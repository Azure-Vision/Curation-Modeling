books,removed,at this point i am going to just torrent the new book grrm is seriously squandering his opportunity to be one of the most influential authors of our generation all the whining and almost certainly intended broadcasting that he is doing anything but writing the book has diminished whatever respect i had for him greatly i have a limited amount of money to spend on entertainment including books and it will go to others who are a bit more deserving i dont like seeing when gifted people take their skills for granted and hold themselves up on their past work i may sound salty but at the end of the day we are all customers of him and his publisher and we are being greatly undervalued

books,removed,there mostly hidden in the darkness was a great inexplicable monstrosity everything had been burned and blackened but still i could see human shapes and forms arms fingers faces jawbones teeth eye sockets all burned and reduced to ash clinging to bone but this was no pile of burned bodies i had seen piles of burned bodies i had seen mountains of burned bodies this was something different human parts were coming out of the walls and the floor and ceiling arms and legs hung like stalactites faces came out of the floor they were fused together in ways that could not be possible at seeing this i was filled with the strongest possible urge to turn away to back out of the awful laboratory and run for my life but i heard again the jews final words you must and knew this to be a command i went inside as the curtain closed behind me i was enveloped in almost total darkness bones cracked beneath by boots near the back i saw a shaft of light where one of the old doors had been sealed up but had become partially open again i walked toward it stepping over unspeakable crunching shapes brushing past nightmarish forms i reached out to the crack of light and pulled back a board which was covering the door though i was not able to rip it free i pulled it loose enough to let in a considerable amount of light enough to reveal what sat at the back of the laboratory as a child i once went to a zoo in vienna where i saw an elephant skull looking at the object now before me i was reminded of this long ago moment and of how i had spent maybe half an hour staring at the skull from every angle how i was titillated by its enormousness its impossible alienness and its unsettling similarity to what was familiar and human before me was a large obloid shape almost as tall as me stippled with hundreds of what looked like eye sockets the lower portion consisted of a complicated structure that resembled several sets of jaws each with hundreds or thousands of teeth of all different kinds including molars incisors canines even animal teeth some of them of normal size some of them as big as my fist the center of the shape was split vertically and inside was a set of curving bone tubes that seemed to fill the interior i stood there in the charred darkness staring at this thing this blasphemous alien thing while my mind filled with images of the awful dream mother and the final gasping words of the jew there is still time to stop her his commandment became strangely clear to me this thing that the scientists were attempting to create whatever it was must not be allowed to exist it was an abomination engel and his team were dead but there were others working on the project it was secretive enough that the essential personnel would be few in number the lab in switzerland a few top scientists perhaps that was entirety of it it would not be easy but far from impossible to find them all it was perhaps in my power to destroy the whole project especially if we lost the war which seemed increasingly likely after stalingrad and if this chemical that they were using was obscure enough it might be possible to eliminate the entire worlds supply thus i could shut the door on whatever unholy creature these madmen were attempting unleash yes i could do this at least i could attempt it i felt now a distinct sense of the entire worlds history resting on what i decided to do next surely moments like this did not come about often surely they must come only to men who are worthy of them surely

books,removed,you really arent grasping how bars have to work in order to be legal if you have a problem telling a customer im sorry but legally the bartender is the only one who can serve you or im sorry but alcoholic drinks must remain in the bar area then thats your social anxiety problem not everyone elses if you cant handle idiot customers then retail sales might not be the best career track for you but no passiveaggressive works for you
books,removed,im sorry but youre a fool if you think she was either hideously racist or an unsubtle apologia for british colonialism in africa what a gross exaggeration and misinterpretation i suppose you also think that the heart of darkness falls into the same category and what is that last comment supposed to mean you said it yourself that over copies have been published obviously some people did not find it to be a fucking slog

books,removed,im seeing a play tonight which is a compliation of short stories ive not read any vonnegut so ive been asking the google about him today your post is very interesting i found a pdf of the story online for anyone interested i just read the intro by kv and im going to say im disappointed that both of the most quotable quotes pop up in the introduction and not in the main text of the story that seems a little shady its more fun to come upon a pearl of a quote in the normal reading of a book just my opinion

books,removed,was describing my neighbours or more accurately the nutters on the neighbourhood facebook groups why am i subscribed to them again dont be so tetchy
books,removed,do you also think people who go to libraries are thieves yes people should be able to make a living wage but i feel like youre saying that you would rather have someone not ever read your work if theyre not going to do it in a way that directly benefits you so what if they get your first book from the library or a used book store and then go on to buy your next two or ten where they wouldnt have bought any without having read it for cheap or free at first what if they cant afford to pay every time they want to read a book should we force them to stop reading because only the welloff who can afford to support writers should be able to do so thats a pretty pretentious viewpoint you have there the public library is an incredible institution but according to you its petty thievery hows the reception up on that high horse
books,removed,as i said the cents per hour is a suggestion and the charge only incurs while you are actually reading the material but if you feel that i am being too harsh how about this stop taking my fucking tax money to pay for libraries and close all the existing motherfuckers already you fucking leeches and stop all social welfare programs while we are at it and make every streets and highways tollways so everyone pay their fair share maybe then the fucking country would not be trillions in debt

books,removed,well if you like catcher of the rye im pretty sure it points to several deep seated psychological issues that are pretty damning indictments of you as a person however have no fear you can move to seattle and discuss philosophy in coffee houses so you can feel good about yourself without ever having to do anything to better the world in all seriousness i think every well written book is both a reflection of the ideas within the book and a combination of where you are in your life you speak of the character with a kind of wistful sympathy and you applied a level of empathy for the character that i simply did not have one of the reasons i hate the book is because holden to me represents so many negative character traits that i cant stand spending time with him but at the time i read the book all i was doing was dealing with dumb entitled people in my life i had no patience to have them in my literary life as well i think people that really hate catcher of the rye and this includes me i hated the book and wouldnt read it again despite it being very well written hate that entitlement holden is an example of a person that has pretty much everything going for him and blows it again and again because of his hubris his self absorption his sheer ignorance of the nature and reality of the world and i think readers resent him for it sometimes to the point of outright rejection of the narrative because they think its ridiculous that any one person could be that coddled while burning every bridge i have known holdens deeply unhappy people who fail despite every advantage so i dont reject the narrative but boy do i resent the little jackass

books,removed,er it is specifically about the russian revolution and it is absolutely not meant to be a condemnation of marxismsocialism in general it is a condemnation of the soviet regime and the myth that it was socialist how do we know because orwell explicitly said so in the only preface to animal farm he ever wrote the one for the ukranian edition you can read a translation httporwellrulibrarynovelsanimalfarmenglishepfcgo if you come away from animal farm thinking that the message is that socialism is bad because the soviet regime was bad that is exactly the idea orwell wrote animal farm to combat in his own words and so for the past ten years i have been convinced that the destruction of the soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement on my return from spain i thought of exposing the soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages

books,removed,the great thing about reading is that it is completely up to interpretation there is no right answer not even if the author says a book is about something else its okay to think fahrenheit contains an important message about censorship despite the fact that the author has said its about choosing to be ignorant andor the rise of technology that created bigger gaps between people and even here thats my interpretation of what was said books belong to their readers

books,removed,they were trying to control the behaviour of the publisher on moral grounds which is a definition of censor nope when they pass a law or act to prevent his book from being published anywhere that will be censorship please dont publish this garbage is far far far far from censorship its ok though words are hard to understand sometimes
books,removed,im not sure what the counter argument to your ludicrous equivocation would be am i supposed to offer proof of a negative that something that isnt occurring actually isnt hurr durr no one should be allowed to not like something and do anything about it freedumbs compelling
books,removed,a typo is a stupider mistake than wholesale misunderstanding of what words mean did the lobotomy hurt much or did you not really notice
books,removed,i agree with that but on the other hand i think it would be simpler to simply point out how bad and inaccurate the book is rather than risking people to fantasise about a great pice of literature being censored because of pc culture case in point mein kampf how many people fantasise on this book being a great piece of literature being censored because he goes against our politically correct society when pretty much everyone who read it agrees that the book is pretty bad im pretty sure milo is very happy to see any controversy surrounding his book thats how he got known to begin with maybe people should start to understand that you dont fight this ideology by preventing people from seing it imo seing the truth about this kind of individual is how you fight it and myself i really dont care and dont want to hear about this guy and you know why i hear a lot about him recently even though i avoid rightwing medias because of all this left wing people creating useless drama around it its retarded really

books,removed,they do have a meaning and you dont get that im sure youll get your bookburning soon enough
books,removed,wat
books,removed,i understand your point but i do disagree i think the desire to pressure companies on what should and should not be allowed as free speech is authoritarian and i disagree with authoritarianism in all forms i can understand a business choosing not to publish his novel as they fear it would hurt their reputation or bottom line in the long run and while i wld deeply respect an organization who decided to publish controversial ideas despite that i wouldnt hold it against an organization that chooses not to i do however have issue with the people who would demand the organization take such actions i believe that free speech is an issue that is important because every idea that is vital to pushing society forward is one that starts off as controversial that isnt to say controversial ideas are always good far from it for example communism is an idea that i find to be both controversial and dangerous and far more dangerous than any ideas milo might say however i would never call for a publishing company to not publish communist literature and i view thinks such as the red scare as being one of the greatest disgraces of american history and as a nation it should fill us with shame as the ideas of communism should have been fought with the pen and words rather than with persecution and consorship i feel the same in regards to many ideas milo has while i do believe many of the things he says to be valid for example he has stated something along the lines of words like faggot should not be controversial if its used in a context not derogatory to gay people because if we change the meaning of the word to not mean gay people than we take away the power of the word there are many ideas of milo i disagree with and i think he very often is infamitory to a needless and counterproductive degree and i think that he is in many ways afraid of his ideas being challenged like when he backed out of the debate with ben shapiro who i find to be much more wellspoken and have better ideas in many regards despite still having some disagreements but at the end of the day when you try to pressure a company to not publish works you do not like on the basis that you do not like the ideas being said there is no way around that being censorship its not legislative censorship but it is censorship and it i dont think anyone with any intellectual honesty can deny that and as such i believe anyone who wants to censor these ideas from being said are acting in an authoritaian manner and i believe those people do not believe in free speech as a principle and i must say the final line of what you are saying is ironically what i would say in return to you if it is acceptable to pressure companies into selfcensorship based on a dislike of the ideas being said than i believe you do not understand the actual consiquences of your actions these tactics of trying to silence voices of opposition are the same used by the religion right of days past when they dominated the public dialogue and i would argue that the way they censored ideas via public pressure helped block the progress of things like gay acceptance and equality and helped keep things like the aids epidemic from being taken seriously for a long time by minimizing the voices of the people fighting to help stop the epidemic and it helped stop the voices of acceptance of homosexuality that many young boys and girls needed to hear and there are probably many young boys and girls who ended their lives that may not have if the voices telling them they dont need to feel ashamed of who they are were not being silenced by the bigots who controlled the conversation and the problem is when it comes to controversial views the only way to decide which are worth believing and which are not is to allow them all to be heard otherwise the good will be burried with the bad
books,removed,such as being against this bullshit pc culture that we live in and is trying to silence him yet again being against sjws and ultra liberalism being against islam when its the most cancerous religion on earth

books,removed,if i have to explain to you why books promoting nazist fascist ideals shouldnt exist then youre probably his target demographic and we arent going to agree given that theres no point in continuing this conversation
books,removed,im just saying that those who protest his book on the grounds that he is espousing nazi ideology are in fact doing that very thing youre free to say that but youre idiotically wrong nazis didnt organize to boycott books they confiscated them legally banned them and violently attacked the authors they didnt like absolutely none of that is remotely similar this is a case of organizing for a boycott of a business for giving him money and a platform to speak on protesting them demanding they retract their offer and refusing to do business with them is all part of free speech

books,removed,self help books are all garbage i cant believe people pay money for that shit
books,removed,lol where did you get that idea that is absolutely false from the goal of my writing an essay by ayn rand published the motive and purpose of my writing is the projection of an ideal man the portrayal of a moral ideal as my ultimate literary goal as an end in itself to which any didactic intellectual or philosophical values contained in a novel are only the means let me stress this my purpose is not the philosophical enlightenment of my readers it is not the beneficial influence which my novels may have on people it is not the fact that my novels may help a readers intellectual development besides that your premise is flawed there are plenty of other contemporary popphilosophyliterary philosophy books written in as accessible or more accessible language than rands and many written far better and with superior literary value off the top of my head i think of the stranger camus le petit prince saintexupery mans search for meaning frankl being and nothingness sartre etc you could also go back further in time and encounter far more popular and lasting works that were also without a doubt read by the mainstream such as walden thoreau utopia more etc youre a candidate for riamverysmart if you somehow think that rand blending her personal philosophy with popular literature is somehow new one could argue that all of literature is predicated upon that in fact
books,removed,how pretentious of you ive read a biography of rand and several of her works including we the living anthem the fountainhead and atlas shrugged i also have a degree in literature although that is immaterial as it doesnt take a degreed professional or someone born after to realize that shes a shit writer from a purely literary perspective she is a shit writer and her philosophy is shit tooabsolutely just as impractical as her mccarthyesque vision of collectivism and frankly diametrically opposed to every notion of humans as social creatures we can agree or disagree as to the validity of an absolute morality versus a relative morality but the fact remains that everyone acting solely in his or her own best interest is inevitably at crosspurposes with the betterment of society and of general social good her works are obsessive hackjob thinkpieces that are the result of an embittered aristocrat who lost everything to bolshevism god read a book

books,removed,urfascism derives from individual or social frustration that is why one of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups in our time when the old proletarians are becoming petty bourgeois and the lumpen are largely excluded from the political scene the fascism of tomorrow will find its audience in this new majority o hi rthedonald
books,removed,so you would describe fascisms goals as reducing the size and scope of government in our lives seems to me the fascists are the protesters of a fair and free election
books,removed,
books,removed,the essay is probably best read through a framework of eco attempting to resolve his existential anxiety he goes from toeing the line on facism justified by mythologies of the arayan race to toeing the line on social facism justified by mythologies about penis size and institutional racism
books,removed,trump isnt a fascist hes a statist and a nationalist hillary bush netanyahu and the neocons are on the other hand true nwo fascist neocons

books,removed,thedonald does not hate jews wtf
books,removed,unprovoked everything is unprovoked if you selectively ignore all provocation racial extermination what racial extermination
books,removed,i was looking at the essay and thought of the rthedonald i took a few parts from it mein kampf is a manifesto of a complete political program famously the donald does not seem to support any specific political program conservatives ranted about how trump did not have any specific ideologies and his supporters did not mind it he went through one sacred cow of the right iraq war gay marriage etc and his supporters particularly the subreddit cheered him on liberal pundits sneered at trump supporters because their side after all had a complete political program nazism had a theory of racism and of the aryan chosen people a precise notion of degenerate art entartete kunst a philosophy of the will to power and of the ubermensch rthedonald came out of fairly and allowed every type of meme meanwhile the left said quite precisely that drawings of mohammed were the product of a degenerate set of people and portrayed exhibits of green cartoon frogs as examples of nazi art to be shunned nazism was decidedly antichristian and neopagan while stalins diamat the official version of soviet marxism was blatantly materialistic and atheistic if by totalitarianism one means a regime that subordinates every act of the individual to the state and to its ideology then both nazism and stalinism were true totalitarian regimes there has been a ton of subreddit drama about splits in thedonald about the main mods resigning they have a clear definition of being a subreddit whose purpose is to cheer for trump within that anything goes people who use this for any other purpose see the nimble america episode for example face the guillotine even it they were favorites like milo meanwhile the left cheers about my having to buy insurance i do not need at a cost i do not want to pay for and gets even diversity champions like mozillas brendon eich fired if they do not accept every tenet of the needs of the left ideology irrespestive of whether the tenet flipped recently we dodged a bullet when america chose to repudiate this totalitarian behaviour by choosing trump

books,removed,im all for intellectualizing but if your position is that its not hard to understand the motivations of the nazis and that them being evil is propaganda than im pretty sure youre more interested in weaving a political narrative than actually engaging in a debate about moral realism that or youre a nazi apologist yourself but im inclined to believe the former
books,removed,saying hes biased because hes german makes you more of a nazi than him

books,removed,and the us is unique in spreading democratic and free speech ideals that other countries have failed to spread anywhere or actively obstructed with their empires dictatorships and kingdoms top kek tell me more about how we spread democracy by support batista pinochet and many other dictators and our invasion of haiti in and our overthrow of the democratically elected government of iran our disastrous interventions in the middle east for the purpose of fighting communism or securing oil and oh the freedom we brought when we occupied south korea and supported numerous dictators there or when we dropped more bombs on north korea than were dropped in all of or when we dropped so many bombs on vietnam that we literally ran out of targets to bomb and they are still dealing with the effects of all the napalm we dropped on them but yes america is absolutely the defenders of freedom we never colonized anyone except for all the colonies we did and do have i mean jesus christ are you seriously going to sit here and act like america hasnt colonized the world and hasnt overthrown government after government in order to bring people under our sphere of influence

books,removed,youre a fucking idiot do we give islamic terrorists and isil a pass because they all use captagon i mean it is basically the same exact drug knowing the nazis were on drugs doesnt make anyone think what they did was okay in the same way we dont think it is okay if someone is drunk when they commit a crime i was drunk has never been and will never be a valid defense if you want to attack his book then attack his sources or the scholarly research that went into it dont just dismiss it because he is german born and his book somehow supposedly makes what the nazis did okay in conclusion youre a fucking idiot

books,removed,we live in a postfact world where the emotional appeal the editorial is established as fact we are as much ourselves to blame as the media outlets which publish it we as a people want something compact and digestible to provide our information anything we want is at our fingertips so attention being at a premium comes as no surprise having said all that id like to move on to the topic at hand i am not a professional historian in fact im not even a good hobbyistamateur one nor have i even read the book in question yet the events proceeding wwii has always fascinated me the topic of hitler consuming large quantities of pain killers is one ive hard before as well as the well documented fact that amphetamines were being given with german field rations but never ever have heard anything regarding widespread use of any stimulants or narcotic substance among the german populace at the time other than the obvious medical opioid use due to stress of wartime i really would view ohlers book with skepticism regardless of his intent

books,removed,your dumb
books,removed,its a great book for high schoolers or people who are still learning that books can be fun doesnt offer much beyond that in my opinion in terms of literary value but its a good adventure youre kidding right could you possibly be more pretentious this is like saying the iliad is just a basic war book nothing really going on
books,removed,oh ha ha theres always some dwight schrute wannabe who jumps to the how to build a boat answer like nobodies ever though of it before
books,removed,youre part of the reason theyre not doing so well maybe for me visiting a bn almost feels like visiting a museum lots of stuff that i like but nothing for me to buy the books i read as ebooks are novels that i dont need to see in person bookstores are pretty good for discovery when im wandering through the bookstore i see lots of things that i want to read that look exactly like what i want maybe they will buy out some bn locations and i will start spending money in a bookstore again
books,removed,pretty much any book that involves travel and exploration i love to visit places ive read about in books and see how they are up close even something as benign as bill brysons notes from a small island makes me want to visit the places he describes i read paul brickhills the great escape as a kid and recall wanting to visit the site of the former camp in poland to try and find the tunnel that they partially dug but shut down and was never found by the germans i saw a documentary not too long ago where a team found the tunnel and wishing i could have been a part of it the doc also showed just how bright the yellow sand was and remembered reading in the book about the problems the prisoners had in trying to disburse it without the germans suspecting a tunnel was being dug
books,removed,who the fuck downvoted me fuck you buddy
books,removed,um how am i intolerant did i scream censor her throw her in jail oh wait is criticism intolerance now gee ill remember that next time i share an opinion in my initial comment all i did was share my misgivings and the reasons behind it then you jumped on that to accuse me of intolerance and bigotry for sharing an opinion how are my actions equivalent to kicking someone in public anyways have i hurt anyone oh noez my written words have irrevocably harmed someone behind the screen im sure rowling is sobbing in her hands right im not even sure whats the point to your analogy but okay you do you boo again nobody is denying rowling her creative freedom i posted those links to refute your point that there is no correlation between representation and tangible damage i have not in any of my comments advocated for something like censorship or antistereotype legislation or anything of that sort reading comprehension is a valuable skill yknow
books,removed,the bn website is closer in price to amazon though still a dollar more here and there for some of the more popular books its the same price a lot of customers would complain about that i can get it for five bucks cheaper on amazon yes and i can order it for the same price from our site and have it delivered to your door for free but if you want it right now thatll be five bucks extra i use amazon a lot myself but it seemed to usually be a fair price difference for instant gratification as others have mentioned a lot of book customers are there to browse and get suggestions so for them it didnt matter as much when i spend minutes giving you suggestions and you get a basket of books then stand there taking pictures and ordering it on amazon because it was literally cheaper for the whole basket thanks for valuing me at less than an hour jackass

books,removed,mein kampf i realised that trump shouldnt be running and neither should hillary because there is only one true leader who will take the reich to victory on all fronts
books,removed,this first sentence is horse shit anyone who is vaguely familiar with presidential history knows theodore roosevelt far exceeds anything obama has done in reading or writing and comparing him to lincoln is as far fetched as it is preposterous the writer either doesnt know american presidential history or is deliberately ignoring it in favor of worshiping his subject because he can both read and write and if i read one more sycophantic journalist call a harvard lawyer a community organizer because he represented rich unions in court im going to vomit all over my aclu card
books,removed,yes it was so full of cliches it kind of seemed like a typical young adult male fantasy story where hes the good guyhero that saveshelps a lot of stereotypical people with contrived twists the protagonist grated on me so much but there are people who think similarly about the book thief we all have different tastes even knowing that it honestly baffles me haha

books,removed,im reading children of thorin now its quite difficult to read at the beginning because of much descriptive information but then you cant stop reading the book only pages left from yesterday and im looking forward to finish it this evening likewise one writer from httpwritemypapertoday told me he read it with one breath within one day thats why decided to write a short feedback on his blog page so as you see its worth to read and im sure you enjoy this book well maybe it cant bet the fellowship of the ring but anyway its close to that
books,removed,hello my name is vester what do you do first when trying to become a published author and how do you get help to extend you charters of you book thanks for the advise
books,removed,the ending to part two was just amazing i did not expect the shardblades to tie in with the stormfather or the spren and the parshendiparshmen evolution is just amazing i cant wait to find out what happens in the third book
books,removed,stormlight archives is one of my top as well but i think its because of the overall plot and not due to his writing style i get so annoyed with brandon because he spends so much time on every minute detail spoilers he moves the plot at glacial pace and spends way too much time making kaladin conflicted about his powers and trusting the light eyes its evident to kaladin early on that dalanar is trustworthy but he contrives reasons for kaladin to be a petulant twat then as soon as things start coming together and the plot ramps up speed he culminates it in an epic ending ive read both books twice and i always feel like it was worth reading as soon as i finish it but i find that days later i question if all the bs was worth the payoff

books,removed,why did they forget to add that into your programming
books,removed,yea as an atheist i didnt like it eitherthe key words are edgy and young it was like reading daniel quinn the author lays out half an argument without really dealing fairly with the objections from the other side and it conforms to your confirmation bias so you love it thats nails on a chalkboard to me makes me think im the asshole because i agree but the guy im agreeing with in this case is a twat obviously though its a sacred text to this crowd its funny i was all set to disagree with you about something on the list being of quality and i couldnt find anything i was willing to defend heh what the hell is the hunger games doing on there might as well add twilight or divergent

books,removed,i definitely vibe with the idea of being into pynchon on paper but i know ill feel cheated in the end unless theres some key to it all i wasnt even being cruel when i described it as shattered post mental breakdown discharge ive read complaints online concerning the references to poop in gr but in truth theres a hilarious amount of talk about the scatological origins of language in the psychoanalytic world effectively closing the loop of psychic experience these highs and lows you feel yourself enjoying in a matter of pages which at least has the potential to illustrate the arguably positive message that we are all a part of this same crazy universe of course as i reflect that would also imply the arguably cold message that were all at the mercy of chaos i read lot but i dont see where its coming from either i just get the idea that its trying to complement contemporary philosophy while at the same time being a trip of a book perhaps one frustration is the mystery of not knowing what if any sort of mission pynchon is on with his books is he like virginia woolf or stephen king i like both authors for different reasons but king isnt on a mission missions can go to hell hes going to write books because hes a bookwriting machine what im suggesting here is that if pynchon is merely a writingmachine that he will leave me feeling cold obviously im going to over think things and thats one thing thats pulling me towards pynchon that he gives you lots to think about perhaps hes juggling a set of ideas and hes displaying all of what hes juggling i dont know im going to move forward with my plan where ill string together a book of pynchon wiki annotations itll be fun

books,removed,oh good i dont know anyone else whos read it so im going to tell you what i loved so much spoilers ahead for anyone who wants to read it he had just been in suydams library and the absurdity and pointlessness of his life is laid out before him hes made to feel totally powerless in front of the beast that could kill a million humans with a breath then he goes home wondering whether his existence his being has any strength any power any purpose and then he goes home to discover that his father has been killed by racist police officers in a horrifying deeply unjust way and after he collects himself his thought is paraphrasing this is important this must be important these two events being side by side are so beautiful because they affirm each other and rail against each other simultaneously the absurdity and pointlessness of both actions but one steals meaning and the other gives it but ultimately both make him feel powerless and lead him to the logical conclusion if im powerless apart from the elder gods then ill go to them to get great power and exact revenge on those who have wronged me anyway that part at least was just masterclass storytelling and ive wanted to geek out about so thank you for reading it if nothing else its definitely a fun book should read httpwwwhplovecraftcomwritingstextsfictionhrhaspx if you get the chance

books,removed,ive got a gigantic pirated oldscifi superanthology a lot of which is out of copyright or ought to be out of copyright because the author is long dead and its taking me back to when i first as a child started getting my mind expanded by reading stories where any philosophical concept could easily be focused down upon because in scifi you can construct whatever world you like to tell whatever story you can manage theres a lot of philosophy and ethics and even morals in scifi if youre stuck in some goddamned prison then even if youre there for a very good reason you could do a lot worse than explore many crazy speculative ideas and the more advanced class some of those old stories are just garbage quantifying why theyre garbage is highly educational too

books,removed,be equally on guard for the slide back to racism and bigotry which is why those of us who oppose social justice and the left oppose them
books,removed,youve dropped a ton of things here below are the ones id like specific citation for muslim registration breitbart is a hatespeak website trumps campaign was run on hatred of muslimslatinos and women then this last one and i guess its a coincidence that the fbi police and local support organizations are reporting upticks in hatecrimes and harassment the difference between you and me is that youre concerned about the freedom of the people to be shitty people and racists and so on and im concerned about the left passing shitty laws and also what exactly would it take for you to recognize the truth in the quote at the top of this page youre demonstrating its exact point
books,removed,er yes socialism is absolutely a left ideology nazism was not it was a very right ideology they called themselves socialists but they were nothing of the sort their policies were nothing like that why do you think they were so opposed to the communists
books,removed,of course you can sec and of the german ciminal code explicitly state that they shall not be applicable if the means of propaganda or the act serves to further civil enlightenmentenlightenment to avert unconstitutional aims to promote art or science research or teaching reporting about current historical events or similar purposes it is a common misconception that swastikas are completly illegal in germany as well as it is a common misconception that you can not legally buy mein kampf
books,removed,yes and did you notice that the us voted against the uns censorship cyber vawg the us is united on free speech
books,removed,they are free to defend themselves or to just accept the racist label this is disgusting
books,removed,the question is whether or not one can say they thought they were free not whether or not such laws actually make people less free if the argument was simple that the laws germany passed were bad this would not be notable or a point particular relevant to today the point that is attempting to be made is the implication that they thought they were free under law x so if you think you are free under law y maybe you arent really and while that may be true under the patriot act or whatever law you dont happen to like that is just as possibly true under obamacare or whatever law you happen to support
books,removed,only sheltered neckbeards use sjw as a slur to fight their imagined boogiemen kind of like how you might be using sheltered neckbears as a slur to fight your imagined boogiemen

books,removed,i can say that in my experience on mainsubs that my views on feminism despite being backed by sources and statistics have never been welcome and ive always seen a large amount of downvotes on several accounts ive stated that there are prime figureheads in the feminist movement whove said blatantly misandrist comments and provided sources and quotes and despite it being a fact i get downvoted it wasnt as if my comments were inflammatory or inciting they were just responses to people saying feminists dont say x this is strawmanning by and large theres a push and pull on reddit but social justice advocates have a strong silent group on reddit across all subreddits

books,removed,propaganda war so whats the subject today people are reading altright news lets just call it all fake news and call them nazis if they show any defense against government regulations made by neoliberal globalists meanwhile the militaryindustrial complex secretly controls a deep state much like the ss did back in nazi germany and no one cares when the dod loses trillion in unaccounted spending just last year
books,removed,thank you for proving my point take my upvote
books,removed,omg america is nazi now because the person i voted for didnt win grow up
books,removed,gotta admit that nazi germany had style
books,removed,i think the lesson of history is that hitler really could be around the corner continued vigilance is all that stands in the way of tyranny just as the passage says some will mock the alarmists because they are being alarmist one can never know the end and therefore never know the beginnings
books,removed,ive always wondered about the everyday germans during the nazi regime did they realize what was going on were they so blinded by propaganda that they believed it were they too afraid to do anything or speak out a mixture of all of these things i know a lot of people have told me in my short life that it could never happen here because this is america damnit but all you need is one terrorist attacking to cause terror create a faceless enemy and we the people will gladly give away our civil liberties its fucking absurd
books,removed,rthenewright is the official sub
books,removed,yes the majority of germans were not nazis the majority of germans did not believe nazipropoganda and were not openly racisteven in the nazi party did not carry a majority in the federal elections and yes communists and socialists did fight in the streets in the german revolution which ended in but this is years later

books,removed,theres a serious issue with institutional racism just because a law has disproportionate effects on different racial groups doesnt qualify it as a part of institutional racism we really need to stop demonizing each other because there are valid points on all sides this is the potential of a trump presidency
books,removed,you both make good points i think is opposing gay marriage a human rights issue or is it a pure political one are human rights issues always political should all political opinions tolerated even when understanding you dont have to agree with them now i have typed it out i think i agree with u opposing gay marriage seems like oppression of homosexuals so is a human rights issue and should be fundamentally opposed it is also political but that just means its an abhorrent political position i mean if we were even talking the difference between trickle down vs social welfare we can argue the points neither side can really say definitely what works well i have my opinion but its not a hard and fast human rights issue like gay marriage
books,removed,thats why people are calling you guys bigots if you want them to stop open your ears and try some empathy or you know we could refuse to let you define bigotry as anyone who disagrees with me kick your collective collectivist asses at the polls and win with a mandate and proceed to dismantle the political machine with which you sought to force your views on decent good people
books,removed,not in a lot of circles in the us the republican party became the party of old men racist white people warhawks etc since the bush era in blue states it is fashionable to hate white people if you try to assert that the dems have been part of the same warmongering political class youre sidelined as a conspiracy theorist or grouped in with the racist white people and the irrelevant old people
books,removed,you make it sound like this is exclusive to white people it turns out a lot of peoples brains are fucked up and dont work right mine included just not in the discrimination kind of way that guy is trying real hard to ignore his own problems and it looks like he got pretty good at it
books,removed,ive met a lot of people who think even saying the sentence white men do have inherent privilege or something similar is an assault on them personally and an invalidation of the hardships of their life i think thats why there is so much pushback and blowing things out of proportion people genuinely refuse to believe things like that and hate to be told it
books,removed,rpolitics it seems i was a crazy selfhating trans and antivaxxer for supporting jill instead of hillary i still dont get what antivaxxer has to do with anything but i was called thateven if i support vaccination
books,removed,ill never agree with censoring peoples opinions shutting down discourse or deligitmizing people for their beliefs sorry but most of those civil liberties that you care about have been born from freedom of speech both the constitutional protection and the broader concept so that is the fundamental liberty that i consider nonnegotiable in any democracy when people try to limit discourse for whatever reason i will not support that
books,removed,propaganda
books,removed,really you need to find the centerleft and centerright peeps embrace the shillness
books,removed,man you should really read up on your historycheck out jonah goldbergs book called liberal facism who knows you might learn something
books,removed,cmon grouping half the us into the ignorant crowd is in and of itself ignorant and only drives those people youre calling ignorant further away most americans that have reached high school education have a good idea of nazism and definitely do not want to repeat it
books,removed,well it does depic our current state of affairs but guys were fucking america fuck anyone who an asshole by asshole i mean those who take lives of the innocent
books,removed,reeeeee the guy i dont like won democracy is dead its hitler all over again look at this chilling quote reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
books,removed,more various work programs designed to establish fullemployment for the german population were instituted once the nazis seized full national power hitler encouraged nationally supported projects like the construction of the autobahn the introduction of an affordable peoples car volkswagen and later the nazis bolstered the economy through the business and employment generated by military rearmament not only did the nazis benefit early in the regimes existence from the first postdepression economic upswing their public works projects jobprocurement program and subsidised home repair program reduced unemployment by as much as percent in one year a development which tempered the unfavourable psychological climate caused by the earlier economic crisis and encouraged germans to march in step with the regime to protect the german people and currency from volatile market forces the nazis also promised social policies like a national labour service stateprovided health care guaranteed pensions and an agrarian settlement program agrarian policies were particularly important to the nazis since they corresponded not just to the economy but to their geopolitical conception of lebensraum as well for hitler the acquisition of land and soil was requisite in moulding the german economy to tie farmers to their land selling agricultural land was prohibited farm ownership was nominally private but business monopoly rights were granted to marketing boards to control production and prices with a quota system
books,removed,here is in on video saying it
books,removed,yes they are more and more often they no longer rely on logical arguments instead they just operate off of the assumption that their opposition is always wrong and stupid theyve been getting more emotional and have been pushing a new narrative of victimhood they are becoming the very sjws that they once claimed to hate same phenomenon different buzzwords
books,removed,pastor niem√∂ller spoke for the thousands and thousands of men like me when he spoke too modestly of himself and said that when the nazis attacked the communists he was a little uneasy but after all he was not a communist and so he did nothing and then they attacked the socialists and he was a little uneasier but still he was not a socialist and he did nothing and then the schools the press the jews and so on and he was always uneasier but still he did nothing and then they attacked the church and he was a churchman and he did something‚Äîbut then it was too late this just gave me a chill
books,removed,yes theyre totally the same thing you utter moron
books,removed,the right were the ones who pioneered these tactics in the with the satanic panic and the war on drugs now sjws are using the same authoritarian rhetoric to stifle the possibility of their having to accommodate people with different value systems from their own low verbal intelligence people tend to be authoritarians wherever you go whether they end up being sjws or religious zealots just depends on whether youre in a blue or red state
books,removed,people do go to jail for speech now a days go write a book denying the holocaust and see what happens do i agree with the book thats not my point but no one should go to jail for anything other then a direct threat onto someones life
books,removed,we live in an age of extreme polarisation in the coverage of current affairs everyone is a polemicist the other side are always irrational fanatics the most blistering condemnations of them are the ones that go viral the most hysterical critics of them are the ones who get book deals it is a toxic atmosphere it sows deep mistrust and fills people with the belief that anything is better than letting the other side win no matter who you have to vote for and what they might have done and to win to truly defeat the other side the soft moderates must be vanquished first then and only then can the true rightleft save the country i dont know what to do about this censorship is no answer nor is the market it seems all you can do as a citizen is refuse to support through your readership material that encourages you to demonise half of your fellow citizens anything written to trigger your rage is purposefully avoiding an engagement with your reason and perspective if you can free yourself from this trap there might be some chance that you can someday free others
books,removed,ive watched friends be so indoctrinated that conversation is no longer possible because if you disagree then you are a racist pig to be fair there are people being radicalized on the other side too no meaningful discussion some people i literally cant talk politics with there is no nuance they are so hateful of sjws and safe spaces they have ironically made their own right wing safespace echo chamber
books,removed,nsa surveillance is done to keep women safe apparently so you are a sexist if you oppose it iraq is a war fought to support muslims but also somehow against sexist terrorists so it is a moral imperative to fight it wat who are these democrats youre talking to oh right theyre made of straw
books,removed,youre gonna have to help me where in this does donald trump say all muslims have to be registered
books,removed,if youre going to call all who are not feminists misogynists and bigots you should at least address the view of feminism they have and what they actually think it is i agree with feminism in the sense that feminism is a goal to achieve eauality but i also think that men need independent groups to advocate for their rights in certain areas as well because feminism does not dedicate the same time and resources to mens issues for example funding was denied to a group that would support male victims of rape it was actively lobbied against by self described feminist groups because they saw it as a threat to funding for their own groups feminism focuses on equality for the sexes by advancing womens rights there are certain things men lack that need to be fought for and are not fought for by feminist groups such as support for rape victims in that particular instance radicals exist within feminism like any other group and those are the people who turn men off to the group they want nothing to do with a group that is host to even a minority of people who consider all men to be rapists or that asking someone out is sexual assault if you are a man
books,removed,we agree with each other not all socialisms are made the same nazism had more akin to fascism then it did to socialism nazism is a right wing ideology with smattering of other leftist ideas as you previously mentioned so to go around and deem that hitler and his party were actually leftwing politicians would be a little strange
books,removed,ughreally not looking forward to years of misguided nazi references didnt we just do years of completely wrong socialism ones
books,removed,where are you getting the idea that non feminists are ostracized i live in texas if anything feminists are the ones who would be ostracized also nice one with the im totally going to get downvoted for shotting on sjws
books,removed,guys im in a infinite loop awwwwhhhhhhh
books,removed,at least muslim registration is nothing like jewish registration
books,removed,the idea of saying youre not a feminist now is socially reprehensible heres the thing though for what reasons which are legitimate should any given woman not be absolutely entitled to absolute equality as any given man on equal tests i feel like every time someone says im not a feminist theres an asterisk on it because they have some bias that women shouldnt be on utterly equal terms as men is there a scenario where someone isnt a feminist but agrees women should be treated equal to men
books,removed,i look at his actions and his words we are socialists we are enemies of todays capitalistic economic system for the exploitation of the economically weak with its unfair salaries with its unseemly evaluation of a human being according to wealth and property instead of responsibility and performance and we are all determined to destroy this system under all conditions adolf hitler quoted in john toland adolf hitler
books,removed,yup whenever one partys leader is elected the other goes into this crazy paranoid state of accusing the other of fascism and doing anything to get their voice heard against the administration just a huge overreaction from the party that lost is going down keep in mind nazis established themselves as a socialist party and once hitler gained power it was only a hop skip and a jump maybe less into fascism
books,removed,the sjws are that strong there
books,removed,perhaps not the same level but the sexism is still rampant for both sides it has been shown that men get higher criminal sentences for the exact same crime it has been shown that women often win custody even if the situation should typically not allow for it a man was imprisoned because of a womans dreams that he was going to rape her this isnt all that uncommon sure men may work the background and will continue to rule but just from day to day life being a man can suck sometimes
books,removed,lmao you people are fucking funny zomg trump is
books,removed,as someone who is on the left reading both ops comment and your response is like the fucking twilight zone do you not realize what party passed the patriot act and champions nsa mass surveillance or who was president when we got into the iraq war or who overturns consumer protections in favor of massive corporations jesus its not like democrats are innocent and dont bear responsibility but i literally feel like im taking crazy pills reading your response
books,removed,there is no german version at least on the current amazonde this book is from the and not superfamous so perhaps just never translated
books,removed,right hitler left stalin mao pol pot castro dozens of south american dictators the body counts are not even comparable
books,removed,have you considered the possibility that you are wrong generally
books,removed,like people have said above very much depends on where you live i dont like the term because of the connotations people make to it but where i live those that wish to be called that are generally not nutters just more active in their pursuit of fairly moderate feminism other acronyms have been made up for some of the groups of nutters like swerf or terf i dont think many people live in a place where all sjws are nutters just perhaps we like to think that its commonplace people always like to put people in boxes if those crazies are sjws all sjws must be crazy
books,removed,the problem with the patriot act is the chilling effect even if we think we are free there are too many afraid to speak out because they dont want to end up on a list
books,removed,ive been harassed by sjws nonstop for the past three years perks of being a ucla student i guess
books,removed,no where the right is xenophic jingoistic and ignorance worshipping tribalists the left is fascist guilt wielding and socially insane any negativity towards the narrative is a death sentence irl as anything that is not an opinion approved by the party is tantamount to racistsexismoppression youre lucky to be missing this twosided jackassery
books,removed,i see a lot of highly upvoted if you didnt vote hillary fuck yourself
books,removed,would you rather he link to a fuckton of far right blogs like your ilk loves to do
books,removed,thanks for the cookie and sorry for the hostility it just annoys me that people are so focused on the sjw boogeyman actually existing in the face of the other extreme gaining just as much ground and being way way more fucked up
books,removed,they absolutely did value democracy and liberty over human life that was the whole point of the lesson of wwii i just told you this lasted until the so citing westernbacked dictatorships only further proves my point that this was their realpolitik conclusions after the attitude of postwwii democracy died down once the nazis imperial japanese were defeated
books,removed,you say in a post about how the presidentelect is literally fucking hitler get some self awareness
books,removed,the militant brand of sjw and feminism i have only encountered on the internet and even then its usually people using it to discredit feminism um discredit feminism the sjws are the ones promoting feminism and blm your lucky to not see it irl ive had a couple friends who arent friends anymore because they drank the koolaid its bad in some places but the majority of us just want to live and let live
books,removed,i never cry wolf im scared my cousins grandmother who lived through the rise and fall of hitler as a little girl in germany is scared shitless this times different different people are crying wolf than those that normally cry wolf
books,removed,i went into reading this thinking i bet trumps presidency will be analogous of this then a little way in i realised it sounded much more like hillarys then a little more like trumps and then i reached the part about little steps and then all i could think about was the little tiny steps of political correctness that get larger and larger over the years until you get people out in the street screaming bloody murder on the racist president elect while chasing down white people in the street and beating them
books,removed,so muslim registry racism
books,removed,im not trying to pick a fight but people really need to chill on the breitbart hatefest i doubt that most of the people raging over it have actually visited the site or read some of the articles with any intellectual earnestness why is it that all these leftist rags have this innate legitimacy but breitbart is some out of left field white supremacist propaganda source its just patently false i guarantee the people who visit breitbart have a more rounded exposure to opposing viewpoints than those that stick to the msm
books,removed,these people are not some major force threatening your rights this is what social justice does
books,removed,then again when their leader hillary clinton publicly states things like that women are the primary victims of war i guess it makes some slight amount of sense oh this shit again last time i saw it was on rthedonald for some context and im not saying i agree or disagree but its not as cut and dried as you make it seem while some might argue that clinton was inaccurate in labeling women as the primary victims of war since the majority of military members are male a resolution adopted by the united nation security council in arrived at a similar conclusion stating that civilians particularly women and children account for the vast majority of those adversely affected by armed conflict the united nation security council repeated this assertion in when it adopted resolution which stated in its introduction that rape and sexual assault were considered tactics of war ivilians account for the vast majority of those adversely affected by armed conflict women and girls are particularly targeted by the use of sexual violence including as a tactic of war to humiliate dominate instill fear in disperse andor forcibly relocate civilian members of a community or ethnic group and sexual violence perpetrated in this manner may in some instances persist after the cessation of hostilities httpwwwsnopescomhillaryclintonvictimsofwar
books,removed,im surprised this got so upvoted on twitter sjws think they have some superior morality but so did adolf hitler it rolls both ways
books,removed,many people will also use the first amendment as argument against being censored by websites or the media they act like they have a constitutional right to have their opinions shared or published which is frankly not true corporations and people have a right to not sponsor people they dont agree with or to not publish their works the first amendment only removes the governments ability to block two people from communicating it does not guarantee that the communication itself occurs its a subtle but important distinction
books,removed,you cant deny that the us govt isnt beginning to act in a similar manner as the german govt did increased surveillance a lot of the word terrorist in the media a populist leader shouting hateful rhetoric towards a particular group of people and look at how much foreign land our military is currently occupying this shit is scary like it or not the fact that you can post your waffles on facebook doesnt change that one bit
books,removed,were much further away from racismbigotry having any sort of meaningful power assuming were taking bigotry to mean the intolerance of different opinions then oh and if were taking racism to mean prejudice discrimination or antagonism directed against someone of a different race then again too
books,removed,lol why would anyone bother fagmo youll just handwave it away by going oh well they werent truly leftwing for once i actually do hope they herd you into camps jfc so dishonest
books,removed,this if let us say the gassing of the jews in had come immediately after the german firm stickers on the windows of nonjewish shops in but of course this isnt the way it happens in between come all the hundreds of little steps some of them imperceptible each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next step c is not so much worse than step b and if you did not make a stand at step b why should you at step c and so on to step d
books,removed,apparently most of reddit covered their eyes when obama was president because he helped accelerate the descent into tyranny and now you see all these posts on rall aww im gonna miss obama ndaa renewing the patriot act assassinations more undeclared wars corporate welfare
books,removed,tell me which minority does she scapegoat mexicans muslims
books,removed,when i was touring the house i eventually bought there were still many personal items around of the previous owner including books on the shelves i noticed a ton of them had swastikas on them and i thought uh then i saw a mezuzah on a door frame and thought phew just jews
books,removed,its not the left saying this its a few crazies that maybe you have gained a skewed view of the world is not black and white left vs right reinforcing that kind of polarisation is what leads to more and more people adopting extreme views if you think those people are nuts dont call them the left call them nuts the same can be said on another side of the spectrum it would be foolish to say that all people on the right are neonazis and accedit every gop voter to their existence
books,removed,some of adolf hitlers closest advisors were socialists
books,removed,compare the following on william douglas over the course of his career he grew to become a leading advocate of individual rights on the bench douglas became known as a strong advocate of first amendment rights ultimately douglas believed that a judges role was not neutral the constitution is not neutral it was designed to take the government off the backs of the people on richard posner if the nsa wants to vacuum all the trillions of bits of information that are crawling through the electronic worldwide networks i think thats fine much of what passes for the name of privacy is really just trying to conceal the disreputable parts of your conduct privacy is mainly about trying to improve your social and business opportunities by concealing the sorts of bad activities that would cause other people not to want to deal with you posner in response to aclu argument that illinois wiretapping law prohibiting taping police is unconstiutional posner theres going to be a lot more of this snooping around by reporters and bloggers aclu is that a bad thing your honor posner yes it is a bad thing there is such a thing as privacy
books,removed,well no one is rthedonald is altright then they co opted the term some bullshit they have to ruin a good term i just talked to their fucking loser mods in raltright shit likely a false flag by ctr rthenewright were its at
books,removed,i sometimes think you are right but its like using the word ignorant in proper context there shouldnt be anything wrong with it but there is because people are ignorant if you werent saying privilege youd have to say something else that means the same thing which would also become demonized because youre still saying to someone that their life experience doesnt actually matter empirically that is what causes the anger
books,removed,subtle üôÑ
books,removed,there probably would never have been a world war ii if american never stepped into wwi where it played semineutral until halfway through the european allies and germany probably would have been forced to settle things fair and square instead of muchhated treaty of versailles now that is depressing to think about i can only think we did the same shit in the middle east a decade back with the blowback biting us recently
books,removed,omg so that must mean that trump is literally hitler
books,removed,the uk us canada australia new zealand and many other nations are involved in the single larges mass surveillance aparatus ever constructed and they have abused it and youre concerned about sjws well yeah if the sjws actually get into power you think theyre going to dismantle those operations we can fight both
books,removed,kind of like the assault weapons ban that clinton signed in no matter what good president obama did in his eight years in office i will never respect him for failing to let the usa patriot act die
books,removed,lol looks like reddit has upvoted another swastika to the front page
books,removed,it doesnt disprove it clearly any nation has a priority list and some are at the bottom of that priority list the british also promised liberty to india if india committed troops to fight the nazis so the reason the british left india is because of indian troops fighting the nazis on behalf of the british
books,removed,this is eerily similar o what liberal democracy has done to the world we let it go little by little without taking a stand welll until weeks ago is it too late though
books,removed,there was a post on rpg about a social justice fog and only decent was down voted and rpgnet is a hive of sjws you will get banned for wrong think
books,removed,you got to be fucking kidding me
books,removed,check your privilege literally means it used to mean now it means shut up whilst less privileged people speak or just shut up
books,removed,so why are you assuming he is a lefty because he hates nazis do not right wingers hate nazis also
books,removed,nsa surveillance is an affront to the rights of americans regardless of political leaning the iraq war was for oil and had nothing to do with muslims it was a shitshow that tied in a terrorist attack to a country that had nothing to do with it because brown is brown and people are sheep the dnc is a corrupt party just like the rnc even more so at least in the rnc the people got what they want regardless of how idiotic i may think it is corporate donations are one of the worst things in politics period and this is coming from someone that considers themselves a socialist and thinks that capitalism is a dying economy
books,removed,he renewed the patriot act his appointment for ag sold guns to central american drug cartels he allowed our military to execute american citizens without due process on foreign soil
books,removed,it was heavily used in slavic cultures as well either way it was perverted under the nazi regime
books,removed,i am totally buying this book while i was looking it up on amazon i found there was a review of it by his daughter where she adds some amazing personal details by julie vognar march it is wonderful to see so many thoughtful and incisive reviews of my fathers book a few details that might interest you none of the unimportant nazis he interviewed knew he was a jew which he was the book wasnt published in german for years after its original publication we spent in the small town which milton mayer calls kronenberg where he wrote the book which was published shortly afterwards his german was awful and he said this was a great aid in the interviews he conducted having to repeat in simpler words or more slowly what they had to say made the germans he was interviewing feel relaxed equal to superior to the interviewer and this made them speak more freely sehen sie herr professor mayer so war die sache very patiently you see this is how it was he made one small but dreadful mistake there is a very common name in german to which milton mayer added a suffixbecause with the suffix it was the name of a great family friend in fact my boyfriend four years later and used it fictitiously for one of the interviewees however with the suffix its a very rare german name and having given the general location and size of the town together with the rare german name he really identified the interviewee asour family friend who was quite upset he never told my father this though my father was always a superlative interviewer he said as little as possible aside from encouraging the interviewee to go on talking if someone seemed to be avoiding a subject he was really interested in he would repeat the name of the subject the interviewee had abandoned and look terribly keen and respectful when my father was about a wind blew in one of his ears while he was camping out paralyzing one nerve in his face for the rest of his life he could only open while speaking one side of his mouth and he had a very diabolical grin and could never raise both eyebrowsalways he was raising one eyebrow this gave him a very wise look somewhat ironic at the same time and made him appear even smarter than he was my sister and i occasionally exchange misms things he used to say from time to time some inherited from his father and others from god knows where here are a couple try them they are very effective in many convrersations i left it in my other suit been to the city and seen the gaslights i dont think i have anything to add substantively to what has already been said in the excellent reviews aside from these few personal details milton mayer died in and is survived by several real and step children real and step grandchildren and two great grandchildren at least all of whom like him are pacifists
books,removed,people painting swastikas on walls im not saying that nazis are left wing although i do think its a little more nuanced but the more famous cases of this happening have turned out to be fake its the medias fault for not making that clear since they run with the sensational story first and never bother to follow up when it turns out it was someone that hates nazis making a statement
books,removed,arent pejorative terms like mansplaining and manspreading counterproductive if your goal is inclusion and dialogue silly downhilldude thinking the goal was inclusion and dialogue see that was the goal but then it was discovered that it was far quicker and easier to just bludgeon people into acceptance than it was to convince them
books,removed,being accused of mansplaining while annoying and probably undeserved in many cases is far less of a problem then being put to death for being a jew feminists are never going to build death camps a person can easily convince himself of almost anything so feel free to tell me about how the wool is over my eyes and feminists are horribly sinister yet i can tell you feminists are never going to build death camps i read a lot of hysteria about sjw bullshit these days the comparison i somehow never come across is good manners like the rules of social etiquette the beliefs of sjw bullshit are nonsensical half the time however in both cases the world is a miserable place if you reject all of them entirely thats what it seems to me the alt right crowd are keen on doing
books,removed,lol imagine if the right were allowed to play this disingenuous game b loo bloo bloo hitler wasnt a true fascist you cant criticize pinochet he wasnt truly right wing blo obloo admit it you know that whole charade is a fucking tapdance around your gay dead ideology
books,removed,saying youre not a feminist means saying you dont want men and women to have equal rights no it doesnt saying youre not a feminist only means that you choose not to label yourself in that way it doesnt actually speak to what your beliefs are terms like mansplaining and check your privilege subtly reenforce the idea that certain classes races or genders should have their thoughts and feelings instantly discounted this was the main point behavior like this no matter your position or language used discourages open conversation and dismisses all the detail and nuance that make these issues so complicated
books,removed,as a long time history graduate its seems strange that you dont realize that the entire history of the human race is a story of us vs them in every country on ever continent at every time everywhere there is always a presumption of us vs them is a truly dangerous characteristic for any society to have its not though every country ever has had that only a tiny few go off the deep end over it you are painting a bullseye around the nazi arrow and acting like you are making some grand discovery keep reading your degree is only the beginning of your history education
books,removed,you dont watch or read anything so i will catch you up nationalism has been a growing concern throughout europe for many years hitting we thought a breaking point with brexit and then america elected a reality tv star who caters to the basest most hateful impulses of poor whites fostering a rise in white nationalism and a validation of prejudice then the presidentelect appointed cabinet members in the same vein and the rest of the world is watching us with its mouth agape and wondering if germany ironically the last liberal stalwart in the west can hold back what is becoming a global tide
books,removed,about his voting record i meant
books,removed,let me be an asshole or i will accuse you of oppressing me
books,removed,yeah im not a liberal and i dont read liberal blogs so please spare me the classification youre right though ‚Äì i cant supply a citation here this is simply my opinion and i can only offer my reasoning as to how ive arrived at this point propensity for harassment and open intimidation oppression of political opponents calls to lock her up yes shes corrupt but setting up his own inquiry how much more impartial can you get appealing to emotion over fact attacks on the media call them liberal fine point out their bias great openly intimidate them not fine blatantly inciting violence at rallies some if not most of his policies are based on an overreach of presidential powers he wont be able to achieve a lot of this but the fact he believes he can or should be able to is disturbing

books,removed,i think its just as insulting to imply that we are now hitler has been trivialized to the point where after every election of the country claims that the other have created the fourth reich
books,removed,the biggest shame in the past few years is the equation of feminism with the tumblr helicopter propaganda that is completely disregarded by of the population feminism is not about giving women more power and representation than men it never has been regardless of what a few maniacs on tumblr say most feminists or leftleaning people dont believe that all white men should be killed that perception is the result of the other side focusing on one incredibly tiny fringe belief and believing that its representative of the majority it isnt whether you feel like it is or not
books,removed,clearly youre not doing it in the open ive watched people get doxxed death threats letters sent to their employers to try to get them fired and far more why because the dared to say something that went against sjws beliefs
books,removed,when the nazis attacked the communists he was a little uneasy but after all he was not a communist and so he did nothing and then they attacked the socialists and he was a little uneasier but still he was not a socialist and he did nothing and then the schools the press the jews and so on and he was always uneasier but still he did nothing and then they attacked the church and he was a churchman and he did something‚Äîbut then it was too late my daughter had a friend in high school explain to her how it was impossible to be racist against white people that type of thought that makes it ok to dehumanize an entire class of people is exactly what happened in germany at that time
books,removed,not compared to tumblr and twitter
books,removed,sure but it could easily be taken seriously as well the message that people literally take from the passage is that hitler is always around the corner guyz and there are undoubtedly a lot of people who would unironically agree with your comment
books,removed,lol illegal immigrants being forcibly deported imagine someone change my diaper
books,removed,holy shit the next us president wants to put all muslims on a list and youre concerned about fucking sjws
books,removed,this is about you twat people like you wow you are dense
books,removed,dont forget obama phone dont forget all the rebel groups he funded dont forget isis who spawned because he pulled troops out with no plan for restructuring dont forget the hundreds of vacations he took
books,removed,reddit loves them a nazi post everytime to the front page
books,removed,i know right instead we elected the guy who promised a national registry of muslims sure did avoid holocaustic conditions there
books,removed,this gets propagated on reddit a lot but the swastika existed in europe prior to the nazis the used it the used it the used it the used it in fact a lot of cultures used it prior to the nazis not just the hindus you even see it pop up in places like
books,removed,dont predict shit makes you look like an ass
books,removed,however id sum that up as the vocal minority of the left political ideology because im left leaning and i feel that i can say that i dont bite off someones head for discussing their opinion on i feel the same goes for the rights vocal minority which is probably the vocal minority of the left is so strong because they hate the vocal crazy right that want you to keep your babies gas the gays and stop taking marijuanas lets not forget about flat taxes and the trickle down theory but economics gets heavily controversial across all spectrums so i digress
books,removed,sure it does people say that we should have the right to freedom of speech regardless of whether others agree or not some people feel that they should be able to call others racial slurs without any repercussions and when punishment is delivered like firing someone who calls michelle obama an ape people consider that in the same vien of denial of freedom of speech
books,removed,bububut literally hitler
books,removed,how about media and entertainment i know theres a number of games that have been banned in germany for nazi reference but perhaps they were for being historically innacurate or completely fictitious
books,removed,what in the world are you talking about the antisjw crowds principles center around freedom of speech and expression
books,removed,cointelpro
books,removed,almost makes you want clone hitler from his living brain in a jar so we can have him for office it for no other reason than to be justified in calling our political opponents hitler
books,removed,my favorite is reverse racism which by its nature implies a normal direction for racism and implies that any other racism ought to be considered abnormal im sure i neednt explain how this is obviously racist in and of itself
books,removed,harry potter for a while i dont want to kill him its against my principles fuck you just fucking do something anything i beg you
books,removed,yep i just saw a girl with a mao face on her messenger bag like as if i dont have relatives who were slaughtered during the cultural revolution i wish communism were as taboo as nazism it has killed way more people
books,removed,and here i thought it was because of this social justice bs that we got a pres like trump
books,removed,uk
books,removed,but i thought only white people could be racist
books,removed,well those not in the majority would likely agree it is trending that way and that is what the excerpt in the book is talking about were getting to a point where if you dont agree with the majority you are ostracized and shamed people from both sides dont listen to each other anymore and sadly the national discussions are on trivial matters as opposed to serious matters
books,removed,you elected a man who wants to expand the patriot act
books,removed,the echo chambers that the us is in now the internet allows access to any information but people only chose to trust specific sources so the media on either side attack the sources of the other further polarizing everyone and entrenching each sides belief that the other is wrong were at a very dangerous crossroads now in the us of course youre an alarmist if youre very concerned about what both sides are considering i hate both the extremes rthedonald is looking more every day like the nazi party in just go read through that cancerous subreddit and youll see more examples of the above but ive also heard the same rhetoric from the left extremists too the whole situation is fucked if anything to take away from ops article its to speak up and act before anything happens if we get to that point and to not be a bystander
books,removed,actually im nice try fuck head
books,removed,i think they are talking about paid shills and astroturfing the media having their own agenda and narrative and talking past the people and their concerns social movements being manipulated by people with hidden agendas and now the talk of censorship etc
books,removed,except we have most of the top universities and have a gdp dwarfing all these european safe havens you probably admire fuck off with your useless input
books,removed,what a bunch of ridiculous bothsiderist garbage mansplaining and check your privilege are in no way even remotely equivalent to the type of systemic prejudice that women people of color and lgbt people face
books,removed,you sound like a more traditionally minded libertarian like myself personal freedoms including but not limited to gun ownership and the ability to marry any other consenting adult be they a lady or dude the old libertarian adage i want a world where a gay married couple is allowed to defend their marijuana farm with their machine guns the right wants the freedom to defend a farm with machine guns but not the freedoms to get married to the same gender or to growuse marijuana the left wants the freedom to get married to the same gender and growuse marijuana but those guns are absolutely evil and must be banned the first libertarian candidate for president was openly gay everyone associates it with the tea party mentality but that isnt what its about at all its about people having as much freedom as is reasonably possible all about the personal privacy antinsa spying on everyone government monitoring keeping the government out of the bedroom let me nail another dude if i so choose it aint your business and retain the right to keep and bear arms and defend myself and my castle
books,removed,
books,removed,and you dont see similarities to antisemitism in the rights opinions of islam
books,removed,further for the most part being sjwy typically just means trying to be inclusive and egalitarian only when idiots are abusing the term it specifically refers to a type of liberal which is unfortunately extremely common right now that subscribes blindly to their beliefs with absolutely no ability to consider them objectively for example in your quest to form a society where everyone is equal you might pause and realize that you took it a step too far and now its considered racist to suggest that illegal immigrants be deported because life is hard where they come from to put it less bluntly many liberals have their heart in the right place but rush too quickly into helping others at a significant cost to themselves were talking to the point where they might not even be able to help anyone at some point these same people also fail to consider that those they are directing their egalitarian views towards may not feel the same in return or only does so long as they directly benefit tldr criticism of the left based upon the complete lack of pragmatism in the modern movement is entirely valid and not racisthateful
books,removed,for real if hitler had only had clinton and sjws he would not have had to burn the reichtag to get people afraid and ready to support any nutty thing he came up with
books,removed,zoom out for a moment and realize that both parties can take the blame for a more remote government and inadequate responses to the grand canyon wide wealth gap not to mention the expansion of surveillance powers which might be the most illustrative parallels with the authoritarian state of nazi germany its either democrats voting on republican bills or vice versa and considering that we will soon be under a republican dominated government prospects dont look good for anyone the biggest problem with a two party state is that its almost a one party state
books,removed,how do you look at the right winning everywhere in the last few years and find yourself worrying that the next holocaust is gonna come from sjws get real
books,removed,haha but actually this points to what i perceive as the big problem in the sjwfree speech debates that rage on reddit sjws arent saying youre not allowed to say what you want theyre saying if you talk about shit you dont know about you should be aware of your lack of knowledge and preferably humble about it theyre warning people about the racegender variant of the dunningkruger effect where white dudes on the internet become convinced they know how to fix ghetto culture or why feminists dont really understand the problems theyre talking about the sjw moment isnt dont hurt our feelings its dont expect to not be called out when youre way out of your depth
books,removed,that doesnt mean it was clear how it would all turn out concentration camps took a few years to appear as did the murder of the disabled and the outright antisemitism one might still have hoped for the best in retrospect that was the point at which hitler was granted the power to do what he ended up doing but his plans wouldnt have been obvious at the time
books,removed,if they establish a muslim registry the best thing we can do is encourage every single person we know to register when the nazis came to holland and told all jews to wear yellow stars the king of holland wore one as well as did many most of the nonjews there it was tremendously effective and saved many lives
books,removed,this is another one of those le adolf mussolini von drumpf threads disguised in a way that it is relevant to this particular subreddit isnt it
books,removed,yeah it didnt come all at once the nazis spent over a decade with a paramilitary army intimidating beating up or killing people people have literally no idea what they are talking about when comparing trump to hitler
books,removed,far right eradicate non whites drives a subaru eats shwarma wears clothes made in africa far left kill all white cis men go feminism critical whiteness lives on daddys bank account goes to a top liberal arts college owns the most expensive technological gadgets is white has only white friends and the one non white person in their circle of aquaintances gets handed around so everybody can slum a bit without actually touching non white people
books,removed,nobody around me gets this and when i talk to women about how i shouldnt be immediately discounted because of my skin colour they laugh and say pfft youre a white male shut up totally counter to the entire point of egalitarianism
books,removed,trump is literally hitler xdddddddddd
books,removed,you seriously think the greatest threat to the world at the moment is sjws campus feminists can be annoying yeah but they hold no power in our society and given the current political climate never will for the forseeable future
books,removed,yeah well they kinda were the western world had spent the better part of a decade oppressing germans and buggering their young women for pennies we took away their pride and dignity a big part of that was turning the female youth of germany into a nation of whores were doing the same to eastern europeans now it is not right the treatment of eastern european women in germany makes me sick women from poor countries they should be flat out banned from working in sex work outside their own countries
books,removed,i have lived here for years and i have had mostly lowertomiddle class acquaintances i can say without any hesitation that it is not fashionable for minority latino black asian youth to embrace any cultural artifact that is perceived as belonging to white culture and that white culture is largely seen as backwardslamehokeyetc and white people are only selectively spared from the same characterization im saying this from the inside of these communities my experience validates what im saying and im being honest you can choose not to trust what im saying if you wish
books,removed,thats actually how its supposed to be bigots science deniers and other types of deplorables are bad for the world but it would be even worse to deny them their rights using social pressure to curb their bad behavior is the most morally correct
books,removed,i could be wrong and i agree that racism has been ingrained in american history and literally every country on this planets history but your comment seems to exclusively discuss european white racism when in reality racism has been seen from every group in america not that you were saying otherwise but i assumed you were implying it was purely native whites
books,removed,after years of chaos and depression finally there was again a sense of direction and purpose indeed a lot of the popularity enjoyed by the nazis at least initially was down to the fact that they did not pay back wwi war reparations to the french by a big part of historians the peace of versailles set the conditions for wwii with germany unjustly treated as the main culprit when in reality all european powers were guilty and punished too harshly actually the french used the peace to set the score straight and get revenge for the franco prussian war they somehow did better than the weimar republic and its infamous stagflation after that they got by by acting like russia is acting right now invading small countries to keep nationalism alive and let the people focus on external perceived enemies they offered an easy scapegoat to the woes and upheaval caused by the effects of the wall street crash blaming the masonic lodge jewish run metropolitan elites and the inability of traditional representative democracy to make perceivable change in essence what i would call a perfect storm but really think about the fact that deutsche mark banknotes were losing so much value that even poor working class people were going to the cinema knowing that by the time they watched the movie a banknote would have already lost some value
books,removed,the most used slur the media uses is racist today
books,removed,a new nazi or stalin like regime is of course unlikely in our times but dont let that lull you into thinking freedom cant be taken away dictatorships may not be as brutal today but they can still exist consider russia china singapore turkey these are all dictatorships in various forms some are so subtly dictatorship that you probably dont think about it the most likely model for an american dictatorship is likely something like singapore they keep a symbolic opposition which seems real enough but which can never really challenge the ruling party they dont torture and shot dissidents they just sue them into silence in the courts putin is another great example it isnt the terror of stalin there are actually elections and people have generally a decent living standard and a fair amount of freedom but of course elections and the opposition in todays russia is mostly like a potemkin village people think elections are free because they actually cast ballots according to their wishes but they dont realize how they are manipulated by all the media to think putin is a great guy erdogans turkey is another great example as in his case all you need is a dramatic incident like an attempted coup and the president will get all the goodwill he needs to start a witching and eradicate the opposition
books,removed,are you kidding me your candidate losesthe us elected a right wing president and you are saying right wingers are tearing the world apart is canada britain france ect too right wing for you as well many people were not happy with years of obama either but who cares about them theyre just a bunch of ignorant racist misogynistic fascist redneck climate change and holocaust deniers
books,removed,so why do jews cast out everyone who isnt jewish example i cant walk on the same sidewalk as this jew but he has all the rights to spit on me oooooookay
books,removed,both sides are headed towards extremism altright and progressivism whoever wins will provide us the next hitler or nothing at all like usual
books,removed,he really was a moron
books,removed,you are right to a degree however what we associate the nazis most strongly with today are the holocaust and territorial conquest these two things did not happen until years later people did not vote for these things when the nazis appeared on the ballot
books,removed,exactly
books,removed,people were probably ok with these changes in germany they had recently lost and were going through one of the worst economic crashes in history the german people were extremely demoralised after being the dominant powerhouse in europe since the birth of the nation then you have this man who comes to power promising to make germany great again he gets rid of the democracy which many people were unhappy with and blamed for their recent hardship and saw as an alien government pushed on them by the entente germany was under an absolute monarch before and seeing hitler come to power was like the rebirth of the kaiser and all the prosperity autocracy had brought to germany to us today hitlers dismantling of democracy might seem scary and unthinkable but for many germans then it was probably a welcome change
books,removed,sjws got trump elected and you still think theyre an unimportant factor in this whole thing the cognitive dissonance is strong in you
books,removed,your muslim grandchildren will thank you kafir
books,removed,i live in sc and generally dont disclose the fact that im a conservative unless i know the people im with we may be red states but we still have some aggressive sjw activity
books,removed,ask any socialist their opinion on gun control and the vast majority will tell you its wrong as it deprives the proletariat the ability to overthrow the existing capitalist paradigm with that said not all socialist tendencies advocate violent revolution and marx himself saw little difference between reform and revolution and when one realizes that the middle class would be considered part of the bourgeoisie and not the working class and that marx called specifically for violent revolution it becomes appallingly evident this can only occur with gun control and the resulting genocide while it is true that eugenics was a popular pseudoscience among some early century progressives and fascists alike it has no historical precedent in socialist theory the webbs founders of the socialist fabian society stated eugenics to be the most important question of all in achieving a socialist society as no eugenicist can be a laissezfaire individualist george bernard shaw wrote the only fundamental and possible socialism is the selective breeding of man william beveridge stated that defective people can be dependent on the state but at the cost of surrendering all rights john maynard keynes served on the bored of the eugenics society i would also like to see citations on the cofounder of planned parenthood claim planned parenthood was originally called the american birth control league its cofounder was lothrop stoddard who wrote the rising tide of color against world wide white supremacy planned parenthood became the groups new name after the horrors of the eugenics programs of the nazis and their racial views require the eugenics movement to rebrand itself
books,removed,they are stoning gays in france

books,removed,i dont think that is the feminine strength people talk about when they bring up the argument i think it is more about the things we see as strength are inherently male traits so a strong woman would have to act like a man and then what kind of feminism is that my opinion is that we would need to change what we see as strong first before we could have strong female characters who as strong in feminine ways that is a long road until then i will take kick ass women who are strong in any way check out neal stephensons baroque cycle he writes really good female characters and there is an almost cliche woman in that series that never seems to be cliche i dont want to spoil anything but i went from eye roll at her introduction to hell to the yes as the story progressed
books,removed,that right there that mentality the fucking mexican standoff we defend the extremists of our sides because it feels like a personal attack why are we defending them ive talked to neonazis whats your point whats your point neo nazis exist so that nullifies his experience with militant sjws is one extremist better than the other your party has fault so you cant tell me shit about my party cool than nothing gets fixed ever
books,removed,please dont invite more muslims to my country thanks
books,removed,the right are full of racists supporting anything they believe or do makes you a racist too s
books,removed,what happened here was the gradual habituation of the people little by little to being governed by surprise to receiving decisions deliberated in secret to believing that the situation was so complicated that the government had to act on information which the people could not understand or so dangerous that even if the people could not understand it it could not be released because of national security and their sense of identification with hitler their trust in him made it easier to widen this gap and reassured those who would otherwise have worried about it pretty much a textbook description of the obama administration and the pelosireid congress but sure lets pretend it applies to the guy who isnt even in office yet

books,removed,obama heavily supporting the rebel groups throughout the arab spring in multiple countries led to massive conflicts and a massive loss of lives it also caused the european migrant crisis and intensified western hatred from islamic terrorist groups there would have been other ways to deal with the situation other than simply arming any group that opposed assad his heavy support of rebel groups in syria is what escalated the conflict into a full scale war you are delusional if you deny this you most probably wont like this opinion though as you are undoubtedly used to a huge leftist circlejerk over your favourite president cant go against that groupthink he was not a good president but he was better than bush
books,removed,oh fuck off
books,removed,in that one specific way yes in another there is a whole hell of a lot of ribald very lowbrow humor throughout this and much of joyces work the entire penelope closing chapter is a woman masturbating also and even buzzfeed has published excerpts from his letters to nora barnacle much of which could pass for a victorian smith script i had a chance to go to a live performance of these letters years ago and theyre as filthy as anything youll hear come from jays mouth in one of those movies are they on the same level artwise my opinion would be no that doesnt mean you cant use a modern pop culture reference to make a single point though and it makes more sense when you read how much jj liked farts sexually
books,removed,they find out at the end of book one that theyre related by mid book three they still made out in book two jace said he couldnt be away from her shes basically said fuck you to jace after seeing him make out with some girl a nice charismatic boy comforts her and she makes out with him only to find out that hes her real brother and jace has been a decoy all this time unfortunately the incest did not improve as sebastian her actual blood brother and an absolute sociopath in some ways worse than valentine bencouragedb it source read it in middle school its been a while since then and i didnt end up finishing the series so just pulling from memory

books,removed,certainly stephen r donaldsons thomas covenant series did me in back in high school i was the outcastmisfit type that didnt fit with anyone so reading about a leper traveling into a fantasy world where hes in complete denial rapes a young lady then suffers immense guilt along with having the burden of the land on his shoulders was pretty intense for my mind back then all the characters that had good personalities would die go insane or be injured badly making you feel terrible in some ways i felt that the book reflected my own world at the time so it was cathartic on several levels also the dragonlance series hooked me for years i was again living in that fantasy world and refused to be in reality probably the big bummer for me was seeing laurana hook up with tanis in my version i enter the picture and take her with me

books,removed,i agree with that its the ending more than anything that makes me think of where winston spends the whole book fighting only to give in at the end mae seemed to resist a bit early on less because she saw it as tyrannical but because she still respected privacy but eventually succumbed just like winston except hers is creepier in a way because she did it voluntarily i saw it less as a book that showed how the problem would be solved and more as the story of a brainwashing the way its written forces you to sit and watch as an impressionable young woman succumbs to these insidious beliefs allows her morals re privacy to be compromised for a greater good she cant really understand

books,removed,several things we could flip the roles and say a girl never approached him equality but then guys are the ones who are supposed to approach women that was one aspect that put him at a disadvantage he was also timid and shy which was worsened as time went due to his upbringing he knew very well how people operated better than most people i daresay but there were certainly areas where he thought how things were supposed to be rather than how they were aka feminism he was polite but as he said girls do not appreciate those things he also went to school in a highly sexualised environment with classmates who engaged in sexual behavior even before becoming teenagers these are not anomalies but society ignores them also the places he grew up in had many entitled womeni remember reading a forum where a guy said that he was a student athlete there and it was difficult for him to get girls so imagine rodgers troubles think about it it is always the women getting tons of offers from random guys but not the other way around why find out next episode on rredpill

books,removed,well he was just sort of narrating along in his stream of consciousness way and happened to mention something like and then i looked up and saw a cloud and it looked like this picture of cloud and then the narration continues on like nothing at all just happened only then you notice that the outline of the cloud isnt quite right its all cloudshaped on the top curvy and puffy but the bottom is all jagged and angular and youre like wtf until you realize that the negative space inside those jagged angles is actually the shape of the buildings near the horizon behind which the cloud was sitting i just found it this incredibly powerful way of hammering home just how literal this characters perspective on life is to him the cloud was exactly and only the parts he could see like the part behind the buildings didnt even exist for him
books,removed,the author is really reaching for clickbait here its an altleft article written to demonize people who won an election that the author is politically against this is a political article and nothing more shoddy work tbh

books,removed,i feel like there must be some major flaws in it that some people are just oblivious to so noone knows what it is because anyone who can stand to read it all the way through loved it you know how some hardcore fantasy nerds just dont notice when the characters are totally unrealistic because were a bit aspergers something like that
books,removed,k
books,removed,hahaha that series is total garbage its like wish fulfilment for fedoras
books,removed,mine would be the christian bible tons of death rape weird curses its crazy
books,removed,remindme hours do this survey
books,removed,spoiler kvothe ends up destroyed on so many levels and not in anyway is he like the boy we hear about in the story where he is in real life not really wish fulfillment if you ruin the entire worlds yourself kill everyone you loved and have to live a life of unending agony maybe its because i use to be a child without postsurgery chronic pain for years that i dont look back on memories before my life was unending constant agony as being wish fulfillment even though i had an ideal life going for myself
books,removed,dont think you really understand the book first major point is that a main theme is pridecompetencepower is the flipside to arrogance and that sword named folly in the inn the story starts in a world he ruined where hes lost most people important to him and gimped himself he nearly asphyxiates himself as a child he starts a pissing contest with a noble and teacher he cant bring himself to borrow money from rich friends so he gets into very dangerous situations he breaks into a professors room and is party to arson he jumps off a roof and a hundred other things stemming from that character flaw it is most bluntly explained by the character who is the kvothe of last generation elodin who in his own arrogance drove his pupils to insanity or auriness i suddenly realized what was going on oh god i said whose rooms are these elodin gave a satisfied nod very good i would also have accepted why dont you have a key for this room or what are we doing in here he looked down at me his eyes serious doors are locked for a reason people who dont have keys are supposed to stay out for a reason he nudged the heap of smouldering cloth with one foot as if reassuring himself it would stay in the fireplace you know youre clever thats your weakness you assume you know what youre getting into but you dont elodin turned to look at me his dark eyes serious you think you can trust me to teach you he said you think i will keep you safe but that is the worst sort of foolishness second point is he isnt a mary sue there is almost always numerous people that are better than him in anything he does exception of music and he frequently loses or gets by through luck he barely survives in tarbean is beaten is almost raped felurian flashback and it takes two years to get out of there he is worse in medicine math alchemy poetry naming fela etc at the university he loses his fight with devi he has no idea what to do leading mercenaries in the forest he has no competence in friendship or relationships and after learning enough about sex to not embarrass felurian he can only be the target of flings explained by fela and ends up hurting denna who is forced to sell sexflirtation to survive he winds up being at a talented child level of fighter after leaving the adem an old granny ends up knowing more about medicine than him and really odysseus is not a gary stu hes the sort of character you get to tell a meaningful story about an average protagonist either requires endless dei ex machinis or you tell a story with a limited much more limited scope and that isnt what the fantasy genre is about third point is that the unreliable narrative is important to the plot bast has been trying to get kote to tell his story in the right way he lures chronicler and warns him to avoid talking about her or the music in the inn with multipart silences he wants kote to remind himself he is a hero and tricks bandits to hopefully get beat up flatters kote when he kills the spider demons interrupts at key times the reason is that story telling is a mechanic of the world that effects things there is a reason that the chandrian kill his parents for telling the wrong types of stories why skarpi is imprisoned for the same why felurian wants stories told about her why denna is learning some form of magic and composing propaganda why elodin is startled when he thinks kvothe is changing his name often why records of certain historical things have been expunged by secret societies why the edema ruh were persecuted and a reason why time is spent going into kvothe changing a swords name to caesura in a series called kingkiller there is a reason the author uses certain numbers of words in phrases and dozens of other clever little things its a brilliant book

books,removed,all i can say is that fake reviews is a misnomer at best people who were launching their own brands or trying to create brand awareness or deal awareness were giving away product at atleast promotional discount if not free via a voucher system in order to gain star reviews this allowed the vendors to rapidly take a product to market and have it show high in rankings due to pumped up feedback but came at a direct cost to the vendor giving away his product the consequence of fighting fake reviews will be quite counterintuitive as the amazon executives in charge of this policy dont truly understand what is transpiring what policy changes like this will do is lower the variety of american and european companies importing their own brands or pumping out closeout buys and placing into fba facilities and encourage hordes of chinese to engage in just greater levels of counterfit and dropshipment from hong kong china and cousins in los angelesnew york what this effectively has done is take away shortcuts allowing thousands of the largest amazon vendors were employing only to leave chinese factories and established retailers or brands really really really poor decision on their part they will feel the ramifications in stop the circle jerc

disease continues to ravage our world today despite tremendous advances in health care therapeutic approaches to treating this widerange suffering cannot be met by technological growth in pharmacology genetic therapy or surgery it should be obvious that the real solution for treating cancer and disease is not found in a manmade pill but rather is found in regulating the metabolic functions within our bodies western cultures today enjoy a diet rich in the delicacies that our ancestors did not consume on a regular basis such as grain sugar and starch research continues to show that sugar is the main source of fuel which feeds cancer and contributes to an inflammatory environmentsugar essentially increases the risk for cancer and disease how the ketogenic diet works what is the ketogenic diet the eskimos and maasai group are cultures we often look at to learn how their scant consumption of carbohydrates sustained their bodies through harsh weather conditions it turns out that their low carb diet switched their metabolism to burn fat instead of sugar or glucose this created a metabolic state known as ketosis a process in which the body burns ketones to make energy instead of relying on sugar or carbohydrate ketones are metabolized by fatty acids in the liver for energy this source of fuel is capable of crossing the blood brain barrier and is an excellent form of energy for neurons when the body lacks glucose which is its first source of fuel ketones are created in its absence ketosis was a beneficial process the human body developed as an adaptation to times when food was unavailable such as for these huntergatherers howeveryou can effectively produce ketones too by limiting the carbohydrates in your diet to less than grams daily and protein to no more than grams of proteinper kg lean body mass as the body adapts to the use of ketone metabolism over time the hormone in the liver that is essential to ketone metabolism known as becomes more efficient Ôøº the ketogenic diet starves cancer otto warburg was a leading cell biologist who led to the discovery that cancer cells are unable to flourish using energy produced from cellular respiration but instead from glucose fermentation dr thomas seyfried and other cancer researchers agree and have further discovered that cancer cells are also fueled from the fermentation of the amino acid glutamine in other words carbohydrates are broken down into glucose which feeds cancer cells by removing carbohydrates from your diet you can also deplete cancer cells of their energy supply cancer cells are unlike normal cells in many ways but one of their traits that is most unique regards insulin receptors they have ten times more insulin receptors on their cellular surface this enables cancer cells to gorge themselves in glucose and nutrients coming from the bloodstream at a very high rate as you continue toconsume glucose as your primary diet source cancer cells will continue to thrive and spread it is no surprise that the lowest survival rate in cancer patients is among those with the highest blood sugar levels cancer cells have damaged mitochondria and lack the ability to create energy from aerobic respiration they cannot metabolize fatty acids for energy for this reason cancer cells thrive in oxygendepleted environments instead cancer cells metabolize glucose and amino acids restricting glucose or the amino acid glutamine is essential to starve off cancer intermittent fasting and cancer prevention the ketogenic diet is particularly effective when combined with periods of intermittent fasting fasting increases ketone production and can starve cancer cells late stage cancer patients can further weaken their cancer cells by completing a lemon water cleanse for three to seven days in todays modern diet snacks and meals have us eating up to five times a day preventing any sort of intermittent cell fasting as nutrition is constantly supplied blood sugar levels remain elevated insulin levels remain high and the fuel source needed for cancer cells to develop and grow remains a constant threat a lifestyle of fasting may involve an individual eating for a period of only hours in one day a fast may involve eating food between and each day this regular fasting lifestyle allows the body to produce ketones in order to fuel the entire body the fast may be optimal for individuals with the diagnosis of cancer but may otherwise be incorporated into your lifestyle using a to hour fasting period etc research dr dominic dagostino

books,removed,because the website just take parts making it look like a smoking gun while the email itself is perfectly normal are you saying it does this for every single one you looked once again give an exemple yourself ok look at the leaks surrounding donna brazile leaking questions to clinton before the debate look at the audio about rigging a palestine election look at the cf bribes involving morocco look at qatar receiving a massive increase in arms sales under hillary after giving bill a birthday gift of million look at her staff praying after the san bernadino terror attack that they wished damn better if a guy named sayeed farouk was reporting that a guy named christopher hayes was the shooter and look at the numerous examples of corruption to make bernie fail as well as media collusion bbut its ok for the dnc to cheat its not technically wrong then theres one of my favorites the leak showing clinton knew saudiqatar funded isis but said nothing publicly and continued taking tens of millions from both countries and coincidentally carrying out foreign policy that just happens to make them super happy ie nfz plus a full on intervention in syria her own staff chews her out for it clintons should know better than to raise money from folks whose primary concern has been supporting the niac a notorious supporter of the radical islamic mullahs the clintons have thrown principle out the window in exchange for cold hard cashputting money ahead of principle do you think if trump was caught in a position where hes taking money from people who funded isis that wed ever hear the end of it this is something thats grounds for treason its just brushed over because like clinton tons of dc insiders have connections to the gulf arab lobby to which i would give you the snope link snopes and politifact was a partisan joke this election cycle blatantly cheerleading hillary political subs that arent trash like rpolitics rgeopolitics or rneutralpolitics would require additional sources beyond just links to factcheckers if you want to be taken seriously one example from you doesnt negate the entire list i produced or the specific examples i just listed previously since your claim was that nothing significant appeared in the emails and i just gave numerous examples otherwise i think we can close the book on this
books,removed,yes the mods keep deleting it though the media brought up the crowd issue first the one day they couldve been fair and nice to him they have to sneak diss with misleading crowd pictures what business interests does he have in russia none call me when you find some he did one beauty pageant there years ago youre pushing a fake narrative watch his conflict of interest press conference he explains how there wont be any they go over the emoluments the tax return thing isnt a real issue they dont even show foreign investments he didnt shut out any news organization and bannon is a bad ass i dont even know anything about him i just like how he triggers sjws by existing you realize elon musk just said tillerson will make a great secretary of state so did the economist your narrative cognitive dissonance and mass hysteria is going to come crumbling down youll probably realize by the end of that president trump is making america great again by the end of these years he will go down as the best president of our life time stay salty my friend

books,removed,if your forced to think a certain way goes hand in hand with pc thought thats where it really shines is not just about what people say but how they act books and art are not allowed erasing history and writing what you want the people to think happened instead of the truth walking on egg shells all the time hoping know one thinks im racist because of a shrug or an eye roll gave me the feeling people telling me how i should be not knowing the new words i shouldnt say and saying them and getting called out government lies the list goes on if you read the book in the last years you could see lots of similarities if you are just reading it because of alternative facts then your not getting everything from that book it has nothing really to do with trump or obama but how the machine people have made kind of takes over becomes its own entity then it owns us
books,removed,good be an idiot no one cares

books,removed,so harry potter and the cursed child is out and largely its a fantastic take on the world with an inventive tale but it has one gaping plot hole spoilers to come so dont read on if you dont want it spoiled the plot revolves around the use of time turners in book we see that when you travel back in time you essentially create an instance of occupying the same space in time for a short period and this book follows this rule until we get to the point with scorpius dumb name coming to a world ruled by voldermort in the present scorpius assumes the mantle of the default scorpius in this timeline completely removing any other scorpius from the time line so my thoughts is that harry potter time travel creates different possible branches of the time like a tree every time you travel a new branch grows so a scorpius would of had to lived in this time line where was he when the scorpio we know came magically gone

books,removed,i was told to read catcher after someone read one of my novels and asked if i was a salinger fan i had somehow missed reading him in high school and thought i was probably too old to read him i was around still i read catcher and then instantly devoured anything i could find even snagging copies of magazines containing his short stories i am drawn to salinger especially the glass family stories the characters arent necessarily saying anything profound but you are slowly getting to know them with each little bit that they put out there its not necessarily just a case of an unreliable narrator its more complicated than that to me its all subtext and the more you read of his the more you see
books,removed,let will smith explain it httpsmyoutubecomwatchvarphzlhlyey
books,removed,urwhighwater points an hour ago but would really like an honest discussion op asks for honest discussion posts an honest observation about people who are unsympathetic to holden op gets upset
books,removed,i cant even please try to even i would be interested in hearing the perspective of a teenage white girl such as yourself
books,removed,dude fuck off out off my whole post the only thing you bother to point out is a misspelled word i was getting all my thoughts about before a final in a few minutes dont you have something better to do like discuss my points or any other post in this discussion
books,removed,apparently hit a little to close to home for many of the people on this subreddit lol
books,removed,thanks for the downvote although my comment was ontopic and added to the discussion sorry i didnt continue your circlejerk to me it seemed so over the top but i guess i just wasnt the right person to relate to his way of thinking i could definitely see loving the book if you felt the way you say you felt youre saying it seemed over the top like it was unbelievable for someone to feel that way you said you cant relate to his way of thinking which literally means you cant imagine why he would think like that to top it off you add the way you say you felt implying that its possible people didnt actually feel that way
books,removed,that is precisely what the word means relatable to make a connection i agreed with you on the one comment i posted that did not add to the discussion my other comments have addressed reasons why i personally enjoyed the book and why i think its heralded as one of the classics i might have been rude about it but it doesnt change the fact that my comments were ontopic you asked for people to explain and many have but now it doesnt seem like you are interested in any kind of discussion when someone gives their interpretation youve basically just said yeah i could see that i just dont like it
books,removed,rcriclejerk is that way
books,removed,but that fight for continued oppression has dissolved into if you go beyond my idea of oppression that person shoots off the idea of youre a misogynist racist sexist pig
books,removed,replying that he needs a slap upside the head means you didnt get it its cool you understand its well written and stuff but you really just didnt get it if thats still your reaction to a depressed teenager whos been molested and abandoned your criticisms arent literary analysis theyre personal opinions you havent provided any sort of legitimate analysis on the book and you dont seem to understand the distinction between holding personal opinions about characters and holding opinions about the structure and development of plot good luck
books,removed,i just wanted to link to this brilliant monologue from six degrees of separationback when will smith could have been one of the worlds greatest actors httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvarphzlhlyey
books,removed,not an allusion they are the same ducks they tried to exert mind control over holden but he proved to weak to be a suitable vessel thy migrated to new jersey and waited for decades to appear in tony sopranoa pool and found themselves a new host body to carry out their plans of murder and mayhem its all there just gotta read between the lines a bit

books,removed,dais
books,removed,im really late to the party but can i ask how old you are i read the book for the first time when i was about so the same age as holden i got about the same from it that you got ive now read it a second time at and i see so much more of the book now first of all i now get that what i found the first time was exactly the point of the book its a look into the inner workings of a slightly weird year old which is something that was pretty rare back in the day you could even call it one of the first true young adult novels but there are also the finer points that i didnt get the frist time around holdens past of probably being molested and his innate distrust of adults that stems from that a lot of teens who were abused when they were younger display the same fascination almost obsession with innocence and being real that holden shows i completely missed the fact that holden was in a hospital for a breakdown that could have been pneumonia but was more likely something mental i understood how desperately holden wanted to make a genuine connection but also was afraid to let anyone close in every scene where he tries to talk to an adult whether it be the teacher the hooker or the nuns you see him trying hard to get through to people but at the same time hes shying away laughing it off focussing on some really stupid detail like the ducks in central park as a teenager i was a little ahead of my age but i still could never have gotten it back then the way i did the second time around being a teenager is something you only get in hindsight the best advice that i can give you is to gove it another go in a couple of years even if youre not a teenager youll get something completely different out of it the next time also if you want to have a pretty good analysis of why its considered a classic check out this its a but so worth it

books,removed,dumbing down america the war on our nations brightest young minds and what we can do to fight back by james r delisle its an endless runt about how gifted children are underserved in us public schools without any reasonable solution being offered yes they are underserved big time so is everyone else for the same reasons the classes are too big since the size of the classrooms is basically fixed we could still make things much much better by having two teachers in the classroom so more individualized approach could be used which is needed for all kids
books,removed,you should read the formatting help section so you can responsd properly here on reddit i choose not to format it i have been on reddit for years and been in countless discussions and you are the first person stupid enough to try to use that as an argument thats even more idiotic than the people who get caught up on typos if you read my original post which its clear that you did not i wasnt forced thats odd i recall you saying i actually picked it up in high school because we were required to write a research paper about a book oh i get it you are just saying that you choose from a list so no one was telling you what to think about wait whats this with a lot of resources and material to pull from at no point was it ever required reading for me at both points it was required reading just because you had options does not somehow make it not required arriving at the conclusion that you were condescending was not entirely based on your comment to me but rather reading multiple comments from you in this very thread where you keep telling people how theyre supposed to think or feel about this book all of which were valid and avoiding the stated reply by going to other comments shows you lack a sound argument against what was stated just like you commenting on my formatting every distraction you make from the topic at hand only can farther demonstrate your inability to counter my argument not agreeing with you or others who share your opinion doesnt make the rest of us somehow you feel as though other people stating their opinion is justified and when i state my contrary opinion it is not how are you making this arbitrary distinction between me and the rest of us it sounds to me like you are making a distinction with people i agree with and people i dont many people in the thread understood the book and i upvoted their comment and moved on incompetent i called you incompetent no one else being wrong doesnt make one incompetent it was how you replied that did so doesnt make us wrong no but in this specific case the people i replied to were uniformed andor wrong which is why i replied plenty of people had differing but valid opinions it is left up to the person observing that artwork in this case the reader to take away from it what they will you are somewhat confused yes a person can take away from it what they will but that does not mean their takeaway was intended nor reasonable i am not saying you did not takeaway from it what you did i am saying what you took away was both unintended and unreasonable as if someone enjoyed a picasso painting because they liked how realistic it was and i shared my thoughts which is completely fine i shared my thoughts on your thoughts you certainly dont get to tell us all how to think or feel about it sure i can just like you are currently telling me how to think and feel about telling others what to think and feel how you dont see the contradiction in that is beyond me but you are certainly allowed to say it its obvious you dont agree with many of the top posts in this thread well yes that has to be true for anyone the top posts are contradicting eachother i particularly agreed with this post although i dont think the book is anywhere near as good as he is claiming it to be so why not make your own reply to the op i did what you are supposed to do on reddit look to see if someone made the same comment that you would make and upvote it if is already there which would be this post in particular stop trying to pick others apart civil and intellectual discussions should always be welcomed what you are suggesting is how ignorance and stupidity happens

books,removed,this makes no sense you seem fixated on their lack of names you can have characterisation without naming the characters mccarthy even provides backflashes to provide context on the man theres no characterization only the outline of a generic as fuck someones dad i am man must protect woman and small man woman now dead must protect small man harder you literally just referenced cannibals there is an extended action set piece where they discover and flee from cannibals how is that not a thing that happens action there are cannibals there they exist now let us run away yeah tons of action there you also have the problem that you know absolutely that neither of them are in any sort of danger because its not far enough along in the book for either of them to die its such a generic story outline that you know all the beats about ten pages in i quoted you you fucked an elephant thats what i get out of what i just quoted that means you fucked an elephant right after all i quoted it and then said something what you quoted had nothing to do with what you said quit being an idiot uh i would think the motivation of survival is sufficient for any work of fiction it is if you have a destination it is if you provide a reason and a motivation guy doesnt want his kid to die okay thats cool now make it interesting give me a reason to give a shit about either one of them other than the fact that they care its not a writers job to make characters care its a writers job to make the reader care the road utterly fails on that point for me for you thats just like your opinion man yes i know and its correct because i am perfect in every way in fact its been the main plot element in fucking loads of celebrated works of fiction the stand the martian lord of the flies i am legend the revenant robinson crusoe and life of pi to name just a few of them know how those things differ from the road they actually had a goddamn story every one of them provided extensive character and world building they provided a reason not only for the characters to continue living but also a reason for us to give a shit its clear from the beginning of the road that there is nothing there is no food there is no water there is no respite they are going to die it is not a question of if but of when why the fuck even bother that would be why the conditional if is there buddy and thats why i said if i wanted to say something i would fucking write it i didnt write that so dont even fucking bring it up quit being an idiot what is the point of this statement your ability to acknowledge that one of your favourite books has flaws doesnt suddenly make you a paragon of objectivity and literary criticism it certainly doesnt mean you are right about the road the point dumbass is to make it clear that im well aware of the flaws that exist in all works of fiction a trait people that are dumb enough to like the road clearly do not possess i like how you simultaneously dismissed and utilised this form of criticism why thank you i craft my hypocritical hyperbole with great care also if mccarthy was neither showing or telling the pages would literally just be blank no jackass the pages would be filled with what is exactly in them all he ever shows of this world is that everything is grey and covered in ash and dead all he ever tells you about this world is that well its grey and covered in ash and dead at no point does he describe the extent of this damage we have no real idea of the kind of timeframe this novel is happening in we know theyre going for the ocean but how the fuck far away is it where did they start what part of the ocean are they going to think about this really actually fucking use your brain for a fucking moment tell me about this world tell me about these people you fucking cant because you dont know anything about anything in this shitheap of an attempt at fiction thats not criticism its just protest oh fuck off with that wank shit if you dont fucking like it then shut the fuck up and stop fucking responding to me you fucking moron and seriously if you dont see criticism in what ive written just fuck your own pretentious mccarthysucking self to death with a hand of grey ash

books,removed,i fixed the article the superintendent of accomack county public schools confirmed the district had removed harper lees to kill a mockingbird and mark twains adventures of huckleberry finn after a parent local idiot voiced her concerns during a nov school board meeting reported wavytv right now we are a nation divided as it is said the mother buffoon whose name was not released in a recording of the meeting so what are we teaching our children she continued the woman further missing the point of the works who she said her biracial son as poorly educated as her was upset by racial slurs used in the books were validating that these words are acceptable and they are not acceptable by any means the superintendent took the books off the curriculum so they could be replaced with basic english language works such as spot the dog and the big red car as the material was clearly too advanced for the grade at which it was being taught

books,removed,the song of ice and fire flee market grr martin
books,removed,spoiler alert except this is the season where john snow comes back to life and aria gets her sight back and danerys topples a few lanterns and single handedly wipes out dozens of elite warriors i for one am glad were getting back into fantasy vs a rapey medieval soap opera but feels a little deus ex machina at times
books,removed,i dont like this explanation the reason him killing off characters works is because it creates tension that is lacking from most stories usually creators keep characters alive at least until there is something really important to be done and if you spend enough time watchingreading stories you start to see a pattern and you know when a character is in danger so there is either no danger for the character or you dont care for him which makes the situations less impactful but when you kill off several characters on points when their story is seemingly nowhere you break that rule the viewer understands that most characters actually dont have plot armor and there is legitimate chance something bad can happen to them there have been points when i was really worried about some characters in got for that reason and it made scenes more powerful but got still has to make some sense so there were points when i was sure there is nothing to worry about even though spoilers stop reading if you havent watched the last couple show episodes the characters were even dead i knew there is no way jons storyline has ended not until hi rides a fucking dragon
books,removed,some of you neckbeards might disagree with me but george is nothing but a perverted old man there is no need for all of the boobage he shows and it portrays women in a bad way
books,removed,well its not like just because someone survives means that theyre unkillable spoilers stannis is dead jon actually died and dany is immune to fire has dragon babies and often armies following her
books,removed,its also dishonest to sit on your fat ass for ten years and not finish the series youre working on
books,removed,no they die because that fat bearded fuck is shit writer thats all there is to it
books,removed,that show was gratuitous in all the right ways was really sad when andy whitfield died
books,removed,the everybody dies in game of thrones thing is mostly marketing spiel and people trying to oversell the series major characters dont die that often one or two a season on average
books,removed,im okay with this as long as he stops killing queer characters they should be exempt
books,removed,this is hard to argue concisely but let me try at least with one of the characters spoiler warning i guess dany i would say has been the least likely to die of all the characters since her plot has no value to the overall story until she started interacting with other westeros characters or until she travels to westeros spending books and books following her watching her grow and develop only to see her die would have made her part of the books more or less a waste in a way that ed and robbs deaths did not eds death and robbs death to name just two were shocking and in some ways at least unexpected but the value of the story wasnt lost when they died robb had great plans and the means to execute them so his death felt like a bit of a waste but everything he had done up to that point had caused so many ripples for the other main characters that i think he contributed more to the overall story than dany had in the first four books in danys case the payoff hasnt arrived yet and i dont think it will arrive until she steps foot on westeros
books,removed,i think the heroes that sit behind a computer screen and shoot missiles from drones at people riding camels might not die as easily the ones that do actually die usually just get blown to bits by a random roadside bomb its kind of like a lottery for sheeple

books,removed,life death lifes just so righteous uhhhh uhhhhh can i get a mic check my bitches got five kids god damn mannn imma break the bank feeding these skanks do ya feel me if you was a doctor would ya heal me open wounds would you seal me strokes of blue would you teal me
books,removed,i think you should read the books shes only immune to fire in the show but i dont mind because i thought they used it to great effect burning all the khals was her idea she knew she would look like a goddess walking out of those flames and that she would have the entire khalasar after that ehen she traded the dragon for the unsullied i thought that was pretty clever the tactics she used to conquer the cities in slavers bay was pretty awesome imo and if you really have a problem with knowing that she isnt going to get killed do you like any of the main characters still alive since season it seems unlikely that jon snow is going to die again bran sansa arya arya is a little girl whos somehow still alive in this brutal world if anyones been lucky its her
books,removed,maybe i think after the death or so while reading the books it would become a lot less surprising as ukurujt said its just hard to get invested in much anymore i like the story but im no longer emotionally invested in any of the characters the next major death isnt going to do anything for me take for instance the other stark brother whose name i cannot even remember that was just given to ramsay yeah hes probably going to get tortured to death or nearly maybe saved maybe not but i really just dont care much about the character and given weve already seen this numerous times it is no longer shocking
books,removed,rob stark is dead

books,removed,idk about tv but
books,removed,httpsyoutubeieowrfiqzek russia kids
books,removed,its really not a cheap gimmick in the books because of the way the characters are when they are brought back remember its still a fantasy novel with magic spoilers so lady stark or catelyn stark died during the red wedding right after killing a frey when shes brought back to life shes obsessed with revenge on the freys even going so far as to killing numerous freys that had little to do with the red wedding and almost killing brienne and pod because they didnt kill jaime lannister catelyn who was level headed and caring before she died is now some crazy psycho murderer when benderic dies and brought back he has no memory of his past life and is obsessed with killing gregor and keeping the kings peace which was his last mission before dying
books,removed,i understand the women nude scenes but why does george have to force the gay sex scenes on us who the hell wants to see that shit my kids watch that show
books,removed,personally id love to see sansa die ive never liked her character she has constantly turned her back to her family though obviously for political reasons i honestly dont know why shes relevant right now married twice and now has a personal body guard joffrey was a dick sansa is a cunt

books,removed,why is this shitpost at the top of rall
books,removed,spoilers incoming i think the best description of realism in fantasy is that it makes the unbelievable believable if you want the reader to believe that magic and dragons are real then how everything else in the universe which is supposed to be normal needs to be spot on grrm has gotten flack for this many times ie things are too real or are gratuitous when characters like ned stark robb and oberyn martell die their deaths makes you appreciate that people in this world are mortal despite some having very unique characteristics or abilities and that makes it more believable if you conceal your main characters in swathes of plot armor the reader cant relate even the most epic heroes in the best series can be hurt or their friends slain try reading the dark tower by steven king for a good example

books,removed,are you trying to exfoliate and give the guy smoother skin cut his asshole out and use it as a cock ring to skull fuck some sense into this mutanta fucking scoreboard
books,removed,social justice warrior youll find it referenced when people complain about people complaining about the things they used to complain about so now they complain that they cant complain like they used to complain because sjws complain too much
books,removed,samurai jewish warrior
books,removed,theres a pretty good chance that youre an sjw then
books,removed,come on youre ruining the circlejerk with common sense and facts
books,removed,hahahaha get fucked nerds
books,removed,dont interrupt the circlejerk
books,removed,add also five innocent people shot dead and itll be perfect
books,removed,social justice warrior its used to reference often fervent offense monkeys who go out of their way to be offended for other people and make a big deal out of it as with all of these things though theres a mix of perfectly reasonable people and fucking nutjobs
books,removed,yeah more people enjoy a specific sport than movies right oh wait no youre wrong and stupid and whats wrong with society mindless more people watch movies than play any specific sports drama club are one way to learn acting also universities are supposed to be educational not manage professional sport teams
books,removed,get out of my anti safe space safe space
books,removed,lol fuck you heres an upvote
books,removed,last i checked educational institutions are lacking funding and theyre lacking funding because the population is uneducated
books,removed,so football is a waste of money and drama club other educational services to be clear people are stupider because so many fewer parents raise their children and even elementary schools replace stem classes with racesexgender lectures intended to steer their ideologies for political purposes football and drama club are both extracurricular hobbies i could not care less which one you are more interested in but the one that the most people are interested in should and does get more funding
books,removed,fuhrer
books,removed,the school is just making people stupider in the long run given how our government works isnt this what they want a population just smart enough to do what they are told but not smart enough to question if they should do it
books,removed,good for you jock bro but everyone else still reads books
books,removed,haha surrrre thats the difference np one goes to high school play unless its to support someone in the play
books,removed,wow football fans are more shallow then i ever thought who gives a flying fuck about a scoreboard as long as the old one works somewhat ok its not like its necessary to the enjoyment or the practice of said sport wtf
books,removed,not to mention flint dont even got clean drinking water but football forgetaboutit
books,removed,it sums up human stupidity
books,removed,social justice warriorpeople who make it their job to get offended on behalf of someone else because they feel those people should be offended
books,removed,social justice warrior its a derogatory term used to refer to essentially imagine the white guilt crowd its just another term for that
books,removed,obviously we should the school should tax the football programs boosters to pay for the drama department because the enlightened few who understand the value of the arts must direct the benighted many who only value athletics s
books,removed,same with my school for the long time music and theatre comes from above else well other then jebus i guess belmont is wack
books,removed,we had large sports programs too we just had an arts program that wasnt shit
books,removed,ha my old high school had a crack running all the way through the math building which widened noticeably in the time that i was there and yet nothing was ever done aside from more grouting every year but the football team got new equipment and somehow they managed to astroturf the field weird
books,removed,i mean thats all nice and all but it wont get kids into a real university program
books,removed,because how else are the colleges going to afford to pave their sidewalks with gold
books,removed,thatd break their circle jerk of dae murika suks bcuz evks dee xd

books,removed,boo yah
books,removed,little safe havens for sjws who dont want anyones feeling to be hurt and no one to actually be ready for the real world when they are leaving it seriously it was one comment above yours
books,removed,i have this argument all the time with footballtards usually goes something like this what does football even have to do with school well its what brings in all the money of course yeah but the money never seems to make its way over to the yes it does shut up go dawgs
books,removed,then they should start paying the employees who generate all the revenue the players
books,removed,a new scoreboard is not gonna help their team not be shit
books,removed,this yes
books,removed,lol big ten schools are among the best universities in the world i cant think of any that dont spend incredible amounts of money on infrastructure the one i went to uses proceeds from football to fund education in addition to all of the unpopular athletic programs in a sub full of bullshit assertions pulled out of asses this is the most bullshit assertion to be pulled out of an ass
books,removed,and i want a million dollars doesnt mean i deserve it or produce enough goodsservices to warrant it

books,removed,this feels like a place to bring up misuse of funds our local mosqueglasgow central spent ¬£ on a fire alarm that doesnt work they also have ¬£ in their account but still ask women for donations for certain funerals the twat behind most of it is called nabbed sheikh and ran to the police when he was mildly threatened by a few people
books,removed,youre wrong nerd
books,removed,he is now on double secret probation
books,removed,thats not conclusive
books,removed,i have seen football players in college unable to read above elementary level i have seen professors allow football players to skip class because their tired from practice but dock me because i was tired from studying all night i also know several athletes from college who went on to become doctors and lawyers hes not insulting the players he insulting a system where sports is more important than academics and if anything the players suffer for it
books,removed,ok i do not have to be college uneducated to know what is right and what is fuckn ape poo a million for a scoreboard is bullshit and ape poo
books,removed,booooo
books,removed,if anything ever seems really stupid about us policies just assume its due to money in this case the amount of school administrators who have been caught receiving kick backs from sports suppliers andor people who profit from sport is ridiculous add to that some loud idiot parents who vicariously live through their childrens sports accomplishments and you have our current system
books,removed,because when youre raising an idiot kid to begin with sports is the only way most parents see their kid succeeding socially now and potential big payouts down the road

books,removed,its okay man were all friends here this is a safe space
books,removed,million of the donation spent on a career center but keep circlejerking
books,removed,booooooo
books,removed,im sure its true that sports draw some people to certain colleges but isnt that pretty stupid when you think about it the point of college is supposed to be getting an education so if youre choosing to apply to a certain school based on whether their football team is good or not youre probably a fucking idiot and shouldnt be in college in the first place even if winning a game just gets the schools name out there and then people research it and decide its a good school for other reasons it would still make more sense to funnel money into making the academics better then advertising the educational quality rather than throwing piles of cash at sports programs to get that publicity
books,removed,anybody else think that librarian looks like the creepy old pedo who used to post youtube videos

books,removed,meanwhile half the bathroom stalls had no doors and there was never any soap or paper towels well no not in the student restrooms entitled little brat
books,removed,this is fucking ridiculous and it makes me terribly sad
books,removed,theyre the biggest talking point in any of my interviews whether it was school related or job related not saying education is less important but often times athletics are of equal importance what the fuck is wrong with america thinking that sports are of equal importance to education when talking about a job interview is symptomatic of why youre becoming a second rate power
books,removed,well maybe people wouldnt have made comments about it being rude if you didnt lie in the first place and say they were naming it student success center instead of john doe center you karma wanting pansy
books,removed,not true at all the majority of colleges lose money or break even but with the ancillary benefit that less popular sports like field hocky or swimming get funded no i didnt read them all one of them may prove you correct
books,removed,got some bad news for you soccer is never going to be a thing in the united states its considered a weak elitist sport that overprotective suburban mothers force their children play because they find it safer than real sports the game is slow low scoring and just not aggressive enough for american spectators plus we get the same kind of payoff from watching basketball we have no desire to have a world class soccer league
books,removed,you need to add some kind of sjw safe space issue to make it really like american universities
books,removed,on average id be willing to bet just search for world university academic rankings and check out how many public read not ivy us schools are there in the top top or so then for canada you get mcgill toronto and bc you can huff and puff about how theyre scams but the numbers speak for themselves bullshit school for religious idiots who can only get hired by other religious idiots httpsenwikipediaorgwikicategoryseminariesandtheologicalcollegesincanada how embarassing

books,removed,i have to laugh at your terribly inaccurate statement youre completely wrong on your point that they didnt translate to meaningful skills your comment is so stupid im assuming youre trolling people i went to school with ended up in a world of hurt in college because they couldnt navigate a computers file system didnt know how to use the internet didnt know how to type didnt know how to use software like office to create the documents the professors required didnt know any basic coding which is usually required in college for most majors didnt know how to work with spreadsheets or even what one was youre telling me those are useless skills not used in the real world youre the only one that deserves to get laughed at

books,removed,there are still plenty of individuals and organizations making a profit well thats kinda the problem isnt it the influence and priority money has over education which is the intended purpose of a school its not a simple issue not one likely to change sports have a benefit of course but the and when there are billions at stake students become an afterthought this documentary explains it very well

books,removed,using old computers wont hurt you having to replace gear every many years will they break if not replaced every years causing the risk of death in the field failing your courses isnt the fault of the school or the football team but if you are already feeling entitled to getting the schools money spent specifically on you then i doubt you would understand i picked football because i knew i would learn something from it how to work with others in such stressful conditions how to push on when you know you have never gone as far i knew that with how much the school was receiving in donations that there would be much recognition for the players it wasnt just football though i was accepted to my college of choice this year because i proved that i could manage my time in a varsity sport ap courses debate and work on weekends our school offered coding as well and those who were interested found ways didnt have computers at school or home get a book go to the library like i said earlier dont blame your failure on other peoples drive if someone sees a team full of people wanting to do more to be more they will of course give more money to them who would pick the kid that sits hands open waiting for opportunity to fall in his lap

books,removed,you do know football brings in tens of millions of dollars to universities and football and basketball literally carry the finances of every other college sport including womens every sport cost the university money and they dont provide any profit so now imagine how many kids will lose their scholarships if we were to suddenly do away with football for a lot of youth football is their only way to a better life either through scholarships or professionally organizations like the nfl donate millions of dollars every year to charities and help out their communities all the time just look at what the saints did for new orleans after katrina also the history of football has been vital to the growth of universities around the country since its inception winning programs brought in more money more support and more donations that have allowed them to build up their schools and use that money for better research and professors in fact it can be argued that the reason the us has one of the best higher education systems in the world is because of football so please inform exactly how its a cancer again kids get hurt okay isnt that why theyre constantly looking for new ways to make the game safer and as far as economic strain what are you talking about football at the college level pays for itself man rbooks is the poster child of rianverysmart

books,removed,nerdwriter on youtube made a really good point about moments in stories in one of his videos granted hes talking about movies but i think it works really well for any kind of story telling too many writers view stories as a series of big connected events you dont have to be good at making the connections as long as the emotional payoff works in your events but thats not how great stories work the story should be the event with memorable portions developing organically from the story im shit at explaining this and nerdwriter does it much better
books,removed,wow thats some selfish smug high and mighty ego you got there bud he needs your blessing you decide whether or not his spending habits are moral karmaic balance saving small amounts of money is not cheap its intelligent and quite frankly a fantastic way to ensure you nurture a mindset that keeps you from leaking money needlessly an important virtue in todays day and age and before you take your selfimportant attitude and try to put me on blast let it be known that ive racked up years of volunteer work at several libraries local to me so i get books i get the importance of them i get the work that goes in and fuck it if i can get the choice between two samequality books with slightly different prices ill choose the cheaper one every time regardless of the experience because its just the smart efficient thing to do

books,removed,rofl so you want to argue about semantics over the internet ok then i wrote this exactly this is dumb as fuck nobody cross purchases graphic novels and actual novels notice the bolded portion of that quote it seems to me you lack the fundamental english vocabulary to understand what cross purchase means since you obviously lack the brain capacity it means that you replace one purchase with the other i never said people who buy regular novels would never buy graphic novels if you misunderstood that thats your own stupidity and arrogance i said people who buy regular novels will not replace a regular novel purchase with a graphic novel purchase
books,removed,i refer to my other post which i will just copy paste here rofl so you want to argue about semantics over the internet ok then i wrote this exactly this is dumb as fuck nobody cross purchases graphic novels and actual novels notice the bolded portion of that quote it seems to me you lack the fundamental english vocabulary to understand what cross purchase means since you obviously lack the brain capacity it means that you replace one purchase with the other i never said people who buy regular novels would never buy graphic novels if you misunderstood that thats your own stupidity and arrogance i said people who buy regular novels will not replace a regular novel purchase with a graphic novel purchase

books,removed,its been cool seeing sandersons writing skills develop i read elantris the original mistborn trilogy the way of kings and two of the newer mistborn books and theres a huge difference in writing style his earlier books were not impressive prose for some reason the final empire in particular reads like a teenager wrote it i mean a teenager with a ton of talent for storytelling and worldbuilding but well for example he is absolutely obsessed with the word however seriously of the book do a text search for the word however he uses it times in a book i counted six different paragraphs that use however twice for example however if the feruchemist were also an allomancer he might be able to burn his own metal storages releasing the energy within them tenfold mistress vin tried to burn some of my metals earlier but couldnt access the power however if you were able to make up the feruchemical storages yourself then burn them for the extra power i also found a page that used the word four times most of the time he begins or ends a sentence with it i remember my tenthgrade english teacher warning us not to use however too much in the unabridged audiobook the reader starts skipping or rushing the word because its used so often to so little effect another example people are constantly pausing before doing things he paused then smiled four times he paused then turned he paused then eyed vin kelsier paused then eyed ham she paused then threw the cloak over her shoulders sorry im ranting it bothers me because i love the story and the magic system so much but i cant get past how teenage the writing style is rant over

books,removed,have you ever read any of ibn tammiyahs work have you he is a big influence on salafis how do you not know that because they are you provided no information for the contrary nope theyre not islam itself is the problem along with shitty cultures lack of education lack of civic duty tribalism foreign intervention etc many of the problems are homegrown and many of them start with islam yea because people typically dont want to murder their own brothers in faith thats a stupid deflection which has nothing to do with your constant insinuations that the british empowered wahhabi clerics specifically rather than the military impressive saud clan religious people murder their own brothers in faith all the time as a muslim you should be familiar with that no the saudis had been fundamentally wahhabi from generations prior to and the british werent empowering clerics hoping to see radicalization of muslims lol they were never decently progressive thats an absouletly hilarious thing to say lol yes they were they were going on a path towards progressive modernization before attack on the kaaba shows how much you know they were the only grpup that didnt believe and pan arabism and were a wrench in the development pf unity among muslims thats why the british loved them because a united muslim world is a threat to oppressive western globalization holy shit theres that delusion i love from muslims they were not the only wrench in panarabism unity among all muslims and not just arabs is likely impossible to achieve and has never even come close to happening in a postwwi world a united muslim world would be about as much of a challenge as a dumber and more religious version of china lol httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiijma yes ijma is a concept too bad sunnis are hardly ever able to actually agree on anything thats not proof of your consensus claim at all that wasnt me and that was the actual topic itt i was just pointing out how you were deflecting poorly

books,removed,k
books,removed,well in the view of the ot your concept of our messiah is ludicrous and we view it as paganism a jew is allowed to step foot in a masque because it isnt considered paganism but a jew is not allowed within a church because we view it as pagan your concept of the messiah is pure dribble as far as we are concerned
books,removed,one day you should really learn how an analogy is used the subject matter is irrelevant dont be such a plebian and the old testament has advanced mathematics far beyond its time its ideas on hygiene and philosophy are still in use today show me inaccuracy prove it instead of talking nonsense furthermore my point was just because you in your abysmal wisdom cant observe or prove something or use logic to support something doesnt mean no one can in fact it is the science within the old testament that is one of the greatest evidence for its validity but you an ignoramus would know nothing of that in your great arrogance
books,removed,neckbeard mouthbreather small dick basically youre describing a dog so what do you have against dogs

books,removed,really either you are ignorant or disingenuous if you are merely ignorant let me help you youve probably heard of a guy named abraham right yeah guess where he lived a sumerian town named ur ur was also a dynasty even a simple google search could find you any number of things directly borrowed by christianity from sumerian beliefs since hitting the search button is apparently beyond you ill name just a few easy ones have you ever heard of a guy named noah who made a huge boat to survive a huge flood in the sumerian babylonian version he is called gilgamesh in the gilgamesh flood the gods decide to destroy the earth with a worldwide flood a righteous man is informed and told to build a large roofed boat with multiple decks and make all living beings go up into the boat along with the mans family after a violent storm the earth is covered in water and the boat comes to rest on a mountain after the flood the man releases one bird after another to see if it will come back or find a perch on dry land elsewhere when the last bird does not return the man knows the flood has abated and offers a sacrifice to the gods the gods smell the sweet savor and are pleased and bless the man with a special promise for bonus points guess where its dry and basically never floods israel guess where it floods regularly mesopotamia the concept of devine beings merged in a holy trinity thats another sumerian concept from the gods an enlil enki the list goes on and on while you are at it look into mithras dionysus horus etc etc etc

books,removed,even as a jew id be thrilled if this was true be because it would totally devoid any pretense of divinity for the new testament and the koran which are built off the old testament bye bye jesus bye bye muhammad
books,removed,seems unlikely that he would do so willingly all the way to the part where he was imprisoned and died poor and in pain perfect way to seal a masterful performance think the prestige lol s no easier way to get rid of christianity in the immediate years following christs death i dont think the evidence you provided is evidence proving jesus was resurrected or anything or that the movement was so strong because those miracles actually happened i mean just look at how stupid most of the population is today a popular rapper with no scientific background has helped convince millions of idiots that the earth is flat imagine how easy it would be to swindle people back in the early bcs they couldnt just show folks the tomb where he was buried or point out the lack of resurrected people obviously there was a lack of resurrected people its not like jesus was walking around through throngs of people shaking hands and kissing babies and you couldnt show folks the tomb where he was buried because transportation options consisted of walking and riding another animal at the time it wouldnt be practical to bring people to a tomb in the ass end middle of nowhere

books,removed,old testent like modern jewish run disney take already good things and reboot for fame and money
books,removed,the problem with religion and god is that most of them have all been disproven even if a god might exist it shouldnt be the christian muslim or jewish god because all their holy scriptures are faulty all of them have contradictions and unprovable happenings in them isnt that a little weird then take into account that most reasons why people believed in gods can all be proven by science now there is no reason anymore to believe in god even with all those elements taken into account its for me impossible to understand that you would believe in a god in the western world other than maybe social attachment issues but lets look at it from a different angle what if god was real the christian god the muslim god and the jewish god were all real its still stupid because the rules in their holy scriptures are ancient and absolutely insane why would you follow allah a guy who literally had sex with a y old girl when he was in his fifties perfect morals right thats what i have against religions and gods

books,removed,interesting i believe i have seen some of those orthodox churches around town lots of gilt domes and crosses i always think of ottoman architecture when i see them as opposed to the gothic architecture feel i get from catholic churches although in terms of religion i am much happier being completely removed for it no offense to those who need to believe something but i have always seen religion as a crutch for the believers and a tool to oppresscontrolinfluence people for the priestschurchleadership politicians who exploit those beliefs it makes sense that people want answers to some of lifes tougher questions like what is the point in even existing and i understand that religion provides easy answers to those people but i just feel like i am living a much more rewarding fulfilling and enjoyable existence after taking the time to not only find out what tough questions i have about life and then finding my own answers to those questions if i could sum up religion it would be a tool to placate the masses religion to me in a nutshell dont worry about the staggering inequality massive injustices war and outright bullshit in this life it doesnt matter anyways just keep tithing of your income paying your taxes and bending over and taking it because in the next life youll be first isnt that great nothing in the universe currently matters other than believing in a fictional deity because that deity will deliver you into paradise if you believe in him and dont cause too much trouble questioning the order of things in this existence what dont question the fact that the vatican acts like a strange nationstate and has the highest concentration of wealth on the planet its uh for charity and stuff beggars like to see their godking pope on a gold throne encrusted with the most expensive gemstones in huge vaulted chambers filled with expensive furniture and overt displays of wealth why was this priest transferred to your parish it certainly wasnt because he was raping children i can tell you that
books,removed,i have plenty of examples of why im right you have plenty of examples of why your right and were not going to listen to each other actually between the two of us we have neither we are all just monkeys walking upright arguing about things that may or may not have happened thousands of years ago there is no right or wrong just varying degrees of evidence that can be used to support a subjective opinion i mean i am not really listening to anyone on reddit but thats just because i dont use a text to speech feature and instead read peoples comments i also wouldnt call myself militant or an athiest ive always seen it to be a bit silly how desperate people are to label themselves so they can be defined by their membership to a group or ideology im not really outraged at all i just find it hilarious that some people believe that an all powerful deity created the universe for a race of monkeys to exist on one planet constantly worship him and that he wrote a book years ago that is infallible really trying to walk the fine line between being a smug smartass playing devils advocate and not ending up on riamverysmart

books,removed,interesting i didnt know pynchon shared my interest in barriers my paranoid suspicion of walls the very fact that we feel ourselves born into a world of walls and learn of the dangers behind them is immensely suspicious considering the history of oblivion prior i can see now how the disjointed expose in mason dixon could be an expression of dismay over the death of ideals by talking about dividing lines barriers and so forth one can also be talking about the world of effects and therefore domination unpeace anyway once i got the hang of the book it wasnt bad

books,removed,really he gets saved by gandalf the first time with the trolls saved by gandalf again the second time but falls and has to save himself from gollum saves them himself from the spiders and again from the wood elves then smaug is killed by archers from lake town and its not even as if the black arrow was an ex machine because its just the last arrow he uses that is special but doesnt have any special powers that actually differentiate it from a normal arrow i will admit that bard is a bit jarring because hes never introduced previously as well as the sudden appearance of beorne during the battle of the armies but in general i dont think the ex machina problem really happens much in the hobbit

books,removed,well youve clearly displayed your complete lack of knowledge regarding the japanese literary scene to start with the domestic awards hes won are some of the most coveted japanese literary awards that exist and have been won by kenzaburo oe japans last nobel winner and nearly every other highly regarded author being an outsider means nothing oe was an outsider he writes prose based on british and french literature and actively tried not to use japanese influences he still won a nobel the other international literature awards hes won are nearly all major awards that past nobel winners have won prior to recovering their nobels hes such an outsider considering his books sell millions of copies the first week of their release solely in japan that makes sense you sound like a butthurt crybaby and your attempts to compare japanese literature to anime is laughably stupid

books,removed,i am sure iranians appreciate your kind words when i left my original comment i just meant to give an inside view of iran and didnt intend to get into debates and clash of civilizations however since similar comments like yours came up few times i feel obliged to write something in response first of all because of all the cultural barriers which make it hard for different nationalities to understand each other i ask you to not take my comment personally when i refer to you i mean metaphorical you as a westerner who lives in the us or uk or similar places i know it is a generalization but so is your comment that being said i could give you different answers for example one version of my answer would tell you the reason iranians are not free is because westerners uk and us staged a coup which overturned the democratic government of mossadegh then westerners for many years supported the despotic regime of shah to ensure the stable cheap flow of oil and then remind you that shah under your protection created a brutal security apparatus which purged any moderate opposition and left only the hardcore islamists as the viable alternative to its regime the very same group which is currently ruling iran and iran wasnt the only country where westerners screwed for many years they wereare supporting backward dictators who guaranteed their supply of oil and ignored israels apartheid and occupation in return these regimes got to do whatever they wanted with their dissidents while westerners turned a blind eye and that is how middleeast is in the mess which you see these days so you can drive that oil guzzling suv with the us flag on its top and enjoy your freedom of course that would make you a culprit too with the west being a democracy which makes their people responsible for the governments they choose and their actions but by giving that answer i would have felt lowering myself to your level of ignorance you know that same level of ignorance which thinks iranians are not free because people cant drink in public or the same level of ignorance which created vietnam iraq and syrias fiascoes my second version of answer could be asking you if you are really free yourself can a country so consumed with hatred racism and misogyny which chooses a candidate like trump even be free are you free because you can go out drinking and carry a gun and shoot your neighbor because you just feel threatened and stand your ground are you free because your boss pushed you so hard and made your life so miserable that you conned your fellow countryman and robbed his livelihood and created the market crash or the wells fargo scam so you can spend more money on food women booze and drugs are you free because you can lie and wage war on innocent people and kill them in hundreds of thousand and face no accountability then another version of my answer could be asking you if you were always free didnt your founding fathers risk their lives for you to be free didnt their freedom start the moment that they dismissed the rein of the king and dared to entertain the image of a free world created based on their own dreams and ideals that freedom of thought was essential to eventually create the free world funny that the irans medieval regime can recognize that freedom and arrest a writer even before she can publish her work but you coming from the free world fail to recognize that freedom so please next time you casually commenting on a post about another nation like you are commenting on a cat picture and belittling and dismissing their struggle for freedom which has been accompanied by giving their blood and risking their lives first look into the mirror and ask yourself am i free myself how much of responsibility i bear for the misery of other people who i am dismissing their efforts and remember that it is because of the bravery the same people that you get to have a stable free life the same people who resisted another ruling regime similar to taliban or north korea and fought that by giving their lives otherwise what you had right now was not just an isis but possibly oil fields burning all over the middle east and iranian people achieved this freedom against one of the most brutal regimes and also douchebag superpowers such as your very government which imposed on them coups wars and sanctions just to fulfill shortsighted politicoeconomical gains

books,removed,agree with the comments above about winston being brokenindoctrinated might be reading too much into the book but i also think partly to show the might of big brothera totalitarian state orwell refutes the idea or cliche that love conquers all the scene where winston parts from julia and they become separated by a crowd of people is dripping in pathos but in a sentence orwell demonstrates that big brother destroyscontrols everything and every aspect of human relationships including love and including winston its very difficult to understand an ending when what you expect to happen doesnt happen this is a spoiler but at the end of moby dick i was honestly expecting ahab to finally defeat the great white whale i was very disappointed

books,removed,there was a time when my mother a devout christian who relied on the church for spiritual and physical comfort we have always poor ‚Äì i come from a long line of terrible drunks and substance abusers was convinced that i was a homosexual she had caught me behind the elementary school after hours studying the long furred shaft of a stray rottweiler the kids all named rottie he certainly looked the part with his terrible case of fleas and lice and patches of his black fur already missing it was one of those hot days in early spring that put summer on your mind and the dog lay there panting on its back too tired and brainaddled im sure by the various diseases that plagued his poor soul to disturb my efforts to stimulate it and thats how my mother found me vigorously stroking the great furry thing with great gusto she understandably screamed at me in her confusion and disgust and ordered me to find my way to the church before confession hours ended largely i suspect because she was unsure of how to handle the situation herself so i fled crying in guilt and fear all the way to the small parish the great hall where mass was conducted on the weekly was empty and i wandered to the closest confession stall it was more like a small wooden locker with a small window that you could communicate with the priest with under the blessing of anonymity i took a seat on a really uncomfortable plastic purple cushion which i am convinced must have been manufactured by the same company that provides furniture for prisons and interrogation rooms i blinked a few times to get used to the dim lighting before explaining the entire shameful episode there was a pause and i was afraid and also a bit relieved at the thought that perhaps there wasnt even a priest on the other end and maybe it was okay to quietly make my escape and forget about the whole ordeal then a great gruff voice rang out from behind the curtain dashing my hopes and filling me with a wave of christian shame kneel gay man

books,removed,bizarrely fanatical neckbeards who are middleaged and still shit themselves like his books is the remark he should have made

books,removed,inspiring and eminently interesting story out of stars by katos revenge on june format paperback for those of us who are not in the banking industry and for me especially living in a country where the capital is the financial hub of the country perhaps the world you might think a story called my life as a banker would be too dry to enjoy author brenda mohammed has written quite a few books across different genres this book is a relatively quick read but readers can be taken along her lifes journey as they turn the pages i found myself more interested in the life worth living elements of the book i congratulate her hard work which allowed her to work in the banking industry and get promoted but i was more interested in the personal side of things for example how she met her husband thats an excellent segment of the book and also attaining her strict fathers support for the marriage the authors approach to writing this memoir is direct and therefore one imagines this is how she would speak in real life but the tale is told with such verve and energy it is an enjoyable book that people will find much to like the real life stories contained within are things we can all relate to things such as ending up in a great city like toronto but being sick at the time and told you shouldnt go out then but this is not the authors approach to life if you have read her travel memoir with pictures you will understand what an accomplished traveller this lady is theres some surprisingly gory scenes in the book tempered by some poignant sadness around certain family members as well as the central theme of how the author made her living in the banking sector its an interesting and very readable memoir from one of the more creative authors out there
books,removed,review by readers favorite retirement is fun a new chapter by brenda mohammed is an interesting memoir where the author shares with readers her moments after retirement and how it is a time when everyone should sit back and enjoy life after reading this book no one will dread retirement they will all look forward to it and use that time to enjoy the beauty of life spend more time with the family and experience their unconditional love retiring from the job does not mean one retires from life because one gets time to appreciate the beauty of unlimited time and use it effectively by doing things they missed out on doing while they were working the book is uplifting as it makes everyone who is going to retire look forward to it the authors experiences and adventures after retirement give readers ideas on how to handle their lives in a good and happy way after retiring from their jobs brenda mohammed shows by example how ones attitude can make a difference to everything and life can be enjoyed at any age irrespective of whether you are young or not the memoir is simple and chronicles the authors life and events taking readers into her space the memoir is a good read readers can connect well with what the author says and the events and experiences in her life and the way she handles life is tangible the words of wisdom from dr murdoch quoted at the end of the book are very inspirational and will help readers look at life in a positive way an interesting book for all those who are going to retire from their jobs and want to know how to handle life after that

books,removed,actually no i wasnt sensitive i just saw youre started to get riled up and i know that is the sign of a debate turning into an argument and nothing is learned from that also you are neglecting my point that i am differentiating between a company saying no we arent i treated in publishing this because we find it lacking in some regard and oh we changed our mind because mobs of people are protesting us because they do the like certain ideas being said and they want to stop us from letting them be heard you still havent addressed this distinguishment i am making also once again i didnt scold you i was explaining that youre getting gupset and riled up and thats not going to get us anywhere in a conversation and youre still riled up it seems because youre disregarding the fact that i am differentiating what is typical business practices and people petitioning a business not to let ideas be published and calling it idiotic when you are ignoring what im saying and calling my statements idiotic i cant help but feel like youre being very emotional in your argumentation trust me ill never be one to tell people not to be profane when im probably the most profane person youre gonna meet when it comes to casual conversation haha im just saying you seem like youre getting emotional and emotional argumentation just ends in stonewalling
books,removed,all of them
books,removed,hes just another typical leftist who cant see past his own extreme bias they are extremely common in reddit censorship is bad no matter if you lean left or right
books,removed,show me where i said being black is synonymous with being gifted i asked you if that was what you meant but even if i had stated thatdo explain how black excellence is racist against nonblack folks im not black and i applaud black excellence but let me guessyoure one of those white folks whose jimmies get real rustled when black people excel i cant fathom why else youd be saying such asinine trollish things go drink some water or something else productive have a good night
books,removed,they are trying to restrict the speech of someone they disagree with its the definition of censorship its just not government backed censorship if you had an ounce of intellectual honesty and were willing to look past your own biases you would admit this
books,removed,im stoked for oathbringer i juuuuust finished reading the previous two stormlight books back to back its going to be a long haul waiting for the rest of the series spoilers also hopefully without giving too much away to anyone who hasnt read it did the specific abilities that dalinar and renarin gained at the end feel kind of cheap i felt it undermined what shallan and especially kaladin struggled through
books,removed,dont talk about asian immigrants you clown firstly there are dozens of different countries in asia and asian immigrants from different countries have very different socioeconomic outcomes an immigrant from laos or cambodia is not in the same position as an immigrant from south korea and the stats strongly reflect that secondly a large number of asian immigrants are highly selected for their wealth and educational background as in it is mostly wealthy and educated asian people from asia who have the opportunity to immigrate in the first place that leads to more prosperous outcomes in later generations the parents equip the children with the tools to better succeed in the western society im vietnamese and the vietnamese situation is somewhat variable my parents even though they were refugees had a privileged background my maternal grandfather was an educated businessman my paternal grandfather was a university professor so even though they came to the west as teens not knowing any english they had that privileged background to help them in their high school studies and to find good jobs later on now my brother and i are doing quite well for ourselves i know other vietnamese people in very different situations who came as refugees too but their background was working class or peasants some of them were lucky enough to send their kids to college many werent and besides this doesnt account for the fact that even if you have a job and an education it doesnt mean youre doing fine either or are even moderately insulated from great risk upwards mobility is a joke only a tiny fraction of the population will ever become truly wealthy you also havent actually demonstrated that the stats posted below about how if youre born into a certain socioeconomic bracket youre very likely to stay there so what if some individuals can move up in general upwards mobility is unfounded most people are born poor will stay poor and will die poor and thats the way the capitalists like it the fucked up part is cretins like yourself buy into it as this vonnegut quote shows refrigerators are you shitting me the scores of homeless folks i see almost every day dont have refrigerators so i dont know how you can boldly claim the poorest in america live like kings no they dont and just a generation ago what the flying fuck theyve had widely accessible color tvs since the mid which is way longer than one generation also access to color tvs is really inconsequential
books,removed,aggggh punctuation
books,removed,yes kill the first amendment burn the books censor the heretics
books,removed,my first reaction to your comment is semantic nitpicking it sounds as if you are lost in the rhetoric of the quote and overlooking the meaning behind the specific words he chose to illustrate his point to me it is you who sounds cynical about their pecerption of life how is the quote simplistic how is it cynical my second reaction or rather my response is yes the words of the quote are ironic but is the meaning behind those words potentially id argue no vonneguets use of americans as a placeholder for observations of poor american culture is evident by his narration of events creative writing is not about dictating everything as specifically as possible but as a vehicle for meaningmaking tldr you sound like youre focusing on what he said and not what he meant and by doing so come off like a pseudointellectual douche
books,removed,i believe vonneguets observation is directed towards you
books,removed,in what way is it different nobody owes you a platform you can still express yourself in other ways pretending that taking away someones platform is silencing them is simply nonsense no it wouldnt because i wouldnt be halting the publication do you really not see a difference there no there is absolutely no difference whatsoever you do not have a right to a platform to speak from period not being denied having a platform removed im happy to discuss the differences but either you need a lot of evidence as to why its denied rather than removed otherwise youre going to have to convince me why having a platform removed is not the same as being silenced because they are literally different things you do not have a right to a platform you still retain all the same rights you did before and you can still spread your views any number of other ways he can selfpublish he can tell anyone he likes he has zero rights whatsoever to the use of anyone elses platform however you mean like the difference between refusing to publish someone and authors with no contact trying to swing their might to stop someone from being published youre right thats quite a difference those authors are absolutely in their rights to refuse to work with a company who does business with someone they find hateful and bigoted yes are you under the insane delusion that a publisher has a right to demand they keep working for it thats ridiculously ignorant
books,removed,nope its still monetary to me i never said he was owed a book deal i objected to the authors saying that the publisher should cancel their offer because they didnt like him if you think this can be described as they dont like him youre ignoring the reality of the situation regardless those authors are in their rights no matter what you think cancelling is not the same as not offering you dont seem to acknowledge that difference no there isnt a difference here youre pretending that matters but youre wrong it doesnt i have no problem if they never offered him a deal what i have a problem with is third parties saying that because of his political beliefs that he deserves to be silenced hes not being silenced hes losing a book deal it happens all the time for a huge range of reasons youre half right he has been given the megaphone now a third party is trying to take it away im not cool with that its still not his megaphone you dont have a right to use things that arent yours most people learn that by kindergarten i see youre still having difficulty with the concept the good news is that if he has an advance hes going to keep it regardless of what the authors say which means hes likely to still get published or they will eat the loss which isnt that much to the company and move on without giving a platform to a racist bigot ah heres the heart of the matter it goes against the principles of freedom of expression lets say you get hired for a company then a coworker you never speak to finds your political opinion and demands you be fired or they and all their friends will leave is that right i dont think so do you thats not even remotely comparable private political beliefs are in no way comparable to someone who works as a political commentator who is being hired specifically to talk about their political views again you cant seem to make even remotely similar comparisons without massive errors you literally do not understand what freedom of expression or human rights even mean the authors found his political views distasteful and demanded they cancel his contract thats what i find to go against the principle of freedom of expression he doesnt have the right to publish through any given company but i also dont think the other authors have the right to ruin his livelihood and business dealings based on the fact that they dont like his politics again that is utterly ignorant and wrong anyone has a right to boycott anyone they arent slandering him or lying they are simply refusing to do business with the company that is giving him money your understanding of rights is utterly ignorant and wrong he has no right to a publishing contract that is not in question by anyone with the slightest understanding of the issues and pretending otherwise is simply an error on your part

books,removed,if you like science fiction id recommend paolo bacigaupis books namely pump six shipbreaker and the drowned cities these books build incredibly realistic future worlds and focus on the disastrous effects of human advancement and ideas
books,removed,are you a selfmade multimillionaire if not then youre clearly an idiot and we shouldnt listen to your opinion
books,removed,wow this comment is as pretentious as you can get i suppose every person who wants to make a statement on americans should do polling on the million inhabitants before speaking what type of literature do you enjoy reading ledgers and account books
books,removed,jesus the fedoras really fucking came out hard for this and for all your talk about generalizing truth science you literally provide none of your own making your own comment just as the one you try to detract from reddit is fucking funny af
books,removed,jesus fucking christ cant you people give it a rest why does everything need to be bitching about politics i dont give a fuck who you voted for i dont give a fuck what sociopolitical system you prefer i dont care how much you pretend to know about economics i come to the books subreddit for books and talking about books if i wanted ignorant political discussion based on obscure quotes from dead writers i would go to rquotes and add to their circlejerk
books,removed,so whats the point in carrying on because politics keeps getting worse and worse weve now elected a regressive sexual predator moron and the other half was revealed to care so little for the people that they had their presidential candidate chosen before a single vote was cast in the primaries complete crock of shit
books,removed,you should ask for a refund for your ba in marketing it doesnt seem to have worked
books,removed,what a fuckin moron america is the best place on earthto be poor or to make a fortune

books,removed,am i really about to have to unsub from rbooks too man fuck reddit get your shit together and keep the politics out of this nobody cares about your fucking circlejerk
books,removed,if your coworkers decided that you couldnt work at the same company because you were a nazi and told him that trans people should get fired im sure it would be a different story

books,removed,the lefts policies are actually designed to help the underprivileged the lefts policies are actually designed to make it look like they help the underprivileged ftfy
books,removed,asians are more successful than whites across the board so how come nobodys talking about asian privilege
books,removed,i wouldnt call things that affect large groups of people in how they live their every day life irrelevant its still relevant just not as much as the patriot act citizens united the coming destruction of net neutrality the economic and cultural imperialist agenda insane gerrymandering yellow journalism and many others that dont have a directly noticeable affect on our day to day lives and it all starts in our schools we rewrite history to remove references to the playbook being used to subdue us no one learns about the robber barons in school anymore you know the same guys with their names plastered all over our present day corporations wouldnt want to showcase the blatant connection between the demons of our past and present
books,removed,the systems of this country were designed by the white man for the white man its only been the last out of years that this has not been the case all things being equal it is still better to be a poor white person than a poor black person especially where you have contact with the system which when you are poor requires lot of systemic contact
books,removed,lol well pittsburgh is the paris of appalachia have you actually spent any time in eastern ky or west virginia because for the last years ive used a week of vacation time to volunteer in the poorest parts of the region i dont consider myself qualified to speak on many things but the plight of the poor in appalachia is sure as hell one of them id rather be a hillbilly than whatever the fuck you are
books,removed,youre the only one not sucking on the writers dick for white guilt so i like you fuck this author
books,removed,we can you cant
books,removed,you know whats wrong with you td sycophants besides the annoying impotent shitposting youre hung up on working against the other side of the aisle instead of with them obstructionist to the core putting the liberals in generally the same threat category as isis that kind of thinkings as regressive as the left trying their best to undermine the incoming administration before it even has a chance
books,removed,k
books,removed,thats not white privilege its an anecdote about racist individuals do you need me to link you the video about the white torture victim kidnapped by black youths
books,removed,comments tldr true equality means giving people i agree with special privileges freedom of expression means giving rightwingers special opportunities to talk above other people if private entities deny this to them it is oppression and furthermore when liberals voice dissent about something they are not exercising freedom of expression they are actually censoring those poor oppressed rightwingers
books,removed,lol so if we meet in the middle we get eddie munster httpiimgurcomthwxmjpg

books,removed,no what it is there are two windows and they use social issues to divide ppl while fucking everyone over behind the scenes ive spent countless hours researching every political and economic theory and incan definitively say that unless youre very wealthy being conservative is going against your own self interests
books,removed,nope not at all the fault lies with the american people choosing to be dumb ignorant fucks on both sides
books,removed,hence the birth of milo yiannopolous just noam chomsky pretending to be conservative to break the system w controversy dont feel bad it took me forever to see it too hes a liberal hes just cleansing liberalism slowly of its extreme sjw psychos
books,removed,heres the subtlety of my point that i dont think youre recognizing i am not denying that any of these results that you talk about occur all of what you say about policy being influenced disproportionately by the wealthy policy being tried to get pushed through against the whims of the people etc does happen but what i am trying to say is that the motivation for these things can not be contributed to an organized effort by all wealthy people to keep the poorer people held down instead i am arguing that the motivation is to continue becoming more wealthy i think theres an important difference there
books,removed,i would say mic drop if of the natives hadnt died accidentally from small pox and of the europeans being chill and nice to natives yes columbus and andrew jackson happened but its sad all of western immigration gets a bad name for a couple admittedly war crimey assholes its like blaming modern americans for henry kissinger we want to sodomize him to death as much as the rest of the world

books,removed,actually we hear way too often about these people because they tend to be paid shills you know real science by exxon even better that real science by reynolds tobacco
books,removed,he posts in the donald good luck
books,removed,i rephrased the argument to highlight the fact that it is not a very effective counterpoint if you want something else note the fact the the end consumer is not being allowed to make the choice to buy the book or not it is a group of people with political interests right or wrong leveraging a decision with their economic sway thats not just how the free market works thats a lot closer to how an oligarchy functions than you seem to realize disagree well then theres probably core beliefs at work here in the argument that are not going to be solved in reddit posts so well leave it at that i dont lose and i dont win either the fact that you feel the need to tag along and tell me as much only reveals that youre a petulant child probably conceived with a weak sperm i think if you were pulled apart by horses and strung up dangling by your viscera for the entire town to see the world would be a better more productive place get fucked
books,removed,not sure about the rules of social justice but they certainly arent worthy of compassion or help according to the gop bootstraps etc

books,removed,normally but thats a liberal
books,removed,also sjws are not limited to liberals bible thumpers could easily fill this definition as well

books,removed,sjws may barely exist but they seem to control a lot of college campuses and media newsrooms
books,removed,do you really think that white people vote republican because black people are democrats like thats actually why you think they do that

books,removed,i gave them a very close look you should too but dont stop there he acted as a fraud i dont know your political affiliation nor do i care about it but i do know that you appear to be intellectually lazy and prone to believe bullshit as the saying goes you are entitled to your opinion but not to your own facts at the moment you seem to be based on a different planet enjoy

books,removed,no they didnt they approved a choice choosing and approving a choice are two different things when you choose something you look at all the options and decide the best when you approve a choice you say thats good enough i guess just because they dont know the exact name of the font doesnt mean they didnt know exactly what it would like prior to tattooing uhhhhh no fucking shit dumbass but that doesnt mean there isnt a font that they would have liked more had they seen it

books,removed,for whom the bell tollsfarewell to arms spoilers im of two minds about the way bell tolls ends i mean yes the tragedy that we all knew was coming showed up just on time he lived his lifetime in three days etc etc what kills me is he dies believing wholeheartedly in this romantic heroic sacrifice believing hes done his work and is likely quite thrilled that the rest of his merry band can continue on having completed the mission but just outside his point of view we see the attack is an undignified failure from the word go so many sacrifices were made for just no reason whatsoever in the end and robert jordan dies completely ignorant of that a farewell to arms ends with a meaningless death but at least our protagonist is in on it we feel that pain together we search for meaning together and come up with nothing and walk home in the rain together for whom the bell tolls never lets jordan in on the narrative he dies alone in the woods never knowing that the whole bridge operation was pointless and the life he actually wanted was just within his grasp he dies in ignorance alone and we watch his tragedy with its full context alone thats what started really getting to me the third or fourth time through i think the way that farewells ending is written makes it hit a lot harder but in a weird kinda meta sense for whom the bell tolls feels worse sometimes

books,removed,at some point there was going to be a black or woman librarian since they get extra priority in the hiring process yeah
books,removed,exactly and then maybe we can actually elect a president who has a brain and is competent maybe like a college professor or intellectual who is one of us it would even be better if they were relatively young and maybe like a person of color why cant we have a president like that its if we can just elect that kind of person weld finally get all our good ideas implemented and weld get these awful white men who never did anything for america out of power for good
books,removed,im really confused how she is the first woman to take on the job media has always instilled the sexy librarian trope on me and by media i mean porn
books,removed,certificate with an orangutan on it ok just because half of the white male in public service have been replaced by lightskinned black women with short hair doesnt mean we have to be racist now if we can just get hillary elected so we can replace the other half of white men in public service with lesbians in pantsuits

books,removed,this is the kind of book for dummies who think mtv is still cool to watchwho love realty to shows of the lowest denominator and most scripted kind as does amy schumer who admits it to this dayyes she loves loves anything desperate house wives schumers comedy is simply for dumb downed folks in our society at a point she was like a breath of fresh air but by the time id heard her saying the same jokes over and over again and sounding more like sarah silverman or wendy liebman and god knows who else to the nth degree most of them in her biz and the joke stealing the more i could see aoh whats that word hack amy schumer has got to be the biggest comedic hack in us history yes even surpassing that mencia idiot at least hes sometimes funny in movies ill give him that as young as you are youre just unfortunately not like that good for you and this youre going to be like huh get out youre crazie true that but thats really besides the point this maidnotforyoucom and how amy hackmer treaded on me for almost two yearsfrom her stand up jokes at the apollo to her movie and now her book who am i no body no one near her industry butthe examples are too numerous to blame it on parallel thinking the apollo jokes by as and my similar sentiments are on my hashtag page on twitter ask yourself this if shes done this with just one person whos not even in the media biz how often does amy schumer hack of others seriously think about that ask yourself this as well but wait why would amy tread on the likes of you great question there is history between me and amy s and twitter read it for yourself you might be amazed but the hacking from my tweets arent a big deal the other stuff i wanna pummel her for regardless of how obnoxious and annoyingly bitter i sound imagine this happening to you your own book is a failure which is purely my fault in my case your book may even suck to most folks ditto that for me but imagine all the years and hours you put in writing and editing your book before shelling out thousands for editing and formatting it to be published only to be hacked by the likes of amy schumer now imagine whoring yourself to pay for all this okay that parts not really true if ever i see amy schumer in person i know that i will not only see red and not just a pig shaped unattractive woman trying to look hot i will probably see bars all over the place in jail or in prison if anything pray for me thanks for reading
books,removed,by a variety of reason you mean medicine nutrition and fitness right things money can buy or give you time to pursue
books,removed,ah reddit a website of nitpickers and pedants ill be sure to give myself lashes for the sin sir

books,removed,but wut abowt tha conneckshin between moola and educashin errybody hurr durr
books,removed,it costs time and nutrition and it required a level of discipline and motivation which are values that need to be instilled in you somehow thats not quite free
books,removed,related if you like metal at all blind guardian has a whole album about the silmarillion called nightfall in middleearth even if you dont like metal at all you should give this a listen if you like anything tolkien its easily blind guardians best work made with a clear love for the source material its powerful and sung with emotion which for me at least added new depth to characters of a story id read years before the silmarillion was always interesting to me as someone interested in mythology and world building but nightfall in middle earth is what made care about the characters in it
books,removed,really did you personally invent the concept of motivation or did it come from the culture media and people around you maybe some people have less of that culture or even none of it and thus have worse chances of internalising the idea of motivation
books,removed,did you personally invent the concept of motivation or did it come from the culture media and people around you maybe some people have less of that culture or even none of it and thus have worse chances of internalising the idea of motivation your statement that anyone can is true but it is also the case that out of everyone who should not everyone does clearly there is something preventing them from becoming athletes overnight
books,removed,if you are talking about the theory of drive reduction then in a way certain forms of motivation are natural however due to the fact that humans do not need to exercise to survive it seems as though something more is required yes humans are capable of exercise but they require sufficient activation energy to being the process evidently a large number of people lack this activation energy while others do not therefore some humans have the correct genetics and environment to give rise to an active lifestyle and others do not also no animals are not designed animals evolve to fill niches if an animal say no longer needs to exercise to reproduce at a similar rate to those that do the exercise will become nonselective and organisms may loose the ability you seem to think humans are magic beings with the potential to do whatever is in their best interests on a whim that is not the case otherwise people would be a lot less fun and do a lot more math and work people are not rational actors no man is an island
books,removed,i saw your indoctrination comment from years ago i want you to know that i think youre an idiot
books,removed,im not offended because i dont lack motivation and im fit as fuck but its not a mental disorder as per the dsmiv and you have provided no argument or evidence to back your claim

books,removed,i know this might be a rarity on the internet but if you carefully reread my comment youll see that its composed completely of personal opinions and observations and never once asserts anything is superior to anything else if you could reword your comment to reflect that you have a different perspective to mine it would be more in line with a polite discussion where we share different views if instead you want to argue whether or not my opinion is valid fuck off
books,removed,lol you done wasting you time on a post you think is dumb or you wanna keep going
books,removed,i love when people get all pretentious and misspell there
books,removed,reminds me of the interview in the where all the reporters are treating him like a deity or something the album cover where youre sitting on the steps whats it mean means i was sitting on the steps i paraphrased that but it was basically that
books,removed,yeah i a republican hate everything he stands for but i have to say i admire his class
books,removed,i would have preferred less bob dylan quotes and more change like he promised
books,removed,hell im a conservative who hates of the affordable care act and has serious concerns about his stance on gun control but id reelect him in a heartbeat over the current options from the republican and democratic parties
books,removed,well if you dont understand something maybe it isnt fair to criticize it alas this is the internet but youre still missing my point even if youve listened to him and he didnt do much for you the point is that he influenced all music what your favorite jimi hendrix song its probably huh well thats actually a bob dylan song you probably really enjoyed the classic song huh its a bob dylan song you probably love that huh its bob dylan and that is why he is deserving of a nobel prize in literature he is responsible for so many songs that helped shape the careers of so many musicians music that didnt just settle in and influence a single generation but multiple generations through covers recuts and revisions
books,removed,he has become one of the greater presidents we have had
books,removed,srs thought they were lovers for a bit ha

books,removed,many of the books in the bible especially in the old testament are structured the easiest example is the book of leviticus which is insanely boring but also fascinating the structure goes like this ch ritual sacrifices ch ritual feasts ch the ordainment of priests ch qualifications of priesthood ch ritual purity ch moral purity ch the day of atonement or the most important day of the jewish year ch the day of atonement or the most important day of the jewish year ch the day of atonement or the most important day of the jewish year the three parallel topics of the book sacrificesfeasts priests and purity bracket the most important day of the year remember it is a book of laws and regulations this may be a small detail but to me the beauty is in the details as far as the new testament goes my favorite is finding the authors purpose for the book johns gospel being largely focused on the theological context of christ being my favorite example
books,removed,i really enjoy this

books,removed,religion is both a free personal manifestation of belief and a tool used by the political players to further their goals i would say the personal manifestation is what most people would call spirituality ala what sam harris discusses in his book waking up attacking a religion is different than attacking an individual who happens to be religious i dont think hitchens ever attacked individuals unless they had it coming hitchens attacked mother teresa and catholicism the institutions and the people who support those power structures not the common people being exploited by them
books,removed,religion is a system where old creation myths are forced upon the public as law in order to manipulate idiots in the pursuit of power not saying all believers are idiots but that is the primary goal ignoring this these creation myths are so blatantly made up stories that it is anti intellectualism to treat them as facts if i have to explain why creation campfire tales which differ based on not only culture but time period as well are in fact stories written by peoplethen you are beyond help you will spend the rest of your life fully indoctrinated shoving said indoctrination down your kids throats continuing the cult and further damning humanity by adding yet another group of fucking morons that will slow progress congrats that is your legacy well done old boy

books,removed,this is one of my favorite books i have questions about the story ive been meaning to ask for a long time so if anyone has thoughts i would love to hear them is there an overall message to the book ive tried researching this but only seem to come up with totally unsatisfying answers claiming its just a big prounion piece which im pretty sure is incorrect and certainly isnt deep enough to explain keseys motivation spoiler whats with all the towns people losing their minds eg the guitarist who burns his hands on purpose is that just to show us how desperate they are all becoming with the stampers holding out on them big spoiler my understanding is that indian jenny is hanks real mother is there any particular significance to that we know lees mother was frail and overall a kind of weak person and hanks wife vivian if i remember correctly is very similar to lees mother so what does it mean to us that hanks mother was pretty much the opposite when hank is at his lowest point and starts saying to himself that the only real strength is pretend strength or something similar is that meant to be like an ultimate truth that he is facing or is it just another obstacle for him to overcome i realize there may not be clear answers to these questions but ive been wanting to hear some other interpretations ever since i read the book rambling a bit now but one more thought in the electric koolaid acid test by tom wolfe which is all about ken kesey sagn is described as something like a superhero story that hank is the hero who overcomes all his obstacles while everyone else is weak and uncertain this analysis which was probably based on something the author actually said is totally contradictory to the wikipedia analysis that claims the book is some kind of prounion statement so anyone want to clarify this for me

books,removed,no im going by the words you wrote after i essentially told you to pick your words more carefully accusing me of creating a strawman argument doesnt make it so any more than me accusing you of back pedaling would make it so the actual truth of the matter is far more likely to be that im just using your own language to fuck with you for being about as pissy as an infant after a nightmare
books,removed,could you point out where i said you did read the words carefully i dont mind waiting my point is that its not racist to associate that type of language with blacks i dont give a fuck what you wanna call it ive saved you the struggle of reading through too many of your own poor word choices by italicizing the part where you were pissy

books,removed,hi heres a summary of the term ad hominem httprationalwikiorgwikiargumentumadhominem from the latin to the person is an informal logical fallacy that occurs when someone attempts to refute an argument by attacking the source making it rather than the argument itself the fallacy is a subset of the httprationalwikiorgwikigeneticfallacy as it attacks the source of the argument which is irrelevant to to the truth or falsity of the argument an ad hominem should not be confused with an insult which attacks the person but does not seek to rebut the persons argument of note if the subject of discussion is whether somebody is credible eg believe x because i am y then it is not an ad hominem to criticize their qualifications

books,removed,i tried to read the haunted mesa recently by louis lamour after reading his excellent the walking drum it must not have had an editor the main character spends pages and pages inside his own head he repeats his own thoughts he walks from one place to another when the reader knows he actually needs to go to the damn haunted mesa the one on the cover but you get halfway through the book and hes still scared to go to the haunted mesa when hes not alone hes joined by cardboard secondary characters who disappear and reappear for no reason their half of the dialogue is written to sound a certain way an affect or an accent but instead comes off sounding like a baby so bad writing is a lot of things its really infinite

books,removed,i hate your discriminatory choice so i will act upon my discriminatory choice because discrimination is wrong stupidity in action you can write good books and still offer little in the way of personal achievement or general wisdom literature is plenty of such people and leguin is quite obviously one of them
books,removed,you know your use of the word propaganda in conjunction with feminist suggests an adversarial relationship yes because i dont agree nor do i like modern da third wave feminism especially not as someone who chooses to follow an egalitarian lifestyle but first thing first lets do away with your disingenuous nonsens i am talking about the modern day state of feminism which does constantly promote propaganda and since you dont seem to fully understand what the definition here it is information especially of a biased or misleading nature used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view yep sounds like third wave feminism in a nutshell i imagine you dont have a very easy time with the idea of men being rejected by women i dont care im subscribed to rneckbeards and rniceguys and i like making fun of the socially awkward dufuses as much as the next guy its an interesting hill to die ona historical curiosity representing the consistency of an authors outlook over several decades i would like to take a moment to thank for this comment off the top of my head pat cadigan octavia butler tanith lee nancy kress andre norton james tiptree jr aka alice bradley sheldon joanna russ anne mccaffrey connie willis marge piercy sheri tepper kate wilhelm catherine lucille moore joan d vinge yes shes vernors wife pamela sargent vonda mcintyre judith merril gwyneth jones and several dozen other women were either established or recognized as upandcoming science fiction authors by and most of the authors ive mentioned by name here have won nebula awards some have won hugo awards and several had written episodes of star trek doctor who and other popular science fiction tv shows by then as well oh yes the terrible horribly sexist industry that not only published women but awarded them this is obvious proof of sexism le guin doesnt have genitalia that you agree with is a bit beyond the pale for you you remember what i said about being disingenuous earlier or did you not read my comments about not caring about genitalia
books,removed,because women werent allowed to be published in the early century httpwwwthebookescapecomfeministahtml looks like that isnt true its not like agatha christie jane austin barbar cartland danielle steel were around right im completely on board with her statement well thank you for admitting youre a sexist marital rape wasnt a crime until because this is relevant to literature why but im glad you didnt care youre right i didnt because i judge people based on merit and not genitals unlike you
books,removed,these words that youve put in my mouth they taste awful oh please im sure youve had worse in your mouth when a group of people have been systematically been disadvantaged and prejudice still lingers on like a bad smell give me one example where this is true today when african americans were released from slavery did they suddenly start owning hotels holding political office or becoming president yes blacks could own their own businesses blacks actually owned slaves in the south during slavery too they became doctors like rebecca davis lee crumpler after the abolishment of slavery john stewert rock was admitted to the supreme court in and the first to be elected into public office was in years later president no but kennedy was the first irish and catholic to be elected president and that was hundreds of years of them being in the us so whats your point this is why affirmative actions exists sure back when there were actual laws of racism in the books now not so much i would suggest that instead of scifi you concentrate on reading history a little more you do not want to get in a history debate with me you will not win
books,removed,i am so sure you actually give a shit about male rape victims and arent just using them as a way to score points vs feminists since youre so concerned about not giving anyone special treatment doesnt the fact that men were allowed to rape their wives mean you have to be okay with wives being allowed to rape their husbands
books,removed,your comment is so disingenuous
books,removed,because men whos lives were destroyed by the accusation of rape has nothing to do with you claiming rape culture i would hate to live in your fantasy world
books,removed,im saying i dont agree with her decision she made a literary decision based on gender and not literature if i was asked to do a report on islam and i refused not because im agnostic but because im german then it would be equally unrelated literally have no idea what youre saying here there is evidence she made it about gender im saying that having all authors be male is not sexism you have both basis at all except speculation i have the letter which is about gender where is your evidence it wasnt about gender before this i comment because i disagree with why she did it again i have no nfl experience but i can criticize coaching decisions the action not the person is under scrutiny and again youre basing your judgement of the action on your selfassessed ability to detect the existence of misogyny imagine for one second that there exists someone with the ability to detect misogyny more than you why do you feel le guin would not be such a person
books,removed,now thats not very nice mr rogers would be disappointed in you and youre the one that brought up rape culture not me
books,removed,anyone who uses the term mansplaining genuinely is a moron
books,removed,do you really think i care i had over replies am i going to keep track of every single one when im replying to people at the same time no and for the record you said i botched about down votes no i didnt i was pointing out that contradictory options were down voted to silence with no rebuttals now does this have anything to do with what i was originally talking about no
books,removed,um fellow redditoryou very original point was criticizing her for singling out one volume out of several of which the latter volumes subverted her assumptions on the exclusivity of male writers and locker room narratives only that was a critique on le guin and you did technically rant very quickly about the amount of feminist propagandists in this sub it was only then you started defending from people whowere probably just trying to point out a few things for you given your lack of accountability for your own past comments let us cease before you embarrass yourself further shall we
books,removed,you cant have anything to add to this conversation unless you agree with me because you were born with a dick ftfy seriously do all women agree with your opinion no are they mansplaining when they voice that opinion its almost as if sex isnt what determines the validity of an idea
books,removed,the feminists were the ones who demanded that the finances be cut in order to go to womens shelters of course being a sjw like trudeau you wouldnt have a problem catering to feminists
books,removed,mansplaining how to spot a sexist with a single word

books,removed,its a cookbook
books,removed,but theres no way of knowing your gender by text alone unless you either allude to being one or the other or straight up say it you say you act feminine here but honestly i cant tell how you comment from anyone else honestly its the internet just a decade ago forums like these were still something for nerdy guys old habits die hard and people arent going to treat each other any better on the net a hundred years from now than they do today worlds not gonna change to accomodate you so suck it up

books,removed,congratulations for the most pretentious comment ive read today
books,removed,what you say the term means vs how it gets used appear to be a little different also condescending is an adequate term making up the word mansplaining almost seems like a technique to introduce vague vocabulary that can then be equivocated

books,removed,perhaps you find classic literature to be dry archaic hard to follow crap because you are a stupid person who cant see the value in the classics im not being tongue in cheek or trolling you or acting a jerk who likes to vent his anger online but when millions of readers for millennia have found immense value in reading what you term archaic crap perhaps its time to recognize that youre the intellectually deficient one not the other way around maybe no one has ever told you that you received a poor education no one is driving the masses away from education educators and the educated simply realize that there is no point in getting kids to read if they never mature and move on to reading better books equating the garbage you read to the classics is counterproductive and needs to be put to bed

books,removed,
books,removed,well since we were discussing the opinion of rands work among philosophers and you said in a field that has thousand and thousands of prominent scholars i think i was pretty safe to assume you meant philosophers in particular and not scholars in general also one must take a work at least somewhat seriously to engage it in a journal article or textbook chapter or full length book i know that the general quality of these things have deteriorated of late but they still have a modicum of decorum when addressing something with which they disagree i dont know any publishers who would accept outright shitting on another writer as publishable scholarly work yes we know the presocratics believed some things that seem goofy by our standards today but we dont divorce them from their intellectual or historical context while writing an article or teaching a seminar and say hey can you believe that thales guy thought everything was water what a stupid asshole and settle down sweetheart i wasnt getting snarky with you you got snarky with me although now i am getting snarky with you because youre acting like a mewling little simp i dont buy for one second that youre in academia kiddo

books,removed,warning for onlookers lots of plot spoilers below i found the main character to be bland but i found the conceit of the book very intellectually satisfying and the mystery decently crafted id have like the city to have much more personal feeling and memory attached to it it seemed like the character only cared about things in the past that would make for good exposition about the city in the present the lack of any real personal dual experience of the dual city kind of made the book a bit cold for me its like writing about somebody living in berlin in the wall period who has no personal stories about the wall going up besides it making going to their favorite restaurant tricky i know the story is sort of about this detachment allowing the guy to become a secret police dude but i also have a running issue with mieville because nearly every book advances through some third party thing usually a monster obtruding into the characters life in such a way as to force an easily resolved conclusion beat the monster solve the mystery etc i think mieville is actually a pretty weak writer in the character department hes great with concepts and settings it frustrates me because i find all of his characters to be interesting conceptually but he never digs into them i want to chain him to a desk and force him to solve the characters problems using the resources in the characters life

books,removed,im not pretending thats not a very good argument i think ‚Äî saying people who dont care about what you look like are fakers do you not want a world where people just dont give a shit about your race or gender youre pushing the idea of that world as a bad thing by denying the capability of a human being to not be racist i dont give a flying fuck what you are if you write a good book ill read it if you make cool art ill look at it you are disconnected from reality if you think most people dont feel the same way most people arent bigoted it definitely isnt a progressive thing because that word doesnt at all describe what youre trying to do very well its a pc thing and it wouldve been very helpful for a great deal of people in the century i dont read for perspective i read for good reading i think thats how most nonpc people go about it

books,removed,we dont talk about that now hes funny and loveable cause hangover and his cartoon so its ok that he raped a bit here and there
books,removed,yes there is evidence that he didnt do it primarily a prior false rape claim by the victim desiree washington that the judge didnt allow as admissible in court the only evidence that he did do it was his dna on her which doesnt conflict with tysons account of a consensual encounter also the fact that he was a known thug

books,removed,wahabbi philosophy in theory is well but practicality is anything but for example they have a very strong belief system and anyone out of that system is not muslim well even their own scholars nowadays have different opinion on this belief system they say not to follow any imam but then turn around and take abdul wahab as their leader over better scholars they have turned almost all mosques into saudi satellites where following the actual sunnah is questioned and blind following of saudi is considered forward thinking what amazes me is that most of these blind followers are very educated bunch not just of the worldly education but also of religion

books,removed,ending spoilers for it novel im always torn on the ending the ending of their childhood storylines is one of the most beautiful things ive ever read when they pass the coke bottle between them and make their oath you feel the entire passage the beautiful background now free of the taint of it their friendship and camaraderie as they agree to go back into the hell whence they just departed if the need arises magic you feel magic but then they separate the mark of it drives them away only mike is left as the watchman they never hang out all of them together like that again since stan kills himself fine i accept that was its magic but then they kill it bill ben bev ritchie and mike go their separate ways again except benbev which makes the whole thing more confusing when people undergo trauma together endure wars together they bond in a way thats just permanent but magic causes mikes journals to disappear magic causes them to forget why ive never understood it could be their reward from the other it could be the lingering magic of it not actually killed just defeated on their plane i hate open ended questions it undermines the message and theme of the novel to me about the strength of friendship and solidarity

books,removed,the pain doesnt get better from something like that it just gets easier to deal with it never goes away and it shouldnt sorry to jump on what you said here i know you mean well and think you are being positive but it should fucking go away being unable to deal with life and drowning while everyone around you swims is cruel torturous tormenting and a terrible fucked up way to live it is exhausting beyond belief second guessing if what you are doing saying thinking is normal being unable to work provide for yourself and support others arguably yeah people learn to get on but it shouldnt be there no one needs that lesson to be reminded that youre a completely useless sack of shit to appreciate the good things it is an unfair state of mind to have and there is no fucking cure it gets easier in the sense that you have one other choice and that be death is that an easy way to fucking live tldr ops comment and thought process pissed me off though i respect his positivity and acknowledge his well meaning
books,removed,youve obviously never suffered from depression which is a disease and illness it makes someone with everything still feel completely terrible its not at all about your life or what you have or dont have i currently am living my dream and doing things i never thought i could but i still suffer from this major depression disorder so you can go fuck yourself you self righteous son of a bitch

books,removed,yeah go fuck yourself youve no right to be mad at anyone but yourself
books,removed,i always looked at it like if youre really about to kill yourself everything in the world is free ya know go rob a bank or rape a really hot lady if youre gonna put a bullet in your head minutes later
books,removed,that reminds me of the way you can kill yourself that makes it look like you pulled your own head off you super adhesive your hands to your head and make your noose out of a cheese cutter wire and then when you jump it severs your neck and looks like you just pulled your own head off
books,removed,id like to know what youre dealing with every day seriously because unless youre trapped in some type of void being repeatedly ass raped by a gorilla while being forced to watch the death of a loved one on repeat then i dont understand how what your dealing with is enough to commit suicide daily i would venture a guess that most likely you just suffer from chronic depression i doubt your life is so bad that you want to off yourself yes some people have horrible lives and surroundings but it is always possible to change your life it is possible its always possible first thing i would suggest trying is to manwoman the fuck up and change your environmentlife so you dont think suicide is a viable option get fucking real and do something to make your life better instead of sulking like a bitch about it if that isnt the case i would suggest getting on some depression medication you may just have a chemical imbalance if changing the bad things in your life doesnt help i would explore this option it isnt my first suggestion but it still helps people

books,removed,yes indeed but the fact that hamlet dies at the end of the play is a foregone conclusion the greeks believed that there were only two forms of literature comedy and tragedy the same is true of literature today most genre fiction is romance quest hero villain showdown victory and falls quite squarely into the box of the comedia spoiler the hobbits get the ring to mount doom harry potter vanquishes lord voldemort there will be sacrifices along the way hold the door anyone but the final outcome is not in doubt the sacrifices are always bittersweet and tell us something about the character of the hero and the importance of herhis quest i believe that plot twists are only useful for what they tell us about the larger goals of the narrative and they ought to be enjoyed as such but they need not be a surprise of course a truly unexpected twist is one of reading lifes little pleasures but the fetish of the spoiler has become a little much

books,removed,to puncturing smug privilege and maudlin victimhood the intellectual foundation of what you call maudlin victimhood is as such because it takes the triumphal supremacysmug privilege pose pretty clearly has a lot more of the power in society see the elevation of a misogynistic ethnonationalist to the president of the united states as such it makes perfect sense that critical social theory is necessarily oppositional and unaccomodating in nature theres an argument to be made that its less of the job of the people with less power to accomodate the intellectual worldview of those in power and more that those in power should recognize the concerns of those without power and accommodate themmoderation on both sides doesnt acknowledge the fundamental asymmetry in the ability of both sides to get what they want
books,removed,because he encouraged riots and he used his executive orders to do a shit ton of shady stuff also he had made both sides pretty pissed at him about a lot of stuff not the least of which was giving millions to terrorist states
books,removed,triggered
books,removed,he invited members of black lives matter to the white house and gives tons of speeches stirring people up about giant gaps in society that arent really there also a good example of him trying and sometimes succeeding to use his executive powers is trying to ban certain guns several times after congress has voted to stop him thats not democracy also his office is writing pardons for illegal immigrants that they have no idea who they are non stop even though your supposed to go through a democratic process hes very underhanded another example sending million in cash to iran and then lied about it and may i remind you he also did all this without permission from congress so yeah i dont know what approval ratings you are talking about but i wouldnt trust them havent you learned anything about polling agencys from this election they dont work

books,removed,why is it of the time i read a question like this on reddit it isnt because op is interested in listening to other people talk about insert subject here but because op wants an audience to listen to them talk about themselves clearly this asshole is more interested in telling you his story than he is listening to yours hey op fuck you and dont insult people by pretending to be interested in what they have to say if you want to talk about yourself just start a thread presented that way dishonest prick
books,removed,for me the clearest and most succinct example for obriens point came with this passage you can tell a true war story by the questions you ask somebody tells a story lets say and afterward you ask is it true and if the answer matters youve got your answer for example weve all heard this one four guys go down a trail a grenade sails out one guy jumps on it and takes the blast and saves his three buddies is it true the answer matters youd feel cheated if it never happened without the grounding reality its just a trite bit of puffery pure hollywood untrue in the way all such stories are untrue yet even if it did happen‚Äîand maybe it did anythings possible‚Äîeven then you know it cant be true because a true war story does not depend upon that kind of truth happeningness is irrelevant a thing may happen and be a total lie another thing may not happen and be truer than the truth for example four guys go down a trail a grenade sails out one guy jumps on it and takes the blast but its a killer grenade and everybody dies anyway before they die though one of the dead guys says the f you do that for and the jumper says story of my life man and the other guy starts to smile but hes dead thats a true story that never happened really is remarkable i havent read a tree grows in brooklyn but it sounds to me like obrien would agree with the main character over the teacher his intent is to capture the human experience encompassing both the beauty and the pain not to promote abstract ideals

books,removed,i hate this circle jerk yeah its a good idea but people need to stop acting like no one ever reads anymore its fuckin stupid
books,removed,the problem is many parents treat their kids badly around money by what i mean heres an example of me and my sister my sister spends any money she gets instantly thats why she is always broke and always needs money parents know that so they give her money regularly i dont spend money and can save up a lot sometimes not spending for weeks or months they know that so they dont give me money regularly and give less because they know i have more saved up than they have probably so i started wasting money on anything too and putting it into my debit card because they also kept stealing from me well they say they are borrowing but when i ask a month later the answer is usually you cheap ass we raised you for years and you want money from us then they give my sister a bunch of money again and if i spend bucks on a video game ill play for years they think im wasting money and that the bank will steal everything meanwhile my sister spent bucks going out in the past few days completely fine by them i cant wait to start earning my own money so i dont have to deal with this shit again hopefully i should get a job soon

books,removed,my source is all the people i know who picked english as their major because they thought it would be easy and had no actual interest in writing as a profession i have seen thousands of resumes submitted to me over the years when people apply for positions and i cannot think of a single person who majored in english that actually earned the degree to become a writer they earned it because they felt they needed to have a degree in something also back when i was in the army the two most common bachelor degrees people chose to get the promotion points necessary for nco ranks were english and business both were selected due to the belief they were the easiest degrees to obtain in order to get the promotion points a bachelor degree holds and compared to something like accounting environmental sciences or criminal justice administration english is most certainly an easier degree to earn most of the subject matter is actually covered by most middle and high school english programs so in many ways youre just retaking the same courses youve taken already also despite what you might think youre not clever by being a condescending fuck calling people dolls or asking for sources on an opinion that comes from personal experiences im writing an anecdote not an essay

books,removed,maybe you should read it again
books,removed,it was definitely the last wish im specifically talking about these two stories a grain of truth sort of like a twisted grimm fairy tale the casual misogynistic tone that this one took was pretty bothersome and geralts code isnt really making sense to me yet it seems to just be whatever the plot needs it to be he takes pity on a man who is turned into a monster by the priestess that he raped and then saves him from his new girlfriend who tada turns out to be a monster who is just using him for protection so far theres a theme of women being evil the lesser evil the monster that geralt has to kill in this one is literally just a woman trying to exact revenge on a wizard who conspired against her ruined her life and is responsible for her having to sell herself for food the wizard happens to be geralts sort of friend the wizard is also a real piece of shit geralt refuses to go up against him and instead tries to convince the woman to forgive this wizard because of this illusive code that he follows of course thats not happening so he has to kill her after he has sex with her of course oh but he feels really bad about it later so
books,removed,sorry its been a little bit since ive read it so im slightly fuzzy on the details why is giving someone an ultimatum worse than conspiring against someone and ruining their life
books,removed,gotcha thanks for explaining i didnt remember that as i said its been a while since i read it and couldnt remember the specific details that makes sense ps where did i say she wasnt a monster my specific problems with the stories are that most of the women in them are monsters
books,removed,how does the existence of one female monster constitute a theme of women being evil there are a lot more than one the monsters in the collection are disproportionately women geralt doesnt really have a code thats his character geralt bowed even lower your majesty you know our code of practice forbids us to speak of our work i wont kill him my code doesnt allow it he spends quite a lot of time talking about his code so yeah hes got a code im open to being totally wrong in my interpretation of the stories in fact i really hope that i am wrong and i still plan on reading the next ones because the worldbuilding was fantastic i dont mean to be harsh but youre mischaracterizing the book as a result of your own shallow reading youre right and i am wrong i am shallow
books,removed,thank you well he sounds like an idiot
books,removed,no it just shows that depictions of muhammad existed and were not destroyed when discovered by muslims at so me point muslims decided to start shooting western cartoonists who draw muhammad and that is a very recent development in fact you can walk into any library in the world pick up and history about or a biography of muhammad published more than years ago and you will likely find a drawing of muhammad any library good thing muslims are too stupid to visit libraries or we would have a lot more massacres going on

books,removed,or because the writing styles used by shakespeare straight up seem like different people writing it go read the merry wives of windsor and hamlet and tell me they were written by the same person spoiler alert they dont seem like the same author at all also your second point is that most of the plays were written by an assortment of writers wtf why are you using evidence that directly refutes the claim youre trying to make what kind of logic are you using wtf if almost every single play in that era was written by an assortment of writers wouldnt that mean that shakespeares plays were written by an assortment of writers hence him not being the sole author take that thumb and bite it

books,removed,appreciate the info chemistry has always fascinated me in that there are a seemingly infinite number of combinations something as small as whether its the levo or dextro isomer can be the difference between something incredibly toxicdangerous and something that is relatively safe like thalidomide one isomer caused babies to be born without armslegs and with other mutations but the other isomer was safe effective and was prescribed for morning sickness
books,removed,lots of people saying theyve never heard of this hitlers energetic speeches meth
books,removed,theres no credible unbiased evidence that deliberate killings on the scale described in todays books ever happened of course quite a few people of various background died in concentration camps from disease and famine when germany was lacking supplies even for its own army evidence for a genocide are either from camp survivors biased or proven false like elie wiesel or forced confessions from nazi officials who were tortured to the point where theyd say anything
books,removed,juries also dont decide he did the crime but he should go free because i sympathize do you have any idea how the jury system works also claiming that empathy is somehow the cause of crime is moronic beyond reason

books,removed,to dovetail here a lot of what shakespeare wrote actually had phonetic puns that were relative to the time in which it was written hence a lot of the lost in translation effect when we read it in modern english the comedy he intended just isnt there

books,removed,yeah force an old man to fly halfway around the world to pick up a trophy from people who only gave it to him to get a free show thats so reasonable and youre totally not an entitled dick
books,removed,your right my logic is so flawed i forgot about how women had actually fought in every war and not just the recent one with an extremely low death toll how can you take a snapshot of the last years or so and then completely ignore how many men have died in combat i dont like war and i completely agree with the other stuff that you said but war doesnt harm women nearly as much as it does men i know men start wars and whatever but you cant say women see more negative impact from war statistically do you think poor people make up a greater percentage of the military than men do as to the comment that i mad to another commenter i was using intentionally provocative language to express a point men dont act the same around women that they are attracted to as they do around their male friends thanks for combing through my comments where i clearly said dont assume anything about my intentions and then immediately proceeding to do exactly that you dont know me but you have assumed that i am some uncivilized mysoginist loser you are so right about how much implicit bias i have i doubt that you could even say what my argument is because you so clearly see what i am saying as some weird dick measuring contest i dont dislike women in any way i dont think men have things worse in an absolute sense at all i dont really see what is controversial about anything i said but you decided to typecast me i love the fact that your reply to my comment about women have more value in society regardless of accomplishment was to say you probably dont even know any women because your a loser and i would never fuck someone like you you can say that wasnt the subtext but you and i both know it was you know nothing about me and you have decided that you are superior mentally morally and in terms of sexual value asserting that i would want to fuck you or that i would care about whether you would or not once again i dont know you you dont know me i could be a woman based on the info that i have presented in this thread keep in mind that i didnt say a single thing about you before you decided to attack me also i dont view women primarily as sex vessels but i do view women differently as a result of my sexual attraction to them if you said you didnt view menwomen differently depending on who you are attracted to then you are probably lying its not even a purely sexual thing the dynamic is just different in a bunch of ways
books,removed,millennials cant seem to get this fact through their snowflake heads

books,removed,lol oh it happened so gradually we never even noticed please believe me didnt notice them taking every jew that you knew and never seeing them again
books,removed,fuck you ill call it whatever i want
books,removed,i read the excerpt
books,removed,of course it is all i did was paraphrase a quote and critique it doesnt seem like a quality book to me based on that excerpt thats all
books,removed,why do people respond with this snarky tone its just annoying and reinforces the circlejerk
books,removed,i couldnt picture anyone else besides a man named milton writing a book like this
books,removed,what is the point in even saying that is it the expectation that we should feel pity an entire people tried to oppress the world with the idea that theirs was a superior race oh sorry that didnt work out for you better luck next time
books,removed,having spend time in berlin and learning about what happens there i am a little worried there country was decimated from a war that they propagated and were left broke our country isnt broke we have jobs and security no mass famine and no mass unemployment with that said there is a large part of our population that feels this is the case even though they are employed and well off enough to watch brietbart on tv screens or iphones while eating cheetos and coke plus we have a much larger education system then germany did it the and shit is gonna get a little fucked up but we still have large part of the population that is not ignorant
books,removed,lol its not goldhagen you cock
books,removed,im always proud of myself in uniform thank you
books,removed,you better put a book cover on that shit or else your gonna get that ass beat not by me but someone who likes to fight and hates nazis
books,removed,i had no bias but the narrative from this excerpt did that quote was a repetitive pattern throughout the excerpt not like hes listing facts just strung together words saying nothing substantial or concrete while pushing the sympathy card guess if i decide to not read one book that makes me ignorant unintelligent and uninformed ironic for someone to say that isnt it bless everyone in this thread who have such wide open perspectives lead me out of the cave
books,removed,its more of a paraphrase the actual posner wasnt too fond of douglas judge richard a posner who was a law clerk at the court during the latter part of douglass tenure characterized him as a bored distracted uncollegial irresponsible supreme court justice as well as rude icecold hottempered ungrateful foulmouthed selfabsorbed and so abusive in treatment of his staff to the point where his law clerks‚Äîwhom he described as the lowest form of human life‚Äîtook to calling him shithead behind his back posner asserts also that douglass judicial oeuvre is slipshod and slapdash
books,removed,hes a nazi look at his profile
books,removed,ach yeh need the wee free men yeh scunner
books,removed,i have owned this book for like five years and i always want to read it but i am extremely self conscious about reading it out in public because of the bright red cover and swastika on the front i keep thinking people will think it is some sort of nazi sympathizer book and judge me
books,removed,im not sure what the law blog is but richard posner is a judge on the seventh circuit hes one of if not the most famous judge not currently on the supreme court
books,removed,oh just that the author was diverting you from what was actually happening in germany during this time specifically regarding the mainstream german attitude and how much they knew if you were informed on this subject beyond what this book taught you then youd know that and i didnt divert myself i also made a serious response but it was a funny typo id suggest when people have different opinions then you that you dont jump to such ironic conclusions in the future its embarrassing
books,removed,you can always change dont give up
books,removed,its really scary how much germany was like the us is now makes me wonder how long it will be until america starts i feel like muslims will be in the same place as jews were doing history repeats itself and whatnot we live in scary times
books,removed,ha yeah but then that looks even more like i am hiding the fact that i am reading nazi propaganda i just wish i had a hardcover version where i could remove the jacket
books,removed,we dodged wwiii potentially a thermonuclear conflict we dodged the atom bomb you dumbass
books,removed,sounds a lot like the policies implemented by democrats
books,removed,ive been thinking similar thoughts the past week what would i do if america becomes the next nazi germany do i go out and fight and be killed and leave my family behind to face worse
books,removed,clinical studies have proven that only white males can be opressors
books,removed,i do hope you can see that this is very pertinent to the hillary clinton as well as everyone else who hated the so called other side and spewed absolute hate in their so called attempt to end hate this is an extension of the last few decades of purposeful installation of self hate and unwarranted guilt imposed by unscrupulous power mongers this was imposed on an entire generation they did not and do not even believe themselves and are using hate for gain which is morally reprehensible they call for tolerance but it is only okay if you accept and tolerate what they do they call for free speech but they only accept speech that they agree with they call for diversity in a veiled attempt to divide us into groups tribes and colors and they again do it for personal gain and political power they call for freedom of all but only so they can enslave thought and use it as a form of money to purchase votes the word they is necessary here and it is needed too much because of sponsored intentional division ushered in under the guise of national unity nazi germany was free it was free if you thought as those who were in power did it was free if you spoke against those who did not accept the nazi dream all speech in nazi germany was free as well as long as you spoke how they thought you should speak imagine people telling other people what words and titles are alright to utter it is still moving forward on all fronts does anyone really think the so called elite are done with this or are finished with their list of true news websites for example speech actions and even knowledge are being regulated and defined this is not about the dnc or the gop this is about power and money and all americans should be horrified
books,removed,no i agree with you fuck everything about sjws
books,removed,the law blog is his son
books,removed,you realise thats a lie right like the whole terrorist scare has been blown massively out of proportion specifically to distract people from governments passing shit like
books,removed,a government that wants to rule as they are now does everything in its power to keep the populace fat lazy and stupid thats why the sjw leftists had rfatpeoplehate banned and are trying to equate obesity with feminism
books,removed,are there any books written about the prewar nazi germany nor written by jews id like a more unbiased look at things
books,removed,indeed people will always use the its just a minority or it doesnt happen in real life silly as ways to do damage control but it is very very real to add to your comment it is not enough to belong to these groups you have to share their ideology too or your opinion will be invalidated too a woman that believes women can be sexist obviously internalized misogyny a nonwhite person thinking nonwhite people can be racist internalized racismuncle tom a gay person voting libertariangreen partyrepublican instead of democrat selfhating brainwashed a transgender person that sticks to medical definition of transgender instead of accepting fluidgenders truscum gatekeeper bigot you have to think like the group or you wont matter ironically its these people that cry fascism and bigotry
books,removed,ive never seen sjws defended on reddit outside of the safespace subreddits fuck sjws
books,removed,no snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible a fortune cookie i saw once
books,removed,trumps talking about registering all muslims and the existence of male counterpart to bitching is oppression lol
books,removed,wtf are you talking about talking shit about sjwednesday stuff is a safe bet it aint edgy and it pushes no envelopes
books,removed,because the powers that be learned something from the mistakes of hitler and goebbelsthey learned that it is a mistake to murder to gas to condemn their enemies that a much more successful strategy is to allow them to continue with the same legal rights as anyone else and instead of condemning them make fun of them marginalize them label them as pariahs as insane as weaklings as untouchables as clowns as climate deniers as homophobes as preppers as homeless or whatever
books,removed,sure but ethnic groups can be clustered using microsatellite markers by computers with nearly percent accuracy to say that it has no taxonomic significance just because a subspecies classification cannot be made is completely misleading in fact subspecies classification is so dubious in the first place that it is not even clear that humans would not have subspecies by dint of i political stuff because dass raycciss and ii the existence of clinal variation between groups would obviously just result in a biased break from zoological convention and would technically prohibit subspecies classification but is an arbitrary criterion that tells us nothing about the actual genetic variation within a species there are things that muddy the waters like individual crosscomparison between human populations but there are also successful discretizations of human groupings microsatellite and snp clustering proponents of the were all humanity viewpoint ignore the latter and focus on the former metric while rayccisss often only discuss the latter while not getting into the former in fact racedeniers mostly dont even use this evidence or clinal evidence and usually just kneejerk run to some wikipedia article that allows them to parrot lewontins irrelevant fallacy of muh withinbetween genetic variation
books,removed,nope it was intentional and also what i and the trump voters voted against hillary hitler
books,removed,ive never seen anyone defend sjws but ive seen loads of people defending people on the grounds that calling someone an sjw isnt always accurate its an important distinction i think
books,removed,i mean trump is a bitter pill to swallow but when you got a nasty cough you drink that fucking robitussin
books,removed,hitler did nothing wrong
books,removed,thats the burden of being a man women are children that never grow up if you spoil them they will become spoiled if you discipline them they will behave thats why husbanding is a verb racism is alive blacks hate whites and will kill them without provocation or hesitation if there is a chance they can get away with it i believe in discrimination not segregation just discrimination i choose to limit my interactions with african americans i know im still racist but i like to think im less racist i believe african americans should own their own businesses i believe whites should be able to deny service to blacks and vice versa its amazing how highly correlated td trp mgtow etc are
books,removed,milton mayer
books,removed,look up the beer hall putsch and you will understand
books,removed,books is pretty ok most political subs are sjw nightmares as well as movies and tv oddly enough askreddit is usually ok too
books,removed,that really depends on where you live and who you associate with i live in texas and although i am liberal my family is not i have dealt with some very extreme reactions to my sjwness it absolutely goes both ways further for the most part being sjwy typically just means trying to be inclusive and egalitarian the militant brand of sjw and feminism i have only encountered on the internet and even then its usually people using it to discredit feminism
books,removed,a thats not true the electoral college still needs to confirm the election bsoross moveon charity is sponsoring protests that serve to increase civil unrest he clearly doesnt think it is over cthe lefties are incredibly unhinged right now twitter is abuzz with assassination threats from the average joe to the ceo who knows what theyll try dwhat is wrong with what is
books,removed,the antisjw crowd are the new sjws thats the fucking irony
books,removed,i dont know in germany if you called hitler a fascist would anyone care since he was officially a fascist or if you were like that hitler what a great democratically elected and fair and balanced leader would you be shot for excessive sarcasm
books,removed,im not downvoting you but i do disagree with you wholeheartedly saying youre not a feminist means saying you dont want men and women to have equal rights that is socially reprehenisible now im assuming that you dont actually think men and women should be unequal so im guessing your feelings against feminism stem from the misguided notion that men and women already are equal or possibly the more absurd notion that men suffer from more political social or economic oppression than women i am a man and i fully realize that for the entire history of the united states men have controlled power politically socially and economically the same way that whites have over blacks i could provide ample evidence and gladly will if you were interested including but not limited to the research regarding the likelihood for men and women to be hired the likelihood for a man to get a raise the number of men in powerful positions etc honestly anyone who believes that men are oppressed at the same level as women is delusional
books,removed,well i have not seen many black nazis around i suppose youre right
books,removed,as an affluent white male my song is sung in tears
books,removed,i how my closest friends and i can do this i socialist often have fun discussions with my libertarian friend we often find common ground and respect eachothers opinions i found it kinda funny how such vastly different people could get along whilst some of my liberal friends on facebook were literally calling eachother hitler for voting party instead of hillary
books,removed,a class on the history of nazi germany or a history class for nazis
books,removed,for years i only saw this attitude on the left from the sjw contingent ostracizing people with the wrong opinions boycotting companies when they stray from your accepted beliefs punishing those who disagree with you ie getting them fired silencing them taking them to court ruining their lives etc and mockinginsulting anyone with an opinion different now im starting to see the right begin using these tactics too and i think the reason is because they have been proven effective theyve worked for sjws so now everyone is beginning to coopt these tactics its much easier to rule someones opinion socially unacceptable and shame them than it is to try to change their mind through reason or discussion its really sad i was hoping that the sjw mentality would eventually be destroyed but i think its just spreading across the political spectrum now
books,removed,propaganda
books,removed,i can see youre very informed the true dystopian scale of what happened takes a while to write out and im drunk and sleepy so ill give you a shorthand version httpsenwikipediaorgwikirotherhamchildsexualexploitationscandal it was a muslim childrape gang in the uk that raped muslim childrape gangs in the uk are quite common httpenwikipediaorgwikirochdalesextraffickinggang httpenwikipediaorgwikiderbysexgang httpenwikipediaorgwikioxfordsexgang httpenwikipediaorgwikibristolsexgang httpenwikipediaorgwikitelfordsexgang httpenwikipediaorgwikipeterboroughsexabusecase httpenwikipediaorgwikirotherhamchildsexualexploitationscandal httpenwikipediaorgwikibanburysexgang httpenwikipediaorgwikiaylesburysexgang httpsenwikipediaorgwikikeighleysexgang but in this one the police refused to go after them because of the council being filled with leftists that were afraid that if they stopped the gang people would find out about it and start disliking muslims so they completely ignored it for years allowing children to be raped by hundreds of men and the families to be harassed in one case a little girl whod ran away was forced back because they beat her younger brother in two separate cases the fathers of children being raped were arrested for trying to stop it heres the police report if you want more details
books,removed,as nitefall dont come all at once neither does oppression in both instances there be a sorta dark time when everything remains pretty much the same and its in a sorta dark time that we all gotta be hella aware of change in the air ‚Äî however slite ‚Äî unless you wanna be the weak punk ass bitch of the dark billy o doug ass justice of the scrotus
books,removed,dont worry your safe only sheltered neckbeards use sjw as a slur to fight their imagined boogiemen i feel sorry for all the minorities that have actually been physically attacked lately
books,removed,its important to understand how a willingness to excuse or look past prejudice for either your benefit or your convenience is a truly dangerous characteristic for any society to have you have to be willing to stand up for the downtrodden and understand their struggleseven if their wellbeing has no impact on your life the jews were not downtrodden i would expect a history graduate to know such an important fact they were vastly overrepresented in politics media and the law that is one of the reasons no one bothered to stand up for them being told you need to stand up for the powerful sounds paradoxical to most people jews were a tiny minority who had inordinate influence over the german people and had a done a great deal of harm to the the german people thus the german people rightly had very little love for them history is often more complex than simply saying no one stood up for the little guy
books,removed,just another antigerman book for gentile dupes
books,removed,wew lad
books,removed,wow really just struck a heard chord with me on that last sentence i cant help but to think of the immigrants mainly mexicans and muslims here in america and how donald dump must be heavy on their minds forced deportations a registry these are the things that i said i didnt have to worry about but you my friend you just put something inside of me thanks

books,removed,everyone i dont like is hitler scaremongering still goes on and on now with tons of postelection salt
books,removed,meh im not too worried about it sjw bullshit aside alarmists have been saying the world would end during obamas presidency that he was the antichirst if the best they have for trump now is that he is hitler quite the downgrade from the antichrist then im not sweating it
books,removed,i do believe the patriot act was signed into law by george w bush a republican both sides are equally culpable as far as im concerned
books,removed,eh sounds idioticso now trump is a nazi because he opposes free trade give me a breakeveryone left of the bush administrationbill clinton is a nazi thenok
books,removed,propaganda can do wonders to a persons mind good thing we dont have to worry about propaganda anymore since we live in a free society with free press s
books,removed,do it anyway i do ive made enemies i dont care ive also made friends dont want to come off like i think im a badass im just a canadian who wont misrepresent my real views to suit received often wrong sometimes toxic opinion
books,removed,authoritarian citation needed and linking a fuck ton of liberal media blogs doesnt automatically make you right
books,removed,yes the left really is that bad
books,removed,the uk us canada australia new zealand and many other nations are involved in the single larges mass surveillance aparatus ever constructed and they have abused it and youre concerned about sjws theyre overly sensitive teens and young adults for the most part meanwhile there are laws which directly violate constitutional ammendments and charter rights in many countries in the first world journalists are being spied on and harrassed whistleblowers are going to prison i dislike the extreme political correctness that asserts listening to rap is appropriation of black culture and is therefore racist but these people are a laughing stock stop reading so much reddit and watching so much youtube these people are not some major force threatening your rights
books,removed,they thought they were tolerant would be a good one on modern campus cultureliberalism
books,removed,i believe racism exists and it sucks to be discriminated against but i dont see any racist laws on the horizon or any racist governance either anyone involved in anything like that would be instantly unelectable in my book
books,removed,dae trump is hitler xdd
books,removed,what substance do you want to be provided i live in la and this is absolutely true you cannot speak out in public if you share any beliefs with the right at all i encounter militant sjwness all the time living in la you are very clearly a secondclass citizen if you dont share their political beliefs
books,removed,so youre saying its either hitler or jews thats pretty fucked no german perspective otherwise
books,removed,oh really was it hyperbole when the mozilla ceo brendan eich had to resign when his peers found out he donated to a campaign that opposed the legalization of same sex marriage is it hyperbole that well known leaders in the tech community no longer associate or do business with peter thiel and actually called for his removal from the facebook board you obviously dont work in the bay area and if you do i am sure you are well within the echo chamber
books,removed,some muslim men raped some white women in england and fascists like this guy use it to whip up hatred of muslims if you read the accounts of the victims it is pretty clear the police were in on it but they sidestepped the blame by pointing at some admittedly disgusting councillors who whitewashed it because they were pc the other horrific thing is our govt reacted by saying they will fine social workers who fail to protect the victims which will drive the problem underground as the girls are having consensual sex but are about
books,removed,so obama settled a fraud case as president elect appointed racists to his transition team actually said hed enforce a registry of certain religions made actual racist statement during his campaign threatened the freedom of the press promoted violence at his rallies this is why we all feel sad for you and those like you youre so dedicated to your team you make these wildly false equivalences that fly in the face of facts
books,removed,uh bigots amirite guis
books,removed,i dont give a fuck if the man was racist in the past or even is racist now so long as he doesnt bring any of that to the law

books,removed,check your privilege literally means examine how your race sex class etc gives you unfair advantage over others simply because you are that thing and use that to level the playing field or speak out about injustices for those who you have privilege over not put on this badge and get on the train people take it very hard and very wrong whenever privilege is brought up they refuse to understand that it doesnt mean you havent had hardships in life just that youve never been systematically oppressed for things like being white male rich etc as it refers to american political and society
books,removed,you are correct ive watched friends be so indoctrinated that conversation is no longer possible because if you disagree then you are a racist pig especially if you call them on their hypocrisy especially if you try showing them that they are manipulating language to change the conversation but not addressing the huge holes in their logic on the other hand there are the extremes on the other side as well athiests that want to kill religion and dont see the good it does for some people attacks on people and death threats then everyone starts focusing on just the bad parts of each side and well we end up here

books,removed,absolutely not these things are all justified by the left nsa surveillance is done to keep women safe apparently so you are a sexist if you oppose it iraq is a war fought to support muslims but also somehow against sexist terrorists so it is a moral imperative to fight it corporate influence is considered a if it supports leftist ideals in fact many people ive encountered say that that is how you can pick out the good companies the ones who give money to democratic politicians if you criticize these things you are committing some form of oppression and absolutely must be a sexistmisogynist intolerant bigot its completely mindblowing by far the craziest to me is the way that literally everything democrat is tied to women somehowi dont even know how to respond to the people that tell me the nsa surveillance is great because it makes the world safer for women and anyone who opposes it is a clear misogynist

books,removed,deportations of illegals i personally think we should let anyone who wants to move here be granted citizenship but i understand that is a pretty extreme view deportation is one of the duties of the executive branch it isnt racist to enforce immigration law lastly im not sure what the ndaa has to do with being an inclusive society sounds like you are just grasping at any reason to hate the man and paint me as a hypocrite because i made some vague statements about taking a stand against racism
books,removed,well i see people on thedonald are starting starting to organize boycotts of companies report speech on fbtwitter and trying to affect peoples livelihood leaving poor reviews on yelpamazon for businesses and its those type of tactics that i dont agree with and ive been seeing comments about people choosing to stop hanging out with friends or speaking to colleagues because of their beliefs like thats a good thing and they get upvoted or scott adams saying anyone that would vote hillary is dead to him that would be all of my friends and family and theyre all good people i also have american friends on my fb and theyre all no matter what political persuasion sharing memes about how the other side is an idiot they have no respect for anyone that voted for soandso they will unfriend anyone who believes this etc etc i use to only see this crap from sjw types i agree its still much worse on the left but i used to only see it on the left too
books,removed,spoilers yes i understand thats what collins was going for no more gamessafe to have a family now but i felt all that character development made absolutely zero sense in the face of prims death literally the entire series and all the developments hinged of katnisss choices and her choices were driven by her desire to save prim the capitol is finally toppled in book but not only does collins go completely out of her way to show us through the coin is a bad guy subplot that the new world is not really less dangerous than the captiolcontrolled world but alos goes and kills off prim right at the end prim who katniss spent books trying to protect obviously its the authors choice but i felt pretty cheated at the end of that book theres no way after all that that katniss would realistically decide fuck it and just settle down with peeta who is still dangerously unstable and bring kids into the world that she has no guarantee of protecting

books,removed,thats just your subjective opinion and one that many dont agree with or would even respect so maybe dont spout it off like fact when truth is you probably just lack reading comprehension skills like most of the books detractors actively telling others not to try it is just a dick move trying to smugly keep people down

books,removed,how can you be so proud of ignorance and stupidity you just completely sailed by the many points he proved you wrong on and went straight to but but they showed a misleading picture of a crowd boohoo and you call sjws whiners youve done nothing but cry a panty twisted river since you got in the thread this is why america is fucked and why people are worried about trump as a tyrant because people like you that are happy to bury your own head in the sand repeated fox news talking points without a clue whether theyre true or not fingers firmly planted in your ears eyes tightly shut lalalaing your way through life i really dont understand being so proud of happily slurping down the bullshit youre being fed like he said there is no question trump himself or his sonssurrogates have admitted some of these things themselves on tape before it became more advantageous to deny and lie he told his own supporters he lied during the election and you people just dont care and you even keep believing the lies he just said he lied about i just dont understand oh well youre probably happier living in fantasy land delusional people usually are

books,removed,its on the front page because this site outside of td is a flood of liberal pussys suck a fat dick
books,removed,i genuinely dont care about roxane gay undermining her own career and viability as an author gay is far from a noteworthy champion of any lgbt egalitarian or even feminist cause she represents one voice among the cacophony of postmodern feminists who have gone so far as to question homosexuality among men as some complete rejection of the woman for crying out loud the woman is a postdoctoral in rhetoric and outright refers to the advice of medical professionals advising her to lose weight because of her health complications as evidence of fatphobia on a business note this is null and void gay is among very few professional writers to land the privilege of publishing with a national and international publisher she certainly doesnt have to use up resources that can be allocated toward a better performing more balanced and respectable body of work milo may not be the holy grail of balanced writing but he is a thought leader to far more people than gay could muster before her career ends and the worst thing about her attitude is that milo wins on these strategies his entire career is built on allowing other public figures to label him extreme and provoking go ahead gay youve served little more than to add another echo to the racket bouncing around progressive circles an isolationist attitude only begets further isolation and can i just touch on the idea of anyone labeling themselves bisexual engaging in predominately heterosexual relationships and calling themselves a part of or voice for lgbt fuck you fuck you fuck you
books,removed,that doesnt even make sense plenty of racists have sex with black people and other races they find subhuman it is actually a fetish for some white supremacists
books,removed,wow do you have a blog
books,removed,you didnt see a commercial for it while you were watching duck dynasty
books,removed,who is that also who gives a fuck
books,removed,the bits about choosing spinning and narrating facts has not been invented by the trump administration thats actually what people mean when they say politicians lie many times they lie with facts they present the convenient facts and insist that they are the essential facts clinton in this case the best go to for a comparison denied saying that she called black teenagers super predators and we have her on video saying that the media is not playing equal with the trump administration that it has with previous administration i dont actually think thats much of a problem but for those people frustrated by the medias pliability from earlier presidencies the blanket lies from the obama administration regarding the snowden disclosures for instance or the bush administrations iraq war propaganda see a complete with regard to the incoming trump administration i have to wonder if they will function as a willing propaganda tool for the trump administration like they have for other administrations in time say months out when trump is normal or when national ferver has to be stroked to get americans to support an illadvised and poorly conceived war eg dprk so yes everything youve said is right it just seems to me that the emphasis is misplaced and the context is distorted it would be wonderful if the media became and independent organization this administration and for the forseeable future unfortunately i already see them begging for access and being swung around by the actions of the executive office the pessimist in me sees this unique period of media nonparticipation lasting short of a year similar to the brief honeymoon the media had with the american people against the bush administration during hurricane katrina but then quickly reverted
books,removed,lol you can take one glance at her and know exactly what she writes about im not anti feminist or anything but its really weird that theres such a connection with being unnattractive and being a feminist i know they arent trying to fit a beauty standard save your flaming its just that i dont think it matters in most cases overweight andor ugly girls overwhelmingly make up the majority of the population of feminists thats why any hot girl that calls herself a feminist becomes famous on youtube its so ironic that the famous feminists all happen to be attractive name one that isnt anyways i know this shit will make some people mad just know that its only an observation

books,removed,why milo doesnt attempt to shut others down solely on their political beliefs thats the left also youre using the word nazi wrong nazis were socialists who believed the only way to achieve and hold power was to silence andor boycott those who did not agree with them also milo is jewish calling his supporters nazis is offensive
books,removed,its adorable you think milo is worse than progressives on twitter
books,removed,the irony of your words really is lost on you how unfortunate

books,removed,yeah this guy might not be able to make rent this month this guy is famous for being hateful how dare this author say to massive publisher i wont work with you because this guy does the fucking nerve of this persons principles the target of this action is the publisher which actually has some respect that it is in danger of losing not jack ass guy who will make money regardless
books,removed,i think its because a common tactic of the left is to instead of addressing points to just resort to calling someone homophobicracist and dismiss them after labeling them and they have one less tool in their arsenal against him as he is a gay man expressly into black dudes
books,removed,some people just dont like feminists saying that people are better dead than feminist is extreme but there are a large amount of people who arent willing to jump on the feminist bandwagon are you like a genuine putinpaid fucking puppet in rbooks theres no way a real human being just typed that without getting a headache from the cognitive dissonance and mental gymnastics required to stretch this straw man into a position where it even slightly resembles the original argument which it doesnt so lets recap just one more time to make this easier for the slower readers but there are a large amount of people who arent willing to jump on the feminist bandwagon so because some people disagree with the concept of feminism its ok to use your speech to incite actual violence and hatred against a section of people who do agree with it seriously so youre prohate speech and antifreedom and antiliberty because you cannot be profreedom and proliberty if you support speech that incites violence or the taking away of rights from others aka hate speech thanks for clearing that up i find somethings that feminists say to be hate speech but no one would dare silence them when they are yelling at the people who dont support their point of view you cannot possibly be serious not only is what youve said the actual opposite of reality but even if it were true and its obviously not you would never ever be able to prove it you might aswell have just mashed your face into the keyboard and claimed the resulting aghauighaog mess was a valid argument if this is the sort of point you construct people who allow themselves to be indoctrinated by people like milo most likely have their own point of view on the matter and are just searching for a voice that matches what they feel are you aware that if you have been indoctrinated then what you feel is not your own thoughts but whatever youve been brainwashed with i think the free speech issue here is that once you label something hate speech when do you stop easy as fuck free speech does not lead to real world negative consequences for a specific person or group of people just because you said something about them hate speech does free speech in my opinion nazis are scum and should be shot hate speech all rightwingers should be rounded up and shot hey you heres a gun theres some right wingers do you see the difference if you cant then theres no point in continuing this discussion if we always cater to the most sensitive person in the room when does it stop were not always catering to the most sensitive person in the room either you spend too much time on thedonald or or you talk to people that do and theyve lied to you
books,removed,youre a shit troll i didnt blame anyone for anything as im not so selfabsorbed as to think that the rest of the world has an obligation to act in a manner so as to make me happy that being said if you were to fuck right the fuck off thatd be swell
books,removed,eat my downvote your pathetic obvious straw man argument isnt worth a real response
books,removed,well those institutions always disappear it is a matter of intelligence and time mesopotamians romans etc all the time the same formula zoroaster jehovah muhammad mythras cthulhu etc it is a shame for human race to keep the sectarianism from those past experiences and traditions we humans are able to behave decent without a doubleedged weapon if not that would it be a trained mind those who defend this sects usually get money or power out of it not mentioning the control of mass populations using their fear and hopes to make them run against things or reject things im simply pointing out a fact the only testable and reproducible from this formula its power to disrupt minds and now i put down my fedora your move
books,removed,typical liberal yahoo not wanting to other peoples opinions
books,removed,dude half your posting history is either in rthedonald or trolling rhillaryclinton i think you know what all this fuss is about

books,removed,haha if she sold any books she never would of did it who is she anyway good excuse to pull her book for lack of sales yes
books,removed,certainly not but what gay is doing exemplifies the state of progressive social politics if you cant no platform them martyr yourself and thats what the linked article does its made roxane gay a martyr for social justice because poor overweight disadvantaged woman of color had to pull her book after her publisher decided to publish white nationalist supremacist rapepatriarchist colonialist mans hatefilled trash
books,removed,holy shit you read a book authored by that thing
books,removed,ok son you win no really please use neoliberal to refer to leftleaning people do it with your professors especially and in papers for school too youll teach all those idiots who thought they knew what the word meant for years make it your crusade do up some pamphlets picket political science conferences be the change you want to see
books,removed,so let me get this straight instead of allowing someones views to be seen and if bad thusly ignored critiqued and countered youd rather they be not allowed to speak at all nice oppression youre spreading there also hatespeech is such a lazy term that you want to silence a gay jew as milo is could be easily seen as hate speech i mean its literally what the nazis did right
books,removed,free speech is all speech not just speech you like snowflake
books,removed,
books,removed,so a guy saying he doesnt think someone is attractive is far worse than saying kill all white menpoliceetc your critical thinking is somewhat flawed also friendly reminder twitter still allows isis to use its platform wit h no real moderation to counter it
books,removed,well you and those authors are a load of bigots trying to supress a gay jews right to free speech but hey ho be a nazi if you want when it gets published you can all do a book burning if you want
books,removed,shes thinks its germany wants to stiffel this man from selling his book its sad when ya think about it she must of sold books so to save face blamed this guy
books,removed,roxanne gay spoke to buzzfeed lol did she get a commemorative framed snowflake as well the poor darling
books,removed,ok so youre a racist theres absolutely nothing you can do to prove me wrong on this as youre obviously just dating minorities to show face and dont you dare tell me you have black friends because how dare you use minorities as tokens oh youre a minority as well that makes it even worse how dare you fetishize your own status when other minorities are being oppressed similary your ideas are toxic and youre a fucking imbecile signed by a gay disabled white guy with serious mental and overall health conditions who mostly dated blacks and asians because hes such a massive racistwhite supremacist and loves oppressing them by being the submissive in all his relationships
books,removed,also gay read leader standing by upvoted all of you prepare for incoming downvotes over

books,removed,do you ever read this shit back and go wow that was lame or or what you didnt finish the sentence im all ears i was being very serious our side doesnt need to lie to win we told the truth and won the election because of it when someone outright talks bullshit they need to be called out for it even more so if theyre on my side
books,removed,bill burr i mean hes pretty centrist but because he calls out feminists and sjws for their bullshit divisiveness i guess that would make him a fascist to you condescending humorless people
books,removed,no one said its the government censoring him how thick are you
books,removed,im just saying what he says im not trying to defend it the person asked for some information about milo seems you have some personal issues calling his base trailer trash white people instead of resorting to name calling provide some sources of instances of when he was proven wrong and continued to push the alleged lie
books,removed,so fucking stupid doublethink much
books,removed,milo isnt a feminist that makes him a nazi s
books,removed,oh no some far ugly women pulled her book
books,removed,thats a lot of pretentious in one sentence
books,removed,bbut now the special snow flakes need an excuse to explain their own disconnection from reality how could this happen we must live in a dystopian magic land no if you followed the election this was coming exactly because people didnt see it this is what happens when you divide and ignore people they get angry and scared but at starbucks with your imac and latte sitting next to your gender studies textbook the rest of the world must seem strange and futuristic
books,removed,i know her personally she is fat and unpleasant
books,removed,oh youre the guy who invented a word and then was shocked no one knew the new word you invented you really speak inconvenient truths just like your guy milo so cool that youre not afraid to speak your mind your mind that makes up new words very exciting stuff

books,removed,quoted in case you try to delete it i find it genuinely staggering that antisjw fans of milo keep using his sexuality to somehow prove he cant be terrible isnt that literally what the right criticise sjws for for using minority labels as badges that shield you from criticism now all of a sudden its milos gay and he fucks black dudes so its scientifically impossible for him to be homophobic or racist like the actual words and views he expresses are washed away by his sexuality i find it genuinely disturbing that you were somehow capable of taking statement that milo is gay and translating that in your head to mean milos gay and he fucks black dudes so its scientifically impossible for him to be homophobic or racist he literally said nothing of the sort he mentioned it exactly once as a descriptor about the man because said man is a homosexual nowhere does he try to use it as a justification for anything you are raving at the man because of a strawman that you created are you so absorbed by your irrational hatred of milo that its making you hallucinate comments or are you so willfully delusional and rabidly fanatical that youll attack people for your own actions in either case you need to seek help your behavior is not healthy
books,removed,who are you calling alt right thats incredibly bigoted to assume that just because i dont know who about some feminist writer

books,removed,people under seem to yes i have faith that anyone reading farm as was said earlier this week will see huge parallels to the left in america and europe recently those books are basically the playbook of the left by nature this will not push them to the right at all but help them to grasp the huge skewing of facts and the endless gaslighting in the media the lefts identity politics shut down white people stances from the dnc are exactly what was referenced by some are more equal than others it is the ultimate aim of the left to push individualism on the population so they are easily penned off into their own realities where everyone in and the actual soviet union for that matter seemed to know what was going on but everyone seemed to think they were the only ones that had realised it
books,removed,cant get mad at obama that would be racist
books,removed,while i disagree with milos actions on twitter one thing he isnt accountable for is what his followers do and if he did harass her on twitter than i dont see what that has to do with this situation at all it doesnt challenge any argument ive made and id still stick by what i said as for the free market ya ummm i never argued that she shouldnt be able to do this she has the freedom of association im not arguing that she shouldnt be able to do what she is doing im arguing that she shouldnt do it there is a difference also when you start calling people dumbasses youre beginning be behave like a pedantic child if you want to continue im fine with that but youre going to need to start behaving like a mature adult

books,removed,as crazy as my interpretation may be i dont think that the book ban is the main point of that novel i think its a total play on governmental suppression of information and the phrase ignorance is bliss spoilers a nuke goes off at the end of the book and no one gave a fuck except our bookreading protagonist but most people were too busy watching tv media agenda bs and not educating themselves with books

books,removed,crude example for you shut up im going to reddit with myself and my friends and you are not allowed to respond or be on this platform anymore ok sorry for telling you to shut up but now imagine you are no longer to express your opinion here while i can keep expressing mine i really sure i would of just censored you censorship is a power in many forms to silence a dissenting opinion if you were in university in and believed in communism there was a series of enforcement not all from the government to achieve the objective of silencing your opinion if you dont like something dont read it no one is forcing you but dont think it is so wonderful to judge what others read and how they will consume it i dont care what you consume or how you get it im not the guardian of what you read
books,removed,so youre a dirty commie what type is irrelevant

books,removed,i wonder if any of the people picking this book up due to political events will notice that is about an oppressive government that controls every aspect of peoples lives and demands such compliance that you must love it not simply obey it and perhaps ask themselves how a guy advocating shrinking the government and arming the populace is comparable at all
books,removed,this matters now but wed have been much better off if it had mattered more for the last years of right wing alternative facts people climate change is real the food stamp program is not rife with fraud and abuse there is almost person vote fraud thats not what voter ids are designed to address social security is a benefit you pay for your entire professional life not a hand out faux news is not news and altright means white supremacists
books,removed,so the current administration pushes back against the glaringly obvious leftwing propaganda media and suddenly thats newspeak nevermind the nsa surveillance programs obama did nothing to stop nevermind the patriot act under bush nevermind the continual onslaught against capitalism from the left some wh press secretary makes a gaff about disputed reports of inauguration crowd size and now were in orwells get a grip people

books,removed,listen to everyone including people you disagree with makes no sense then how the shit are you supposed to gain any sort of empathy or understanding or middle ground maybe even look at how other people see the world other than yourself your statement that you shouldnt even listen to people you disagree with is ridiculous some people might rephrase that extremely narrow minded tactic as silencing the opposition a classic move amongst fascists and nazis triggered
books,removed,do you guys realize that we say the exact same thing about your side censoring hate speech you label everything you dont like as hate speech and ban it like pepe the frog and milo you dont even realize what you are doing i dont think you will figure it out until its too late you are on the losing side of a culture war

books,removed,um that was kinda obama too he admitted to watching tv the majority of the time and he was constantly saying issues within the administration he just found out about by watching tv i cant remember him talking about a book not saying it didnt happen but he was constantly going on about tv shows and sports
books,removed,dude youre trolling me by asking me why is similar to trump admin look up double speak his cabinet picks his authoritarian way how he uses straw man distractions in the face of implementing terrible policy stop trolling
books,removed,so we have media telling us to be selective with our sources and that anyone but them and a handful of others are alternative news but by saying this they are doing the exact same thing orwell warned us about lol the liberal media is trying to tell you and claim what news is factual and what is made uphow ironic
books,removed,do you need a safe space
books,removed,defined a person who is intolerant toward those holding different opinions roxane gay herself is a bigot she is utilizing intolerance this is why we cant have a conversation intolerance of bigots is not bigotry and as long as you fail to understand that theres no conversation to be had i bet you were real upset when nazi richard spencer got clocked too
books,removed,is hillarys favorite book you fucking stooges caught in left v right matrix good luck being a snowflake in the modern world
books,removed,i dont want to do business with someone who publishes feminist books and didnt publish with them nobody would be upset it doesnt happen it just doesnt thats the difference between todays right and left the left requires hegemony in discourse refusing to participate if dissenting views are expressed the right doesnt that makes the right intellectually superior to the left my point is its in a persons rights to not associate with ideologies they dont like are you morally obligated to stay on tumblr if its politics dont suit you no you arent obligated to support positions you dont agree with no youre not morally obligated to stay on tumblr but youre morally obligated to allow tumblr and alternative ideas to exist it is fascistic and despicable to attempt to censor opinions by banning them thats what the nazis did burned books and refused to allow open discoursesounds familiar to me
books,removed,look if you want to buy a bigots book go right ahead im not going to stop trump supporters from doing what they do

books,removed,im sorry to be the downer here but elie wiesel was most emphatically not a wonderful man he spent a tremendous amount of time being an apologist for some of the worst atrocities of the last fifty years see israels treatment of the palestinians unlike many other survivors he evidently did not learn the right lessons from the holocaust
books,removed,have you tried trolling on the internet
books,removed,its really not a good book youd be better off reading something like raul hillbergs classic study
books,removed,except for the fact that he was never imprisoned in auschwitz and just usurpated the identity of another guy sharing the same last name elie wiesel is a fraud and doesnt deserve any recognition shame on him
books,removed,in hell where he belongs
books,removed,certainly not forgotten hell be remembered as the hungarian jewish imposter who usurpated the identity of a legitimate prisoner who was also named wiesel then wrote a book about his fictionnal stay at auschwitz and won a nobel prize for it shame on him and shame on each and everyone of you backing him up seriously look it up if you dont believe me
books,removed,he wasnt nice at all he was a racist and rabid bigot against arabs and muslims he was nutcase zionist and he believed that jews were an exceptional race and had the right to commit genocide and kill arabs he made millions off the holocaust industry in the us while supporting war in the middle east for israel find a real hero
books,removed,look it up my ass i study the holocaust for my degree and can tell you first hand you are full of shit

books,removed,what can i say the kid loves shitheads
books,removed,i dont see anything inherently wrong with that i assume you see nothing wrong with the genocide of native americansor hitler wanting to keep his nation safe is it okay to excuse a genocide supporter when the people he is slaughtering are arab
books,removed,he was an apologist for other western atrocities as well see his support for the bombing of libya and the invasion of iraq
books,removed,hilberg is the preeminent holocaust historian wiesel was an apologist for western atrocities not much more to say im afraid
books,removed,yeah right whoever believes this story is a fucking idiot like a fucking year old would think of this on his own and in sure his allowance let him afford over hundred books this is so fucking stupid who would actually be dumb enough to believe this

books,removed,fuck social justice warriors
books,removed,im not the one comparing anyone to nazis he was the one who said hamas were nazis and if the vast majority of holocaust survivors are supporting the state of israel then frankly theyre perpetuating the exact same kinds of injustice they suffered palestinians are being beaten and tortured by the idf while zionist settlers raze their homes and force palestinians further and further into a smaller and smaller area while families can get no redress for their children spouses or parents being killed virtually every battle has been fought on palestinian ground as the idf continues to annex towns and villages as they work their way to the gaza strip a small territory bordering egypt and the mediterranean which has close to million inhabitants housing over palestinians per square kilomoter its the most densely packed region on the planet because the extremist minority zionists just started annexing palestinian land in the and then instead of intervening and stopping them the un just decided to divvy up palestinian land and establish israel the israelis now controls close to of palestine and live on stolen land that was taken from the native palestinians and since then the israeli government has denied the very existence of the palestinians a former prime minister even said that there were no such things as palestinians after they made three quarters of a million palestinians refugees and renamed every city river and hillock with a hebrew name hoping to eradicate any and all traces of palestinian culture in one of the worst instances of cultural imperialism in the history of the world now theyve established an ethnically preferential state the population used to be close to muslim and christian and now its almost entirely jewish where most arabic people are subjected to systemic racism and discrimination because of their skin color or religious beliefs men women and children are searched abused and tortured women in labor are prevented from reaching hospitals food and medicine are blocked from entering gaza and israeli forces daily invade injuring kidnapping and even killing inhabitants of palestine and it doesnt look like its going to get any better hamas is about as far as you can get from the nazis theyre not some aweinspiring superforce of evil hell bent on ruling the world theyre a group of oppressed people lashing out at those responsible for their systemic dehumanization and in elie wiesel along with a bunch of other jewish people posted an advertisement comparing them to the nazis which has been since denounced by over holocaust survivors and their descendents what israel is doing is more than just wrong its supremely fucked up its the only remaining apartheid state in the nation and it continues to illegally annex land from the palestinian people in hopes of causing violent revolt to legitimize their colonialism

books,removed,for me theres one clear winner the identity wars utopia is dystopia by jp tate which was published at the very end of last year the novel is a picture of what the future of western europe may turn out to be as a result of the politics of the last few decades its a whole new type of dystopian fiction it isnt the usual fighting zombies in a postapocalypse wasteland dystopian fantasy that has nothing to do with our real lives and it isnt an oldfashioned militaristic fascist state clich√© either instead it looks at where society is right now with all its divisions and conflicts and projects it forward twenty years into the future the characters are trapped within the societal upheaval of the demographic revolution of multiculturalism ie multiple cultures at variance with one another its a frightening yet plausible vision because its derived from the kind of society that we already live in its like watching the television news being broadcast from the year theres actually more in the book than i can say here for example it considers three very different concepts of manhoodmasculinity in three very different cultures namely the past the present and the future its fascinating stuff its my winner because its so original and relevant id never read anything like it before

books,removed,sorry for the rant but this is one thing ive been meaning to get off my chest i wrote about my experiences with book costs below if you want to read it the worst part about this is that all our profs require us to purchase digital access codes and the newest edition of all textbooks for many textbooks its the newest edition and you cant find it online or used personally i have really bad ocd and dont purchase used textbooks before you criticise me my ocd is honestly an illness that ive been trying to work on my family and i are also far far from rich but we find a way it kills me to see students who cant afford to make these purchases the fact that our school also has very little bursaries and scholarships but spends thousand to have rappers perform every year or spend millions on outrageous new buildings with our current buildings are filthy with broken chairs desk etc drives me insane sorry ill end my rant here i finally returned to school after many years about ten years ago our books never cost more than if that now for one class alone we have to purchase two books that come to over for one we only have to use one chapter for our paper and the information in it can be easily found online and on top of that we need to purchase digital access code and software thankfully i found a cheap version of spss for students best part about it our school doesnt give discounts for software besides office

books,removed,wow thats not condescending at all where to start the idea that ebooks are only available via subscription most retailers offer books on a perbook basis just like physical books as long as you have access to the free account you bought the books under and really do we expect amazon or apple to go under anytime soon you can get the books if you do something like kindle unlimiteds subscription service yeah you dont get to keep the books after you end your subscription likewise you dont get to keep the movies you watch on netflix after you stop paying them or keeping internet access after stopping payment to your isp or keeping your cable after you stop paying the advantage is that you dont have to buy each and every book whether you end up liking it or not its better for people who tend not to reread books as they dont need to keep the book after finishing the idea that people who subscribe to these services arent already aware that their access is dependent on paying the subscription based on your faulty ignorant statement id wager these subscribers youre talking about are much more familiar with how the services work than you do i get it ebooks are bad paper books are good never mind the fact that you can carry an entire library worth of books in a device that fits in a pocket and weighs about as much as a wallet or you know you can download one of the various smartphonetablet apps and access it on that device as well or that you can losewreck your device and not have to rebuy your books i like physical books and plan on having a dedicated library room filled with books when i retire but most of my reading the last few years has been digital

books,removed,internet and mass media have a huge breadth and depth think about most uneducated individuals who only you facebook internet and watch fox news or cnn you think these are well informed constituents that therefore we have healthy politics which should most certainly be placed in quotations you say that we are politically active and politically informed if you would have read you would remember the ministry of information collecting all the information known privacy was impossible much like the nsa does today have you ever been to a rnc or dnc i know you are from the us it is quite obvious due to your bumptious rhetoric heinous hellish but hedonistic nay you will meet no one of that nature protesting the many ways this country infringes on the global efforts of the greater good in exchange for huge suvs cocacola cell phones as big as most of our intellect combined while we spiral towards the end of history in a must triumphant fashion continue with your nihilistic beliefs and you too shall suffer
books,removed,what the fuck is with this condescending passive aggression did you not read my first post where i said crime and punishment is my favourite novel of all time and that i love dostoyevskys works so in your view if i find one example of writing i dont think is particularly good im not intelligent enough to read similar works regardless of my already existing appreciation of them and by the way you keep making up words and attributing them to me i also never used the word drivel thats the word you used youve been completely unhelpful and frankly a bit of dick so yeah i would say ive appreciated your responses but i havent
books,removed,lol i am absolutely ambivalent towards apple as a corporation just because im calling you out on your bullshit doesnt mean im in bed with the thing you hate this is a standard publishing deal dude books have had promotional preview chapters in them before ebooks existed its only that with the existence of ebooks theres a lot more distribution channels than your average brickandmortar bookstore one of these channels happened to be apple and they apparently happened to use a different promo chapter thats not exclusive its free to read on grrms blog than others as i said in my original comment chances are grrm had very little to do to this blaming him for what is standard practice with big five publishers is insane there are better things to be salty over

books,removed,watch me whip is literally the worst song i have ever heard the song watch me whip is singlehandedly the worst song i have ever heard before you get all bent out of shape i do know that its not to be some intellectual masterpiece of modern art it is just factually a shitty song heres why repetition this song takes repetition to a level rivaled only by songs written for yearolds the singer repeats his name a full times before the third verse just in case you were wondering who wrote no vocalised the script put in front of him there were words in this song is nae a word scratch that i truly dont care of those words three variations now watch now watch me watch me represent words thats more than ‚Öì of the song for literally words and i didnt include the single mentions of the word me if we include ooh there are instances and bop there are instances which total we have out of words made up of words i think we get the picture on this simplicity the most complex word in this song is a tie between silento the vocalists not an artist in my opinion handle the word already which appears literally once and the word superman doing a quick tally that means that single word instances are syllables all the rest are or syllables the vocabulary is not strong with this one look at that my use of vocabulary beat out this song by whole syllables the culmination of the two previous points into the dumbing down of everyone who had the displeasure of hearing this song pretty selfexplanatory look i get that the writer wasnt going for a pulitzer or a grammy but a quick hit thatll be catchy and easy to remember fair enough except fuck you youre literally ruining music who am i to say what should and shouldnt be written an asshole thats who one who is procrastinating other important work basically by putting music out that has a grand total of about unique words youre contributing to the lowered standard of quality of music this is one step away from repeating one single word over and over for minutes straight which now that i think about it probably exists except that would have some comedic value at the very least this shit well its like a kindergartener took a crayon and drew a stickman poorly i might add that was subsequently put up in an art gallery real impressionable children will listen to this and think wow dad was wrong i can skate in life only knowing less than the bare minimum needed to be able to read see spot run which i never did because fuck books and education side note that interaction wouldnt have been possible outside the childs head since there are too many unique words used now put on your tinfoil hats because this is where i lose half of you with my bullshit songs like this promote the opposite of education like i said it devalues a halfway competent vocabulary in the name of catchiness and a cheap musical fix when you see what can be presumably defined as success ie having several hundred million views on youtube and countless other radio plays it sets a standard in young impressionable minds weve had many people trying to get past this dumbing down of society like krsone stevie wonder john lennon and many others no of course not all of their songs they were trying to create a more engaged people who reflect on the actual issues we face as a society instead of making up a cute little dance to go along with your shitty track as your brain melts from lack of use who is the target market for this song for all the reasons ive brought forth i believe the target market to be the typical vapid vacuous consumer that doesnt engage in critical thought related to anything more than whether the kardashians look better in blue or teal i realise that ive made a broad fairly baseless claim and yet im confident its pretty accurate songs like these placate the masses with their simplicity and safety you dont need to think you dont need to guess what its talking about you just need to follow these three easy steps and you too can conform to the newest dance craze independent thought is the antithesis of this track by listening to this you are using time that could be spent thinking of ways to better the citycountryworld you live in again i realise that not everyone wants to engage with the world like this but i will still stand by the claim that critical thought is better than being herded like a goddamn sheep by popmusic so what have we learned today well mostly that im way too mad about a song thats a given what i want to really stress is that this song is symptomatic of a larger issue at hand like the cia funneling crack into ghettos to me this type of music represents a concerted effort to quell independent thought ultimately its easier to listen to a catchy song with like words than to actually sit back and think about why everything is kind of messed up i really truly fucking despise this song

books,removed,you dont sound like you enjoy reading very much maybe start with garfield first before tackling something like the long walk which in my opinion could have been twice as long his inner dialouge is what makes the whole thing he humanizes all these kids instead of making them like robots there are some issues with it but not the ones you named try reading the running man its not like the movie
books,removed,suddenly i remember what its like to be enthralled by a book lol fuck off you pretentious asshole

books,removed,gatsby is one of my favorite stories of all time spoiler at the end when hes shot inby the pool at the very moment the phone rings is my favorite moment of dramatic irony obviously the reader knows that its nick calling to check on gatsby but gatsby believes that its daisy calling to tell him that she chose him and so even though hes dying he has that moment of peace where he feels like daisy does still truly love him which is also incredibly sad since its not true bad times great story though

books,removed,well compared to a lot of other ya fantasy i have read it is written far better the characters actions make sense for the most part and rather than just being a whinny teenage girl who gets thrown unwilling into the murderdome he is an angry teenage boy who is perfectly happy to be there that said the book goes through ya tropes like the author had a checklist kid has a hard life in an unjust world where the government oppresses some people for no real reason someone takes the kid to a better place and shows him that the government is oppressing his people for no real reason here the kid is usually sent to school or the murder dome kid is sent to murderschooldome to fight other children because flimsy reasons kid turns out to be the best at murder despite not killing many people kid gets a party to celebrate how awesome kid is at murder also romantic tension with some other characters end of book one
books,removed,mein kampf made me feel things naughty thing never have i been so aroused by a book before
books,removed,well i hope you enjoy them if you liked gatsby i personally would recommend things like httpwwwplanetebookcomebooksthestrangecaseofdrjekyllpdf any of edgar allan poes works especially httppoestoriescomreadamontillado and httppoestoriescomreadhouseofusher the phantom of the opera httpwwwplanetebookcomebooksfrankensteinpdf and if you wanna go really classic try william shakespeares hamlet i personally found this story too tragic for me but i think you might also enjoy and i could go on with this list lol but these are off the top of my head

books,removed,the book thief i was forced to read it and annotate the pages in my grade english class my teacher was insane about the holocaust so by the time this book had rolled around we had lectures upon lectures and books upon books about it and we were burnt out to be honest but it doesnt change the fact that this page book had full chapters of things that didnt matter the characters were completely unlikable and were constantly contradicting themselves spoiler alert then at the end almost everyone dies anyway to be honest if i didnt hate my teacher so much i may have not hated it so much but nonetheless i just absolutely hate that book
books,removed,best part of the book was when he spoiler angs himself in the end most interesting part of it all
books,removed,do not post shallow content im sorry but your post currently counts as shallow content do you have something else to say about the book that you could edit into the text preferably your own thoughts about the book or at the least a description of the book without spoilers let me know if you edit it i can reinstate your post
books,removed,that reminds me of innocent by dean koontz my mom recommended it to me i actually really liked about of the book and its premise basically from the moment this guy is born everyone gets the urge to hurt andor kill him the moment they see him he lives a solitary life separated from society until he has to help a woman escape from a man who is trying to murder her the twist is what really made me hate the book massive spoilers theres other people like the guy who people have the urge to kill the lady hes helping is one of them and its because theyre totally free of original sin and are marked by god to remind to reflect their sins back at them it also heavily implies that god didnt give a shit that this caused at least one person to be murdered and young children to get horrifically abused because of this mark which is a whole nother issue in the last pages it reveals a plague has started that will kill every human being except those who are pure in this way at the last possible second the protagonist and the lady get together and marry so they can have gratuitous sex for the purpose of procreation on the last pages
books,removed,also spoiler but the end of the book leaves off with the reader believing that they are siblings later in one of the sequels you find out they arent i looked it up out of curiosity
books,removed,fuck you i enjoyed those movies
books,removed,brave new world my opinion is in now way related to the ideas the book proposes judging it strictly as a novel it sucks the writing is terrible the thirdperson narration is full of the authors personal opinions and sarcasm spoiler alert the story does not develop at all one moment the main character is plucked out of his homeland and brought to this new place then he is in love with this girl and almost as as soon as we find that out he has a complete emotional breakdown because the girl is so willing to give it up and he would rather earn her affection it came out of nowhere and was hard to believe and honestly kind of silly then he goes off to a live on a deserted island and kills himself the end
books,removed,i read my sisters keeper for grade well yep it was about an ethical issue of the day medical emancipation and child with rare disease spoiler dunno if you care so one sister has disease needs kidney and younger sister has a kidney to donate except younger sister doesnt want to and sues actually revealed older sister told her to not give it and to instead sue except then younger sister gets hit by car and dies and then older sister gets kidney anyway what the fuck please
books,removed,there are cultures that are not all that well covered in the canon my condescending friend theres a woman in my grad program whose specialty is hemingway shes not funded you dont go to grad school if youre not funded when you go to get a job in the academic world not having funding looks really bad she wasnt funded because hemingway scholars are a dime a dozen its been done and our field is far more interested in looking at cultural objects that we had previously overlooked which is why we have people in our department publishing on comic books music videos africanamerican literature pornography video games and all sorts of other things i think i will take my direction from them and not some random snide redditor

books,removed,whiskey tanto foxtrot by an author whose name deserves to be forgotten first problem is it starts off really well huge it company has infiltrated everyones computers is listening and watching everything has evil intentions a small group gradually assembles to combat the it giant which is stationed on a ship if it was bad from the beginning i would have ditched it with very little time wasted three quarters were pretty good but then the plot unravelled and the book ends believe me you wont mind a spoiler with the group setting off towards the ship and then stops it is obviously setting the reader up for the next book in the series nevermind the money i paid for the book i still feel like sueing for a chunk of my life wasted i dont care if there is a second book i feel the author betrayed the trust of hisher readers with a dissatisfying ending another thing that annoyed me was that this was a book on a number of recommended lists not off a secondhand shelf i cant help wondering whether the places on those lists are bought

books,removed,it refers to thebmedia being sacks of shit and reporting printing absolute garbage in hopes that we the people are sheeple and go along with thier dimwitted schemes but fuck that we know the truth you bastards
books,removed,its incredibly posttruth to pretend this article isnt full of posttruth appealing to the emotions of people that the dwindling guardian readership simply because the newspaper backed the wrong horse in the two major political events of so now they are publishing stories about how the intelligentsia that make dictionaries even cant believe how crazy it was the guardian got it wrong
books,removed,posttruth is literally just politics lol people can blame it on trump if they want but hillary does the same shit every election an emotional appeal or belief is used instead of objective facts even to the point of using fake statistics with obama it was the etheral idea of change with no substance promises that never got delivered and the idea of just wanted a black president or a younger person just because half the reason bush got his second term was how he handled the terrorism which means nothing and it was possibly the most mishandled and damaging time in americas history

books,removed,
books,removed,this is a good point you can find some convincing supporting articles and statistics to make an argument for and against almost anything the black lives matter thing is a good example of this you can have a statistic say that a black male is more likely to be killed by police than a white male but that same statistic shows that roughly of police killings are against white males with the exact same statistic you can argue total opposite points of the argument and in theory you are both right but as my favorite pundit would say there is so much nuance to how a stat relates to the real world that it can only vaguely point you in the direction of a conclusion you must be a master over a stat and use it to inform your opinion not let a stat be a master over you and decide your opinion be qualitative look at the numbers on many angles and judge the context of the numbers
books,removed,i dont think theres a single person that believes climate change does not exist there is probably overwhelming consensus in that human beings contribute something to this the contention is how much some people believe whole heartedly humans are going to cause the atmosphere to flick into a runaway greenhouse situation other people believe we do not have statistically significant data to come to that conclusion one is demonized for merely questioning the validity of the theories claiming catastrophe is nigh

books,removed,posttruth has to do with people recognizing lies and it not mattering to them the president of the united states and the former secretary of state founded isis the terrorist group we are all terrified of never mind that isis was formed in the truth does not matter to voters so we are posttruth

books,removed,thing is those once trusted experts have proven themselves to be untrustworthy and misleading the age of leaks has completely subverted their authority and their answer to this is to shut down alternative media sources the recent google and facebook false news filter announcements and declare it treasonous to read the truths being leaked cnn saying its illegal to read wikileaks the established media are no better than those they villify they may even be worse because theyre still trusted by a lot of people and abuse that trust to fulfil their malicious agenda
books,removed,was right were already at newspeak doublethink incoming
books,removed,it should have been wrong or literally hitler or crooked or rigged
books,removed,a movie about college rape save me some time here is it a critical piece that presents the situation honestly or is it emotion porn that supports the idea that we live in a horrible world of rape and mayhem
books,removed,this literally describes the situation with muslims right now
books,removed,amazing liberals have been ignoring truth for years preferring feelings instead now that someone on the right wing has supposedly been successful by ignoring the truth the left is all butt hurt
books,removed,so basically sjws
books,removed,username checks out i luld
books,removed,usually when people who have never lost before or are generally butt hurt they try to intellectualize as a way of coping this is a way of saying everyone else is stupid
books,removed,yeah ive never herd that word in my life so because you are ignorant its not real
books,removed,what we feel is more important than what actually is said every liberal snowflake ever
books,removed,mooooooooo
books,removed,race is important to you on a subconscious level refusing to acknowledge that fact and work to counter it is racist
books,removed,phil ken sebben

books,removed,lefty propaganda lol god dam i fucking hate my party too many dumb fucks like you
books,removed,saying i think these things because im white is far more racist than me saying that race isnt important to me also i never claimed racism doesnt exist as i have seen it for myself i said that race is not important to me and that it shouldnt matter
books,removed,i see newspeak is already beginning read the thought police down with thoughtcrime annihilate doublespeak
books,removed,this plus liberal descriptivism is the beginning of the end soon we will only communicate across echo chamber forums and image sharers with a combination of dialectical memes leaving the robots and amish to inherit the earth while elon musk plays ping pong with himself on mars as in liberal use not liberal ideology

books,removed,populism is that theres an evil group of elites who mistreat the saintly public and that the public should just rise up and get rid of them posttruth is that you can win in politics despite not being able to state any facts by simply lying or broadly appealing to the emotions of your voters people dont listen beyond the first thing you say so you say something that validates their beliefs and opinions and they like you it doesnt matter then if the mass media then go on to break down what you said as being falsehoods or empty words because hearing it for the first time was enough for the voter
books,removed,hey you want to disregard facts and evidence based on your own feelings the news how can it be trusted they cant read my feelingssss
books,removed,riamverysmart
books,removed,huh ya and i am saying i am in agreement the wage gap persisting because of misogyny or sexism is a myth to comparisons show that
books,removed,folks decrying msm bias have a point but there needs to be distinctions made between bias shaping truth and fabricating truth for example the christian times newspaper ctn web site published an article reporting that tens of thousands of premarked ballots cast for hillary clinton and other democratic candidates had been discovered stored in an ohio warehouse httpwwwsnopescomclintonvotesfoundinwarehouse then theres the untrue headlines with semitruths below it
books,removed,just remember that when the opposite side reads your blogs they roll their eyes as well
books,removed,of course his model would be better than a single random poll of people the problem is relying on polls even when averaged to predict the outcome of the election nate silver has no clue what is going on and we shouldnt listen to a man who was a so utterly wrong about an election there is so much more that is going on then these shitty pollsters telling us what we are supposed to think this is why we are seeing twitter bans facebookgoogle working to shut out fake news and cnn and npr going into attack mode on any one who is against their narrative
books,removed,bob dylan has become a pretentious dickhead fuck him
books,removed,lol this is the type of problem that the article is trying to address oh my side is all about understanding but the other sides just a filled with hubris and malice give me a break think about how condescending it is that strangers in their own land reads like an update on some forgotten tribe it reads like some colonial missive updating the court on the curious culture of the local tribes the book itself is part of the problem why does the left need to understand rural america now on the other hand do you think rural americans through movies music television books are as out of touch with the left are there writers like coulter who cater explicitly to a conservative audiencem and litter their work with insults yeah duh just like the left has john stewart stephen colbert john oliver samantha bee theres a whole genre of television about being smug and contemptible to conservative americans and then acting like only the left is rational if you have any interest in understanding the right on an intellectual level you should look into reading ideas have consequences by richard weaver its the philosophy book that reinvigorated intellectual conservatism and started a chain of events that led to ronald reagan russell kirks the conservative mind is a history of conservative thinkers starting with edmund burke its super boring but again if youre really trying to understand conservative this will point you in the right direction
books,removed,youre famous and won an award so you must come accept it in person youre an asshole if you dont who cares if you do not like confrontations of any type with other people your logic
books,removed,a friend of mine got to go on your with her boyfriends band who was opening for dylan on tour she was backstage towards the end of the tour and dylan walked up to her while she was sitting on a couch and said hey she was all oh wow hello mr dylan bob goes so are you going to suck my cock she goes uhhhhh no he goes this will be your only chance he goes stupid bitch then he walks off yeah hes a real swell guy
books,removed,you entitled asshole he doesnt owe his fans anything
books,removed,dylans the definition of an iconoclast there wasnt a chance in hell he was going to personally accept a nobel prize dude gives approximately no fucks what us mortals are up to down here in the muck an mire plus he tours like incessantly its all he knows how to do all the people we used to know theyre an illusion to me now some are mathematicians some are carpenters wives dont know how it all got started i dont know what theyre doin with their lives but me im still on the road headin for another joint we always did feel the same we just saw it from a different point of view tangled up in blue

books,removed,who gives a flying fuck quit being such an egotistical asshole and accept the award or dont for fuck sake self important douchebag
books,removed,unlike trump who ran a fearmongering campaign and won this word doesnt reflect a single party it reflects reality
books,removed,i wonder if he feels horrible when he shills for that tech upstart

books,removed,you obama lovers will say anything to keep your hero worship image of him going just sad he inherited it like oh crap i have to use these drones to kill people since i inherited them i have to add drones and users to the program since i inherited them as far as nuclear disarmament goes he has literally done almost nothing except take us to the brink of a nuclear war with russia through is lack of statesmanship and clueless diplomacy skills literally one of the worst presidents ever if not the worst but hey hes black so give him a break right

books,removed,nice edit
books,removed,oh yes he gave himself the award its not like he volunteered himself they picked him he is a notorious recluse what did they expect that doesnt make him an asshole and its certainly not his fault he got the award in the first place youre a moron
books,removed,twat
books,removed,you sound butthurt because bieber did not get the award

books,removed,dark sense of humour is what i would call that not hate i know people who would definitely do this but they are not antisemitic at all
books,removed,i mean its totally ok if i leave this poster saying kill all the jews right its just some paper with ink on it because the book kinda says that
books,removed,this kid is literary hitler
books,removed,its been a while since i read it but spoiler doesnt the main characters demand for justice basically get shot down i thought it was a great ending
books,removed,exactly and at least hitler had a reason to kill the jews
books,removed,there is a radical part of the jewish population that use the holocaust to try to make every other race feel guilty just as black people try to make white people feel guilty about there skin colour when there is no reason for anyone to feel bad hitler was a madman as were many in history but some jews want to portray it like he was the worst which is nowhere near the truth also the holocaust makes some jewish people a hell of a lot of money from entrance fees to concentration camps they have rebuilt to many movies released almost every year about how bad the holocaust was trying to make people feel bad and support the jewish community sadly these propaganda issues and the actions of the israelis have resulted in many people actually hating the jewish population for no reason oh yes they killed jesus too
books,removed,but muh six gorrilion
books,removed,so what get over it you fucking jews no one cares anymore you wanna be victims like it affects you now go get cremated or something
books,removed,but i dont think the kid should get any flak for dressing up as his childhood hero regardless of who that is ehhhi would like to ask why hitler would be a childs hero truth be told httpswwwquoracomwhatdidhitlerdothatothersbenefitedfrom
books,removed,its because of the jewish media
books,removed,til
books,removed,despite the atrocities hitler committed none of which i deny he is the most modern example of a person with tremendous leadership skills that if nothing else can teach us that one person is capable of changing the course of history if presented and taught in the right way i personally have no problem with this and my grandfather fought the germans during wwii
books,removed,good hitler did nothing wrong
books,removed,its because jews are very very influential in america much more so than the victims of stalin and mao
books,removed,banned books share strong parallels with the banned comments and locked deleted threads we see so often on reddit for example the thread discussing the little boy who dressed up as hitler for book week which was just deleted a few minutes ago censoring these discussions is essentially the same thing internet mods who censor discussion will go down in history as the book burners of the new millennium
books,removed,becaful the mods will lock this down if it isnt about books fuckers
books,removed,so lupin was gay
books,removed,hides mein kampf at holocaust memorial
books,removed,woe was the daywoe was you on the day whoa was you the day you whoad
books,removed,spoiler alert
books,removed,whites can go brown from being tanned nonwhites never go white
books,removed,shes reaching real hard to try and get some praise for diversity after the fact because she knows she wrote some very white bread run of the mill books that werent really planned with diversity in mind just like how a lot of people head cannon hermione as black or mixed and she comes along years later like oh i could totally see that yeah she was def not white yall i just feel like if you want to write diverse characters than write diverse characters but claiming you were representing people after the fact is kind shady and also pretty lazy
books,removed,why stop there rowling why not make it a metaphor for rape as well
books,removed,does this mean fenrir greyback raped lavender brown
books,removed,stop doing this jackie
books,removed,say lupin had aids instead of werewolfism hes pretty much exactly as dangerous to the kids as he is in the novels not counting the rampage when he forgets his medication dont forget that lupin literally couldnt get a job and was almost homeless because of a disease that got raped into him against his will and that he has chance of passing to others in everyday life id say its a pretty good metaphor for hiv actually
books,removed,ze jews
books,removed,jk rowling needs to stop making up bullshit if she wanted hermione to be black dumbledore to be gay and lupin to have aids she should have put it in her fucking books when she wrote them jesus
books,removed,i actually think theres plenty of people who are fine light occult fiction but would not be ok with a gay character in their kids book not that my family is a bunch of bigots or anything but my grandparents are very religious and got me the prisoner of azkaban for my birthday one year which got me into the series would that have happened if they knew it from their church buddies as that book series with the gay schoolteacher who can say
books,removed,but saying that being a werewolf is equitable to aids is stupid since werewolf is one of the oldest fantasy tropes in history
books,removed,can black people
books,removed,i thought it was pretty obvious
books,removed,please grindelwald was behind hitler and the goblins are clearly jewish stereotypes
books,removed,except you have absolutely no basis for that whatever youre feeling outraged because you want to and youre wrong youre ignorant of the source material dumbledore was a lifelong bachelor and clearly had feelings for grindelwald the fact you feel that an offhand comment about an old boyfriend is necessary i mean christ are you twelve
books,removed,that is why he was so gay s
books,removed,people are getting way to butt hurt about this
books,removed,imagine that youre an artist on a team thats working on a huge monument that millions of people are going to enjoy you and your team finish this monument and people go nuts they love it youve changed their lives now imagine some other artist whos very wellknown but wasnt involved with your project claims that she helped with it that her work inspired your monument it didnt and you know that but shes getting credit for being involved thats how people who actually did things to advance gay rights feel about her jumping in with oh by the way it was never even hinted at in the books but dumbledore is totally gay shes jumping on these bandwagons after theyre already near the finish line taking no risk of backlash and reaping social justice points for it its lazy and dishonest im more slightly annoyed than anything but i understand if it inspires a bit of hatred
books,removed,yep and dumbledore is gay ect oh cute look how much a attention jk is getting such controversy much wow
books,removed,dont forget about hermione being black
books,removed,if werewolf was a metaphor for aids does that mean twilight is now a metaphor for slut having simultaneous sexual relationships with a hiv positive and a drug addict
books,removed,it was really really thinly veiled and obvious maybe because im gay and life with uncurable desease and shunning by society are close things to me while they are unknown to you im so poor world hates me you damn privileged asshole you know shit about him but you instantly assume that youre only one who has problems in life
books,removed,lol at the people in this thread saying they picked up on the metaphor when they were riamverysmart
books,removed,white people on tilt hahahah
books,removed,youre dumb lol valid interpretation of textual evidence called a werewolf was born normal but got bitten as a kid i guess getting bitten as a kid was also analogy for child rape too only in pain around full moons called a furry little problem by james potter is aids a little problem i dont see any valid interpretation of aids here you could say its any other disease literally just making shit up
books,removed,i dont know maybe because i read of the books when i was in grade ¬Ø„ÉÑ¬Ø
books,removed,i feel like im missing it but it doesnt seem like a really good metaphor for me i mean if you have aids you dont exactly go into episodes every month where you try and rape everyone you can there is a very real reason to be afraid of werewolves and a baseless paranoid reason to be afraid of someone with aids
books,removed,oh jeez this and the whole dumbledore secretly being gay even though the books and movies never confirmed it i love the harry potter universe but fuck off
books,removed,she did the same thing with the whole dumbledore is gay thing although shes the author i get the feeling a lot of these are things she made up after the fact its all publicity nonsense and as far as im concerned its all bullshit
books,removed,they really cant fully control themselves people seem to be forgetting this they typically dont have special potions to keep themselves under control and are known to be violent id say hes closer to a reformed pedophile in the stigma he receives
books,removed,i understand being annoyed at the dumbledore is gay thing but this is not an example of anything being inserted after fact lupin doesnt have aids all she said was that she wrote in a condition with societal stigma lycanthropy as a parallel to real world conditions with societal stigma and she used hivaids as an example she hasnt changed anything with this quote the title is just misleading
books,removed,no one gives a fuck what she intended it isnt up to her to decide how her characters should be interpreted also shes the worst on twitter and the analogies in her books are about as subtle as brick to the bollocks
books,removed,agree i consider it all irrelevant shit she said for publicity
books,removed,agreed i was just thinking how it could apply but i definitely dont think she meant it to apply to him he was just an asshole who loved hurting people i think the hivaids thing came to rowlings mind because at the time she was writing these she was seeing people experience that stigma and she drew on what she had seen
books,removed,am i wrong to have the impression that gay people seem to almost unanimously okay with dumbledores sexuality not being mentioned he was perfectly written in my opinion and i wouldnt have minded his sexuality being mentioned but if it wasnt such a hot topic right now then i would have absolutely no reason to think it should be she said it after so shes retconning to win points if shed written it in the books i gaurantee it would have feel contrived and forced because thats how little it matters to his character and wed have the same people complaining about that
books,removed,except he wasnt i think utobefituser is saying that we dont bother to mention when people are straight because thats weird so its more progressive for a fact like that to be a fact without mentioning it in the case of dumbledore i think jk did know the entire time that he was gay and that it was just background information for herself to draw upon and not relevant to the story just like someone being straight isnt necessarily relevant to the story so in that way even if she never told us hed still be gay consider the book saying he was gay and then everyone wondering if hes eyeing harry strangely nah best to leave that detail out but retconning did happen and they happened within the context of the story itself all the special magic shit that we see harry experience in the and book get revealed to be huge deals we find out at some point that there are magical artifacts given by death himself that started wizardry and harry happens to have one of them and uses it to sneak around the library and we dont see dumbledore even arch an eyebrow at that who should know how important it is he has another one also conveniently stuff like that deciding after the fact that even within the magical world hes still a unique snowflake parseltongue as another example suddenly a few books later is uncommon how she treats harry is pretty much summed up by his role in quiddich we have all these guys scoring points but they dont matter until you catch the golden snitch the game wont even end until you get it theyre not bonus points theyre mandatory points well waste our time and youll end the game and win regardless of our performance the bad game design becomes a metaphor for how she treats harry hes continually uniquely special and no one else matters
books,removed,i think taking credit for work she didnt do is what makes it lazy she didnt bother to write in an element of a story that she later claimed was there making the decision to keep his sexuality out of the writing is fine since as it stands it really had no impact one way or the other and chekhovs gun principle saves another writer from writing no problems there to then turn around years later however and say he was gay in what many including myself see simply as an act of pandering despite the fact that she didnt take the time to write anything about it into the series i believe constitutes being lazy instead of writing it in she just told us about it whether she expected credit for it or not its a pretty lazy move for an author to just throw something out there years later instead of working it in correctly
books,removed,people arent gay because you interpret them as being gay but characters are generally open to interpretation
books,removed,that particular lupin factoid was discussed by her even before the series was finished the dumbledoreisgay thing is the only thing i can think that came out after the books in any case it doesnt bother me it was a series intended for children and young adults she couldnt have been very heavy handed with the analogies
books,removed,ive stopped listening to her dumbledore being jammed in as gay was the last straw for me to care about her retrofitting her own stories
books,removed,instead she just makes stuff up after and collects approval point for being modern the vast majority of these are revealed because shes asked about it did dumbledore who believed in the prevailing power of love ever fall in love himself jkr my truthful answer to you i always thought of dumbledore as gay she also said if i had known this would have made you this happy i would have announced it years ago
books,removed,metaphor
books,removed,being a pedophile isnt a heinous crime acting on it is its a perfect comparison he has the ability and the desire to do harm but doesnt want to so he chemically castrates himself to prevent the transformation
books,removed,the big difference is the racist essays lovecraft published
books,removed,youre right it was a hastily assumption i guess instead youre just a super judgmental prick who has to find something negative to say about a fun idea because you somehow think only hipsters who you definitely do seem to hate could think of it

books,removed,it has been years since i read this series and to be honest i dont remember the specifics in terms of which books were the highs and lows but here is what i remember and what i loved and hated about the series warning spoilers ahead i loved oy frikin loved oy so much a companion like him how could you not when king killed him off i was devastated but in a good way just the fact that he was able to grab onto my emotions like that and i can still remember it or years since i last read it geez thats good i remember all of the disturbing details of that demon birth it freaked me out a little i was only a young high schooler reading this and i remember how king had put himself into his books which in my opinion i never liked i know that it is his thing but ive always felt that it was slightly narcisstic but the thing i hated the most was the ending my boyfriend at the time loved the ending and was one of the reasons why he wanted me to read it maybe i was expecting something more and was overhyped on the ending but i felt like it was a complete cop out my ex was thrilled with it because that means that rolands story doesnt end and he his whole storyline has changed with the addition of the horn i felt like it was very closely aligned with and then he woke up and it was all a dream endings which im not a huge fan of all in all i thought the series was okay but i was young when i read it i might pick it back up and reread it but knowing the ending makes it kind of hard especially since that almost ruined the rest of the books for me one thing that i would like to say though was that i loved reading about rolands history but that was one of the things that i was really intrigued about from the very beginning thanks for letting us know your thoughts on this series its always fun to read others opinions

books,removed,they grew up in a culture where they could whine and bitch until they got what they wanted no amount of whining and bitching can change the results of an election this is why so many of them are crying foul and accusing hillary clinton of stealing the election

books,removed,its racist to not want your own culture and population to be replaced and censored its also pretty sad that you have to stand behind the words of someone black just to legitimize your opinion does this not demonstrate how far getting white people to just shut up and sit down has come
books,removed,there is certainly a place for identity the problem is that we in the west often confuse minority art with skilled art

books,removed,well youre an idiot all you do is look at it from a perspective you know about i assume from a perspective of black people given the context here there are other perspectives that should matter to you as much even so in this particular example the perspective of these students is simply wrong theres no need to entertain it in this case it is simply selfcensorship to not call them children however they perceive it doesnt matter if they are wrong youre saying something that anyone can agree with to imply something that you cant justify to people who disagrees with you you are motteandbaileying
books,removed,every political discussion is a game the first one who gets to call racist or sexist slams down on the button does a touchdown dance and the debate is over woohoo
books,removed,at one and bitching about downvotes grow a backbone u fucking loser
books,removed,good job covering all your basis
books,removed,you nailed it nailed it on the head why cant those pushing for this kind of justice see that they are no different than bookburning nazis
books,removed,oh the shits they would give if you described something as too black though they would lynch you and your grandparents in self defence
books,removed,also why does everyone automatically assume that introducing more women and writers of color lowers the standards for the course thats pretty sexist and racist classic accusatory statement based on a farfetched assumption of course you included it at the end of your post if youd thought it to be worthwhile you would have made it your main point
books,removed,idk i kinda think youre an idiot
books,removed,identity politics has everything to do with the arts what we absorb from the arts shapes our perception from the shows and images we see as children to having those themes constantly reinforced over and over in our lives if you try to say that race has no context or influence in the arts you are simply ignorant and complicit in white supremacy
books,removed,idk maybe youre an idiot its possible
books,removed,yeah i think youre an idiot too
books,removed,ok great but if this trend keeps up why is no one concerned about white people and their population great minorities have another country for themselves but where will whites get to live and prosper if soon they will be minorities worldwide but not even have a country to live in were giving up all of our own countries to immigrants while none of these immigrants countries are doing the same a couple hundred years ago this would have been seen as an invasion now they are censoring and rewriting our own art and literature
books,removed,if you dumb down the education just to be more inclusive youre only going to ensure that no modern blackfemalegay writers will be able to surpass these old white men
books,removed,so i could say something is too black and not sound racist as fuck
books,removed,i give up fuck you society
books,removed,holy shit hughes is a fucking asshole
books,removed,this is an incredibly ignorant post
books,removed,lol what a bunch of histrionic white liberal bullshit oh how weve transcended race class and gender in this classless post racial society we have ‚Äì now lets stop talking about them because they have no place in art oh fuck you
books,removed,the funny thing is that they think calling us white should offend us it doesnt even cracker the worst word for whites has never offended a white person before
books,removed,i dont see why a school should be forced to adhere to the childish demands of racist and narrow minded students who believe that the quality of a persons work is determined only by race if it were a legitimate and understanding demand sure but this is a ridiculous and racist demand and i dont think its wise to give in to a toddlers temper tantrum
books,removed,please stick to your safe space few care for your opinions outside of it
books,removed,thats probably because because youre an idiot
books,removed,eh theyll probably just double down sjw is a profession now
books,removed,anyone that is studying poetry at yale should be able to understand that that would be true years ago but thanks to two decades of affirmative action its actually really easy for unqualified people to get into universities like yale assuming they arent white men
books,removed,in the process teaching them jack shit about the world in the process i pay for a real education not this bullshit and it pisses me off that these entitled asshats come around and want to fuck it all up
books,removed,oh man too many white people in one place call the pc police so literally every single thing has to have an even distribution of race idiots i cant believe this why not just kill all the white people and we wouldnt have this problem sorry some people just do some things more than others it isnt always discrimination there are way more black gangster rappers than white or any other race why dont we give some record contracts to rap minorities make things balanced hahahah the world is going to tear itself apart over race you know whos racist the people who constantly point out racial inequalities if you dont turn every little thing i to racism it is much easier to take you seriously when things are really racist its the boy who cried racism every single day get a life and go about it and if it doesnt effect you let it be
books,removed,this is absurd why dont they apply the same standard to math so you cant learn the pythagorean theorem because it was discovered by a white guy
books,removed,western countries are going to change for the worst in the future as they bend over backwards to appease minoritys demands for fear of being labeled racists white guilt is a disease that that will have consequences
books,removed,yep and im an astronaut who was offered the presidency of a european country everything is true if you say it on the internet and you wanna talk about getting upset why not look at your first post in this comment chain why not look at the post of everybody in this thread with your same mentality those who get legitimately outraged over the outrage if you wanna call signing a petition outrage of others anyway youre a moron and full of shit so there is really no need to prolong this discussion
books,removed,youre a fucking white male
books,removed,social liberalist liberalism and socialism are diametrically opposed you idiot
books,removed,they are both words with a defined definition if you think they have wrongly called you one of those terms then you should be able to argue why they are wrong to simply say the words have no meaning just gives a pass to every racist sexist etc to palm off criticism
books,removed,why are we allowing this racism to happen
books,removed,yeah because the textbook writingpublishing industry has historically been such a huge employment sector in canada oh wait never mind youre an idiot
books,removed,i guarantee if they said the hip hop appreciation class was too black the student would be labeled a racist and possibly expelled why is the same standard not applied here
books,removed,you have the right to be ignorant you just dont have the right to enforce it on others
books,removed,i care if we dont have our own countries and are demonized in our countries for not ceding our ground our culture etc which is exactly what is happening here i am not demonizing non whites by saying whites should be replaced or go extinct the neanderthals also went extinct not because they were less intelligent than homo sapiens alot of proof points to them being more intelligent but because they were simply out populated by homo sapiens extinction is a very real possibility and with how warped most westerners instincts are when it comes to self preservation and current trends it is a very real possibility
books,removed,ugh youre such an ignorant bigot if you dont give equal access to every possible variation and alternative opinion from every race country and creed youre a racist bigot and probably a homophobe white people not included obviously as whites are literally satan and minorities are much nicer and have much better things to teach us
books,removed,you wouldnt complain that a spanish literature class is too hispanic or that a german class is too german why would anyone think to complain that an english class is too white english developed in white countries and most of its major contributors are white honestly this is just racist against white people at this point
books,removed,yw
books,removed,whitewashes sounds rather racist

books,removed,i wouldnt be surprised if those same people would say the english language is too white im pretty sure the anglosaxons were mostly white which is why most of its speakers and writers were for a long while there is an ulterior motive here anyways there are lots of sjws and radical feminists that are unwittingly directing hateful racism and sexism towards white males they seemingly have a narrative built up that all their problems are cause by white males and can be solved by disenfranchising them in any and every way to me this is no different than when people prejudge and scapegoat any other group of people i have no problem bringing in variety and equality but you dont do that by first completely dismissing a group of people
books,removed,this is the generation that will someday run this country i can only hope that the damage done by these back to back horrific presidents and the next no matter which is elected and by millennials is not so egregious that my childrens generation cant fix it imagine taking a japanese native american east indian poetry course and complaining theres no white people smh were so doomed

books,removed,nice writeup op can you suggest any authors who write stuff similar to ubik flow my tears the three stigmata or a scanner darkly for those who havent seen it this short graphic novel by r crumb about pkds reallife strange experiences is a mustsee httpwwwohioedupeoplehartleygauthorsdickreligiousexperienceofphilipkdickbyrobertcrumbpdf
books,removed,im going to preface this by stating the obvious youre an idiot plain and simple just because neil is held is such high esteem doesnt mean everyone is going like him i personally enjoy his work i wouldnt call it deep and i would never call him the tolkien of our generationbut he can tell a story in such a way that youll be weirded out afterwards and probably need a shower like most comic writers he starts off rather slowto build suspense and mystery around his characters he tells a story pages at a time shifting the point of view when he doesnt need to something ive been doing with my own writing and changing the theme entirely of what hes trying to say but again just because there are people who like him me people who worship him an old roommate and people who just go meh you youre and idiot for thinking that you have to like him because hes recommended by a lot of people
books,removed,op even states that he should like him based on other peoples opinion and similar authors op has read i gave my reasoning as to why i like him and ended with the same line as i started but ill reword it here op is would be stupid to like an author because hes been told how good the author was by friends and library goers op has read the in factand still does not like neil op has an opinion and is an idiot for thinking he should like an author because so many others do
books,removed,youre well aware that hes been lauded as the tolkien of our time who the fuck ever said that certainly no one here certainly no one with an opinion worth a damn his novels are average as fuck even his only good work sandman which if you only crawled through suggests your opinion isnt worth much either couldnt be put on the same level of tolkien
books,removed,youre not a dudenoted secondly i never called you stupid thirdly if your job entails you to curate knowledge of works and you have to be well rounded in what you read than you are living every readers dream job however i will still harken back to the original comment you made it should be a perfect fit right i should like his books based onyadda yadda yadda and so forth just because you like other works and authors of the same genre does not mean you should like an author or other works you read them and learn its not for you how else will you know if you like them or not putting the word should in your post means you have an obligation and a duty to like him as author no one has an obligation to like something someone has written why did i call you an idiot because im obligated now to remind you that youre opinion on a particular author is just that an opinion you can always change it if you want but should you change it because its your job to curate and understand as much as possible so you can lead others down a road of authors they normally never would no should you like an author simply based on others recommendation to you no should you ever take an i internet forum post which is here to express opinion and share like minded or opposing view points ever seriously no but you should be able to read whatever you want and feel about it however you like regardless of what others say about it

books,removed,i hope i dont get heat for this but the magicians series made me feel like that i really loved the entire plot and the way their lives intertwined the main characters entire life experience albeit not enviable was still to be desired he reaches the pinnacle of magic subjectively and ends up being put up in a nice office with a hefty salary he still has his magic and hes just there contemplating his existence capable of doing anything in either worlds if he so chooses gosh
books,removed,day old account shill for audible lol too obvious
books,removed,fun book dumb ending i hate that our heroes go on this dangerous journey into vegas and accomplish absolutely nothing flagg is destroyed by trashcan man with an assist from the literal hand of god and our heroes contributed to this in no way in fact the exact same thing would have happened if they just stayed at home
books,removed,i just finished it and found the ending no spoilers to be quite enjoyable spoilerssssss the bike thing was kinda cheesy dont get me wrong but i found the joycean ending with the earthquake that affected all the objects people streets etc that impacted the story to be satisfying and the earth beneath derry broke under all the living and the dead
books,removed,you know what and this isnt about you personally shorfuzd but if you guys were using some females in your quotes some females as examples of great writers i might be able to hear you better as it stands much as i like einstein it really taxes my patience to once again have to deal with this imbedded inbred misogyny and to have to be nice about it why dont you guys get it we are sick and tired of this insane and i mean insane disenfranchisement of half of the human race my half ssssssick of ittttttt i use this tea traditional medicinals wonderful teas that can sooth a sore throat alleviate cold symptoms or calm the spirit love this tea love love love this tea on each tea bag there is a tab at the end of the string on each tag is a quote great quotes not to be argued with quotes but yep i hope you guessed it all by men except for a cupla anonymous onesprobably by womenlol

books,removed,im gonna color the inside of his asshole periwinkle
books,removed,it seems blatantly obvious to me too how many times have you wondered how your children will look back on the old days now and been amazed at how different things were with the fast pace of new technological developments its hard to imagine how different the world will be in the next years my own children think i practically lived in a prehistoric era when i explain that our telephones were attached to a wall that we spun records on a spindle with a needle that we used typewriters instead of computers etc etc etc
books,removed,theres more and more alternative treatments and drugs but for a while chemo and radiation was it when its something that raises your chances to survive over doing nothing you do the something this is how science and medicine work slow progress with a few big breakthroughs every now and then
books,removed,take my moneyyyyy
books,removed,lol mom jeans are cool because they actually slim down a womans figure because of their elongated length in the rise and as far as records im kicking myself for donating my superexpensive turntable a few years ago i guess i got tired of storing it but dang i wish i still had it at least i still have about of my favorite records still
books,removed,the classics you mentioned plus saberhagen niven pournelle p j farmer et al created a massive foundation of work on which everything else worthwhile was constructed later it would be like an english major in school not to ever read shakespeare
books,removed,cancer needs to be looked at like a huge range of diseases with individual cures for each type instead we subscribe chemotherapy which just kills everything again thats how science works its easy to say thats obvious today in hindsight but we simply didnt know that back in the day what we did know is that chemo raised the chance of survival only through millions of man hours of research dna sequencing and hard work have we achieved the level of knowledge that we do today which is still sadly lacking chemo at least had quantifiable results no one is denying that refinement of treatment was or is needed but you have to start somewhere leeches were unjustified to the core based on fallacy superstition and a fundamental lack of scientific process the comparison is an insult to the monumental effort that is cancer research
books,removed,thou shalt not say the cword as it is sexist and insulting everybody knows quaint isnt an adjective but refers to female genitalia

books,removed,nice downvotes uneducated apes its essentially a blood flow increasing blood thinning proteins not some magic vodoo fucking heparin in nature
books,removed,using an unsophisticated and brute force treatment methodology one that was always based in fact and evidence to treat a difficult disease is not the same as subjecting someone to blood sucking for no definable benefit yes chemo sucks but its proven to work and is still a commonly accepted treatment for many forms of cancer today should we not use chemo because its tough on the patient i guess i dont get your point until we have a better alternative which there are many forthcoming but for now this is it

books,removed,it is simply quantifiable that the countrys money is going to the rich as it hadnt since the guilded age for decades the richs taxes have been cut ala supply side economics whose promised benefits to the rest never materialize but then thats not much of a surprise considering that theres no economic theory that says it would ask kansas or louisiana how that worked and yet year after year we can count on conservative media to shill that and all other pet causes of the rich people an corps alike the rich have successfully lobbied eg alec to make it that way and fox et al is their mouthpiece and in people like you theyve found the prefect idiots the rich people and companies alike write pro rich legislation that the gop dutifully pass this is true for corporate socialism privatizing profits while socializing costs eg climate change tax cuts the estate tax cut was pushed by the mars family along with a dozen others decades ago they couldnt have done it because they hadnt convinced so many idiots but the gop media eg fox has taken care of that by redirecting their anger to the poor and minorities the gop has always been the party of big biz thats where they get their money thats who they take care of and fox founded by serial sexual harasser and old time gop political operative roger aisles was made to facilitate that compared to fox msnbc is a joke its not just that they dont have that agenda they dont have the rich backers also the liberal base is notoriously bad at being followers years ago a nyt financial reporter recounted the story of a discussion he had with a cab driver about the repeal of the estate tax a big push by the gop at the time the cap driver was listening to some conservative media working the repeal of the estate tax the estate tax only gets paid by the wealthy and yet conservative media had convinced their gullible idiot audience that this was an issue for them no matter how he explained the reality to the cab driver the guy simply wouldnt accept it and there you are conservative media convincing a hard working poor guy that the repeal of the estate tax a movement started by about a dozen wealthy families was very important to him so in short take your false equivalence bs and shove it up your ass

books,removed,first off an inductive approach that you provide however personally relevant is antithetical to coopting a view on considering consumerism cannot be categorical whether consumerism is categorical or not an inductive approach you provide doesnt provide refutation to it they are two separate statements issues secondly good luck to you at the personal level any criticism made is not a personal jibe at you thirdly i think consumerism as an idea of brain washing and social control has been made go tell any marketing exec you have never been influenced by marketing theyll guffaw at ones incredulity spend some time on this and let the work become a basis for exploration it is far more closer to consumerism as mass manipulation where the major participants state that is the aim to gain control

books,removed,you tell them there is this obvious and expected answer and just say they were wrong fuck that ive had the exact opposite happen in this story i would have said its about the fucking dog because it is literally about the damn dog in my life the grader would have been like didnt you see it was all an allegory no it isnt it is quite literally about the dog i hate when they do stories like this where for some people there is a hidden meaning and for some people its just about the dog as i never had to deal with parents divorcing it isnt something ive had to deal with so it wouldnt mean fuck all to me but if your parents had divorced this story might have had much more underlying meaning

books,removed,tldr type in ¬Ø„ÉÑ¬Ø for proper formatting actual reply for the ¬Ø„ÉÑ¬Ø like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¬Ø„ÉÑ¬Ø which will turn out like this ¬Ø„ÉÑ¬Ø the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy „ÉÑ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize „ÉÑ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¬Ø„ÉÑ¬Ø but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized

books,removed,i think a lot of these examples are honestly just using repetition as a poetic device and it happens to occur at the end of a line not this one things is such a generic word choice it doesnt really stress any idea or bring focus to a particular thought like repeating danger zone thats not even the worst part of that song making love out by the lake to our favorite song hes basically implying that he uses sweet home alabama or maybe werewolves of london to set the mood for sex

books,removed,no you think thats the main criticism because you probably subsist on a diet of leftist media as such youre probably ignorant of the fact that obama was the first president to extrajudicially execute us citizens that he lied to our faces about nsa spying or that he has started numerous wars that would have caused protests in the streets during the bush years but i guess john oliver doesnt cover that stuff hes too busy coming up with musical numbers detailing why you should love the irs
books,removed,as to your edit theyll never move to disarm the populous then why are they trying why did they decide that the best way to curb gun violence was to create secret lists in the style of the no fly list and ban us from our constitutional rights on that basis why was the douchebag congressmen who declared that due process is killing us given stage time at the democrats convention if this is some fucking figment of my imagination
books,removed,first off i didnt call you a single name and i wouldnt you said this it obviously didnt teach you critical thinking or discourse skills was that not meant to be an attack on me second your critical thinking skills are lacking because you think the aclu is out to get your guns please link to where i said that liar third if your discourse skills were on point your first post wouldnt have been so vague i had to go down a few posts to figure out your point it was immediately obvious what my point was thats why it was so heavily downvoted youre being intentionally obtuse

books,removed,more than that there are multitudes of ways if understanding for instance scalia was a practitioner of originalism where on he could divine what was in the writers minds at the time they wrote the constitution except where they meant muskets for the second amendment
books,removed,i hope theres a new amendment that completely overrides the second one so that you can have all your toys taken away and can cry about it more fucking conservatives man is it just me or did you schmucks suddenly figure out how to use the internet en masse the last couple of years

books,removed,if you legitimately cant understand why they would do this then you need more help than reddit can offer
books,removed,yes he has read and understands it he just thinks its flawed due to negative liberties ie things that the government cant do to you it does not state all of the things that the government has to do for you
books,removed,and what did he say about anything pertaining to us muslim citizens he said he will ban the immigration of muslims who are not citizens already are you like
books,removed,i think you think you are trying to convince me of something that i already believe as i said in your zeal to win an argument you never really established the point of contention you just assumed because i used the words well regulated militia that i was suggesting the constitution included an outright ban you sound like an idiot when you argue this way id recommend first trying to understand the other partys position before you jam irrelevant legal precedent down their throat the majority decision also reaffirmed that certain firearms restrictions mentioned in district of columbia v heller are assumed permissible and not directly dealt with in this case this is the relevant portion of the summary of the majority opinion that shows my intent is in fact constitutional and supported by the court

books,removed,i think he was trying to sound smart because hes a pretentious little prick considering this is reddit
books,removed,the second amendment isnt actually about the right to own guns its about the right to arm a militia and who do you think the militia is oh that right the people also us code clearly state who is in the militia not like it matters the constitution is so outdated its laughable actually it does matter its the document on which all us law is based but i guess free speech and nnot being tortuted are completely irrelevant to modern problems you think its outdated fine amendment it until then shut the fuck up fucking ass
books,removed,soi dont like intentional shitstirrers it makes you look desperate and your argument look bad even if youre right you see that with tumblr sjws a lot sometimes they actually do make good points but theyre so condescending and in peoples face about it that no one listens
books,removed,books ive read this year and enjoyed the passage the twelve im on the waiting list for city of mirrors the girl with all the gifts the girl on the train dead wake victory at yorktown the martian in spite of the science all the light we cannot see destiny of the republic station eleven one second after one year after im currently reading the wave but i think i will finish it fairly quickly ive also read and enjoyed all of the song of ice and fire books including the tales of dunk and egg anyone have a good recommendation for me
books,removed,the point is not so much the cultural faux pas if i write a novel about black people eating fried chicken and watermelon every meal i invite backlash but non faux pas that are nevertheless presumptively labeled as such based on the notion that an author cannot possibly be authentic enough with any character other than their own cultural background no scratch that in truth its only the empowered who cant write about other cultures but minorities are free to do so if i write about a black gang member in chicago it matters not how close my writing may be to an actual such individual if any critic can start a social media bandwagon about how a white person cant possible write such a thing without being a racist but flip the script and few would dare attack a black author for writing caricatures of rich white folk indeed to do so would also be racist
books,removed,what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch ill have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on alquaeda and i have over confirmed kills i am trained in gorilla warfare and im the top sniper in the entire us armed forces you are nothing to me but just another target i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth mark my fucking words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet think again fucker as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking dead kid i can be anywhere anytime and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with my bare hands not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent you little shit if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn idiot i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it youre fucking dead kiddo

books,removed,the selfish gene this profoundly cogent tome has revolutionized our understanding of nature and indeed the very fundamentals of human nature while we are partly rational beings we are also very powerfully driven by our instinctive programming that aims to promote the survival of our genes in a big world full of hostile competitors but now that we are the apex of the earths ecosystems much of that programming proves to be counterprodictive to the aims of a civilized and technologically dominant society if only people realized how much they allow themselves to be enslaved and lead about by the nose by their instinctive animal programming we would have a much better chance of siezing the reigns of our increasingly chaotic global society through rational thought and longview problem solving this book is amazing

books,removed,this book has been controversial from minute one with so many people feeling that nabakov had to share common feelings with hh that he felt compelled to write an afterword explaining his position in later versions the debate on whether hh is an honest narrator at all and to what degree he is honest has been going on in academia pretty much since it was published but hey youve got it all figured out it was very obvious that he was a misogynistic little shit ah theres the rub youre a social justice warrior and you cannot get past your sheer offense over what happened in the plot perhaps some reality hh is fictional he cant be misogynistic he cant be a little shit no one was actually victimized dolores doesnt exist etc but the fact you react with this kind of emotional language to a fictional character says far more about your own perceptions and character than it does about hh

books,removed,mae holland has just started to work in the customer experience department at the circle she is eager to fit in and believes she is lucky to be working for the only company that really mattered at all when she steps into the elevator she is greeted with a holographic image of her name and high school yearbook photo the campus has every possible perk to keep the employees working and hanging out day and night caf√©s gyms outdoor recreation concerts club meetings beer bashes etc the circle appears to be a composite of every social media and ecommerce company you can name facebook google twitter myspace amazon flickr yahoo yelp reddit et al the most dominant and ubiquitous tools offered by the circle are free but you have to use them as yourself your truyou the era of false identities multiple user names and internet trolls is over maes job consists of monitoring multiple screens on her desk and answering a deluge of customer questions as deftly and quickly as possible the circle takes pride in the fact that the customer queries are not answered by a robot maes output is measured on the quantity of responses that she handles as well as the customer rating on the usefulness of her responses she starts to believe that her work is important and meaningful soon after arriving at the circle mae also discovers that its not sufficient to just sit at her desk and respond to customers she is also expected to participate in the community aspects of the circle and maintain a visible online presence she becomes obsessed with increasing her partirank participation rank by attending functions posting pictures and zings commenting on everything around her reading others feeds etc its an exhausting allconsuming but at times exhilarating environment that mae thrives in she soon reaches the lofty status of the top among the circlers a group almost maniacal in their social activity and elite in their corresponding followers her days are a relentless cycle of smiles frowns comments votes surveys and other online interactions one of the products promoted by the circle is a live feed from a camera worn around the neck that broadcasts at all times until the circler turns it off at bedtime mae feels privileged to have been selected to wear one and completely buys into the mantra of total transparency and sharing espoused by the circle mae eventually clashes with her parents and old boyfriend mercer who decry the social mania that has infected mae mercer accuses her of having been brainwashed by a cult but she thinks hes a backwards bore who just doesnt understand the value of complete transparency and sharing she truly believes the company motto sharing is caring eggers has written mae as a onedimensional character a pawn in a social structure that has lost its moral compass none of the characters in the novel are particularly realistic or likeable but their onedimensionality seems to emphasize their loss of some basic human element i raced through the book and could hardly bear to put it down indeed the story is farfetched but with a certain ring of truth and a message of the dystopian future that awaits us if monopolistic companies become too powerful and we allow our humanity to be subsumed by technology intrigue builds throughout the novel until a show down of sorts though it wasnt the climactic resolution that i was expecting eggers is a skillful and insightful writer one of the most articulate social commenters of our time he has created a fantasy world of online sharing gone awry you can either scoff at it as farfetched fiction or regard it as a prophetic warning of the shape of our future read this compelling book and decide for yourself
books,removed,living in our present social media world the circle is enlightening to all of us eggers depicts the breadth of communication and community to extremes to create a frightening version of world dominance mae holland is a bright young woman who comes from a simple middle class background she is an only child of hardworking parents who are proud of their daughters new job at the circle a vast company with tentacles into every phase of human exchanges based on communication mae is a college graduate who won the position probably with the influence of her good friend annie who is literally working her way up the corporate ladder the story is what i expected in terms of sophisticated media audio and video with direct interference into our lives the complexity and usage of the phenomena is used to grow the circle into an international power heading up the company are the three wise men far flung from the magi each one has his own idiosyncrasies and acts benevolent but they at least two of them are traditional corporate bosses who are striving to increase their power they do not hesitate to mold staff into their visions it was quite interesting to listen to the hierarchy speak to the staff on every level i found would you like that from a leader to a staff person constantly repeated until the employee is cajoled into believing the upper echelon of physical and emotional monitoring is supreme mae is rather na√Øve she is so grateful for this job she quickly is cast under the spell of their new techie validations of spying seechange truyou etc maes father is suffering from multiple sclerosis and their lack of good healthcare diminishes his health and their financial resources annie works magic and her parents are placed on the circles health insurance relieving them of that burden but replacing it with direct video and audio interference in their lives it is humiliating mae has quickie sexual relations at work with two men one is symbolic of impotence and control and the other encounter is one of lust and secrecy during maes tenure at the company she evolves into a star and she is obsessed with being the best and her need to be liked is fanatical dominance is a central theme of course the fish tank scenes are especially poignant and frightening as a shark consumes the lesser animals in methodical order these episodes are replications of the circles systematic control and governance of their staff and the outside world there are many obvious dichotomies in the book with order vs chaos and freedom vs total power eggers had a preponderance of solutions for total ascendancy quite scary but not surprising maes separation from her parents was the saddest commentary i expected her to have some backbone when she would have episodes of despondency but she chose to give away her integrity instead
books,removed,ive been waiting for a book like this for many years theres been a few books that go into various aspects of the future were building for ourselves but they focus mainly on the how and whatnot the why the circle gets into not only the philosophy of the surveillance state but some of the earlier values that must be accepted before you arrive at the conclusion that this would be a good idea while thematically its fair to compare this to from an execution standpoint its not in that class however its still a very good novel and one i really enjoyed i think the novel was successful in showing maes transformation even if at times the moments of change were a little too fast and easy for me i thought the character development was solid and there was a good collection of periphery characters none of whom felt superfluous to the theme ill admit at the beginning i wasnt sure if this was going in the direction of or office space with the orientation and early weeks of maes employment in hindsight i do think that that uncertainty wasnt necessarily a bad thing because it draws in readers familiar with that world those activities and that mentality which is really necessary to get you questioning what the hell youre really doing online by the end of the book other that a few quibbles with maes development that i mentioned i didnt have many complaints with how the story was told i felt the sexscenes were a little cringeworthy at times and i never really understood maes connection to francis in terms of their romantic relationship i would have liked mae to been a little different at different points but my frustration with her impulsivity was consistent with the character so i guess i cant fault eggers there one small formatting issue i dont know if this was just with the kindle version but since there were no chapter breaks the story was a little jarring when it jumped around at times where the spacing wasnt indicating a scene shift i think eggers has written an important book with the circle the aquarium scene as a metaphor for online communities and social media convergence was worth the price of admission alone
books,removed,i grew up with a party line phone in my home went to college with a nonelectric smith corona typewriter used an electric cherryred selectric typewriter at my first job and a word processor at my last job before having kids so with that type of background i found this book terrifying when i told my daughter a bit about the plot shes she totally did not understand what i thought was so creepy about it she kept saying well thats not that weird and trust me the stuff that happens in the book is weird and creepy and it kind of proves the point of the book that my daughters generation does not think an allinvasive tech company like the circle is a bad thing im even feeling weird now reviewing this book doing my tripadvisor and opentable reviews and posting photos on fball that info going out into the world and i am not techno savvy at all i just realized recently that its not a coincidence when i see postings on my fb from bloomingdales of shoes and they happen to be the same shoes i was just searching for on bloomingdalescom creepy but i digress back to the book its a great story and had a twist i didnt see comingyou go along on maes journey as she does its all fun and games until its notit gives you a lot to ponder and you will shudder when you now read current articles about google buying up robot companies and amazon delivering by dronesits going to be a brave new world and if the books prediction comes true its not going to be that old ground breaking apple tv ad about dissing authoritarian officialsooo no its not going to be that at alli shudder to think
books,removed,the circle by dave eggers is as important a work for the century as was for the add a pinch of brave new world animal farm and fifty shades of grey as well the circle is written for todays audience and takes the reader on a nightmare journey into technologys potential heart of darkness as we shoot video and photos of everything and i do mean everything and post those images online for public consumption we are meandering down that road to the transparency sought in the circle transparency is a world where there is no privacy everyones every action is available for view at all except for breaks that preserve the sanctity of the restroom this is the mission of the circle a fictional highgloss social media network corporation a talented young woman is hired to a dream job at the circle and is gradually drawn into its worldview she is so taken with it that she becomes its face to the world as she allows the masses to live her life vicariously as she shares every moment of her life with everyone here is where i had trouble with the book eggers is a wonderful writer but he didnt convince me that he knows females well enough to try to convey their thoughts and feelings credibly the behaviors of his protagonist mae holland are portrayed as pretty onedimensional she is fiercely ambitious heartless and often quite stupid she is easily manipulated and that of course leads to her ultimate ruin she is perhaps portrayed this way to speak to the shallow and acquisitive nature so often found in online postings i always choose to believe such people just do not do well in expressing the complexity of their thinking in this book however there isnt a great deal of complexity to the thinking of ordinary mortals just to the geniuses who created the circle in spite of that however the circle is an important book and should be read seriously considered and discussed in a world where even street people have a smart phone i find it a little alarming to think where all this personal interaction with technology may ultimately lead clearly dave eggers is concerned as well and has started the conversation in a very readable way
books,removed,first i must say that i am a devoted fan of dave eggers and the ways he has elevated and enriched literature for us all his heartbreaking work of staggering genius actually was just that it had depth and characters who though since it was a fictional work of autobiography tracked as real and who were so fleshed out that every page turned brought a new level of something important being at stake next i need to tell you that the circle presents in a very digestible and tooclosetohome way what may be the blueprint for our culture more obsessed with recognition than introspection ironyfree and trustful of everyone based upon the face value of their statements rather than a questioning of their motives and intentions like some kind of gentle massaging harbinger of the apocalypse the circle may actually be an outline or even abridged version not only of the great american novel but also on its own it could be one of the most important books written ever especially if one rates fiction or nonfiction on the scale of everything is at stake this novel does not skimp on that last statement i wanted to love the circle and in some ways do beyond logic because since i finished it a few days ago it has haunted every keystroke in my computer each moment reading a newspaper or blog viewing tv contact with people and has even broken into my dreams eggers has given us a technological horror story wherein the horror works because it is presented through a character who is the irony free type of person who tends to let technology wash over them completely without questioning more profound far reaching ramifications but this very device of the naive but powerful selfenabled character is also the books main shortfall i am frustrated after reading this book not that its premise disappoints but rather that its execution leaves so much of the richness of what a novel can and should achieve completely out of the equation instead i felt as if i were reading a lengthy detailed treatment for a movie and perhaps this was eggers intention is this a treatment for a century version of the prophetic orwellian science fiction film colossus the forbin project or of terry gilliams brazil or could it be deeper that the style of the novel is a sly and subtle comment on our facile nonreflective techinfused culture even if the author pulled one over on me i still found myself hungry for some of the more grounding techniques of the novel the surprises of the book and i am spoiling here were telegraphed and paid off largely without surprise except perhaps that the feeling of dread was paid off in ways that abandon all hope but again not at the expense of the horror of the world that this book lays out still though i may have been reduced to pure comatose inactivity had the circle actually completed itself in terms of novelistic style with deeper character motivationexplanationbackstoryfollow through it seems that eggers has done a disservice to what may have elevated this story into an unassailable great american novel not unlike demoxie the circle stops short of true greatness in the service of expedience right now i feel like an ungrateful guy formerly in the dark complaining to edison that the light bulb is great but we really need a better lampshade i dont mean to be dismissive or unappreciative its just that a book with so many great ideas and a premise that is universal for our time especially in light of our recent headlines on the erosion of privacy and civil rights just feels like it would have achieved actual literary greatness again completion had it gone deeper into character motivation explanation for sudden insights and more of a fleshing out of situations i am saying that it would have felt even more real and therefore the horrorsuspensedread of it all would have been even deeper of course this review is a part of the social media which is the dna of eggers novel and the irony is appreciated by me with all these things said i still defend this as an excellent book its premise is prevalent in our culture every day and will only escalate in fact the realization that eggers extrapolations of what just the slightest twist or tweak to how we use our social media unfettered surveillance and device culture today are so not farfetched that my heartbeat rose to a level that is not common for the act of sitting and reading fiction no something else was going on here i still cannot help giving the circle a rating of all five stars its premise and dramatic situations are so strong and pervasive that i somehow know that i am changed in some way for having read this book and that is the highest praise long after ive forgotten the names and specific situations from the novel i will still have perhaps in my own dna echoes of the horror of what happens when too much is given away too freely for the shallowest of reasons or even the best highest intentions i will never think of the seahorse the octopus and the shark in the same way again
books,removed,i often wonder why people post their every move on facebook its a weird phenomenon years ago i read about a man who jotted down every minute of his lifewhich means his obsessive jottings eclipsed the business of life of actually living but it is an odd phenomenon why would anyone do that and why would anyone want to read about it who cares what someone ate or read or said or did especially if its utterly banal mundane boring well dave eggers being the brilliant writer that he is creates a facebooklikecomputer campus that is so real and yet so surreal that its hard not to believe that the bizarre escalation into our information is not already happening of course its happening i guess the surreal part comes when people actually espouse the idea that all information should be available and yet i just heard that on npr a week or so ago really all my information should be available as the facebooklike guru says isnt it selfish of you to withhold your information your pictures your experiences someone out there may not be able to experience what youve experienced you owe it to that person well im paraphrasing but thats the gist of it yikes creepy and the protagonist for this story actually believes all this so we get to see her carve out her own and the worlds new version of hell for the megainformationstealing computer company shes very likable and very sure of this brave new world her exboyfriend whom the author paints as passiveaggressive overweight and a maker of antler chandeliers the epitome of uncool has other thoughts nice way to distract us from what might have been just another diatribe against those who are picking our information bones clean
books,removed,as a professor of political science and information security policy at iowa state university i strive to jolt my students into awareness of the zero privacy world in which we live this excellent book can do that better than any textbook facebooks mark zuckerberg just bought four properties so he can have some privacy around his house privacy facebook the zuck has recently stated that people should no longer expect any privacy anywhere anytime he said the the social norm of privacy no longer exists facebook and the other social media are now as powerful as the vatican in reshaping society the circle is a daunting reminder that orwell was right in the most chilling book big brother is watching you and its no longer the state the government who is watching its also the business world from google to amazon twitter facebook and every other networked platform in fact your credit card company knows more about you than the national security agency actually your wireless phone provider knows even more and shares that with the government big brother as we found out this year eggers big brother is the humongous corporation which works off the business model all that happens must be known really known by the circle of course to me the most telling chilling maxim of the circle is privacy is theft let that sink in for a minute in the era of big data and pervasive surveillance when the circle dominates privacy is virtually prohibited and seen as socially unacceptable perhaps even criminal the novel is entertaining often funny sometimes deeply disturbing its a satire of brutal intensity which mocks the na√Øf geeks who populate the digital idealist ant hills of silicone valley oblivious of the dangerous mob rule of cyberspace these denizens of data thrive in the moist world of crowd swarms still convinced that stripping away all of the protections of anonymity produces a world of sharing and caring wrong the heroine of this often amusing and entertaining novel mae holland becomes as michio kakutani suggests in his review of this book a full time digital ninja she is a willing and eager implementer of her bosses corporate goals which are much more than a mere business model but instead are a cultural transformation a revolution if you will of society of course mae becomes entrapped in the metrics and demands of her employer which includes wearable life video except for brief bathroom breaks thanks google glass while fiction and often cleverly turning down unexpected pathways which i will not reveal much of the minutia of corporate profit targets preprogrammed feedback and brutal demand on employees is all too real my students and you will learn moral lessons and breathe quickly what little privacy from surveillance and total transparency we still have enjoy it with greater appreciation for the remaining freedom on the other hand to my shock and despair most of my students dont care that their lives are as we used to say an open book they say things like i havent done anything wrong so i dont care if the government or facebook know everything about me all i can say is yikes in the long run it seems doubtful however that we will be able to beat the monster of pervasive intrusion on our lives back into the steel box we wanted the monster we tweeted going to take a dump now at panera got trashed at whiskey river last night went home and hooked up with a blonde last night lol me in the shower haha selfie is the newest word in the dictionary look at me as a professor of information assurance and security policy i work on ways to better protect the personal data and information there are days like today when i realize i am obsolete there is no confidential private information anymore and this excellent book nails the future world of pervasive transparency in a compelling fictional setting you must read it and then weep
books,removed,this book has absolutely changed the way i see the world although im not a user of social media i will never be able to watch two people having lunch in a restaurant completely ignoring each other while they tap and swipe their way through cyberspace on their cellphones in the same way again the book raises some serious questions about whether or not its a good idea to do something just because technology makes doing it possible eggers novel has a suspenseful structurea young woman named mae goes to work on the idyllic campus of the worlds most powerful social media corporation an outfit called the circle as the story moves forward mae learns that some of the activities of the circle are less than benevolent and some of their ideas have enormous consequences for the world at large but mae is an idealist and ignores some of the warning signs the characters in the book are not particularly well developed although most of them are interestingannie maes best friend mercer maes old boyfriend and a mysterious man who warns mae of the dangers inherent in the guiding principles of the circle like most good science fiction novels this one is more about ideas than character and plot although the story here is pretty good but eggers addresses serious concerns about the nature of privacy the power of technology and how tyranny can come from corporations as well as governments run amok i would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the issues raised by the tsunami of technology that has engulfed us all in the early years of the century
books,removed,we currently live in a world where personal privacy is less important than it used to be one only need to see social media and all the shameless prostitution that is being passed on as being worthy of ones time and attention going to the zoo becomes a must post online event having a blog about your personal sexual life is not invasive and you know that like other people are like this too its all about connecting yet the more times we connect with complete strangers the less output or power we seem to have in real day to day inyourfacewithanotherperson conversation and activities we see families preferring to chat on the phone than with each other at restaurants and no one bats an eye i did not like mae the central charater of this book because i can perfectly imagine some people already agreeing with the notion that we need to know it all and we need to do it as soon as posible who could be against universal knowledge i had a few ideas before but the circle added even more and i would definetly say that i for one would prefer to sustain certain illusions that make reality bearable for us all am i against social networking or internet chatting well im here on amazoncom using my real name so its not a problem of the technology technologies are neutral things its how people use it that really matters everything should be followed with some degree of common sense and balance i have a few friends tell me well why does it bother you if the government or companies see what you type and do what are the consequences its not a big deal well instead of talking about notions of freedom and decency and not willing to give more power to those who already have it i will simply state read dave eggers the circle
books,removed,youre a fucking idiot swallow a take a dive with a noose people like you ruin the planet please improve the planet fucking take one for humanity you are nothing and never will be kill yourself
books,removed,the book is difficult to stop reading once one has started i dont quite agree with the review that characterizes this book as a thriller there are no action scenes at all and the circle could hardly be characterized as exciting it doesnt matter the book is extraordinarily compelling it is more realistic and far more plausible than was in its day this is in part because was set more than three decades into the future it was written in whereas the circle is set in the nottoodistant future the circle is scarier than for the same reason it features known technologies and applications that we can easily imagine developing or that are already in their infancy the dystopia doesnt even feature an evil government as did indeed government spying is never even mentioned at all adding to its realism is the fact that this book is virtually devoid of symbolism it is written in a matteroffact style with straightforward descriptions that anyone who has visited silicon valley companies can easily recognize in one little tribute to eggers does come up with several threeword allcaps slogans that update the classic freedom is slavery slogans from orwell several other lowstar reviews point out some shortcomings in the writing and i agree with them too superficial in many spots but so is complete omission of any online users who object to invasive technologies plot twists developed and then dropped eg the unnecessary sex too simplistic using letters from a former boyfriend as a way of making points that the book should have been able to make more elegantly with better writing nonetheless this book needed to be written the way the circle drives relentlessly into a dystopian future backed by the bestandbrightest minds who are too driven and too young to question what they are doing is masterful im an attorney and my area of expertise is internet law i have written books and articles and spoken many times on the subject yet despite my substantial online involvement i have always refused to join facebook this book is the best explanation yet regarding why
books,removed,theres a lot being said about dave eggers latest novel including a fair amount of criticism about its flawed posturing as a kind of parable meant to terrify and jostle the reader out of social media complacency essentially that is an orwellian caution story for the time of millenials big brother taking selfies much of the criticism seems justified to me as a story the circle hits a few flat notes with almost cartoonishly onedimensional characters that too often show their hand as being authorial megaphones eggers almost stridently breaking the writerly cliche to show and not tell the wouldbe moral lesson of the circle wouldve come across just as well and perhaps with even greater weight if emboldened with nuance and complexity chiefly with its cast of characters mae our young female protagonist is the biggest disappointment here a smalltown girl a bit too easily swept away by the glamorous machinations of the circle a social media behemoth standin that isnt so much symbolic of facebook and google as a future epitome of all social media efforts while much of her near frictionless evolution into the poster child of the circles grandest projecta person going entirely transparent everything from their vital signs to every moment of their daytoday activities freely recorded and broadcastcan be attributed to her youthful idealism and appreciation of a remarkable career and lifestyle opportunity one cant help but feel there couldve been a great deal more to the story had she had more empathy with her parents and exboyfriend mercer who sit on the other skeptical side of the circles efforts that all said the story remains fairly compelling and the book is a satisfying read on the whole it also demands consideration for what it does almost too well it makes big brother look well rather wonderful while many critics have categorized the book as a relatively simple and even heavyhanded warning against the increasing erosion of privacy in the name of digital connectedness that most seems to revolve around narcissism i really found it to be far more than that eggers to my mind has gone to great and convincing lengths to capture the temptations of the circles efforts in a series of lessons of a sort from one of the circles three wisemen leaders mae is told of all the ways society and individuals would lead improved lives through complete transparency the codeword throughout the book for complete surveillance children given tracking chips at birth nearly eradicates all kidnappings complete transparency among adults will nearly eliminate all crime benthams panopticon with unlimited technology and funding a collective of medical data on all people on earth leading to unprecedented advances in detection and cure rates a disabled child in california can tune in as a dozen different advanced cameras track a climber advancing up everest it continues on and on like this resonating most effectively in the realm of government where the trend for politicians to go transparent quickly becomes and overwhelming trend and leads to the first truly transparent democracy the world has ever seen corruption and lobbying disappearing seemingly overnight the idealistic hopes play out in the book rather frequently and easily more criticism is justified here too but the effect remains and is i believe the real brilliance of this book eggers isnt just scaring us all into maybe backing off of facebook for a while or caring a bit more about just how much time and money google is spending to know who we are by trawling every email hes playing devils advocate for his own warning arguing emphatically in return that increased digital visibility will have potential positive effects on a global scale and surely will have many convincing proponents for pushing for those advances philosophically the circle isnt as singleminded as it might at first appear it isnt only a cautionary tale from a social media luddite condemning the age of digital access and monitoring with a heavy hand its richer and more daunting to consider to the full weight of what closing the circle would mean and considering why it might to more than a few not appear like such a scary story eggers leaves it to the reader to feel out these possible futures and wonder if we can take some of the progress on offer from some of them without the requisite totalitarianism here the line between dystopia and utopia is paper thin and all the more frightening because of it
books,removed,we all know we die we all know the world is too big for us to be significant so all we have is the hope of being seen or heard even for a moment wow what a read i went into this one a little tired from the mild letdowns that some of my more recent reads have been and wanting to take a quick breather from my list of upcoming prerelease reviews this one was released in i am delighted to say that this novel the circle by dave eggers really blew me away i felt like itd been a while since i read a novel that actually lived up to its blurb and more so i was thrilled about that not to mention wholly enamored with this world that eggers constructed the circle is the newage animal farm meets the yellow wallpaper a read reminiscent of where eggers provides a fresh mirror in which to see ourselves and our culture in a startlingly accurate light in a kaleidoscope of scenarios that straddle the line between personal rights and rights of commerce the greed of cultural extravagance and the effect of emedia inundation on our lives while at the same time we watched maes slow and complete decent into some millennial version of madness i loved it first off let me say that the lack of chapter markers was a smart play the format threw me off balance which kept me on my toes a useful trick in a read like this or as one character put it i want you on your toes offbalance intimidated handcuffed and willing to prostrate yourself at my command it also did an exhilarating job of reeling me in as a reader making it hard for me to pull back fully immersing me in the oncampus world through maes eyes it was like i could feel my own slow inundation with the circle which of course made the implications as they unfolded a little horrifying the thought of this utterly realistic and culturally possible phenomenon actually happening the completely bizarre started to become normal sounded like it really made sense of course everyone should know everything of course we should do everything we can to keep children safe hmph must be how cults are formed here eggers offered a view of our world like big brother on steroids imbedded in the fact that the googlelike company mostly employed millennials‚Äîand that we millennials are known for our social media voraciousness and oversharing‚Äîit comes off as a totally plausible alteruniverse that mae has stumbled upon when she arrives both to herself and to the reader if youre a typical millennial read it and take pause if youre not‚Äîespecially if youd classify yourself a luddite‚Äîread it and weep at this completely conceivable totally creepy newage possibility the circle was comical in its realistic nature lifelike in the way that the interactions between characters were played out here youll find competition in a survivalofthefittest sort of way reflected in passages that unnerve while being so relatable that theyre undeniable here eggers brushes up against classism caste struggling to belong and competition whether healthy or not annie still held some particular status again annies lineage her head start the varied and ancient advantages she enjoyed were keeping mae second always second like she was some kind of little sister who never had a chance of succeeding an older always older sibling eggers pushed situations to a brink that you might be tempted to label overthetop but he did so in a way that was contemporary social commentary at its finest even maes interactions with the people around her‚Äîall strange in their own way‚Äîring hilariously true from frustrating reprimands from the boss whos drank too much of the company koolaid to clumsy sex in a dorm and even a cave who hasnt done that right mae was a realistic character‚Äîstill brighteyed and bushy tailed initially worried about her student loans and her parents health and wellbeing feeling weighed down by her responsibility as an only child and that contributed immensely to the direction that the plot took as we see her being stripped down to conform to a new mold i loved watching her and being a part of her world in fact eggers wrote a world that i wished i was a part of one of the reasons that we read in the first place he constructed a world where social media reigns supreme where privacy is the enemy an awesome looking glass of us all being reduced to screenscrolling sheep herethere are no oppressors no ones forcing you to do this you willingly tie yourself to these leashes and willingly become utterly socially autistic you no longer pick up on basic human communication clues youre at a table with three humans all of whom are looking at you and trying to talk to you and youre staring at a screen searching for strangers in dubai imagine a world where emedia and allencompassing surveillance are the prime forms of communication and interaction across the globe its also how you vote how you pay your taxes how you shop online your social media profile is how the world‚Äîthe government even‚Äîsees you youre now living in the worlds first tyrannical monopoly thats a scary chilling thought that eggers executed fluidly with clarity and intrigue with mounting anxiety both on the part of the reader and the main protagonist mae untiluntil it all seems perfectly normal and thats the scary part i knew that this one was getting stars from about the midway point and hoped that it wouldnt disappoint with some hastily done bowtie ending or weak sort of sputtering out like it was tripping over the marathon finish line but it did not it held up its end of the bargain so ill hold up mine a welldeserved stars
books,removed,the circle dave eggerss latest novel begins with mae hollands first day on the job at a company eerily similar to facebook or google taking into consideration the luxuries offered to her as well as worldwide influence of the company mae believes herself to have found heaven the reader witnesses mae losing her personalized life in favor of transparency similar to the behavior of the hogs in orwells animal farm corporate rules are posted being enforced by the ravenous hr dogs sent out to correct anyone not abiding mae under the watch of the circle must send out her status updates called zings and monitor results using nine computer monitors mercer her exboyfriend is the added voice of reason her parents are the added example of what happens to those living outside of the circles influence eggerss deft prose can best be described as light and agile some readers may feel the characters in the circle are a bit shallow or flatperhaps even clich√©d however i believe eggers made an intentional choice in this regard which allowed the character of the company the circle to take center stage as the dominant personality and antagonist of this book while the circle is not a book of the horror genre it is a scary book happenings in this book are on par with such real life examples as facebook opening a million housing project iphones unlocked via your fingerprint and google launching computerenabled camera glasses perhaps people will get angry at the issues eggers brings about but this is a conversation that needs to happen making the circle a deserving read
books,removed,there are many ways to view a circle one as a closed system once a cog is admitted to the circle it is designed to remain in place and help sustain the whole the new cog in dave eggers novel the circle is young woman named mae the circle is giant internet technology company which largely focuses on social media in ways that make current social media seem tame and quaint mae through the help of an old college friend annie now a highprofile member of the circle is given an entrylevel position as a ce customer experience representative mae is awed at what seems some vast progressive campus of freeflowing thought and innovation it is less that and more of a disguised reeducation camp employees may work eighthour days more of course is encouraged but they belong to the company if this isnt apparent from the start mae who scores well in her customer contact evaluations from the beginning is soon contacted by her boss who tells her that the circle isnt what you might call a clockin clockout company at that point an interrogation ensues of manic proportions a blend of kafka and the marx brothers mae if not physically present must stay plugged into the circle at all times before the advent of home computers and email there was an old office saying presence is productivity put another way just dont go home at the circle you not only should not leave at but check in at all hours witheveryone besides the circle can be your home free room and board on campus could life get better so mae is chastised for having no photos no zings no reviews notices bumps but since the circle is an internet technology and social media company one could envision neural implants to get these zings and bumps while we sleep lo and behold as i start to draft this review and as i get to page it happens there was a rumor that project engineers had figured out a way to replace the random jumble of our nighttime dreaming with organized thinking and reallife problemsolving the circle is a version of orwells except that on the surface it looks like disneyland even the writing is light and breezy like the spacious atriums at the circle deflecting the underlying cult mentality this is a welcome addition to the canon of dystopian literature mae looked at the time it was six oclock she had plenty of hours to improveso she embarked on a flurry of activity sending four zings and thirtytwo comments and eighteight smiles in an hour her partirank rose to felt a profound sense of accomplishment and possibility that was accompanied in short order by a nearcomplete sense of exhaustion partirank this is a closed society with total interconnectedness suggesting the star trek borg resistance in this cult really is futile at the end of book i it is clear we have entered the orwellian landscape as mae having gone kayaking in secret and semiillegally an obviously subversive act is placed on a virtual scaffold of humiliation for the benefit of circle employees her biggest sin is secrecy not sharing her experience with everyone after a kind of forced confession a screen behind her flashes privacy is theft secrets are lies sharing is caring at the beginning of book ii mae is now participating in the circles ultimate goaltotal transparencywearing a device that delivers all she sees and hears toeveryone after all privacy is theft one of the circles founders overlords named stenton has brought back a number of unknown species of marine life from an expedition to the mariana trench one happens to be a voracious literally blind but translucent shark along the way in exchange for premiere health care for maes parents they are obligated to have cameras placed in their home and respond to all manner of inquiries comments and wellwishes by a voyeuristic public that has abandoned any notion respect for privacy late in the game mae receives a letter through snail mail the only secure form of communication this kind of mail delivery now occurs once a week from an erstwhile boyfriend mercer maes recent enlightened state regards him as some outdated troglodyte but who actually maintains the voice of reason did you ever think that our minds are delicately calibrated between the known and unknown that our souls need the mysteries of night and the clarity of day you people are creating an everpresent world of daylight and i think it will burn us all alive there will be no time to reflect to sleep to cool mercer decides he will completely sever ties with the everencroaching technology and go off the grid in some northern wilderness as if to save mercer from himself the circle with mae leading the charge field tests a new product called soulsearch soulsearch can reveal the graphic and gory genealogy of anyone and locate anyone in a matter of minutes mercer becomes one of the test subjects and once he is discovered he is pursued by people and drones for the sole purpose of demonstrating you can run but you cant hide anymore besides secrets are lies a highspeed chase ensues and mercer drives his truck off a bridge into a riverbed hundreds of feet below although this may seem a little too predictable it is really his only viable course of action if he is to maintain the purity of his values the essence of the companys message comes from a mysterious ty aka kalden one of the founders of the circles principles realizing that his vision was perverted that completion means everyone must be confined in the circle completion is the endwere closing the circle around everyoneits a totalitarian nightmareeveryone will be tracked cradle to grave with no possibility of escape in the last pages mae listens but succumbs to the lure of total transparency that of the deepsea shark that devours every living organism that comes near it with its transparent digestive system quickly dispatching its waste that privacy is theft and rats out the pleading ty there is no questioning just total blind acceptance the thoughts of maes friend annie remain hidden as the exhausted woman learning of a past which should remain hidden lies in a coma her thoughts unrevealed but the circle will work on that the ending is reminiscent of winston smith in but he resists for a while and then is discovered and tortured following his rehabilitation orwell proclaims he loved big brother in eggers novel his character mae willingly embraces the circle and that outcome is perhaps even more depressing the technology of social media is taken to absurd destructive lengths reducing the essence of our humanity to the ashlike waste matter of the transparent shark that devours everything finally it calls to mind the musings of hamlet who said all of denmark a prison shakespeare knew the many forms a prison could take including those without cells and bars but hamlet also knew that he could be bounded in a nutshell and be accounted a king of infinite space mae has made her place in that space

books,removed,you are a dickhead taking someones thing and changing it in for something they dont want is a fucking shitty thing and i would slap you back into last week with your dune i dislike both books for different reasons but you should pull your head out of your ass i mean its obvious that your snobbish crap and you ego are more important to you than your own sister but even then you need to pay her back her money or you are basically stealing from her again you deserve a slap kid

books,removed,
books,removed,of course some people dont like him but id definitely at least peruse the sparknotes for the book the book is almost as anti war as it gets he absolutely refuses to give those scenes any glory or honor and perhaps he wants to mimic the real life acts of how war scenes rarely have a build up his love for catherine can also seem odd if you dont know why he intended it they are two people emotionally drained by the war that pretend to love each other as a distractions but slowly they actually start to commit to one another this is why they seem so weird at times and if youve finished let me explain the ending a bit obviously spoilers ahead what hemingway seems to say is that life especially during something like a word war is devastating to everyone everyone in the book drinks rinaldi has his women henry and catherine have each other catherine talks about this saying that she fears rain because it reminds her of death but even more hemingway believes that any distraction is only temporary rinaldi is presumed to get syphillis henrys drinking lands him liver issues and of course we see what happens to catherine and the boy he walks into the rain that represents the inevitable doom impending on us all and proceeds on with life its a terribly bleak ending but it can seem open ended if you dont follow some of the symbolism in the story even more hemingway often offers little insight into henrys feelings awful things occur and he seems unphased rather the reader is denied this to come to their own conclusions decide how they feel about it themselves i too was initially disappointed with the book but many of the things that seem off about the book are absolutely on purpose definitely at least check out some sparknotes analysis then again you may simply not like it even then hope what ive said helps though
books,removed,so if its cool to go around exposing other peoples kids to porn why dont we see more nipples in advertising go take whatever porn device or magazine you want and go show it to some kids in the library thats totally what youre fighting to be able to do you pedo fuck

books,removed,as a companion you may enjoy the film
books,removed,i think part of the reason i liked the book is because i had times where i couldnt stand him hes a character thats irritating specifically because of his immaturity an immaturity which isnt unusual for a real person of that age one of my favorite things in the book and i dont specifically remember the quote is when hes complaining about having to edit and rewrite that classmates papers because hes using too many commas and putting them in the wrong place in the very same paragraph salinger intentionally has extra commas that dont grammatically need to be there placed indicating that like a lot of teens hes very willing to point out flaws in others while being unable to be introspective and realize the same flaws in himself i see holden in a lot of ways the same way i see severus snape another character i really enjoy reading a lot of people judge him for not being a likable character but i think thats missing the point hes a very flawed very human character and thats part of what makes him so tangible when i read i tend to look for characters who give me a real emotional response and i feel that good writers are those who can make you lovehatepity a person who isnt actually there just because the emotion elicited isnt a positive one doesnt mean the character isnt well written

books,removed,if art doesnt help people understand a culture why do sociologists study it because they study it in context with a broader view not telling themselves they understand a culture is like what they are seeing people in rural areas that are soaking up media about the kardashians and crime scene movies and so on are not getting an understanding of what it is to live in a city consuming that media does nothing to better understand what it is to actually live in these areas do you think living on a farm is dancing around singing eieio while naming the animals likewise do you think that the cardassians represent what it is to be a kid growing up in the suburbs how about any of that other reality tv trash and conversely do you think swamp loggers tells you a great deal about rural living people that study media to gain insights into cultures dont do it as consumers of the media most people with empathy understand that art is a gateway to a different culture art reflects the values and mindset of the artist when all american artists are clustered in two cities our art tends to only reflect the values and mindset of those two cities yes well if a person genuinely thinks that they are understanding city life based on watching television programs i can certainly see where they would get the delusion of elitism never mind how completely out of line with reality that is nope the problems and mindset when somebody is growing up in an urban environment is perfectly encapsulated by watching big brother at the risk of sounding elitist theres a bit more to ubran life edit and as a native nyer i can say with certainty that yes watching seinfeld helps connect you to the mindset of the ny jewish community this would all be more amusing if you didnt seem to actually be believing it
books,removed,i said that the rural voters cannot be as out of touch with urban voters as urban are with rural because rural voters consume a steady diet of art that comes from urban centers ive never once claimed that watching pawn stars makes someone an expert on pawn stores nor is that really relevant to anything tv is art someone who watches the wire will have more empathy for the plight of inner cities someone who watches girls will understand millenials in a new way hollywood made a concerned effort to have more gay characters that werent caricatures so that people would empathize with the gay community despite being a mindless sitcom modern family did more to help the gay rights cause than any politician or intellectual it helped people see gay marriage as an issue about individual people so yes i stand by the claim that your average rural voter has more access to the urban voters mindset and culture than vice versa

books,removed,i like it i just think it doesnt live up to its enormous hype and teaching it to school kids in compulsory schooling is idiotic hi kids youre all forced to be here by your parents and the government heres this book about being a teenager that was written in your grandparents time so you can relate to it isnt relating wonderful hur de hur hur so so wonderful lets all relate look at holden hes upset and insecure isnt that just like you teenagers hur de hur de hur he doesnt like society i bet you dont like society either hurr haha isnt it funny that youre forced to be here by your parents and the government is it ironic should we talk about irony as a class nevermind look at holden so meaningful look at all these symbols symbols symbols symbols all my genuine human reactions are buried under the weight of how i am supposed to teach this fucking curriculum and the things you are supposed to get out of this book so instead of reading it and reacting to it like intelligent human beings lets mechanically find rhetorical devices in it yay can you find similes between pages and can you do it by thursday yay hurr de hurr hurr can you write a twopage essay doublespaced ah fuck me i understand the absurdity of trying to force you kids to write a sensitive thoughtful reaction to a book as if you were doing it of your own free will and i know perfectly well only two of you actually enjoy writing how about using a fiveparagraph structure yay that way you can write without actually thinking or feeling anything remember a simile is easy to find just look for the words like or as

books,removed,still no rebuttal on the original argument i am actually treating women fairly i didnt say women cant write good literature i said women generally do not write epic pieces of literature women have notoriously been the majority of readers if they feel insulted all they have to do is start writing no one in the western world is stopping them youre being absolutely childish ignorant and obtuse stop searching for things to be insulted by and actually gain a legitimate understanding of what people are saying instead of applying your bias and pretending as if someone is being offensive last of all stop projecting your insecurities and flaws on others its unbecoming and has no place in a legitimate discussion
books,removed,no just no you are trying so hard to argue and getting all worked up go outside have a drink a smoke a bowl whatever but im not gonna be responding to you again promise
books,removed,your idea that women need only to write more or write better is besides culturally sheltered also ignorant of the entirety of sociological history and paints a clear enough picture of your biases still no examples still nothing this is absolute fluff the idea that if women want to write more epics that they need to earn it by writing at a higher level to put their names up there with the greats such as woolf is completely culturally and sociologically sound there are very very few great women authors that is fact that is the the world that is the truth it is so true you are unable to name a single one i havent not a single example none you are essentially saying that the nursing industry is sexist because its majority is female when its not sexist at all if men want to be represented in the nursing industry then more should enter the nursing industry its the exact same argument the great stories and heroes of the nursing industry are majorly from females simply because the majority of nurses are female its a statistic its a ratio its calculated its common sense ive phrased my arguments clearly its your wish to be offended your wish to feel as though someone is attacking females your wish to be believe that sexism is at hand your wish to be a hero of females in literature your wish to be a victim that is allowing your poor and defeated understanding of simple facts women men minorities whatever have you do not deserve to be represented in a category of greatness of whatever choice simply because there should be diversity any person of whatever designation should feel offended to be thrown into a list or status based on the idea that it is not diversified enough you earn greatness and the natural world we live in does not have a great number of female writers achieving high levels of talent and ingenuity in literature not for the fact that some patriarchy is damning them but because females on average have not and do not strive to high levels of creative writing or literature in academia with the purpose of mastering their craft hence why the majority of great epics and highly respected prose and verse in literature are male authors it is not inability it is choice take off your ignorant white armor and see that not a single sexist offensive or assaulting word has been said against women in my argument and that you have provide without a shadow of a doubt a single example or rebuttal that disagrees with my observations except for the idea that i am sexist uncultured ignorant a fool and an idiot its asinine that you would take such a stance and its cowardly that you would feel the need to play victim when no assault has taken place

books,removed,that was my first post in this sub so i cant speak to previous trends i jumped to offer beatty his welldeserved kudos for winning a prestigious award i specifically gave reasons why beatty in this book reminds me of vonnegut i dont think beatty previous to this book merited the comparison and like i said there is a real reason i brought up the late mr vonnegut im not a college kid who has just done the curriculum reading im an adult who enjoys reading and would be considered fairly well read by most standards your rant makes paints you as a dipshit it also sounds like youre fairly young given that you actually wrote this the type of writing that makes guys feel smart for reading it when really the true literary elite scoff at such such things about cormac mccarthy and kurt vonnegut ill grant catcher in the rye has a certain freshman year vibe to it but kurt and cormac are venerated celebrated figures in literature and their works are complicated evocative timeless and often important to hear some kid say some nonsense like the true literary elite to back up his idiotic premise thats concocted because hes annoyed at a reddit sub is so fucking stupid and insulting its ridiculous lets be clear people bring up vonnegut often because he is perhaps the greatest and most american writer in our short history his books have a deceptive ease to read but his simplicity of style belies the depth of his craft to underestimate him means youre likely a poor reader nobody of any significance in the literature world scoffs at kurt vonnegut almost every current respected author cites him as an inspiration of some sort including the subject of this post paul beatty furthermore i take issue with your written by rock edited by chappelle line which sounds like a kid who has no prior experience with the art of black americans trying to paint the author as raunchy or sloppy or whatever else you were trying to imply rock tho not a fantastic actor is an enormously successful comic and writer in his field chappelle too tho his shows success speaks to him more wellrounded talents at writing and acting in any case beattys prose has no comparison that i read to either of those guys and his storytelling was far more nuanced and skilled than perhaps youre capable of reading again it seems fairly racist to suggest he shares traits with other black men simply due to their race in short your misinformed idiotic mean spirited and wrong rant shows only that you are a not a smart reader and b dont have much of a grasp of literature i suggest you go fuck yourself

books,removed,youre being way too pedantic dude simply put im saying that not everyone shares the same sense of humor it varies even within western culture from person to person id also argue that your idea of western culture is too vague and outdated to be truly helpful finally if i were being a pedant id point out that my use of the a should imply the singular

books,removed,is it really that far fetched that english people reading texts with british history contained in them are much more likely to come across discussions of alchemy or even the term philosopher used in a less strict sense than americans reading american novels like steinbeck but america apparently cant theres really no need to be so hyperbolic and cynical only in reference to americans it does this sub no favors it is simply unnecessary how about an idea instead that different people with different history and culture understand subtext differently being told what the subtext is as opposed to the subtext being simply available to you give rise to very different experiences imo i suggest watching httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvudbohvjijxi on different harry potter translations try to think about how impossible it would be to keep the meanings the same for everyone that reads it while american and british english are quite similar our background in literature is significantly different theres no reason someone shouldnt at least think about this when porting a novel across the atlantic

books,removed,this is fantastic
books,removed,im surprised nobodies illuminated the context of salingers life normally id agree the author is dead but its undoubtedly important here salinger was on utah beach at dday he was a front line soldier at the battle of the bludge he was one of the first americans to liberate a concentration camp and worked there for quite a long time he once remarked no matter how long you live you never get the smell of burning flesh out of your nose he saw first hand some of the worst horrors man had ever created and then he came home and wrote a book in which nothing happened but that book was especially resonant with his fellow soldiers for a good reason mental illness was a new idea and suddenly this book came along that perfectly encapsulated what ptsd was like holden had a dead brother had seen his roommates suicide and had maybe been raped saying hes just whiny and needs to get his shit together is similar to saying why dont people with mental disorders just get over it which is exactly the attitude held by the american public before the advent of mental health therapy why dont soldiers who saw the holocaust just get over it and its easy to brush off people who connect the horrors of war to adolescence but the important similarity between the two is that you cannot relate your experience with anyone its a burden you carry alone when youre young often you cannot relate either because you dont know how to express yourself or because no one will listen theyre all phonies who arent interest in your problems this is why people who tend to like this book also tend to be susceptible to depression its the same person who both relates strongly with those who suffer but cant talk about it which is why you shouldnt just brush off holden or real people like him

books,removed,some parts of the war were fictionalized in history books im more sure what at this point some people used the events to shift wealth overseas to the us and hid it in sa islands and swiss institutions art is easy to transport considering the value of single paintings warhol likely was heavily involved in art financials and potentially black market medication weapons is a small idea if it involved manhattan scientists

books,removed,projection and lack of empathy is why if you were truly happy with yourself and your life you would not feel the need to criticize someone if you were a wellrounded and emotionally healthy individual you would understand that saying something so harsh over a subjective matter only leads to hurt feelings you also jumped to conclusions i know there are jokes within it but who is to say that this isnt a real teacher

books,removed,christopher columbus was not a hero he did not welcome the americas into the european enlightenment uh you thought columbus was a hero for what he did for the existing population columbus is a hero because he made american history possible he represents an entire era if you made it past grade without realizing that then youre an idiot do you also think washington was great because he confessed over the whole apple tree incident
books,removed,yawn you are too impressed with yourself lol
books,removed,no really please keep rationalizing the largest genocide in history damn neanderthal
books,removed,fuck you buddy more people die today because of intellectual property than ever did because of slavery
books,removed,they absolutely would not have saved the union that is unspeakably idiotic the whole point is they seceded because they were afraid slavery would be abolished its really not that complicated as for why lincoln voted against them it was because at the time he was still trying in vain to hold the union together he had always been an abolitionist at heart but he was also pragmatic and preferred compromise and incremental progress if possible over the allout war that happened but when it did he made sure that it would end the slavery issue once and for all
books,removed,i understand exactly what bias means jackass you could just as well say that reading mein kampf is interesting and valuable for the same fucking reason except its actually of legitimate historical value to understand the thinking of someone as influential as hitler but if you are seeking objective truth and perhaps i was foolish for assuming that is in fact what people seek then bias is never valuable reading extremely biased subjective works straight as fact and outside of a context in which you are aware of their bias at all times is never a good thing and thats exactly what the op did maybe zinn himself didnt present his work as an objective take but then its utterly pointless because he admits from the outset that he has an agenda to push and thus you cannot trust a single word that follows to be unskewed and thus it is useless for those who actually seek objective truth it doesnt matter because clearly people like op are going to take it as objective truth anyway considering thats literally what he said so then what is the value of the work as an extreme counterweight to conventional readings that is a false premise more casually put its like saying you should watch both msnbc and fox to get all your news youre just going to get nothing but a whole lot of slanted misinformation which is worse than no information at all no the only value of sinns work is as propaganda to push his agenda and indoctrinate naive people like the op to his onesided point of view it is therefore no better than anything from the opposite side just because it is different does jot make it more valuable
books,removed,alternative facts
books,removed,well you learned that the public school system lied to you swallowing that first red pill is the hardest its not just us history time to question many more assumptions enjoy the journey

books,removed,just stating some facts dude as long as were all exploring a little past our traditional views on history trying to be subjective
books,removed,lol physicists are so cute with their rants go back to school
books,removed,as much as christian imperialism has done wrong it was a necessary counter to the ummayad caliphate muslim version of crusades which was hell bent on global domination slaves in islamic cultures have been castrated chopping off their balls and wang for over years which required a more frequent replenishment of fresh slaves yet we only chastise those who ended slavery
books,removed,pretty sure his mind is sufficiently broad your pitiful response to his wellreasoned articulate rebuttal as opposed to your op which boils down to i read this book that says america did bad stuff in the past and everyone else should read it and agree with me perfectly typifies his point jesus christ this comment is euphoric as fuck its alright though i was a college sophomore too once oh and youre a douche theres a surprise

books,removed,i kinda had a feeling this would be just absolutely shitting on white people history is already being wrote by liberal professors so do we really need to shove more white guilt down kids throats and completely ignore the atrocities of other races and other cultures honest history is a good thing but when it creates a monolith of evil white guys and ignores the evils of everywhere else that isnt honest that is selective
books,removed,most of what the left say vs does is a contradiction
books,removed,what the fuck are you talking about i agree that most heroes were villains but in no way were the villains heroes you are literally defending hitler

books,removed,ill go first i adore reading epic science fiction massive time and galaxy spanning stories with lots of intertwining plots as i lack the capability to create a visual image in my mind my experience is primarily dependent on enjoying the plots little facts bit surprises insightful characters you name it so when the author takes two pages to describe a massive star ship controlled by an ai i do think thats cool but mostly wish for himher to move on with the plot its the concepts what were here for this is what makes asimovs the last question work so well for me every word of every sentence has meaning to the story the closest he comes to descriptive visualisation is his face has lines of weariness on it and thats something that has a direct meaning the other side the great books i dont get are exemplified in the discworld novels the short bits and anecdotes i read are fun but when trying to read an entire thing they seem so filled with visual tricksery fluff to me that all i end up doing is getting frustrated at the author for all the fluff which according to others is the best stuff the car chase problem ive always been bored out of my mind by long car chases in moves whats the point of some kind of continuous flow of events if halfway in you already cant remember the start having no capability to generate visual imagery also makes it difficult to get a quick feeling for stories or movies that depend heavily on a map or nonstory based plot think car chases in movies or written stepbystep stories about some detective following a suspect however brilliantly written i just dont get the point of it unless i draw it out on a physical map then i can get excited for it its how the lotr went from pretty good story to great novel

books,removed,i actually tend to largely agree with you there is a major issue that people are trying to take abstract academic concepts and impart them onto the larger world especially when those academic concepts are just that abstractions and generalizations about the world i think for example intersectionality is a fantastic way to frame conversations about systemic prejudice however when you force intersectionality to be the lens you look through for every single interaction it becomes the oppression olympics personally i have issues with individuals who try to force the cistrans language on others however i also have issues with those who outright deny the innate experiences of others i believe both sides are operating with false pretenses and clearly clinging to their own morals without question and when someone mandates their view on shaky grounds oh ill definitely call it out for both sides being openly crude to an individual when they ask to be called by a perfectly normal existing prefix that might not align with the general expectations of that prefix is being an asshole its not transphobic its being an asshole far too often people assign denigrating phobias and throw around bigotry however if someone openly denies that anyone experiences a gender which does not align with their sex they are ignorant once they turn that ignorance into an open prejudice towards those individuals that becomes bigotry for some reason that concept is controversial i dont think we as a culture should be telling anyone what to think but i also dont think that we as a culture should allow individuals thoughts to dictate what is an objective truth and the fact that when you deny an objective truth you are ignorant

books,removed,the library at mount char by scott hawkins uthe library at mount charu is a dark fantasy novel about carolyn one of twelve children adopted by father and trained in one of twelve catalogues or disciplines of knowledge and lets just say this girl is great on longrange planning and that she has a truly ambitious agenda the clues as to what exactly shes scheming about and what her ultimate goals are are the metaphorical crack that keeps the reader hooked the library itself is a vast repository of knowledge that exists on a separate plane of existence and mount char the home in suburban america where the children were raised serves as the nexus or portal through which the library can be accessed the worldbuilding is truly original and fantastic and the story has elements of psychopathy darkness explosions that glitter and fascinate the listener it is something different shiny weird and inviting in the fantasy genre which seems to have become increasingly tolkienesque or grrmartinish

books,removed,im really grateful to have seen this because kafka is besides perhaps dostoevsky my favourite author whenever ive loaned my books out ive always tried to explain the humour behind his works to no avail ive always described it as being like throwing a glass of water in the air and trying to catch the drops of water whilst the glass smashes on your forehead its the futility of our own humanity and we pay homage to it in all sorts of literature and expressions cant win for losing judge not lest you too be judged be careful what you wish for you might just get it but kafka more than most authors gives this quality of our existence its own platform whereas many simply use it as a tool to further a plot consider for example the war on terror

books,removed,not likely and please remember that not printing new copies of books does not eliminate all extant copies of books which your hysterical mass deletion scenario seems to assume for so long as libraries and private collectors exist paper copies will be preserved here in the us we have a whole governmental agency the library of congress that is devoted to storing durable hard copies of important documents and cultural artifacts and has even branched to doing that for things that otherwise only exist digitally when necessary and possible the story corps podcast from npr for example moreover digital replication has made most classics literally free to anybody with access to the internet increasing availability of these works hundreds of times over what libraries were previously able to offer and its not even as easy to mass delete data which might be distributed to millions of different machines as your bad scifi addled brain has supposed i have many of those free great works saved to devices that arent persistently connected to the internet and ill bet im not the only one even if a magic bookeating computer worm could be programmed in anything but a fantasy world so no i do not worry about these things

books,removed,full context there is no dispute in this case that dowlings unauthorized inclusion on his bootleg albums of performances of copyrighted compositions constituted infringement of those copyrights it is less clear however that the taking that occurs when an infringer arrogates the use of anothers protected work comfortably fits the terms associated with physical removal employed by ¬ß the infringer invades a statutorily defined province guaranteed to the copyright holder alone but he does not assume physical control over the copyright nor does he wholly deprive its owner of its use while one may colloquially link infringement with some general notion of wrongful appropriation infringement plainly implicates a more complex set of property interests than does runofthemill theft conversion or fraud as a result it fits but awkwardly with the language congress chose ‚Äî stolen converted or taken by fraud ‚Äî to describe the sorts of goods whose interstate shipment ¬ß makes criminal and when interpreting a criminal statute that does not explicitly reach the conduct in question we are reluctant to base an expansive reading on inferences drawn from subjective and variable understandings williams v united states u s at in light of the illfitting language we turn to consider whether the history and purpose of ¬ß evince a plain congressional intention to reach interstate shipments of goods infringing copyrights our examination of the background of the provision makes more acute our reluctance to read ¬ß to encompass merchandise whose contraband character derives from copyright infringement congress enacted ¬ß as an extension of the national motor vehicle theft act ch stat currently codified at u s c ¬ß passed in the earlier act was an attempt to supplement the efforts of the states to combat automobile thefts particularly in areas close to state lines state law enforcement authorities were seriously hampered by car thieves ability to transport stolen vehicles beyond the jurisdiction in which the theft occurred legislating pursuant to its commerce power congress made unlawful the interstate transportation of stolen vehicles thereby filling in the enforcement gap by strik down state lines which serve as barriers to protect from justice cong rec statement of rep newton congress acted to fill an identical enforcement gap when in it extend the provisions of the national motor vehicle theft act to other stolen property by means of the national stolen property act act of may stat see s rep no cong sess h r rep no cong sess h r conf rep no cong sess again congress acted under its commerce power to assist the states efforts to foil the roving criminal whose movement across state lines stymied local law enforcement officials cong rec statement of attorney general cummings as with its progenitor congress responded in the national stolen property act to the need for federal action in an area that normally would have been left to state law united states v turley u s no such need for supplemental federal action has ever existed however with respect to copyright infringement for the obvious reason that congress always has had the bestowed authority to legislate directly in this area article i ¬ß cl of the constitution provides that congress shall have the power to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries by virtue of the explicit constitutional grant congress has the unquestioned authority to penalize directly the distribution of goods that infringe copyright whether or not those goods affect interstate commerce given that power it is implausible to suppose that congress intended to combat the problem of copyright infringement by the circuitous route hypothesized by the government see united states v smith f of course the enactment of criminal penalties for copyright infringement would not prevent congress from choosing as well to criminalize the interstate shipment of infringing goods but in dealing with the distribution of such goods congress has never thought it necessary to distinguish between intrastate and interstate activity nor does any good reason to do so occur to us in sum the premise of ¬ß ‚Äî the need to fill with federal action an enforcement chasm created by limited state jurisdiction ‚Äî simply does not apply to the conduct the government seeks to reach here note the bolded text all the court ruled was that certain statutes relating to the theft of real property run of the mill theft as the court terms it dont apply to copyright infringement not that the certain types of copyright infringement arent stealing in a moral sense thats very different from your interpretation that dowling represents the supreme court declaring that what youre doing isnt stealing if you have any further disagreement on the matter id suggest formulating an argument based on the text rather than hold forth on how i should just read it over and over again until i agree with you sidenote someone who doesnt know the difference between a judicial opinion and a court transcript should probably be a bit less condescending when arguing about the law
books,removed,yep reminds me of youth like the time i had my baby daughter and a few days later was washing her little cute body and accidently took a sniff between her legs and was welcomed with a tangy but sweet smell now i didnt get aroused but it smelled nice yknow anyway yeah books smell great but not old great know what im saying

books,not_removed,i cant wait for men without women by murakami my favourite contemporary author writing a potential homage to my favourite book of the century men without women by hemingway it should be very interesting what i wish to convey in this collection is in a word isolation and what it means emotionally men without women is a concrete example of that the title grabbed me first of course hemingways shortstory collection of the same title figured in and the stories followed each story came from the vibrations produced by the title why men without women i dont know somehow or other that title put down roots in my mind in the same way that a windblown seed settles and grows in some field

books,not_removed,the structure of the book is actually based off of italo calvinos if on a winters night a traveler calvinos is definitely conventionally less exciting but his prose are magical and the book is seriously thought provoking if you give it time
books,not_removed,if you liked the cloud atlas then you would probably like the windup bird chronicles its another book that employs magical realism into the plot
books,not_removed,at the end of the first section i thought the book was broken like literally broken they must have put it together incorrectly stuck with it and now its one my favorites i really enjoyed black swan green by mitchell as well
books,not_removed,its really unbelievable im starting on ghostwritten also by mitchell now if you havent already you might like murakami kafka on the shore and wind up bird are most similar but i also loved norwegian wood the house of the spirits by isabel allende and never let me go by kazuo ishiguro edit would love suggestions of similar books or authors to the above if anyone has them
books,not_removed,it is fantatic i really recommend his other books too the bone clocks and ghostwritten are done in a similarish style were one story goes onto the next but without the russian doll structure if i remember rightly most of his books also reference each other too in some way approach the film with caution though its okay but quite a mess and i feel it failed to have the impact that tbe book does the actors all play several characters each under make up and prosthetics and at times feels a bit like a sketch show
books,not_removed,i accidentally bought the cloudspotters guide by gavin pretorpinney instead of cloud atlas it is literally a cloud atlas and is ok if you like that sort of thing
books,not_removed,i hate to ask a dumb question but when it comes to cloud atlas i have no other choice was the book better than the movie i absolutely loved the movie but i had to really sit down and watch it or times before i could follow the story jumping back and forth enough to retain sufficient information so i could comprehend the movie my wife on the other hand cant sit through the movie a full time because she cant do the bank and forth with the time line in the story id love to know what you think about the book
books,not_removed,i watched and loved the movie its one of my favorites then i read the book and loved that aswell but i feel if it was the other way round it would have been different
books,not_removed,cloud atlas is a beautiful novel i picked it up after i watched the movie and i was very happy with the book the bone clocks is another really good novel by him too
books,not_removed,i was planning on seeing the movie so i decided to read the book problem is i read the cloud atlas and not cloud atlas oh well i hated the movie and never got around to the book
books,not_removed,hopefully it was better than the moviewill never get that hours back
books,not_removed,have you read if on a winters night a traveller by italo calvino its the book which inspired the structure of cloud atlas its a completely different book in many many ways its really a unique novel but it was a big influence on david mitchell
books,not_removed,you should check out one hundred years of solitude if you liked cloud atlas
books,not_removed,thanks for the great recommendations this is the next book i am going to be reading
books,not_removed,got the book this weekend at a secondhand bookstore excited to start reading it loved the movie but everyone said the book is much better like it almost always is
books,not_removed,i didnt know it was a book and now i will read it cause the movie was so ridiculous i was so disappointed after finding out its a book it makes so mich more sense that it was just a terrible adaptation rather then me just being like why did they make this it makes no sense
books,not_removed,hes a great author i really enjoyed the bone clocks and slade house as well
books,not_removed,one of my all time favorites
books,not_removed,its my favorite book of all time im glad you liked it
books,not_removed,im in cloud atlas whats cloud atlas
books,not_removed,thanks for the suggestion good scifi and especially fantasy movies are vary hard and very expensive to pull off cloud atlas the movie had a lot of potential but i felt it fall flat on its face due to a myriad of terrible director decisions same experience as randomly walking into different theaters at different times with no connection or reason at least we have the book to see what the author actually managed to achieve
books,not_removed,how long did it take you to get into it i started it but it just wasnt grabbing me and i found it difficult i really want to like it bc ive read so much praise for it
books,not_removed,i cant wait to get to this i really dont have time to read more than two books a month so i feel my want to read pile on goodreads is just racking up too much
books,not_removed,its probably one of my favorites have you read the thousand autumns of jacob de zoet by the same author its also a very intriguing read
books,not_removed,didnt really do it for me the structure was a cool idea but by the end it started to feel gimmicky you knew each story would end with someone sitting down to read i also didnt feel that the individual stories jived particularly well thematically or spoke to each other in any meaningful way the reincarnation stuff felt shoehorned in and didnt add much as for the stories themselves i liked the pacific ocean story and the one in belgium but i found the others unoriginal he threw almost every overused dystopian scifi trope at the wall maybe im being a bit harsh but overall i think the book bit off more than it could chew
books,not_removed,i was really quite disappointed by bone clocks i kept thinking it was leading to something really twisty and interesting and the end result was a bit of a damp squib in reality
books,not_removed,thank you for the recommendations i totally want to read more stuff from him i still am reeling over how expertly he intertwined the stories
books,not_removed,you just need to read the first paragraph of if on a winters night a traveler and you know youre in for a treat
books,not_removed,and one hundred years of solitude marquez is an absolute master of magical realism and this novel even touches on similar themes as cloud atlas
books,not_removed,mitchell is one of my favorite authors and i just started reading windup bird yesterday im so excited for the ride
books,not_removed,thats so funny this is exactly the premise of if on a winters night a traveler by calvino the main character worries that the wrong book has been printed by the publisher after the first chapter if you havent read it before you might like it
books,not_removed,yes i enjoyed it on audiobook and i thought there was something wrong with the recording its one of the very few books that i finished waited a little while and then began again
books,not_removed,ghostwritten is awesome i would also suggest you read by mitchell as someone who is a daydreamer that book was incredible
books,not_removed,my thoughts exactly i still dont know if theres something i missed because i feel it gets far too much praise for the stories being interwoven when they barely seems to be
books,not_removed,i personally think the book is much better than the movie part of the brilliance of the book in my opinion is how mitchell manages to weave different stories in different genres into one novel the movie doesnt do a great job distinguishing between the genres of each story the scifi neoseoul story and the postapocalyptic story have a very similar tone the movie also makes a crucial change to the neoseoul storyline
books,not_removed,the only part thats actually better in the movie is the part that takes place in hawaii
books,not_removed,i had the same issue i love the movie but it took me viewings to get everything tough to get others to do when its hours long the book is quite different it goes past future back to the past it doesnt jump around like the movie
books,not_removed,yes by far my favorite david mitchell book the others are good this one is fantastic
books,not_removed,the book is always better then the movie
books,not_removed,check out the audiobook if youre into them its amazing
books,not_removed,i loved it so much one of my favorite books although the ending was my least favorite part
books,not_removed,agreed i really liked it at the start and liked it less and less as it went on i loved cloud atlas
books,not_removed,its on my to be read shelf
books,not_removed,its a trippy book but in all the right ways
books,not_removed,agree this book is a real treat
books,not_removed,awesome i will add it to my list of books to read thanks for the reply
books,not_removed,i havent really tried audio books but i have been thinking about it maybe this would be a good start
books,not_removed,the ending was my favourite chapter apart from the first one i liked bone clocks more than cloud atlas although ca was amazing too i found it a bit hard to follow maybe i need to reread
books,not_removed,check out the audiobook if youre into them its insanely good
books,not_removed,i actually went and bought the book on lunch im excited to crack into it tonight
books,not_removed,enjoy
books,not_removed,awesome to see jawbreaker on this list
books,not_removed,singularity by william sleater
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules your post is better suited for asking in rwhatsthatbook or rtipofmytongue
books,not_removed,wow okay that book kept me up all night finishing and that morning was the northridge quake oy timeline was a much better book than movie which is too bad i think it was too nuanced to translate well but all of crichtons filmed novels have been done well i wonder whether its him
books,not_removed,this makes me feel old and sad lost world is also a great read he spends less time on background so theres more action im a big crichton fan so ill go ahead and recommend like all of his other books i really like micro and timeline and did not care as much for the andromeda strain
books,not_removed,speaking of which rosemarys baby
books,not_removed,damn i always thought it was an original movie story i guess you learn something new everyday
books,not_removed,i remember reading the hunt for red october on holiday once never read another crichton since it was just so boring all the technical data that didnt do anything for the story so much detail about which not to care girl with the dragon tattoo did a similar thing and much worse things but thats another post at least the movies spared us all the research notes edit oops need to fact check my own opinions
books,not_removed,yeah i was a bit young for the chaos and computer stuff but i read it when i heard about the movie coming out kids these days
books,not_removed,i felt like lost world was written specifically to be made into a sequel and felt cheap in comparison to jurassic park it lacked a lot of the detail soul of the original ill totally second many of crichtons other works that were turned into mostly meh movies sphere congo andromeda strain the terminal man and timeline were all awesome
books,not_removed,me to i cant even remember where i found it out
books,not_removed,the hunt for red october was tom clancy not michael crichton
books,not_removed,i can see the lack of detail being an issue for some but im an action freak so i could probably deal with it
books,not_removed,ive been reading them back to back every couple of years for quite a while now so you might be right and i didnt notice i mean its pretty obvious when you consider s rumors of malcolms death being greatly exaggerated
books,not_removed,probably anywhere because its not an obscure fact and almost everyone knows of it
books,not_removed,thanks for clearing that up for a second i thought i had alzheimers
books,not_removed,do you need a physical book or an ebook will do does it have to be in english

books,not_removed,what books really made you love reading as a kid
books,not_removed,given how much comedy youre written id love to know who you think of as your comic influences or favorite comediennes ians who should i be watching and reading to sharpen my sense of humor
books,not_removed,can you tell us about your cats
books,not_removed,hi jody thanks for doing an ama with us im most curious about your cowriting experiences in particular im interested in knowing how other authors themes and tropes come through when youre working with them do you find yourself having to walk back or modify anything theyve written or is that even a part of your process also what is your favorite editionversion of dd or favorite setting and who is your favorite superhero i will accept dcmarvel preference if you cant narrow it down to one or two
books,not_removed,do you think new lighthearted adventures in fantasy realms have a chance against the current trend of darker bloody works
books,not_removed,hey jody as a wannabe writer myself and very much in love with fantasy and sci fi my ultimate goal is to somehow unite the two in one story what sort of advice can you share about the writing process i struggle with finishing my stories i get to the climax just fine but during certain mundane parts of the writing moving the characters or setting up action i lose interest and stop any tips on how to be prolific and finish stories
books,not_removed,is it possible that phil foglio might work with you on the myth adventures series whats your favorite rpg system favorite campaign favorite character
books,not_removed,do you have a database of unused punnish titles
books,not_removed,im a huge fan of yours ad well ss robert adprins the mccadles books nsf a very fifteenth feel to them then other books written by you or bob was there a lot of outlining involved in them
books,not_removed,hey jody do you have any predictions on how the publishing industry will changeevolve over the next five years
books,not_removed,are you related to bill nye
books,not_removed,the moment i realized that the black marks on the page meant something i was intrigued i learned to read at three while in the hospital the nurses read to me a lot from all kinds of books then told me i could read to myself when they were too busy to sit with me my earliest favorites were the little golden books so pretty with tales suitable for small children the first one i read by myself was rudolph the rednosed reindeer
books,not_removed,one of my first influences was mark twain i loved his droll approach to a very human situation even serious matters could be given a lighter touch i discovered you could tell people some very meaningful things while making them laugh try terry pratchett an incredibly wise man whose books are laughoutloud funny dave barry is a hero of mine esther friesner good friend whose chicks in chainmail anthology series brings together plenty of hilarity alex shvartzman and his explaining cthulhu to grandma is another droll approach to sf and fantasy on television go back to the and carol burnett dick van dyke and any other comic shows that were based on wit instead of humiliation i hate most sitcoms because of that and mel brooks and gene wilder humorists i adore above all others blazing saddles and young frankenstein are wonderful and chaotic and fun
books,not_removed,at present we only have one cat jeremy hes fifteen a genuine texas longtail hes shy but very affectionate although he hates to be picked up doesnt mean he doesnt get picked up and kissed he snuggles at all opportunities and sleeps in the crook of my arm at night i have always had black cats hes the only one with any white on him a locket mark on his chest and a starbellied sneechtype mark on his lower tummy hes much too smart for his own good he knows there are things he doesnt know and it troubles him
books,not_removed,most important question right here pictures are encouraged
books,not_removed,collaboration can be a wonderful thing i have worked with some of the best i started to work with a few of the worst but those stories and books will never see daylight alas when i am working in someone elses universe i do my best to understand the underpinnings of the milieu i follow those rules but theres plenty of scope to expand even in a tight little picture frame where we are creating a world together i try to be open to my collaborators ideas if they dont match my vision i ask of course there is plenty of walking back in a twoperson work because of sheer misunderstanding or pure simultaneous writing i stopped playing dd actively while it was still add my favorite superheroes were probably the legion of superheroes black panther the thing iron man as portrayed by robert downey jr christopher reeves superman and i am falling in love with the new spiderman hes adorable
books,not_removed,now more than ever during the great depression movie comedies helped people who were down because they had lost their jobs and homes or had wounds or ptsd from wwi personally i dont like dystopias i prefer uplifting stories i intend to be the anodyne to the evening news please come to me if you need cheering up thats my intent i know there are people who love the schaden freude of the dark bloody works if it bleeds it leads applies to more than just the news producers will always go to something that is extreme and dangerous than the lighthearted all i can do is be there when it becomes too much
books,not_removed,there shouldnt be any boring parts in your story if you are losing interest writing it you can bet your readers will be bored too examine those sections and figure out why youre stopping ask yourself if those scenes really need to be there or can you incorporate those actions into a scene you do want to write perhaps you need to simplify your process do you outline or do you do what i do and create an infodump that acts as a rough format for the story ahead do you come up with your plot first or your characters sometimes what is wrong is that you have your focus on the wrong character whose story is it btw there really is no combination of sf and fantasy in the same story if you introduce an impossible element its fantasy no matter what the trappings are science fiction relies upon scientific fact and process to bring about the conclusion of the story if you know enough about science and the way the characters think you should be able to predict a little of the way they will solve their problem and good luck
books,not_removed,ill be the only writer from here on out in the mythadventures i would love to work with phil wed have to talk about whether he has time to do more illustration on a myth project he and bob expanded another fine myth in the graphic novel so well well have to see
books,not_removed,of course i do the next one that is probably going to appear is aint mythbehavin
books,not_removed,thank you im so glad you enjoy our work i cant say about the books written by bob the project only came into my hands after bob died the publisher who had been bobs editor since the very first myth book was as broken up about his passing as i was but two weeks later the second dragons book appeared on my doorstep to edit because there was no one else sometime later she got in touch to ask if i would take over that series as i had already agreed to do with the mythadventures my dragons books dragons deal in spite of the cover bob did not write any of it and dragons run were heavily outlined because of the timelines i had to make certain that the events with regard to mardi gras and the krewes or the pool tournament and val had to overlap properly i did a lot of research both reading his books closely although not closely enough theres one oops i will fix later talking to the people he knew reading history of new orleans the french quarter visiting the museums and sites down there and working all of that into a story that was funny touching terrifying exciting and with that ineffable bobism that made his work so wonderful what does a very fifteenth feel mean
books,not_removed,i had an interesting conversation with mike resnick a few years ago he thinks that if anything is going to disappear it will be the massmarket paperback i could agree with him if youre not aware of the policy bookstore chains have of dealing with mm books you will be horrified theyre free to order as many books as they want for their stores if the copies dont sell they rip the front covers off and send them back to the publisher for credit it costs almost more than their value to ship them back the body of the book is supposed to be pulped although one distributor whom i shall not name notoriously used ripped books in his furnace to heat his warehouse but i have seen them turn up in dime stores and charity shops this is so wasteful and if you see any of these books for sale please report them to the publisher on the verso page its illegal trade paperbacks otoh must be returned intact and in salable condition for the bookstores to receive credit within that stricture the chains are much more careful with their ordering until the mm policy is changed small books except tsr paperbacks always sold as trade are endangered hardcovers are under the same policy some chains sell unsold tp and hc at a discount after their initial newness has worn off discounting wasnt allowed for a long time so i think paper books will still exist but in a fullyreturnable or discountable form ebooks otoh will survive and thrive i was chary at first about ebooks because there was no good way for the author to get paid now im all for it and having a thousand books on your kindle or nook or kobo is wonderful when i travel i like to have real books in my bag but when i run out of those i have a bunch of great ebooks waiting for me audio books are another terrific format i like to be read to but i am picky about the quality of the narrator some people put me to sleep even during exciting books im looking forward to future incarnations of ebooks including illustrations images gifs and minimovies music and other goodies cant wait to see what comes next
books,not_removed,i love little golden books the illustrations are so good and the stories are perfect for small kids
books,not_removed,aw a bunch of these are my heroes
books,not_removed,if you tell me how to post pics on reddit ill put some up
books,not_removed,thank you
books,not_removed,i do outline ahead of time i dont actually write until i know the ending of my story i do let my story evolve introduce new characters but im methodical everything is figured out ahead of time ive had an issue where i try to spice the boring parts up i hate them but my guinea pigs end up loving it i dont get it lol usually i can predict what parts theyll find interesting or neat but the boring parts always surprise me as they enjoy them on the points of sci fi and fantasy i understand the contradiction between the two as sci fi can explain the magic but im convinced theres gotta be away with obfuscation and some misdirection despite the fantasy being explained perhaps theres still a way for it to be full of awe and magical sci fi is only one step away from fantasy anyway
books,not_removed,lol perfect
books,not_removed,that was me having exceptionally clumsy fingers i meant to type different by my auto correct had other ideas what i had meant was it had this more serious undertone to them unlike the whimsical slap stick nature of mythadventures but i really like the way they turned out those books and your mythology series i find inspiring for my own urban fantasy i wish that a fifteenth feel meant something i like the way it sounds maybe it can mean hump day but on a lunar scale
books,not_removed,thanks jody
books,not_removed,agreed
books,not_removed,were going to have to disagree on that last point i know the end of my stories too but if something is bogging it down that tells me theres something fundamental that i havent thought through sometimes that means theres a useful subplot that i am not exploiting enough im glad your beta readers like the parts once youve slogged through them that shows that you write well why do you think parts are boring when your readers like them what do they say about those
books,not_removed,autocorrect has a mind of its own have you ever gone to the site damn you autocorrect httpwwwdamnyouautocorrectcom they are much more serious for years bob wanted to reach past laughoutloud comedy and delve into darker subjects i like them too there are still laughs like the crossdressing werewolf but the stories have consequences not everyone gets up again from the fights it was a chance for me to stretch my storytelling muscles too i only wish i had been able to work with him but ill tell you frankly that i hadnt even read the dragons books before he died i was too busy on other projects including the myth collabs thanks im glad you find myth and mythology inspiring
books,not_removed,well for example our satellite system starts to crash and burn in the atmosphere small pieces of metal pepper a small rural town a local housewife her son and her father in law fear for their safety unknown to her the father in law knows exactly whats going on but instead of being honest plays along and convinces her they need to head to a safe house in the middle of a major city despite her husband being due to return any minute she finds the whole thing fishy but he spins a good story and reassures her her husband will join the family and they need to get moving at this point in the story things have been exciting ive introduced the characters given back stories shards of metal are falling from the sky etc the next stage involves the family driving to the safe house which i think is boring theyre on the highway shes trying to get the truth out of him but theyre just drivingfor a whilesame with the husband i want to so badly take out this chapter of them driving but my beta readers insist on me keeping it because it shows them how much of a liar and manipulator the father in law is and how strong the mother is i spiced up this boring segment of them driving on the highway by adding an interesting phenomenon a horrible sound is being emitted from somewhere in the city theyre driving to the closer you get the more it feels like a sound is drilling into your brain eventually knocking out individuals but triggering a primal urge to run away from the cities as they drive everyone but the father in law hears it and the husband because of his traits straight muscles through it on the verge of passing out she hears him panic and say this isnt how it was supposed to go meanwhile the road ahead of them is filled with abandoned cars and people running away from where theyre driving still im not confident this is a strong chapter another chapter has the husband finally arriving at the safe house and cautiously exploring it boring to me my readers enjoyed it do i need new more critical readers lol edit i would love to discuss the similarities of fantasy and sci fi and my foolish dream of uniting the two but in another forum and another time of course
books,not_removed,what your readers are telling you is that the scene has a purpose and they understand it all scenes have up to three purposes to advance the story tell you something about the characters or to raise tension it helps if all three are involved

books,not_removed,i remember this book my government teacher gave one to everybody at the beginning of the year i still have it
books,not_removed,if youre looking for a more indepth resource that goes a little into how the constitution ive been enjoying the heritage guide to the constitution not very expensive and it gives some perspective to the text
books,not_removed,in grade my social studies teacher gave out so many of these lol
books,not_removed,loads of people are buying it but lets be honest will anyone read it
books,not_removed,this sounds like an rnottheonion article
books,not_removed,i actually own this
books,not_removed,note for mr trumpthere are only articles for the rest of us please remember that the constitution as currently published doesnt reflect the original documents wording theres a lot of history lost if you only know the current text and the amendments
books,not_removed,i feel like all politicians could use one of these
books,not_removed,we should send it to trump
books,not_removed,or internet
books,not_removed,made in china
books,not_removed,my history teacher gave us these
books,not_removed,haha amazing
books,not_removed,thats surprisingly encouraging
books,not_removed,call your us reps office and they will mail you one for free
books,not_removed,maybe he should have mentioned how the democrats completely removed mention of the amendment from their party platform i doubt donald trump is well versed in the us constitution but its a bit hypocritical to be calling him out for it while at the dnc
books,not_removed,now they just need a pocket bill of rights app pokamend go gotta inalienate em all
books,not_removed,ive carried one of these in my backpack and later my car for years
books,not_removed,my apush teacher gives one to every one of his students and tells them to always keep it still have it nearly years later brother is going on years
books,not_removed,kindle edition is free
books,not_removed,i ordered a pair of brand pants online when i tried them on there was something in the pocket happened to be a glossy pocket constitution on my desk ever since idk if this is a business practice or just someones returned pants i ended up with
books,not_removed,as a nonamerican keep i advice you to keep your constitution sacred we dont want another imperial tyrant again
books,not_removed,i was given a pocket constitutiondeclaration of independencemajor supreme court case rulings by my grade government teacher incredibly useful especially when i would yank it out in relevant public forum debate rounds
books,not_removed,somewhere in the us its somebodys job to sell these things and they are elated that theyll finally be getting a bonus and a raise this year
books,not_removed,established judicial review
books,not_removed,holy crap the nra is right the amendment does exist why did i not read this myself until now
books,not_removed,well then technically no one has final say under that argument thats the system we set up where there is a check on everyones power including the people
books,not_removed,i have one i think every american should read it
books,not_removed,when i first was taught about the us constitution i assumed it means what it says i was wrong it means what the supreme court says it means
books,not_removed,i suddenly want one too even though im not american
books,not_removed,i dont read copies
books,not_removed,thats awesome now if we can find a democrat that actually believes in it and but nominees for scotus that also believe in the constitution we might be moving in positive direction if that happens i may rejoin the democratic party yeah right
books,not_removed,a lot of those people are going to be shocked to find out owing guns is a constitutional right
books,not_removed,put me down for two i will not be outpatrioted
books,not_removed,definitely want to pick one up now
books,not_removed,neat can i expect support for anti bully and other speech limiting laws anti gun laws and support for warrentless information gathering to protect our freedoms at a federal level to dry up once people read the constitution also that people stop consider voting for the president is the same as selecting an all poweful king that people spend more time paying attention to congress then the president since they have far greater power finally that people stop expecting federal laws to trump state laws for matters that would only apply to citizens of that state also will majority of people who buy a pocket constitution finally understand the real reason for electoral college is not because it took time to move the state results by horse in the late century but to give small states representation in who is commander and chief since this is a union of states not one giant state also hopefully we can have a call for a constitutional convention to add things like term limits to congress
books,not_removed,that particular pocket version has a page or two at the beginning of quotes and such that are meant to mislead the reader into concluding that the constitution was a christian document
books,not_removed,man ive been carrying around a pocket constitution for years and now its cool gah
books,not_removed,they really should be giving away pocket summaries of constitutional law cases you cant intuit the body of contemporary constitutional law by reading the original constitution but hey literal interpretations of century documents arent destined to be inapplicable to contemporary problems right
books,not_removed,this is so stupid as are most of these comments holy shit people
books,not_removed,plot twist trump owns the company that prints these in china
books,not_removed,wonder if theyve already crossed out the yet in those versions
books,not_removed,awesome i hope lots of people read it and actually what is really in it so that they know its not about building wallsalienating a religion making up constitutional facts or some ladys email
books,not_removed,i wonder how relevant the original document truly is at this point the courts will twist those words to mean whatever it is they want to mean some constitutional scholars say the death penalty violates the amendment yet the death penalty was clearly used and supported by the government that put together the bill of rights and lets not even get started on the amendment
books,not_removed,i kinda want one
books,not_removed,filthy casuals cato institute kicked down my copy years ago
books,not_removed,im sure theres an app for that good grief dont get on the aclu mailing list
books,not_removed,the democrats should be giving these away
books,not_removed,sad that it takes a speech attacking a political opponent to read the constitution hopefully everyone reading it realizes how far away for our founding fathers weve moved
books,not_removed,people pay for this they give it away for free at my college or you can just google it
books,not_removed,it was the most incredible speech
books,not_removed,why is it sold shouldnt it be a thing that is just available to everyone that wants one like a religious text unless there are free versions out there
books,not_removed,uh oh when people get these read the republicans are in trouble
books,not_removed,mr khan apparently doesnt understand the document he claims to hold in such high esteem it conveys no right on foreigners to emigrate to the us equal protection is only guaranteed to individuals within the jurisdiction of a state
books,not_removed,do you get little flags you can wave while reading your little red white and blue book
books,not_removed,he should have given it to hillary and obama
books,not_removed,thanks
books,not_removed,but the aclu are liberals and if watching years of fox news taught me anything is liberals hate the constitution
books,not_removed,whats the code
books,not_removed,thats probably so they can capture your name address etc to solicit funds from you
books,not_removed,who would want a free pamphlet to be bombarded with advertisements and spam from the aclu for an eternity
books,not_removed,thank you just picked one up because of your comment
books,not_removed,thanks for the heads up
books,not_removed,larue tactical also sends free copies when you place an order
books,not_removed,is it a limited time offer
books,not_removed,freehmmm i might consider this now since it wouldnt be giving money to the church of lds
books,not_removed,the code is pocketrights free shipping its actually free thank you
books,not_removed,yeah the actual words of the constitution are like of constitutional law possibly less
books,not_removed,i recommend reading the federalist papers the compilation of articles written by james madison and others to explain and advocate for the constitution
books,not_removed,but the first two are a great way to get to that third step
books,not_removed,buying spaghetti making spaghetti and eating spaghetti are three different things
books,not_removed,obviously but why not just hope that the people buying it are hoping to read and then understand it
books,not_removed,preach preach
books,not_removed,bible
books,not_removed,httpswwwcongressgovconstitutionannotated will go a long way towards actually understanding it
books,not_removed,kind of like the bible
books,not_removed,correct if people want to understand it i suggest they take jeffersons advice and read some of the ratifying convention transcripts
books,not_removed,owning it helps though
books,not_removed,sounds like the bible
books,not_removed,you could have just bought the book
books,not_removed,how long did were you married to your wife till she was able to apply for and become a citizen
books,not_removed,yeah i got one for free just this friday free tiny us flag too
books,not_removed,same version as that depicted in ops accompanying image was she given her copy by a government official was it paid for with tax dollars handing out a constitution would be a great way of publicly welcoming new citizens
books,not_removed,that is where i got mine its now on my front door
books,not_removed,and that the biggest power they have right now is nominating biased supreme court justices
books,not_removed,i dont think equal is the right word to describe the branches parallel maybe but when the constitution was originally written it was intended for congress to be the most powerful branch and the judiciary to be the least powerful
books,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiheadofgovernment literally means the head of the executive branch of government unless theres a position that is technically higher but without as much actual power like the queen or a governorgeneral the president is also the head of state
books,not_removed,thats the thing all these presidential candidates say they canwill do things that are of the time out of their power as president
books,not_removed,worth bearing that in mind whenever the republicans try and act like theyve been out of power for eight years and that the president is to blame for every problem theyve had the house for ages and now the senate too not to mention and fairly conservative court too
books,not_removed,the executive branch has the power to move an aircraft carrier wherever thats an immense amount of power to be at the head of our military
books,not_removed,seriously everyone complains that the president is messed up but in reality your legislation elections determine of what everyone complains about the presidents major concern is international relations
books,not_removed,this i have an annotated copy of the constitution that i have in my house that is about years old i got a copy as part of my high school civics class and its filled with notes and notes about notable supreme court cases and other significant information i know im a nerd but i still take time to read through it from time to time even though i have the constitution pretty memorized in my head every time someone talks about the presidential election and about the candidate in general all i want to do is tell them to open the constitution and understand the division of government
books,not_removed,thanks a lot
books,not_removed,you gave an equal opportunity pot shot but now tread in the negatives take you sense of humor home apparently im bringing you back to even
books,not_removed,httpwwwusconstitutionnetconstpdf
books,not_removed,makes sense its the document that soldiers swear to uphold in their enlistment oath
books,not_removed,rotc instructors love these apparently mine gave these out every year i appreciated the gesture though it was jrotc and a lot of students had somehow gained very little understanding of the constitution by grade
books,not_removed,i want to start a pyramid scheme where i sell these to raging conservatives to then sell to their friends itd be like mary kay for people who watch fox news
books,not_removed,khaaaaannn
books,not_removed,careful now about khizr khan you wouldnt want to incurthe wrath of khizr
books,not_removed,you leave khan out of this another great man
books,not_removed,ive had mine in my backpack since college going on years now
books,not_removed,boy scout
books,not_removed,while is important is the real winning number
books,not_removed,any secret maps
books,not_removed,honestly i wouldnt be surprised if half of them havent read the damn thing
books,not_removed,was the copy his office sent you the same as that in ops accompanying image
books,not_removed,my data caps shall not be infringed
books,not_removed,khan pulls smartphone out of breast pocket and holds it up to camera accidentally presses camera button and temporarily blinds self with flash
books,not_removed,i feel like by a conservative estimate its pretty likely that america has always consistently followed at least half the constitution at any given time a lot of it is just boilerplate stuff setting up the structure of government which weve generally followed
books,not_removed,also that sweet sweet dillo dust shits good
books,not_removed,got one of these the other day when i ordered a product from pmaca pretty cool
books,not_removed,is that tactical seasoning and was it actually something you ordered or was it just a freebee they popped in the box
books,not_removed,ive got a bonein pork butt rubbed with dillo dust sitting in the smoker as we speak wth might as well use my tactical dillo to open a cold adult beverage as well
books,not_removed,httpwwwcatoorgmultimediamediahighlightstvlibertarianvicepresidentialcandidatebillweldshowscato
books,not_removed,i never understood that point of view there is already a process of amendment if we decide it needs to change
books,not_removed,these exact ones copies who was handing them out
books,not_removed,by one of these do you mean the actual version depicted in ops image
books,not_removed,wonder how many ended up being used as roach paper
books,not_removed,yeah ron paul was doing it way back but dennis kucinich on the in stands out in my mind the most pocket constitution used tea bags other random stuff he carried on him
books,not_removed,khizer khan at the dnc sentenceparagraph of the article
books,not_removed,this isnt about hillarys emails it has no place on rpolitics
books,not_removed,theyll have to figure out a way to blame this on clinton and make it a bad thing first
books,not_removed,this would be an appropriate comparison of the catholics didnt have a different version of the bible than protestants
books,not_removed,printed by a group that published a textbook that httpsenwikipediaorgwikinationalcenterforconstitutionalstudiesthemakingofamericacontroversy holy crap
books,not_removed,not just american citizens i got one while travelling the us a few months back i dont even own the constitution of my own country
books,not_removed,by one of these books do you mean the same pocketsized version depicted in ops accompanying image
books,not_removed,he couldnt figure out the first amendment at a basic level i doubt he gives a shit about the rest at all
books,not_removed,by these do you mean copies of those depicted in ops accompanying photo
books,not_removed,its funny anyone should fall for that after they read the amendment i actually think it is the first two sentences of the amendment
books,not_removed,i thought that wasnt going to trial
books,not_removed,regardless of whos publishing it its either the constitution or it isnt
books,not_removed,they didnt write the thing
books,not_removed,whats so stupid about giving out pocket constitutions
books,not_removed,article section clause congress has the power to establish an uniform rule of naturalization that covers wall building and keeping muslims out
books,not_removed,the thing is scotus was never intended to be the final word thats actually a role scotus assigned to themselves the intention was for congress to come back around and rewrite laws to comply with the constitution but as is today illegal legislation from the bench is expected thats why everyone is so concerned about the upcoming scotus appointments which would be seriously mitigated if congress actuality did their job and dont get me started on nullification
books,not_removed,there are the aclu gives them away for free your representatives gives them for free upon request
books,not_removed,you can get one for free from many sources as many people have already pointed out as for why its sold the text itself is free and not copyrighted or anything youre paying for a physical copy to be printed and shipped directly to you also religious texts do the same thing sure you can get a free bible from just about any church you step into but if you start looking for a nicer version say leatherbound with gold leaf on the outside of the pages or a large format for older eyes then youll end up paying for those extras
books,not_removed,he could have been talking about that freedom of religion thing
books,not_removed,so native americans then gotcha
books,not_removed,have you seen the dnc it was a giant murica cringefest i guess they are trying to appeal to nationalist republicans who cant imagine voting for the trumpster
books,not_removed,i understand that some people hate the us but what is wrong with learning
books,not_removed,apparently education isnt everything then
books,not_removed,its on their website but just in case pocketrights is the code
books,not_removed,obviously thats why theyre trying to get rid of them so badly
books,not_removed,in fairness and this may not win me many friends here but they hold a position on the second amendment that is counter to individual rights affirmed by the supreme court youd think a civil liberties union would like all civil liberties afforded to them
books,not_removed,buddy that there sounds like a true partisan hate speech ifn i never heard one before
books,not_removed,aclu constitution they are mostly for it probably just a little forgetful
books,not_removed,pretty sure most people can look at the aclu and objectively decide they lean to the left but gotta get those free erhmahgerd fox news upvotes
books,not_removed,thanks for eroding the quality of this thread and subreddit
books,not_removed,whew thanks for reminding me i was about to get one really dodged a bullet there
books,not_removed,does anyone else see the irony of his sarcasm
books,not_removed,the constitution stands in the way of the utopia fox news is right about that
books,not_removed,considering censorship on the first amendment and attempts at curtailing the im actually great with them polishing up on it
books,not_removed,pocketrights
books,not_removed,and their emails will go to the spam folder and their mailers into the trash just like everyone elses got a neat pocket constitution though
books,not_removed,if that was true they wouldnt let you opt out during checkout
books,not_removed,you can opt out
books,not_removed,did you know americans use less than of their constitution
books,not_removed,after years of case law spent interpreting the thing its easy to argue that its far less than
books,not_removed,i like to think of the constitution as a table of contents to constitutional law
books,not_removed,have you read it they are like one one hundredth the second amendment alone is a great example theres hundreds of decisions that now define the law as well as many important supreme court opinions that pretty much define every word of it the actual second amendment twenty seven words hell theres probably over two thousand words been written about a single comma in the second amendment so just on a single comma its almost not even a hundredth of the writing
books,not_removed,and others ignoring the founding father without a father james madison alexander hamilton and john jay hamilton wrote the most though iirc its widely agreed that madison wrote the more important ones especially with regards to the topic constitutional law
books,not_removed,dont read them without reading the antifederalist papers too
books,not_removed,this is my bathroom reader number is perhaps my favorite piece of political writing ever
books,not_removed,hamilton wrote of the articles and james madison is the guy you mentioned okay
books,not_removed,watching baseball throwing a baseball and catching a baseball are three different things
books,not_removed,true so one should not simply buy spaghetti and go around claiming theyre eating it
books,not_removed,steps are things
books,not_removed,well three special steps thats all you need the key is to follow those special steps
books,not_removed,the bible cannot be understood as it makes no sense
books,not_removed,the bible makes no sense it cannot be understood
books,not_removed,i will wait for the movie
books,not_removed,you must think i am made of money like trump
books,not_removed,since ive gone through this is can answer years its not instant like in the movies depending what status you are before resident perm resident or even visa the paperwork mountain grows its also crazy expensive people who are naturalized want to be a citizen i swear half the process and cost is just to dissuade you and they dig through your background like crazy any run ins with any law enforcement is an issue even a parking ticket if you ever meet someone naturalized thats an american they wanted it
books,not_removed,my wife went through the process as quickly as she could submitting all forms and going to interviews as soon as possible it still took three years people who think we just have open immigration are really misinformed my wife and i went to college together and lived together before being married we submitted paperwork showing common leases phone accounts and utility bills they still werent convinced we had to further submit wedding photos and photos of us throughout the three years to establish that we were married and together that whole time
books,not_removed,you need to be a permanent resident for years have a green card and be married for years to be able to become a us citizen through marriage
books,not_removed,i have been married for years but as listed in uscis website years for a spouse of citizen after she becomes permanent resident years for an individual permanent resident to become a citizen
books,not_removed,congrats dont forget to wave that flag all the way home
books,not_removed,umm its not just supreme court nominees though given the current makeup its certainly of great import its also every federal appointment who control vast amounts of delegated legislative power plus you know the whole deploy armed forces anywhere in the world for any reason for thirty days before any official congressional ability to reverse said decision
books,not_removed,i dont know if youre being passive aggressive or not i cant really tell but it has always been this way nothing new
books,not_removed,curiously the supreme courts power of rejecting laws as unconstitutional isnt in there it is a power the supreme court appropriated in its early years thank god
books,not_removed,and pardoning criminals
books,not_removed,but only for the first of their term
books,not_removed,i would say executive order
books,not_removed,which to be fair packing the courts has been a thing since the first president adams thats been a big partisan power for a very very long time its not something new
books,not_removed,and that the biggest power they have right now is nominating biased supreme court justices the gop doesnt care about that part the president can nominate people all day long but theyre not going to confirm anyone obstructionism
books,not_removed,well except for being the head of the military and responsible for actions of all departments of the executive branch cia nsa etc
books,not_removed,until john jay and john marshall were like look at me i am the captain now
books,not_removed,i remember the bush years do you it seems like back then the left thought the president was an emperor now they think hes a powerless figurehead what happened
books,not_removed,theyve had the house since and the senate since
books,not_removed,somehow education system is biased and only educates a narrative
books,not_removed,is that anything like jrpg
books,not_removed,you still carry your backpack from college any forgotten sandwiches in there too
books,not_removed,has it ever left your backpack or is that a sort of personal portable archive museum
books,not_removed,sounds like youre one of the west wing pocket constitution bandwagoners
books,not_removed,no my ap us history teacher made us and i kinda kept doing it
books,not_removed,were pretty good at following the third amendment without any question
books,not_removed,first amendment were doing okay on some significant violations that arent really enforced so no big deal second amendment is being violated everywhere amendment were following completely and are being flagrantly violated were doing pretty good on has been violated significantly recently were following pretty well and we pretty much shit on so we have a success rating at upholding the bill of rights
books,not_removed,i think it is generally because they are younger people that do not have any sense of history and the importance of the document
books,not_removed,dude you cant expect me to read the article when ive got like comments to slog through
books,not_removed,there is nothing overly difficult about understanding the constitution the years of case law are what fucked it up and the idea that us common peasants cant possibly know what the constitution means is part of the problem
books,not_removed,there are some introductory pages that proselytize for theism and say the constitution was a religious document
books,not_removed,what are you going to do with a pocket constitution that you cant just do online it isnt like the us constitution isnt publicly available right now by just googling us constitution
books,not_removed,so we we should totally disrgard the first amendment and discriminate against a specific religion i thought freedom of religion was a thing i dont see that in article section they could restrict who comes from what countries but not based on religion also unless the wall sinks into the earth most people are smuggled into the us via tunnels under the border
books,not_removed,the supreme courts power of judicial review is an implied power if you read marbury v madison
books,not_removed,understood
books,not_removed,freedom of religion also doesnt apply to people who have not yet come to the us
books,not_removed,all million of us
books,not_removed,what was the rnc in your opinion and for the record the national conventions are always pep rallies thats how its been for decades
books,not_removed,obama was a law professor the university of chicago law school the law school that employed him even refers to him as such obama was a senior lecturer at chicago senior lecturers are considered to be members of the law school faculty and are regarded as professors chicago also states that several times during his years as a professor in the law school obama was invited to join the faculty in a fulltime tenuretrack position but he declined httpwwwlawuchicagoedumedia also it generally doesnt take years to become an assistant professor if you get hired on in a fulltime position youre generally given an assistant professor position so it is in many ways an entrylevel academic position which nowadays is very rarely a tenuretrack position however it often does take years to land an associate professor job because those jobs are much more frequently tenuretrack positions the increasing number of adjuncts and lecturers is less of an indication that assistant professorship isnt an entrylevel academic job and more of an indication that the academic market is at overcapacity and has thus spawned many lower paying parttime positions to take advantage of being at overcapacity if the market loses some of its saturation those parttime jobs will disappear quickly and well again be left with assistant professorships as the primary entrylevel base for academia
books,not_removed,rants about people down voting him knowing nothing manages to know even less himself great job
books,not_removed,here is the link just in case httpsshopacluorgproductaclupocketconstitutionoftheunitedstates use the promotion code pocketrights
books,not_removed,thanks
books,not_removed,lol thanks
books,not_removed,donated and received a free pocket us constitution good deal
books,not_removed,sweet thanks
books,not_removed,holy crap im from new zealand and the coupon code worked when i finished the order i hope they actually ship the copy to here i have always been interested in studying the us constitution so im quite excited for its arrival
books,not_removed,looks like the code may no longer be working it says code not recognized for me
books,not_removed,audibly laughed good one
books,not_removed,god damn it kyle i need to get rid of these constitutions now whats next on the gay agenda
books,not_removed,from a constitutional perspective we know it to be an amendable document the being an amendment itself i have no problem with a civil liberties organization believing in a different interpretation or wishing to change a part of it edit the mass downvotes are cool and all but stifling conversation is not the way to protect and convey your beliefs
books,not_removed,what individual right to be perfectly honest a plan text reading of the second amendment says i have the right to own a nuclear missile or a hellfire missile or a abrams tank when people talk about restricting arms were all just talking about levels of severity so are you claiming to piss on the second amendment less if so ill give that to you but i dont exactly think you have the moral high ground
books,not_removed,i recognize the legitimacy of your complaint as a supporter of the aclu i reconcile that stance with the fact that the second amendment has very vigilant defenders and those groups that vehemently defend the amendment have stood in silence while the and amendments have been gutted you have to pick your battles and the aclus stance on the second amendment makes sense to me at least in that context
books,not_removed,theyve actually opposed most recent legislation trying to tighten background checks specifically they argue that any legislation tied to a terrorist watch list is unconstitutional because it does not satisfy the due process requirement which is absolutely correct
books,not_removed,they hold a position on the second amendment that is counter to individual rights affirmed by the supreme court they dont have an official position at all do they thats not exactly counter also the second amendment is in better shape than pretty much all the rest amendment ftw so its not completely unreasonable that they dont wade into the political morass that is gun policy
books,not_removed,this election season ive been watching a ton of fox news and msnbc and cnn and there are a couple things i have noticed fox news uses a lot of fear mongering and depending on the anchor it is either extreme and in your face or a little subverssive i enjoy fox because in addition to this they seem to actually discuss issues and i see attempts to try and dissect problems within the party msnbc i try so hard to watch i notice a significant amount of denial and i guess what i would describe as the equivelant of putting fingers in your ears and humming to ignore the world around them if any news organization is biased msnbc has an extreme and obvious agenda cnn is a very good mix and generally in the middle i like cnn when i dont feel like watching the denial and complete hypocrisy of msnbc of the doom and gloom of fox anyways i may be wrong
books,not_removed,please enlighten me about the censorship on the first amendment
books,not_removed,this would be a great idea the new luc bensonscarlet johannson film the average american uses of their constitution imagine what she could do with
books,not_removed,this is my favorite
books,not_removed,well sure as the doj itself says
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,yep and this is ignoring all of the state and regional case law on top of it knowing the constitution is important but it wont get you anywhere near understanding of all constitutional law
books,not_removed,i would argue theres more than given how much of our laws were based on common law of brittain ive heard some civil rights cases had discussions of rights stretching back well before
books,not_removed,interpreting
books,not_removed,after years of case law spent interpreting the thing its easy to argue that its far less than with the really creative interpretations in the case law commerce clause etc you could argue that its more like heck httpinvestmentwatchblogcomthefbihascirculatedtopolicedepartmentspeoplewhomakefrequentreferencetotheusconstitutionorthebillofrightsmaybeterrorists
books,not_removed,meh depends on how you figure the number there are large sections which will never be litigated because either they explain things in such a basic way that it will never be enough to challenge someone on or because the supreme court only ever says that they are not allowed to for some reason
books,not_removed,damn youre old
books,not_removed,how many words were written over what the definition of what is is
books,not_removed,like the fact that supreme court justices believe that a flat ban on arms does not infringe
books,not_removed,and ill take that advice into cooperation now lets say you and i go toe to toe on bird law and see who comes out victor
books,not_removed,sigh in the end they wrote essays in a span of months john jay got sick after writing james madison wrote hamilton wrote the other but yeah id call madisons more important a lot of hamiltons are basically let me tell you how goddamn genius this is
books,not_removed,and the meh im not surefederalist papers
books,not_removed,tying your left shoe tying your right shoe and wearing floppy floppys are three different things
books,not_removed,oh i just thought we were naming three things that were different
books,not_removed,hes still working on the third one
books,not_removed,easy steps to wealth and success
books,not_removed,national treasure the search for article xii
books,not_removed,yeah but you know the book will always be better
books,not_removed,no he probably isnt either
books,not_removed,im guessing there are also companies or lawyers that help you with the process or do you only deal with the us government
books,not_removed,ah the good old golf of tonkin resolution if only congress would have just repealed it all together instead of passing the war powers resolution no president should have the power to declare war even if its only for days its how we end up with messes like libya and kosovo edit libya war powers resolution
books,not_removed,eh i would argue that supreme court appointments are far more powerful than any other appointment scotus justices have traditionally had the final say in constitutional law and except for minor isolated incidents all other branches of government tend to follow their rulings without delay or complaint being head of the nsaciadept of defenseetc grants you power lots but your decisions wont have the weight of the courts only weakness of the court is that it has to address real cases and controversies whereas most agencies can make policy without being prompted
books,not_removed,like the fcc
books,not_removed,they are allowed to pardon the innocent as well
books,not_removed,yeah but governors can do that to
books,not_removed,not really an executive order can be overturned by the next republican president right the supreme court nominations amount to decades of influence over american law
books,not_removed,executive orders are simply rules that govern the executive branch the constitution names the president head of the executive branch they arent permanent in anyway and dont have the force of law so for instance w couldnt outlaw stem cell research but he could stop all federal funding for it an executive order also cant supersede law it can only clarify laws pertaining to the executive branch any law would supersede an executive order so basically the complaints about executive orders are pretty misguided as they are pretty much the weakest and most easily dismissed way of creating rules in the us government
books,not_removed,but you see thats an implied power
books,not_removed,doesnt say anywhere that they have to accept his nominee
books,not_removed,well more marshall and less jayjay left his post pretty early on
books,not_removed,they only controlled the house in bush had house backing for years
books,not_removed,thats the problem with the two party system when its your guy in power you wont admit the bad things they are doing when its not your guy you wont back the good things they are doing so they only care about the base of the party and who is giving them money
books,not_removed,theres a difference in a democratic president with a republican housesenate and a republican president with a republican housesenate
books,not_removed,it seems like back then the left thought the president was an emperor now they think hes a powerless figurehead what happened because bush was driving a war policy and obama is much more reserved in his use of the armed forces not necessarily less destructive in some ways instead delegating action to drones rather than costly ground wars nobody asked for
books,not_removed,you first comment was deleted for some reason thankfully i was able to order one first
books,not_removed,one time i forgot a banana in my backpack for months and it was all dried out and moldy and i had to throw it away
books,not_removed,several new backpacks since then constitution in all of them
books,not_removed,i still have my messenger bag from college going on seven years yakpak is a decent brand
books,not_removed,same pocket constitution as that depicted in ops accompanying image was she a public school ap teacher
books,not_removed,well considering that according to the constitution the supreme court gets to decide what the constitution means then i would say we are closer to a success rate
books,not_removed,judicial review is not the same as final word of law if you read the federalist and antifederalist papers youll see that the people is the final word period the people are represented by the republic which is our representatives which is also why the concept of nullification exists basically you confirmed what i said but based on common misunderstandings you simply didnt realize edit to be clear judicial review is in no way a point of contention in my comment to which you replied
books,not_removed,no but when you want to deport your soldiers its not a good message
books,not_removed,the rnc was a giant doomsday scenario all they talked about was how terrible and weak america is right now how we all need to be scared of terrorists and scared of immigrants and scared of china and scared of people killing cops and scared of the government taking away the right to bear arms im guessing that is why the democrats deliberately chose to go with a nationalist american exceptionalism narrative to create a positive and optimistic contrast to the rnc
books,not_removed,love
books,not_removed,great i ordered one
books,not_removed,shukran
books,not_removed,thank you very much just ordered mine for free
books,not_removed,i feel a little bad basically taking such a minuscule amount of money from the aclu but fuck it i kinda want one
books,not_removed,just ordered mine
books,not_removed,totally just ordered one thanks
books,not_removed,thank you
books,not_removed,just ordered it thank you
books,not_removed,thanks for this placed my order
books,not_removed,pocketrights hmm wonder if that would work transatlantically
books,not_removed,plus junk mail asking you to renew your membership for life
books,not_removed,some might say he laughed out loud
books,not_removed,thats not really true the aclu just has a nuanced position on campaign finance that cant be summed up as for it or against it from their website in our view the answer to that problem is to expand not limit the resources available for political advocacy thus the aclu supports a comprehensive and meaningful system of public financing that would help create a level playing field for every qualified candidate we support carefully drawn disclosure rules we support reasonable limits on campaign contributions and we support stricter enforcement of existing bans on coordination between candidates and super pacs httpswwwacluorgacluandcitizensunited
books,not_removed,redditors only care about free speech when its their speech
books,not_removed,most people have no idea what the citizens united decision actually entailed either
books,not_removed,wouldnt things just go back to the way they were before cu
books,not_removed,true but those first amendments are called the bill of rights for a reason the governing body that charter our constitution saw fit to include a bill of rights that are inalienable to the freedom of its citizens that isnt just something like prohibition it holds a little more weight i would also give more credence to the aclus position on guns of they didnt continously cite bad statistics i respect a lot of what they do and who they are and even donate to them however when they chop statistics like fox news and present them as legitimate it gets to me as much as right wingers talking about welfare queens dragging down the economy while giving out tax breaks to billion dollar corporations
books,not_removed,absolutely its okay to say that you think people shouldnt be allowed to own guns it is quite another however to say that the courts and congress should be able to make it nighimpossible to own them anything beyond basic background checks and such ought to require an amendment
books,not_removed,the right to bear arms guns for all is a relatively new interpretation too
books,not_removed,but couldnt i argue the same for the amendment then what makes conservatives that want to changeinterpret the amendment bad and liberals that want to changeinterpret the amendment good
books,not_removed,wouldnt amending the constitution cause a mass reprint of the selling pocket edition this would then fly in the face of global warming and climate change
books,not_removed,its one way
books,not_removed,i dont think its illegal to own any of those honestly the only thing prohibiting you is the fact that they contain classified components and youd be hard pressed to find someone that would sell any of those things to you i wonder if the atf would approve the construction of a destructive device if it was a nuclear bomb on a more serious note most progun people ive talked to generally agree that anything that doesnt kill indiscriminately should be legal to own ex no sam sites or nukes you can own a fully functional cold war tank in the us yet the only tank rampage committed was using a poorly locked up tank that was federally owned people with enough money to own tanks generally dont like committing murder its the ones that build killdozers in their shed to get back at their city council that you have to worry about
books,not_removed,rights have been allowed to be abridged in this us for public safety whether you are actually more safe or not public safety is also the reason police are allowed to pull over people without probable cause in those road blocks they setup to catch drink and drivers there was no evidence to support that these roadblocks actually reduce drunk driving but hey if someone with authority says they do then its ok i suppose keeping weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of the uninitiated could potentially help with public safety so no one fights this restriction
books,not_removed,arms in common law refer to light infantry weapons and if iran cant make a nuclear weapon what makes you think youd have that ability let alone afford one
books,not_removed,generally i agree although cnn has become the clinton news network more recently
books,not_removed,andrea mitchell hates hillary clinton it colors her reporting mika b from morning joe is so annoying she interrupts everyone thank goodness they will be getting rid of her soon
books,not_removed,is it bad that i think this might actually be a more interesting movie than lucy was
books,not_removed,i remember hearing this quote around the same time i learned thanks to reddit that people use significantly more than of our brains and it is a common myth
books,not_removed,shed probably dissolve and turn into the american flag
books,not_removed,scarlett johanneson is the patr wait
books,not_removed,magna carta the supreme authority
books,not_removed,man and here i was thinking i would never have to see the words commerce clause ever again after my con law final
books,not_removed,example
books,not_removed,far more after than before lol
books,not_removed,thats bc supreme court justices vote their politics instead of using their reading comprehension skills
books,not_removed,just one quick question why did he write like he was running out of time
books,not_removed,well given the original point was to defend the constitution i would say that playing it up is a viable strategy if it changes the minds of the people you need to to get it to fruition
books,not_removed,good news everything is steps now
books,not_removed,there are tons of companies and lawyers out there in all levels of quality i had an in law use a lawyer because he got busted once for speeding hes still in the approval queue we did it all ourselves the government publishes tons of pamphlets on how to fill out all the paperwork some are better than others all of the paperwork each step ends in standing in front of a clerk if that clerk has had a bad day and you filled something out wrongyoure starting over the majority of the time they would help us because it was some small box we didnt check or otherwise by far the worst part was the final citizenship stretch this ends with the oral test and an interview craig ferguson has his oral test on youtube taped it for the show this last process is hard the citizenship questions range from constitutional awareness to details most americans dont know and the interview is subjective i dont know anyone who has failed the interview part but its scary its like the most important job interview ever oh and if you want to see the happiest people on the planet go to a citizenship ceremony it is amazing
books,not_removed,you should go through an immigration lawyer its to make sure you have everything i cant remember exact numbers but it was something like for the green card
books,not_removed,kosovo actually was a success
books,not_removed,kosovo unlike afghanistan and libya we the locals actually wanted the us to intervene to try and stop the genocide against us and we didnt end up in a civil war after the intervention
books,not_removed,golf
books,not_removed,evidently libya became such a mess even their spelling got mangled
books,not_removed,supreme court appointments are more powerful but their power is much much more limited in frequency of use the supreme court only hears about cases a year and only one or two of them will actually be important enough to impact national policy meanwhile by appointing the heads of everyone from the fcc to the fda fbi nsa cdc nasa etc etc the president has directly affected the tens of thousands of decisions recommendations and guidelines that affect every aspect of the economy the average american just living their life and doing everyday things is affected everyday by so many regulations and practices that were passed down via the federal agencies meanwhile most people arent too personally affected by this years rulings like williams v pennsylvania that deals with legal biases in criminal proceedings of capital punishment not saying thats not important just saying most americans are not affected in the same way the fda rulings affects them
books,not_removed,the executive order isnt the power that will have the longest lasting effect but they tend to affect people more during the presidents term
books,not_removed,i agree with the idea that the power of executive orders is a bit overstated presently but the issue is the efforts in the last few presidents to continually expand these
books,not_removed,thats odd i thought the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution were reserved to the states and the people
books,not_removed,no but it does say the senate must give advice and consent meaning they have to come to a decision the negative impact of obstructionism is undeniable just accept or reject garland easy
books,not_removed,doesnt say anywhere that they have to accept his nominee certainly not they should follow the process thats been established for when a president nominates a justice though if the senators feel that there is an issue they can vote the nomination down
books,not_removed,justice marshall was a badass john jay was just a really smart mother fucker and i love reading his writings
books,not_removed,if military actions are why democrats hated bush then why dont they hate obama he has drastically expanded drone warfare and nsa spying
books,not_removed,obama had congress for a while what did he do with it and bush didnt always have a gop congress
books,not_removed,possibly had a referral link in the url
books,not_removed,shame about that banana
books,not_removed,youre assuming that the court is always right were they right when they upheld separate but equal and then were they right when they struck down separate but equal are they right even when they disagree with their own decisions oh and youre not factoring in times when the government has done things that scotus ruled unconstitutional such as the nsas spying
books,not_removed,if judicial review is not what you mean by the final word then what do you define the final word to be i have read the federalist and antifederalist papers and the people are the final word through the process of electing their representatives into our republican government structure which to reasonably extrapolate appoints and confirms the supreme court which has judicial review and interprets the constitution through that review there is no structure for nullification unless you want to argue amendment vs implied powers
books,not_removed,you do not need to publish to be considered a professor what do you need to do to be a professor generally you need the highest degree offered in your field eg md phd etc to be employed by a university or college and to serve in a position with the title professor ie adjunct professor assistant professor associate professor full professor publishing papers is not a requirement to be a professor for instance adjunct professors who are parttime professors brought in to teach a course or two at very low rates rarely ever publish professors at many liberal arts colleges also have absolutely no obligation to publish many do but many rarely if ever do if you go to your local community college most if not all of the professors will have zero publications publishing being tied to the role of a professor is not the same thing as being necessary you can be a professor given you have the qualifications by teaching at a community college as an adjunct or at many liberal arts colleges with no publications excluding the dissertation required to get your phd is it true that you will rarely if ever get a tenured position not a tenuretrack position at a research university without publishing absolutely if obama ever took u of c up on their offers to become a tenuretrack faculty member he would have needed to publish to get tenure research universities like u of c want to hand out their fulltime tenured and thus protected positions to scholars who are going to publish and bring up their citation ranks and thus fame and law school rank however obama never wanted those things so he was a senior lecturer which u of c considered equivalent to a professor just a professor that doesnt do research if you arent going to believe the institution that hired and employed him which has long been known to be one of the top six law schools in the country currently below only yale harvard and stanford then youre not going to believe anything you dont want to regardless of the truth which is problematic obama did not only teach courses about race and gender how do i know this because you can look up his exam online honestly the bottom claim you typed out is the paraphrasing from an article i found on the allen b west website a conservative politician not exactly the website that id trust to be commenting on a liberal president without any sources cited did obama likely teach courses regarding race and gender in the constitution probably but he did teach courses that were simply constitutional law as you can see that he taught constitutional law iii from the exam i linked above obama was a senior lecturer along with the u of c law school dean and judge richard posner one of the most respected legal theorists in the us clearly the position is given to those of high regard even if not formally named professor based on u of cs statements and who is to pretend to know more about the titles u of c gives their positions than u of c themselves they were all de facto professors also if a person had an md a residency in surgery opened you up fixed what was supposed to be fixed and was called a senior surgical assistant youd be a bit amiss to say they were anything other than a surgeon thats about the equivalent of what youre doing now with obama did you know that some hospitals require their doctors to do research did you know that the doctor at your local clinic likely does no research is one of them a doctor and one of them not a doctor i think youd call them both doctors like in academia research is a function that can come along with the job and depending on the setting can be very common eg research hospital or research university in the case of a jd or phd holder or very rare eg local clinic or community college but it is not a requirement to be a professor or a doctor
books,not_removed,one mans junk is another mans treasureill show myself out
books,not_removed,eh aclu junk mail is more acceptable than the shit i get from insurance companies and crap
books,not_removed,i know it may not catch on but could we shorten laugh out loud to lol
books,not_removed,speak for yourself everyone down vote so his free speech gets suppressed
books,not_removed,what is it
books,not_removed,the bill of rights wasnt even an original element to the constitution they had to draft it because certain states refused to ratify the constitution until certain things were guaranteed in writing all amendments are not permanent hence the name amendment
books,not_removed,remember of the supreme court justices who were on the court at the time of the ruling in question agreed with the aclus interpretation you are free to disagree with them but please understand that their view is not as radical as some people would have you believe
books,not_removed,it is quite another however to say that the courts and congress should be able to make it nighimpossible to own them i dont see any generally popular movement to make it nigh impossible to own guns but perhaps im just missing it
books,not_removed,the issue at hand isnt the idea of changing amendments and nothing more its not a good bad thing things should be amended if you can prove to enough of the population and therefore the necessary representatives that it is a necessary improvement the aclu believes that we can modify the second in a way that improves the situation of americans if they could argue that to the necessary level of support it could change the law likewise if the right could argue for a change in the it could change the law its not about ideology its about making sound arguments a fair number of people are swayed by arguments to update the not so much with the neither enough to make changes at this time
books,not_removed,it is illegal to build a nuclear device a californian boy scout tried and was prosecuted for it i think in the but fair enough the thing about the second amendment is that in the federalist papers it was explicitly stated that the second amendment exists to have an equally armed citizen militia to any standing army we have thrown that notion completely out the window there is no way the us army would let someone have a predator drone so when i say i want universal mental health checks along with safety training before a person can buy a handgun yes i know i also want a pony for christmas im not the only one who is stepping on the second amendment technology has destroyed what it was supposed to mean
books,not_removed,so if were good on restricting rights for public safety i think we are then the argument about gun legislation isnt one about violating the second amendment its one about will gun control of any type not to interested in specifics protect the public safety now thats a very different debate to saying liberals are against the constitution
books,not_removed,i for one would pay good money to see americans using of our constitution
books,not_removed,thats not a high bar to set not only do humans use way more than of our brain its not possible for a person to be so smart they gain telekinesis and the ability to morph a thumb drive
books,not_removed,i think that people only use of their hearts
books,not_removed,we use all of our brain that myth was complete bs
books,not_removed,an american flag on a thumb drive you mean
books,not_removed,the government of britain actually gave the us a copy of that made out of solid fucking gold it was a gift for the bicentennial its pretty badass they put it in the crypt where washington was going to be buried i feel like that all sort of misses the point of the revolution but its still nice to look at
books,not_removed,not exactly magma carts was pretty much dismissed by king john right after he agreed to it
books,not_removed,dormant commerce clause bitch
books,not_removed,almost all of article i falls into this section paragraph the first sentence says that members of congress shall be paid i do not believe anyone has ever attempted to litigate this and on the other side section paragraph reads each house may determine the rules of its proceedings punish its members for disorderly behaviour and with the concurrence of two thirds expel a member people have attempted to fight this but the supreme court throws out cases that tread on it after saying that the other branch has a right to decide these issues
books,not_removed,because he was always the smartest in the room
books,not_removed,shhhhhhhh
books,not_removed,the man was non stop
books,not_removed,a green card is not citizenship can confirm have a green card cant vote do people know that john oliver cant vote
books,not_removed,they literally have statues erected of bill clinton there last i checked
books,not_removed,not if you ask the serbs
books,not_removed,im not sure we cared whether the afghanis wanted us there we were there to kill al qaeda we would have let the taliban stay in power had osama been turned over
books,not_removed,i take it you havent spent much time with afghans that lived under taliban rule
books,not_removed,man i suck at spelling today im not even going to bother editing that one just gonna let the fail live on
books,not_removed,the war powers resolution restricted the golf of tonkin resolution which gave the president power to basically wage war anywhere for as long they want the war powers act restricted those powers to days and a day withdrawal period i agree though they should repeal it altogether
books,not_removed,you got me there my bad
books,not_removed,blame hamilton he used the implied power argument when he was trying to found the bank of the united states
books,not_removed,i hereby pass an executive order that i be given more cheese fries
books,not_removed,implied powers are powers that are necessary to undertake the responsibilities the constitution grants the federal government eg the cia is implied as constitutional bc it helps serve the common defense a responsibility of the federal government its not all written down not with the constitution being as short as it is
books,not_removed,well that is how it is supposed to be
books,not_removed,enter the all powerful commerce clause
books,not_removed,thats true an executive order is a power given to the president
books,not_removed,oh no question im just saying marshall did most of the heavy lifting to get the scotus we all know
books,not_removed,he expanded drone warfare but significantly reduced warfare nsa is a fair point
books,not_removed,he didnt deploy military personnel into a country under a pretense that later turned out to be false that resulted in over a decade of protracted expensive not just in money war
books,not_removed,because drone warfare results in drastically less rates of casualties than sending our to troops over there and putting them in basically guerrilla warfare situations yes there have been some major tragedies associated with drone operations with bad intelligence but if you look at the numbers we arent dealing with the some deaths we saw during the bush years
books,not_removed,because there arent as many boots on the ground and corpses in the ground
books,not_removed,registered democrat here i regularly talk about drone warfare and how fucked up it is i loathe it and i deeply resent obama for it people like me arent unicorns we just dont discuss it with conservatives because at the end of the day we dont want to weaken our guys and we think conservatives republicans are worse not saying its right just saying how it is by my estimation and in my experience
books,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiunitedstatespresidentsandcontrolofcongress house withcongress withhouse divided there ya go
books,not_removed,he perhaps foolishly spent his first term trying to reach across the aisle and each house democrat thought they could extort him when they realized hed need their help when the republicans said they were never gonna play ball
books,not_removed,its not as simple as that unfortunately keep in mind that a representative is up for reelection every years and a senator every years outside of presidential elections there are also midterm elections where roughly of people vote that means that the distribution shifts in fact the republicans gained control of the house within years of obama becoming president even then the distribution was pretty close same case with the senate there was a pretty even split until the republicans gained control of the senate if that doesnt show you just how partisan congress is i dont know what will obama doesnt control congress he has the ability to set policies but doesnt have the power to write law congress does and when you have congressmen who care more about party lines than they do their constituents youre not going to get very far especially not within years and with stagnant improvement and no change in sight the people got disappointed and their votes reflect that in political science there is somewhat of a j curve when it comes down to what a leader can accomplish in a set amount of time in the beginning there is little that is accomplished as you try to deal with legislation or rules set forth by the past administration it takes time for the administration to work at full capacity and to get things done years is not enough and one would argue years is not enough especially when it comes down to how the american political system is
books,not_removed,im not assuming that that they are always right im saying that the constitution says that they are always right and yes i am saying that they were right according to the constitution both times one of the beauties of the constitution is that it leaves room for interpretation this allows it to change with the times to your second point id argue that an action is not technically unconstitutional until the supreme court rules that it isnt or decided to not take on a case that a lower court has ruled on i would agree that this area is slightly grey which is why i said closer to not exactly
books,not_removed,judicial review is intended to be there you implied that i implied otherwise what is supposed to happen is the law is struck down via judicial review thusly forcing congress to do their job and pass constitutional laws thusly scotus should never ever be the final word of law at best they should affirm the law as supported by the people but thats not what happens that said this concept is further reenforced by nullification whereby if scotus andor the government gets it wrong the final word always remains with the people as such the people can simply ignore the law thereby nullifying it again every aspect of the constitution is about ensuring the people retain the power and the final word in all matters of law but today we have the exact opposite today the feds have the final word and youre a heretic for even mentioning nullification
books,not_removed,could it then be used as a reply to things that dont really make anyone laugh at all
books,not_removed,in fact lets go one step forward and immediately make it obscure lets try lel
books,not_removed,i think algo audibly laughed good one will have more traction
books,not_removed,doesnt this mean lots of love
books,not_removed,no stop being so lazy
books,not_removed,would you be speaking in this manner of the first fourth fifth or thirteenth amendment i wonder
books,not_removed,bruh i know how an amendment works but if you are saying the bill of rights is the same as the prohibition you are mistaken they hold more weight yes they can be repealed but the minute you touch one of those rights all are on the table ban guns ok now lets talk about freedom of speech no one wants to open that can of worms
books,not_removed,thats not what amendment means
books,not_removed,the states refused to agree to the constitution until the bill of rights was added they makes them pretty important they werent just tacked on they were integral to the constitution being passed
books,not_removed,which ruling are you referring too
books,not_removed,there is a concerted effort to demonize semiautomatic weapons specifically targeting the ar style platform the people forwarding the agenda are the ones calling ar style weapons assault weapons there are many politicians who are vocally against private ownership of any firearm these same politicians are invariably held to a different standard however since they can hire armed security without open criticism the school system i was raised in denigrated firearms so much i grew up afraid of them its disgusting private ownership of firearms is the only way a people are truly free
books,not_removed,im more referring to the groups who do think that i personally have nothing against a background check and fingerprinting for owning a firearm however many states effectively axe the second amendment by being may issue states that means that they might let you purchase a concealcarry permit as opposed to shall issue states where unless they can demonstrate why you shouldnt own a weapon and be able to wear it on you they have to let you so new york for example its nigh impossible to own a firearm there from my research on the subject
books,not_removed,massachusetts just banned the sale of california has steadily made pointless along with new york in ca you have to register your rifle and it gives free reign for police to enter your house to inspect it whenever that want without a warrant
books,not_removed,well i guess it would more be like the amending of the amendment thats my point though there really should be no call for congress to pass federal laws restricting guns they should be lobbying for a constitutional amendment instead its a shit ton harder to actually do but its the only legal way in my opinion
books,not_removed,i understand the good nature of your comment i really do i sympathize with you and everyone that wants a safer america and i also sympathize with victims of gun violence people that have been committed to asylums can not legally own handguns people that conceal carry in most states require training seeing that guns are used in at least instances of self defense annually according to a cdc study on gun violence that obama had supported though do studies place it i think that limiting any lawful citizens access to a self defense tool is not what we need to do if you have any ideas on how to prevent the mentally ill from illegally obtaining firearms that doesnt include taking them away from lawfull citizens then i would be very interested in hearing them unfortunately nobody can really come up with anything that doesnt destroy due process i do not understand how safety training prevents someone that wants to commit a crime from committing that crime we should start by arresting felons that try to purchase firearms a two strike system would be nice mental health is part of it but that needs to be treated as a seperate issue why do so many kidspeople feel like he need to resort to violence as their last word i think part of it is a grasp for notoriety that comes with it cnnfoxmsnbc will plaster their name and face over tv for a week or two and theyll be remembered through history how can we stop that i personally think that if news outlets stopped namingidentifying these murders it would be a good start i also dont understand your reasoning behind how how these new laws wouldnt be as against the amendment are you saying that because the government has prevented ownership of land mines and ir manpads that any new law wouldnt be against the because there are already laws that infringe on our rights to bear arms im not trying to misrepresent your argument but if thats your reasoning then you need to seriously think about the implication of that in regards to other aspects of the constitution
books,not_removed,no soldier shall in time of peace be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner nor in time of war but in a manner to be prescribed by law
books,not_removed,jaden smith
books,not_removed,preach brother
books,not_removed,dr suess knew this decades ago and yet we still have people shouting boil that dust speck at every opportunity its really sad when reality meets a childrens cartoon and you find that reality is left wanting
books,not_removed,and the flag would be millions of images that symbolize america

books,not_removed,but was he in the room when it happened
books,not_removed,that could be his doom
books,not_removed,i didnt say it was citizenship its the first part i didnt get to pay for citizenship only the green card just giving a dollar value amount to the process
books,not_removed,or the russians
books,not_removed,they still dont want us there i understand the out rage at what the taliban does to the people but there is no push for democracy and you just cant force that kind of change militancy wont create democracies only positive propaganda can do that
books,not_removed,the only downside is that unless it gets taken to the supreme court or if another act overrides it which lets be honest is definitely easier said than done especially since it has been in effect for a while now guess well just have to wait and see
books,not_removed,can you blame hamilton he couldnt have done it if washington didnt agree
books,not_removed,yeah hes easily the most influential
books,not_removed,his party had congress what did they do when they had power they bailed out their campaign donors they didnt try to make gay marriage legal address climate change or implement universal health care
books,not_removed,by being the highest court in the land they are the final word when it comes to the judicial system there are no appeals from them making them the final word and when the court strikes down a law congress is suppose to act to fix it and make it constitutional look at the voting rights act and how easy that is but your theory of nullification is not practical whats to stop me from opposing any law i choose and saying i do not think it is constitutional so i am just going to ignore it previous applications of nullification have been at a state level which again goes against the philosophy of the founders they were against such large amounts of power in the hands of the state where tyranny by the majority was much more common now if you were proposing a more referendum style of nullification to laws then that would be something else but i just cannot see how people ignoring laws would work
books,not_removed,my point is all amendments can be changed updated simplified or stricken holding one as sacrosanct is completely ridiculous
books,not_removed,it wouldnt matter how hed speak about it the constitution can be changed all they need is of both houses or of the states to call for a convention
books,not_removed,hes correct though the bill of rights were a compromise james madison felt a lot of what was written in the bill of rights were already a given from the constitution they had written they hold no more weight than the rest of the constitution it can all be changed so long as enough states or representatives agree that a change needs to be made if you look through the original constitution a lot of it has been changed through amendments
books,not_removed,no one is talking about banning guns i am absolutely sick of people pulling that slippery slope interesting that you bring up the first amendment which we absolutely have updated for modern times with regulations on radio tv print media internet etc
books,not_removed,the aclus position statement on the second amendment is specifically in reference to dc handgun ban which was decided in dc v heller httpswwwacluorgsecondamendment
books,not_removed,id argue that concealed carry is not at all implied by the amendment paraphrasing here but doesnt it say that because having a militia is important for the sake of the country all citizens should have the right to bear arms it doesnt mention selfdefense which is the primary need there are probably others though i can think of for cc which isnt me arguing for or against cc just that a groupstate being against it should not be read as being unconstitutional
books,not_removed,which is ironic when you consider that over of gun murders are committed with pistols and only are committed with long guns of any kind including rifles and shotguns and also functionality wise most ars are virtually identical to a semi automatic
books,not_removed,how can hearts be real if percentages arent real
books,not_removed,mostly though i just wanted to use a wedding crashers reference
books,not_removed,ay macarena
books,not_removed,washington was just paranoid that the country was going to fall apart without a strong central government and his fears werent baseless
books,not_removed,his argument that you dont seem to be grasping is the literal meaning of final word scotus is the final word of presently written and enacted laws they have no final say over what laws are repealed what laws are enacted or anything in that sense if scotus came out and said guns are illegal as per the amendment because the amendment clearly states a militia that doesnt mean that for all time normal civilians will never be able to own guns it means congress gets together with the powers they were given to hold a constitutional convention and amend the amendment to read all persons or citizens vice militia at that point scotus decision on the meaning of the word militia is moot so they werent the final word on anything and you can definitely appeal whatever scotus says its just not in the normal sense of continuing up an even higher judicial court again scotus could come out and say the amendment only grants rights to militias bearing arms you cant appeal that decision in a court you can appeal it via amending the constitution to read something other than militia
books,not_removed,everything in the constitution can be changed not just amendments for instance amendment xi makes changes to article iii section ii nothing in the us constitution should be considered set in stone it was designed to be changed unfortunately government simply ignores the change process reinterpreting on the fly when convenient or worst case ignores the constitution altogether thats not new behavior of course the political class has been undermining it since before the ink was dry
books,not_removed,no its not the logic behind rights isnt that the constitution gives them to you its that you have them despite what any piece of paper says thats why they are in the constitution you have the right to not be taken as a slave for example if that were stricken from the constitution you wouldnt suddenly lose that right the constitution would simply be wrong
books,not_removed,no treating them as if they are trivial is ridiculous they are sacrosanct and for good reason
books,not_removed,well that is kinda the end all argument if you legislate something so much that people can no longer afford to have it you have effectively banned it whether you admit it or not people are pushing to ban guns the arguments are always look at australia im sure some want to limit what guns people can buy but those people usually have no idea why they should ban a specific gun other than it looks mean an ar is the same gun i use to hunt coyotes with more frills we have already regulated gun ownership considerably just like the first amendment has been modified so has gun ownership everyone wants people to use guns safely the issue is you cant control a person who wants to do evil
books,not_removed,the only difference between the updated interpretation of the amendment and those of the is they use the opposite logic they say well there is no way the founding fathers could have guessed the internet would come around but we will still say you have amendment rights in these new forms of media and then turn around and say well there is no way that the founding fathers could have guessed there would be and stuff so lets get rid of those that wasnt the purpose of the amendment they say this when repeating riflesbasically long revolvers and revolvers had already been a thing for years just not widespread
books,not_removed,i understand there are different views and i am all for discussion on it i also believe dc itself may have produced an entirely different position from the dissenters than if it had been a city like omaha nebraska i am for sensible gun regulation a lot of what i see is reactionary and emotional and completely disregards the rule of law and reason when it comes to guns
books,not_removed,our rights are not limited to what the bill of rights enumerates the enumeration in the constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people amendment the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people amendment selfdefense is undoubtedly a concrete natural right
books,not_removed,the prefatory clause of the second amendment has nothing to do with the latter half
books,not_removed,id argue that concealed carry is not at all implied by the amendment you would be wrong its been argued and shot down by scotus the as defined by scotus includes the right of private citizens to own defensive weaponry
books,not_removed,the original definition grants the right of states to organize militiasthe national guard and the right of the individual to keep and bear arms which was actually a federal legal requirement of militia members the modern interpretation comes from the post civil war era when the south was passing black codes to limit black firearms ownership it was a common sentiment that blacks should own guns to protect themselves in the postwar south so much so that black soldiers were allowed to keep their arms after the war this was partially the intent behind the amendment to protect that right skip a century and the political right adopted this stance as well there is an atlantic article that does a decent job of covering it
books,not_removed,bearing arms is interpreted as owning firearms but the original phrasing was to keep and bear arms which in more modern speech means to have and carry them so its not enough that you have a musket back in the day you had to be able to keep it above the fireplace to get to quickly or carry around if there were hostile indian tribes who might just come by to axe you a question
books,not_removed,the amendment states the government is prohibited from making laws that prevent people from keeping and bearing arms carryingconcealed or open bearing its a pretty simple statement if you can read english when some people want to ban others from exercising their natural rights you need mental and linguistic gymnastics to do so
books,not_removed,i think the stat is you are two times more likely to die from a knife then being shot with a rifle
books,not_removed,ay caramba
books,not_removed,no it clearly states that the bill of rights are inalienable rights granted by our creator or life if youre atheist the bill of rights doesnt grant any rights it enumerates them
books,not_removed,while many of the rights guaranteed by the constitutions and its subsequent amendments were inspired by religious sentiment those rights are maintained by secular rather than theocratic authority an appeal to absolute concepts of right and wrong is anathema to a secular system of governance fundamental human rights are established because ultimately the will of the people recognizes a common humanity and our need to work together to build a more prosperous future
books,not_removed,rights are hard to talk about because as i see it there are really two different definitions that people use first there is the right as the legal entitlement which only exists where there is a legal structure to enforce them to use your slavery example i have the right entitlement to not be a slave because i live in a country in which slavery is illegal and there exists a system to enforce that law if i lived in say the roman empire where slavery was legal i would naturally not have that right similarly if the amendment were abolished then i would no longer have the right to not be a slave on the other hand the term right is also used to refer to general moral goals for the treatment of other people for example because slavery is immoral we say that there exists a general human right to not be a slave this exists regardless of what the law says in a state unfortunately these rights arent enforceable however they do play an important role in guiding what rights are codified in the law
books,not_removed,its not treating them as trivial its understanding that we as a society adapt and change thats why we have the elastic clause that allows for amendments in the first place amendments are not sacrosanct because they can be changed and updated weve already done that for a few the biggest one is updated the first amendment to cover new forms of media that have arisen since while allowing them to be regulated
books,not_removed,yes but muskets arent usually concealed
books,not_removed,luckily for us about of the population think it has something to do with the national guard or a variety of other hilarious beliefs
books,not_removed,ayyyyy you wanna da pizza
books,not_removed,anything but deckled edges just learned that term from the above poster but came here to say that i hate those fucking things
books,not_removed,personally i enjoy the feeling of on the outside of my books pages they make the book feel homier almost perhaps its just myself
books,not_removed,i prefer paper but thats just me
books,not_removed,i dont know how materials are chosen for a book or if the author gets a say the only thing im opinionated about is that the paper has to have a matte finish glossy paper tends to have glares from any lighting in the room and makes it harder to read in my opinion
books,not_removed,i like solid hardcover victorian style books
books,not_removed,not material but the size of mass market paperbacks piss me off now i want larger books i have big hands and they just fit better
books,not_removed,not so much the material but goddamn am i ever a snob when it comes to font if it isnt exactly what my eyes find easily readable i cant have it or have to find another version i share a similar prejudice with book dimensions not the size long books short dun matta but if theyre too tall or wide ill search high and low for something that fits my hand better
books,not_removed,i prefer the products from the folio society nice hardcover comfortable font and good spacing from the edges nice paper and lovely illustrations
books,not_removed,im not an author nor a publisher but im pretty sure that the author doesnt get a say in the materials used his job is to make a good story and the publisher has to sell it in the best way possible taking into account costs and marketing stuff
books,not_removed,i like europa editions paperbacks they feel so nice in my hands i just wish the pages werent deckled ‚Äî the covers are so nice to handle the books themselves so pliable
books,not_removed,same i dont get why they exist
books,not_removed,i didnt know the word for that but as soon as i read it i knew exactly what you meant and i hate them
books,not_removed,i dont like deckled edges because it makes it harder to flip through and find a specific page i also like toi just realized i dont know what you call it when you let the pages slide off your thumb so its sort of like shuffling a pack of cards it feels so nice but you cant do it with deckled edges it works best with fat stephen king mmpbs
books,not_removed,oh god yes
books,not_removed,i had no idea what this was until just now but omg yes especially on classics or books i enjoyed when i was a kid because it weirdly feels like im reading a piece of history or something
books,not_removed,this isnt to attack you but i find deckled edges to be pretentious its trying to give off an ooh im old and disheveled therefore cool vibe
books,not_removed,i like them my partner omg she hates them with much fury
books,not_removed,less paper cuts
books,not_removed,but human skin
books,not_removed,what a weirdo
books,not_removed,ha im the opposite i hate hardcover books i do however admit they look better on a bookshelf
books,not_removed,youd be out of luck in japan the most popular mass market size is √ó or √ó real pocket paperbacks
books,not_removed,i love clothbound books the everyman collection does great hardcovers with wonderful clothbound covers as someone whose hands sweat a great deal when reading cardboard hardcovers are a nightmare
books,not_removed,deckled edges the book style equivalent of the papyrus font
books,not_removed,depends on the treatment really seriously i hate it when the pages have hair on them
books,not_removed,this is the most accurate description of deckled edges ive ever read in my personal opinion
books,not_removed,i carry books with me everywhere backpack messenger bag purse i always have a book paperbacks are more transportable yes yes i know get an ereader etc
books,not_removed,i wonder if it is an expensive process i cant imagine it would be with the prices of the everyman books being what they are i dont understand why any special editions of books would come out in a standard cardboard hardcover when the cloth elevates the book to such a higher level of quality
books,not_removed,if you eread everything then how will people know how well read you are with your lack of bookshelf oo this is seriously something that im struggling with a great bookshelf of things ive read is a life goal of mine to be even more pretentious i should make a video display that cycles through ebook covers
books,not_removed,i dunno im a new yorker and books are sort of my subway lifeline i have found lugging books around is preferable to ereading i just have a hard time reading long literary passages on a screen
books,not_removed,but beyond that sometimes rereading something or rewatching something while knowing what happens in the end has its own sort of pleasure you can see how things are set up in order to end up where they do for me in particular sometimes i am so busy trying to see where it ends especially reading that i might miss something rereading something suspenseful allows me to take my time and savor the build up i watched arrival last year and read the short story story of your life a few weeks ago knowing what happens didnt diminish my enjoyment of the short story it was sort of complementary to the movie that i already liked
books,not_removed,yes i dont readwatch for the plot
books,not_removed,yeah the books are more immersive so if you enjoyed the movie then the book will be as enjoyable as long as you like reading side not for people who want to get into reading i always suggest reading a book for a movie they have already seen and enjoyed usually harry potter then they learn about something they already like and have little trouble staying focused as they dont have to create landscapes and characters in their minds eye
books,not_removed,there are different levels of reading when the book is well written the process of readingrereading it is so enjoyable that it doesnt matter if i already know how it ends also sometimes i specifically like to compare a book with the corresponding movie some movies change the details in such a way so that even though the ending seems to be the same eg death of one of the main characters the result is so completely different i think it should have a different name like in the painted veil another such example is the time machine
books,not_removed,i wouldnt read a book if id seen the movie and i usually wouldnt see a movie if id read the book it kind of depends on who is involved though i personally only have the tolerance to experience a story once
books,not_removed,it depends on the book of course but yes ill still read a book even if a movie has given away a secret for one thing the movie can change a lot of things from the book including plot twists the planet of the apes has a famous twist but thats not what happens in the original novel besides there is or should be value beyond the twist everyone knows the plot twist from strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde for example but people keep adapting it anyway
books,not_removed,not at all but i do the opposite all the time
books,not_removed,for some reason i kinda like reading the book or novelizations after the movie i absolutely loathe it when people spoil movies and tv shows for me though lol i guess its the actual reading part that i enjoy so it doesnt matter if i know whats going to happen or not
books,not_removed,i just read the rogue one novelization despite having heard spoilers on how the film ends twas worth it ill see the film once its on dvditunes
books,not_removed,definitely even if youve seen the movie times and know it really well the moment you read over the pivotal point in the book or get to the big twist youll get tingles your spine will rattle against the back of your neck just hearing it in your own inner dialogue makes it true
books,not_removed,its not so much that i dislike already knowing the plot that sucks sure but what i dislike more is already having the characters physical representation already chosen for me for example i grew up loving the movie the color purple the movie has some sentimental value for my mom and me i was surprised to love the book so much more but i also realized upon reading the book that i wished i couldve created the character for myself i instead had whoopi goldberg danny glover and oprah winferey came to mind whenever i pictured the characters
books,not_removed,sure off the top of my head i read the hannibal lecter books long after the movies probably a few more too
books,not_removed,the endings arent always the same for example the bad seed by william march in some cases the stories can be vastly different like in the shining the grudge world war z etc im not sure if shutter island is like that if i really like the movie ill read the book a lot of times the book fills in some minor details that the movie leaves out or gives some insight to the movie that i would not have considered before and its often interesting seeing how the two stories differ from each other and what the reasons are
books,not_removed,i actually read shutter island last week after seeing the movie a couple years ago it was a pretty good book but the adaptation is very very similar i personally feel as though it ruined it a bit for me with this particular but with others its definitely enhanced my experience considering many movies arent faithful
books,not_removed,uhm different actually usually when i read the book i get hyped for the movieassuming i liked the book but if i watched the movie before reading the book it actually kills my hype for the book and i dont read it anymore rarely when i really liked the story where i both consume the tvmovie version and the book
books,not_removed,for a book like shutter island i may give it a shot shutter island was so beautifully crafted that i put on levels of the sixth sense in terms of story telling and suspense however if i didnt love the movie i probably wouldnt
books,not_removed,you can see how things are set up in order to end up where they do i also think it gives you a better understanding of the book things that were not clear or didnt make sense on first read make sense on the second
books,not_removed,youre probably better off because the movie is rarely as good as the book with a few exceptions none of which i can recall right now
books,not_removed,im confused what you think the correlation is i am under the impression that george kills lenny cause he is to stupid to be trusted in societyis afraid he will be accused of rape and sent to prison where george wont be able to look after him its like when a good dog that isnt mean or anything accidently bites and hurts a kid or something the dog didnt know better but you cant have a dog that bites around even if it didnt mean to hurt someone so instead of taking it to the pound or something terrible like that you take it out and shoot it you dont want to but its kind of whats better that having a dog that may bite again around they even talked about taking a dog out anf shooting it for its own good in the book right before george killed lenny it was for lennies own good that he didnt go to prison he would have been bullied and abused and would have known how to stop it or would have lost his pure childlike innocence not sure if that helps im still confused and interested by what you mean by the correlation
books,not_removed,george put lenny out quick it would have been a long slow death for him any other way and he didnt deserve it
books,not_removed,this was also my interpretation of the story
books,not_removed,to be honest i expected the first reply to my comment would be hate filled towards shooting a dog instead of some other more humane method thanks for restoring a bit of my faith in people
books,not_removed,dont get me wrong i grew up with dogs two were completely out of control nut job dalmatians and they would bite people like crazy if that old yeller moment ever came up yes i would take that gun but i would use it to defend those dogs to the death now i have cats and visitors ask me if they are nice i say if you are nice to them they are really nice but if you arent nice somehow you might end up getting a round house kick to the face they always look at me funny but the meaning of the story is exactly as you described it no hate here glad to restore some faith in communicating over the internet it doesnt all have to be about hate
books,not_removed,yeah i havent had to kill very many domesticated animals but unfortunately i have had to do it everytime i have its practically ruined my whole day i live on a country road and people like to dump animals off and leave them i know it sounds bad but in my defense i live in a pretty secluded place so i know all my neighbors animals and i do call the radio station and let them post it as well as give it a couple days but atfter a certain point i cant stand warching them starve to death dont want them to turn to killing farm animals of my neighbors and dont want to put them in an already overcrowded dog kennel where they live a couped up sad life some people dont understand it my best friend being one and i hate it everytime and cuss the person who dumped it to hell and back whoever they are its always a sad day when i have to take that action simeone forced on me
books,not_removed,i had neighbors growing up who had a pair of dalmatians the breed apparently has a reputation for being a little kooky the larger dog bit their youngest child in the face they had that dog put down immediately
books,not_removed,do they scratch a little mostly round house kicks d
books,not_removed,sorry u had to do that but i get it if u took them all in it would he cruel as is a small town pound
books,not_removed,wow that is painful thank you for sharing im in the opposite situation ive never laid down an animal my wifes cat laid in my arms while i fed it with a water dropper for hours then i handed it to my wife where it finally died ive done the same with chickens ive had them die in my arms i never actually even killed one of my own chickens i feel your pain you cant save every animal you need to do the humane thing
books,not_removed,thank you for understanding ive had people not before and some who try to make me feel bad about it as if i dont already thanks again i appreciate both you and uroofedsnail i honestly was hesitant about typing my original post cause i thought id get a lot of hate for it this has been refreshing to say the le√†st
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules posts cannot be inherently political this is a book forum not a political platform
books,not_removed,the definition of the word unreflecting is primarily unreflecting not engaging in reflection or thought i think an unreflecting day is one that doesnt require thought like when you are on autopilot just going through the motions an unreflecting day is a thoughtless day one that you wont remember because nothing happened of note a day you wont reflect on or remember thats what i think it means
books,not_removed,why would plomb hold his right hand up to his face unreflecting day could also mean uninteresting forgettable so on
books,not_removed,a cloudy day i imagine
books,not_removed,this actually pairs well with one of the themes of the story and the disposition of the narrator i think this makes sense thank you
books,not_removed,theres a reason for that but itd give away a crucial aspect of the story the reason is easily deducible once youve read the story but its not explicitly explained in this particular section its a disturbing detail once you understand the context
books,not_removed,yup i would say so too its cloudy and therefore no sunlight can be reflected by windows or shiny surfaces
books,not_removed,no thank you youve added a book to my to read list have a great day internet friend
books,not_removed,my first thought as well as noted in the op although im convinced theres a doublemeaning here see umatesses response which also seems spoton given the particulars of the story
books,not_removed,american history books
books,not_removed,does anyone have why the west rules for now by ian morris or the mediterranean in the time of philip the second by fernand braudel in ebook id love to read them but just dont have the means to financially
books,not_removed,an interesting list but very much americana for example the silk roads by frankopan should definitely be on the list
books,not_removed,how does that not have the romanovs on there they even sold it at costco it was one of my favorite books last year
books,not_removed,i am addicted to second hand books a year from now i hope the titles from this list will feel like deja vous as i am walking through the stacks
books,not_removed,i really liked blood at the root its so nicely written perhaps more poets should write history you can watch the episode of oprah where she went to forsyth on youtube surreal
books,not_removed,oooh ive been wanting to read about benedict arnold i got into biographies at the end of the year so this is a good list for me hitler arnold churchill
books,not_removed,anybody read rasputin
books,not_removed,in fairness the first book is about hitler another book is on winston churchill in the boer war which last time i checked the us was not involved and were reading an american publication predominantly read by an american audience or you could chip in a suggestion of a nonus history book published this year we should all read you get an a for snark but a b for reading
books,not_removed,no library near you
books,not_removed,is that the simon sebag montefiore romanovs im reading that right now im absolutely loving it have you read robert k massies book nicholas and alexandra if you liked the romanovs i really recommend picking it up
books,not_removed,i had the same reaction as op super americancentric had the effect of making me distrust the best books part of the title i understand why theyre mostly american as its for an american audience but i think its worth noting the us centric bias so clearly on display its not about snark its about recognising this list is just the tip of the iceberg and its waving the stars and stripes
books,not_removed,massies biography of peter the great is really good too
books,not_removed,yes that one ill check it out thanks for the suggestion
books,not_removed,why distrust through you are reading some guys opinion who writes for smithsonian magazine you dont think he can honestly come up with his own subjective opinion of what books are good even if its us centric its just a weird way to make your point
books,not_removed,because its a top ten list which implies these are the best books of now of course opinion is subjective but im always interested to hear experts opinion however i am going to distrust said opinion when the overall focus is so narrow without at least some caveat from the author that it would be so also i think youre over analysing this is a three week old reddit post i probably wrote it in a minute i think picking on the suitability of one word in a reddit comment is a bit nitpicky
books,not_removed,right but people always do this sort of thing and words matter what you are describing sounds like disagreement to me which is fine but i dont think you should call the authors credibility into question just because you think the list has a narrow focus
books,not_removed,i distrust his opinion on what the best books of the year were because of the narrow focus of his list that doesnt mean i distrust the author more generally just this particular list
books,not_removed,ok thats fair and you are of course entitled to your opinion
books,not_removed,andromeda strain by michael chrichton
books,not_removed,i was thinking flowertown but could be wrong
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules your post is better suited for asking in rwhatsthatbook or rtipofmytongue
books,not_removed,yep op would probably like sphere too i loved crichtons books in high school
books,not_removed,that is precisely what i thought as well
books,not_removed,damn something i knew and i was too late
books,not_removed,thank you soo much
books,not_removed,such a good book and movie
books,not_removed,will deff check out thanks
books,not_removed,this popped up on my front page no idea why i dont often browse new
books,not_removed,no problem its also a movie and a mini series both are worth a watch
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules your post is better suited for asking in rwhatsthatbook or rtipofmytongue
books,not_removed,da fuq ive never heard of these guys i would have used the fuck out of them
books,not_removed,what is mysterious to me is the notice and no notice at all for drm content the owner speaks of not being profitable but this lack of warning makes me suspicious there may have been legal issues at play
books,not_removed,once again proof of why drm is harmful and you are within your ethical rights to remove drm from anything that has it sure it may not be legal in your jurisdiction but neither is speeding and we all do that anyway
books,not_removed,im sure some publisherdistributor will happily buy their tech and put it to good use one can hope at least their imagedetection was solid
books,not_removed,i have heard of them but always as an instagram for books sort of service i dont think their marketing was very effective
books,not_removed,hence theyre going bankrupt
books,not_removed,same for online ondemand only services but then the solution is to not use them
books,not_removed,indeed the branding change from bitlit which was fine to shelfie in my opinion cheapened their image the offer remained the same though i used it to convert the handful drmfree of oreilly books i had when i went paperless the process was smooth and quick im disappointed to learn that some of their partners locked clients in drm versions which are now apparently worthless
books,not_removed,awesome i couldnt find his playlist on spotify so i replicated it
books,not_removed,it was backwards to do but i found the for the one on the site
books,not_removed,how did you find it i couldnt find it under stephen king or scott landon curiously there is apparently someone else named landon scott
books,not_removed,i ctrlclicked on the image on the right i believe on my phone now so i cant check
books,not_removed,ok thanks
books,not_removed,seems they made the riddell version for the anniversary
books,not_removed,personally i like mckeans illustrations better they are creepier and darker which is how i look at the coraline story riddells are more whimsical and happy in my opinion i guess it just depends on how you want to look at the story
books,not_removed,personally i think everybody sees something different in that book its a bit of a mirror come back and read it in ten years and youll see it entirely differently
books,not_removed,did you invent the word understandment
books,not_removed,you cant read this book and judge holdens character without understanding the serious mental health problems hes struggling with
books,not_removed,this book is an excellent example of the unreliable narrator in holdens perspective hes kind of telling it like he sees it and kind of telling it the way he wants you to see it problem is hes young and ignorant and self centered and also has some mental issues so how he sees it is warped and how he wants you to see things is off because he doesnt properly empathize with others so hes trying to tell a story where hes the hero but its easy to see that hes clumsily trying to brag about imaginary stuff to get approval
books,not_removed,although while i was reading i literally wanted to blow my brains out because holden is the biggest piece of shit i have ever seen hyperbole much
books,not_removed,i think you completely missed the point of the book in my opinion not to offend holden is dealing with some serious mental issues he is constantly depressed likes nothing and talks about dying or committing suicide more then once im not sure if you have dealt with depression but getting angry or disliking people easily is a possible aspect of depression at the end he was im pretty sure in a mental institution the story dives in to something much deeper then teenage rebellion because really holden isnt much of a rebel at all the only people he really liked were his dead brother i think his passing had a lot to do with the mental issues the nuns the women on the bus and pheobe he never disrespected adults he just didnt like a lot of them to me the book is about some one dealing with probably depression and trying to deal with the people around him along with coping with a distant family the loss of his brother and his emotions really holdeb makes me feel depressed as hell as he would say this is just my opinion im not trying to offend you its just a new perspective
books,not_removed,the catcher in the rye is one of those books you should absolutely reread every few years ive read it every year since i was and i always find a new angle on it due to being a little older and a little wiser its okay if you dont feel like you understand it all right now
books,not_removed,i never realized this in highschool but i think holdens flaws make him a very poignant character struggling with an impactful death hes confronted with the harsh reality of life and like most of us he struggles to deal with it he does says and thinks things many of us do i think hes pitiable more than pretentious or insufferable and i think many people are closer in character to him than they realize
books,not_removed,i see the of my life ill never get back in that book sure hes a typically flawed decent representative of youth who sometimes curses and gets himself into troublenottrouble its all privileged bullshit nothing happens to this kid at all for him to be so god damn annoying there are teens even in this day and age who have actual problems but please lets continue to talk about some spoiled rich boy who is the poster child for the adolescent struggle between a careless upbringing and the eventual lack of punishment hell face and welloff future hell continue to enjoy
books,not_removed,i think catcher is one of those timeless classics that has too much depth to simply label as this or that i also dont think its as much of an angsty youth novel as a lot of people make to out to be to me i think its an examination of the human condition its a dark book no doubt but its also a beautiful work of art and art doesnt always have to be defined
books,not_removed,my perception is holdens naivety of the world is only cured by not accepting society as it is but how he decides to view it as
books,not_removed,yeah i kinda remember hating that fucking kid throughout the entire book he just spends the whole time whining even while all these interesting things are happening around him like why is he even breaking free and putting himself through all these experiences if hes not even gonna take a minute to enjoy them like he got slapped around by a pimp on a misunderstanding thats some cool shit but no the entire world is stupid and hes the only one who has any sense when hes giving the metaphor about children in the rye hes saying were all children and he feels compelled to stop us from running off a cliff because were so short sighted he cant trust us to know where the edges are he thinks were idiots and hes doing us all a favor by stressing out over the dangers that only he can see but like who the fuck is he to assume we need a catcher in the rye should i be thankful for this service hes providing im not a child or at least i can run my life off a cliff if i want to hes casting us as idiots and children to inflate his own ego and justify all the stressing he does anyway as like a service to society hes just pretentious and boring is why he struggles to fit in not because were operating on a lower frequency than he is in case you didnt notice throughout the book holden is not exactly a genius hes just a blowhard narcissist
books,not_removed,remindme years
books,not_removed,and confliction
books,not_removed,although i agree with you about him having depression maybe even ptsd that doesnt mean he isnt a narcissist
books,not_removed,agree with you but also somewhat the ops perspective its a bit of a mirror book and like with many books like this you really get out of it what you put into it
books,not_removed,except hes having a mental breakdown
books,not_removed,no i think the point of holden is suppose to be a representation of how the youth feels he isnt an individual character per se
books,not_removed,confliction is an accepted word and has been for quite some time
books,not_removed,i dont think you understand what narcissism is holden is just critical of the world and the way people act not because he thinks he is superior but because he wants to preserve innocence in my opinion the whole book is about him idealizing youth and innocence because he doesnt want anyone else to go through the things he has
books,not_removed,perhaps an informal word but i cant say i have heard it be used it is no more and english word than fleek
books,not_removed,its merely a formal word with a suffix youll find it as a noun listed under the root httpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionaryconflict also as an experiment would you mind articulating to me how most words become formal words in the first place
books,not_removed,this is a really cool review it opened my eyes for real i have a slight exposure to indian history and religion from comparative religion classes in school so i figured i was up to date not even close indian history so far available is squeezed into a westerncentric framework through artificial and alien terminology barbarism feudalism aryanisation and class war that was me before i read this review well damn too bad my teacher is dead id go tell him about his stupid self on the notion of aryanisation of india basis of introduction of iron the use of horses and knowledge of spoked wheels ample material is provided by him to shatter the theory whoops guilty again one central focus throughout the volume is the role of indian archaeologists hankering after socalled international recognition and accepting their lesser role without demur and unfailing in their praise of the work done by their euroamerican colleagues on the same grounds the pattinam excavation in kerala was hijacked by the western world while indian archaeologists were mere spectators thats just fucking criminal bastards but the author is silent on the fact that asi national archaeological bureau was headed by nontechnical bureaucrats for more than a decade even worse boo i cant say the last time i was educated by a review as thoroughly as by this one this is def on my toread list the other reviews on this site are pretty cool too
books,not_removed,you should read nehrus the discovery of india and year by chomsky and read about how amazing indi was before it was despoiled by the british particularly bengal
books,not_removed,i have read the chomsky but not the other all of those discovery narratives are so damn depressing im still trying to get mad king leopold out of my head and its been a couple years now

books,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikithecompoundbook
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules your post is better suited for asking in rwhatsthatbook or rtipofmytongue
books,not_removed,lol too late moderator
books,not_removed,yea ikr i want to read this book again and that exactly how it is at the end
books,not_removed,thank you haha ive been needing this
books,not_removed,yes i didnt know of these subreddits wont make the mistake again
books,not_removed,they havent even gotten to the handmaids tale parable of the sower or parable of the talents even the space merchants or the iron heel would work theres plenty of dystopian fiction out there
books,not_removed,there has recently been a sudden increased interest in recently seems like i can speak to no one without them saying that its on their reading list
books,not_removed,people read and act like it is their bible of wisdom or something
books,not_removed,there is a great german book called drohnenland drone country by tom hillembrand about a future surveillance state where everyone in the police relies on the surveillance data but the data can be changed and an europol inspector has to proof that things did not happen as the digital recordings say i hope it will be translated to english it is a great story
books,not_removed,dont forget about the dead zone by stephen king about a man with psychic powers who realizes a joke of a politician will become president and eventually cause a nuclear war
books,not_removed,reflecting our reality how much more hyperbolic can this get
books,not_removed,this is like the post like this ive seen
books,not_removed,dont forget oryx and crake
books,not_removed,honestly after south park im not sure this isnt just a hidden advert for amazon
books,not_removed,im somewhat disappointed by what people call orwellian these days orwellian is not authoritarian orwellian is a new word that means control through language much like pc culture
books,not_removed,i would like to point out that articles such as this are free advertisement people really will start picking up the book if they see articles like this so after a point the original reason people bought it may no longer be the reason they are now im sure his estate is loving it though assuming he has one and they can collect copyright fees
books,not_removed,i felt that the dead zone by stephen king was a perfect prophecy that nobody has listened to now we will live in the dark times that are about to come
books,not_removed,arent they going to be opening a book store
books,not_removed,glad i got my copy of brave new world from a flea market its an old penguin copy shilling and it cost back in day
books,not_removed,i picked up a copy of brave new world and found out that huxley lived in my tiny village in england thought it was peculiar much recommended book by the way
books,not_removed,this is the most rnottheonion thing ive ever seen
books,not_removed,on the positive side none of these books are banned on the negative side yet
books,not_removed,what are the top books
books,not_removed,what about john shirleys eclipse i mean neo fascism check maniacal religiously backed ruler check ü§î
books,not_removed,made me remember reading this httpwwwthenationalaethenationalconversationcommentarabsciencefictionshineslightoncurrentmiddleeastthemes a few years ago literature can work as a learning tool and also a massive release valve
books,not_removed,not the onion
books,not_removed,have they tried the nonfiction section
books,not_removed,hmm read the books or watch the live reality show
books,not_removed,especially parable of the talents with its help us to make america great again demagogue president the comparisons to that one are chilling
books,not_removed,the handmaids tale has actually had an upswing in sales recently though it attribute that more to the new amazon prime show than current affairs
books,not_removed,alas babylon should be in there also
books,not_removed,arguably theres too much dystopian fiction what started as a response to the amount of utopian fiction has become just as bad its got to the point where some utopian ficton would be welcome
books,not_removed,feed i dont remember the author but feed is great
books,not_removed,i watched the handmaids tale many many years ago to this day i have nightmares about it i guess growing up in a male dominated home will do that to a young girl i was glad i was born being raised in america watching this movie terrified me at the thought that things could change at any moment
books,not_removed,walk to the end of the world suzy mckhee charnis
books,not_removed,well um thanks
books,not_removed,i will include the martian chronicles in this list
books,not_removed,which horrifies me because people my age should have read it already
books,not_removed,funny because my english teacher told us that we are going to read it soon
books,not_removed,i once read a comment by some redditor in r philosophy which made a good point concerning this they said that if an adolescent looks at single novellas or books like or maybe siddharta as the pinnacle of wisdom thats okay but if an adult still does so it only shows they havent read or experienced much else the world isnt simple enough to explain in one book
books,not_removed,and others read it like its a howto manual well have it read to them
books,not_removed,they probably dont read much in general so it makes them feel edgy and smart
books,not_removed,ahahahahah so true
books,not_removed,that sounds interesting my german is very bad but maybe ill buy that and try to slog through
books,not_removed,theres a great english book called animal farm about some barnyard animals use the concept of equality to start a revolution and take over the farm and install themselves as dictators
books,not_removed,greg stillson is a tireless advocate of the working man
books,not_removed,spoiler alert dude
books,not_removed,turn off cnn it rots your brain
books,not_removed,does the article author think its by divine goddamn providence that reality is reflected in literature does she just go about her day thinking stupid shit like hey those farm animals said comrade a lot too spooky
books,not_removed,the whole point of dystopian fiction is that they are hyperbolic reflections of the present day theyre making a point not trying to accurately predict the future come on dude
books,not_removed,shhh big brother is watching
books,not_removed,it is hyperbole for now thankfully
books,not_removed,orwellian totalitarian where the state seeks to control all aspects of life authoritarian states dont care about a lot of things as long as you do what they say political correctness is more like normal conformism it is not statedirected
books,not_removed,they all have been at some stage or another especially but there are billions of copies circulating today that you probably need a london fire of proportions to destroy all of them
books,not_removed,all of them
books,not_removed,is it a good read
books,not_removed,not nearly dystopian enough its all have a nice nuclear war get to know your neighbors better run a few barnraisings
books,not_removed,its got to the point where some utopian ficton would be welcome try some httpsenwikipediaorgwikisolarpunk its a new genre but ive been enjoying it is one of the more interesting things ive read lately
books,not_removed,ecotopia
books,not_removed,i had to read it my junior year of high school i absolutely hated it its the second most boring book ive ever been forced to slog through the entire feel of the book to me can be summed up by hurr durr technology bad fire scary
books,not_removed,mira grant
books,not_removed,mt anderson if my memory isnt failing me
books,not_removed,it should be read in high schools
books,not_removed,im and was in all honors and ap classes in high school in california i read it on my own but even in my liberal oasis of a school i wasnt required to read it
books,not_removed,perhaps people not having read it is the reason we are in this mess
books,not_removed,funny how they all want to read and not animal farm
books,not_removed,get on audiobook read by gibert gottfriend for only usd
books,not_removed,its like a year old bookand like a year old movie
books,not_removed,my point is that the point used in those books are not used in the correct context at all by people
books,not_removed,certainly not thank goodness however when your presidents press secretary tells the american people not to trust anyone but them because the only truth is the truth that the comes from the office of the president people start to worry that we may be moving in the wrong direction
books,not_removed,last time an idiot was in charge he declared war on terror and besides terror being a nebulous adjective innocent people died for it andor were sent to lush places like guantanamo bay
books,not_removed,definitely not political correctness has a tight grip over language and over the last decade they have turned many negative phrases into double good phrases ex colored people to people of color to be unpersoned is orwellian to be shot at a riot is to be a dissenter from an authoritarian government
books,not_removed,i know theyve been banned from schools and such but have they ever actually been banned on the national level like the sale was completely prohibited
books,not_removed,its absolutely amazing its a two part series read parable of the sower first
books,not_removed,i got a similar vibe but the voice the author cultivated was very compelling maybe you disliked it because it was such an accurate depiction of someone permanently distracted was the torturous book for me but i felt like it was a challenge you know and i kept waiting for some sort of triumph of the hero i was pretty close to suicide when i had finished the damn thing
books,not_removed,i agree
books,not_removed,is it not we read it in high school and id read it already by that time
books,not_removed,i think it should be required reading once you finish high school too many people i know read it in high school and hated it same with brave new world
books,not_removed,same it was too prominent a title not to read i forget now that we were never actually required to read it
books,not_removed,we finished reading that in november
books,not_removed,underrated reference
books,not_removed,but thats just more idiots on top of other idiots im not seeing anything sinister just morons accomplishing nothing
books,not_removed,toronto public library has four copies holds now
books,not_removed,added it to my shopping list thanks
books,not_removed,no it wasnt the whole permanently distracted vibe it was just plain simple the technology bad fire scary vibe that was the reason i hated it i cant stand things like that because i work in it even back then in high school i worked in it doing repairs and building custom computers for people on the side im currently back in college getting my certifications to be a network engineer but back to the point i hate that vibe because it reminds me so much of all the criticism i got and all the bullshit i had to put up with from techignorant and techhating baby boomers back when i was first breaking into the industry i never could understand or accept irrational fear mongering like that especially from people who clearly have no idea what theyre even talking about
books,not_removed,its on some reading lists
books,not_removed,i got it in a bundle with animal farm figured id give orwell another shot i wouldnt say i was disappointed it was good writing but ive never been brought so little joy from immersing myself in a fictional story so many things registered as too real with today and the happy ending was the sweet release of death after big brother won winstons and julias minds
books,not_removed,fair enough i had just gotten a cellphone with texting at the time smartphones were coming into vogue so it wasnt as clean of analogy as it would be today but i can see where alarmism towards your career field might turn you off to the message and thats fucking badass do thhe shit outta that shit get on with google and make six figures im enrolling in an apprenticeship for software engineering this summer hence my exuberance
books,not_removed,catch is my favorite book of all time and i have never been able to find something that even comes close a lot of absurdity and war if you find yourself craving just funny ive recently read lamb and fool both by christopher moore and i enjoyed them both immensely
books,not_removed,the discworld series pratchett deals with the effects of tourism protests international politics police ineffectiveness police brutality the need effects of war economic crisis the industrial revolution the issue of weak currency and the effect of local markets the effects of technology not to be confused with the industrial revolution and the wealth gap between the rich and the poor and down trodden
books,not_removed,infinite jest duh holy hell does wallace know how to set up a joke even especially if it takes pages to do it but more often than not the funniest bits were total and complete leftfield nonsequiturs
books,not_removed,happen to be currently reading good omens it has a fantastic theme of the imminent apocalypse presented in a very upbeat and off the wall tone dry humor and jokes that make you think then realize wow that was dark
books,not_removed,i thought john dies at the end was good and funny
books,not_removed,the thursday nexf series by jasper fforde starting with the eyre affair is definitely my number one
books,not_removed,people will say vonnegut and adams of course ill go with john irving at his best a prayer for owen meany world according to garp ciderhouse rules
books,not_removed,the martian has some really funny bits
books,not_removed,is one of the few books that has made me laugh out loud the fact that the subject matter is pretty intense makes that quite the feat i also have to mention the sellout and the white boy shuffle by paul beatty different subject matter than but beatty uses humor in a similar way as heller
books,not_removed,life expectancy by dean koontz best book i have ever read so much humor in a very serious thriller
books,not_removed,the quijote
books,not_removed,does the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy count there are a lot of disparate themes about the nature of existence the meaning of life race relations and prejudices politics and more plus its extremely funny
books,not_removed,if you like urban fantasy i like matt wallaces sin du jour novella series hilarity plus action plus magic plus cooking recipes and the occasional demon clown
books,not_removed,the casual vacancy by jk rowling is one i read fairly recently and it fits your description quite well
books,not_removed,april fools day by josip novakovich its farce and hilariously absurd but covers the breakup of yugoslavia and the horrors and atrocities that occurred in the balkans during that time
books,not_removed,well since you mentioned pratchett id say small gods is to me among the funniest from the saga and although its of course very discworldish the topic of religion and mindless adoration is very well portrayed the process by which anything becomes a deity and how it gains power very applicable to nowadays society too
books,not_removed,the dresden files are kind of like this the stories are for the most part serious but the main character is constantly making hilarious quips kind of like spiderman does in his comics
books,not_removed,killing yourself to live by chuck klosterman semiautobiographical exploration of sites famous rock stars died and his own tangled love life devastatingly funny and intelligent throughout
books,not_removed,a confederacy of dunces by john kennedy toole
books,not_removed,easily the good lord birdhilarious irreverent take on john browns idea of armed insurrection to free the slaves great book
books,not_removed,idk percy jackson its more comedy than anything you can actually count the times where parts of the book are serious
books,not_removed,journey to the end of the night by louiseferdinand celine pretty darn funny while criticizing society
books,not_removed,john moore has a series of standalone books that take place in the same low fantasy universe the ones ive read so far are heroics for beginners bad prince charlie the unhandsome prince a fate worse than dragons and slay and rescue they somehow manage to acknowledge make fun of and follow every adventure trope out there the good guys dont always get a perfectly happy ending the bad guys sometimes get away with it the men are all kind of doofuses and the girls ditzes but every major character does get a few opportunities for their intelligence and strength of character to shine through also the books are about pages each cant recommend them enough theyre out of print but you can get them from amazon pretty cheap
books,not_removed,terry pratchett books
books,not_removed,catch
books,not_removed,anything by bill bryson proper laugh out loud stuff
books,not_removed,mort terry pratchett any discworld novel for that matter but this one stood out for me
books,not_removed,a prayer for owen meany
books,not_removed,jesus christ how is there no tom robbins in this thread that man is one of the funniest writers around and his stories are incredible fierce invalides home from hot climates is my pick
books,not_removed,the milagro beanfield war its been a while since i read it but i recall its one of the few books that caused me to literally laugh out loud while reading it
books,not_removed,robert ludlums the road books the road to gandolfo is about group of people who set out to kidnap a very popular pope and hold him for ransom for about for every christian the road to omaha is the same team trying to one up the us government about a deal between the government and anative american tribe over their lands ive read a few ludlum books before that and never thought he could write comedies
books,not_removed,i never expected come thou tortoise by jessica grant to break my heart a little after the number of laughs it gave me through its protagonists way of viewing the world around her
books,not_removed,the good soldier ≈°vejk it really does show how stupid the war is
books,not_removed,my vote would go to one of the iron druid chronicles books they have a perfect balance of seriousinteresting story and light hearted comedy for my tastes anyway the book hammered does that balance quite well edit grammar
books,not_removed,old mans war by john scalzi got some great humor and dialogue made me laugh out loud at several occasions
books,not_removed,how to talk to a widower by jonathan tropper the eponymous widower has done nothing but grieve his dead wife for over a year until his equally fuckedup twin sister moves in and does her best to get him back into the world a field of darkness by cornelia read despite the very serious plot of a murder mystery set in the late a postclimax punchline got a loud laugh out of me a more recent read the interns handbook by shane kuhn the protagonist is on his last job as an assassin disguised as an anonymous intern and complications arise as his target is also the focus of an fbi investigation headed by an agent undercover as a company employee
books,not_removed,cannery row sweet thursday and tortilla flat by john steinbeck are all very funny and depending on how you want to look at it varying levels of deep and meaningful i couldnt recommend all three more highly
books,not_removed,candide or infinite jest
books,not_removed,furiously happy good bit of laugh but still a strong message of how depression can fuck you up without anyone even realizing it
books,not_removed,john scalzis redshirts or agent to the stars are really humorous and enjoyable year zero by rob reid the humans by matt haig
books,not_removed,the thursday next series by jasper fforde the nusery crimes detective in the big over easy she has to find out who murdered humpty dumpty
books,not_removed,the once and future king by th white is a fantastic telling of the story of king arthur that is also completely hilarious at times the first joust we see in the book is a prime example of stretching real events to the point of absurdity
books,not_removed,not a book but a passage and its maybe not the most funniest but the funniest ive read in awhile spoilers ahead for those who havent read the book thief many jocular comments followed as did another onslaught of heil hitlering you know it actually makes me wonder if anyone ever lost an eye or injured a hand or wrist with all of that youd only need to be facing the wrong way at the wrong time or stand marginally too close to another person perhaps people did get injured personally i can only tell you that no one died from it or at least not physically
books,not_removed,the sellout by paul beatty i didnt think that the book could maintain the scathing absurd viciousness that it immediately springs on you but it did
books,not_removed,a confederacy of dunces
books,not_removed,well if you like fantasy and magic id say the skullduggery pleasant series by derek landy which ended recently sigh might tickle your funnyserious bone its also one of the very few books id both love and hate to see in movie format
books,not_removed,discworld books
books,not_removed,everything is illuminated
books,not_removed,lamb by christopher moore its about jesus early life as told by his best friend biff really funny but also heartfelt i cried when jesus died even though everyone knows that
books,not_removed,john dies at the end favorite book impossible to describe but basically think stoner scifi horror comedy with a lot of deep moments
books,not_removed,snow crash the whole setting is designed to poke fun at the cyberpunk genre but the underlying plot posits the idea of information being multigenerational
books,not_removed,it took me starting multiple times probably before it actually stuck and now its one of my favorites so good
books,not_removed,to follow up with another heller book god knows for all of its humor at the end it felt like all the laughter you had just slowly faded into silence when you get to the ending
books,not_removed,that is definitely not a serious plot but it is the first thing that came to mind as well this shit had me laughing out loud in public like a jackass amazing book the only serious parts are the whiteknuckle bombing runs although the book is a comedy it captures how awful war is
books,not_removed,came here to say this excellent book in my top for sure
books,not_removed,i am a few dozen pages into right now and not liking it so i did the natural thing and poked around reddit to see what people think what strikes me is there are so many posts saying laughout loud gutbusting funny all the way through if youre not laughing you have brain damage and then when someone posts saying i dont find very funny so many posts jump in saying well its not funnyfunny its more like witty oh and it turns very dark later you shouldnt really be laughing per se more like finding absurdity
books,not_removed,i loved lamb this had me giggling at the most obscene things
books,not_removed,yup im currently reading the deaths storyline in discworld and some of the underlying points in the books have a point plus i love his humor
books,not_removed,funny yes serious plot i would say no
books,not_removed,agreed i got a tattoo based on that book definitely one of my favorites
books,not_removed,owen meany is amazingly heartwrenching and uplifting and funny
books,not_removed,ive read those three and i loved them all have the hotel new hampshire and am very excited for it
books,not_removed,how do people like a prayer for owen meany its so damn boring
books,not_removed,i cried laughing at this book at some points
books,not_removed,i thought the beginning chapter or two of velocity by him was very funny there was a great scene being told as a tale that actually did make me laugh out loud which for me is quite rare with books the rest of the novel was not quite so light hearted not a fan of his really but i will always remember the good chuckle it gave
books,not_removed,funny as but took me ages to read im talking about the book trilogy though which got a bit drawn out in the end still woke my wife up from laughing a few times though
books,not_removed,this sounds amazing ill have to check it out asap
books,not_removed,have you read kevin hearnes iron druid chronicles great series along the dresden files line
books,not_removed,i am so happy to see chuck klosterman i got my username from him i havent read killing yourself to live but some essays in sex drugs and cocoa puffs as well as iv had me dying
books,not_removed,i love humor but man do i hate this book
books,not_removed,came here to post this glad others know about this gem
books,not_removed,did he write another roadside attraction i remember my friend telling me to read it but i never got around to it
books,not_removed,not to be confused with cormac mccarthys the road widely accepted as the literary definition of unfunny
books,not_removed,agreed steinbeck is one of my favourite authors and his shorter lighthearted works are very good
books,not_removed,i really love how they used death and even game him a sort of personality as the narrator in book thief
books,not_removed,poke fun at cyberpunk it is one of the quintessential cyberpunk books
books,not_removed,same here stopped around page two times before i made it through obviously glad i finally did the following quote changed my life among others what is a country a country is a piece of land surrounded on all sides by boundaries usually unnatural englishmen are dying for england americans are dying for america germans are dying for germany russians are dying for russia there are now fifty or sixty countries fighting in this war surely so many countries cant all be worth dying for anything worth living for said nately is worth dying for and everything worth dying for answered the sacrilegious old man is certainly worth living for
books,not_removed,i totally understand why some people dont like it i dont even recommend it to people because its a hard book to judge whether someone will like it or not i thought it was hilarious and also contained some pretty deep insight on life mortality and war when i find a book funny and profound thats it im in
books,not_removed,i genuinely laughed out loud many many times reading this book
books,not_removed,once you get to the bit where major major is introduced it gets great this book is one of my favorites and i felt the same as you at the beginning
books,not_removed,i think it is funnyfunny maybe they mean it is not the only appeal of the book because at points specially towards the end it becomes quite poignant
books,not_removed,i read lamb it was very funny i loved it
books,not_removed,you should be nice to people even creeps and if you a believed that joshua was the son of god and b he had come to save you from sin and c acknowledged the holy spirit within you became as a little child he would say and d didnt blaspheme the holy ghost see c then you would e live forever f someplace nice g probably heaven however if you h sinned andor i were a hypocrite andor j valued things over people and k didnt do a b c and d then you were l fucked
books,not_removed,pretty much everything by christopher moore is hilarious he has the same absurdist sensibility that pratchett and adams possessed
books,not_removed,his humour is brilliant i just love the subtle undertones
books,not_removed,i find it fascinating that death in fact suffers depression and often goes into long fits of existential crisis
books,not_removed,it certainly wasnt ridiculous or slapstick i mean it was farfetched but still dakr in that way i would say it was serious
books,not_removed,i would say that this book is full of spiders sequel has a bit of a more serious tone than the first one
books,not_removed,i havent ill try to check it out but ive got such a huge backlog that it may be a long time before i get around to it
books,not_removed,sorry dude
books,not_removed,yep
books,not_removed,woah woah woah youre saying that i shouldnt have been giggling at the scene where a human baby was roasted on a spit
books,not_removed,likewise i was really confused at first though but the way he narrates the story is probably my favorite i also think its interesting how he sees all those colors
books,not_removed,youre right but my statement still stands cyberpunk was a speculative fiction genre that was eliminated with the advent of nanotechnology see warren spectors deus ex the first game stephenson took the ideas from gibsons works and ran with it its still a seminal volume for the genre but its toungeincheek all the way through
books,not_removed,httpwwwshelfiecom might help you cut costs for a few books but generally yes youd have to repurchase them in a different format or resort to piracy no different from upgrading from lp records to cds to gotta pay each time
books,not_removed,if youre talking about physical paper books youd be talking something which would strictly be piracy which would be prohibited here anyway if any of the books are out of copyright theyre likely on project gutenberg though and available to download in a nook compatible format
books,not_removed,calibre is an open source program that can rip the books from your nook more importantly it can remove the drm so that the books can be loaded to a different ereader mac os x windows linux
books,not_removed,sell your books to amazon ebay or a used book store and then rebuy them on nook although honestly kindles are better imho bigger selection and you can add your own pdfs
books,not_removed,stop by rfreeebooks you will have to pay for the ones that are still in copyright if you want them you may be able to pick some up cheaply gutenbergorg is the place to pick up the public domain books mostly classics there are other legal sites too eg manybooksnet rfreeebooks will have resources collecting the public domain versions and paying for those that arent are the only legal optionsand we dont offer illegal options in rbooks
books,not_removed,that would work but i want physical and digital as a backup
books,not_removed,thats a good point op you should check out projectgutenbergcom to find free copies of public domain ebooks they definitely wont have everything but they might have a few if you read classics
books,not_removed,yikes its going to cost you some money then the bright side is ebooks are generally a lot cheaper then their physical counter part
books,not_removed,ive been meaning to read him for a while now is there any place youd recommend starting
books,not_removed,i have a michelin map of paris which was really useful to visiting and planning metro stops but i dont think thats what youd use it for
books,not_removed,if you can read the original french id recommend quartier perdu which made me discover some places of my very own paris
books,not_removed,anywhere they are rather similar
books,not_removed,his whole thing is looking at similar themes over and over from slightly different perspectives so you really can start anywhere that said i really liked missing person
books,not_removed,yes you are supposed to read it source i am the ghost of david foster wallace
books,not_removed,yeah just bounce around as directed its not linear plot where you have to worry about spoilers also most of the really important info is in the endnotes
books,not_removed,copied from my response when someone else asked this a year ago regarding your specific question qv note sub is quod vide note sub which translates too which see note below this is all to say its referring you to footnote later because it contains the relevant content you will also see supra which will be referring you to a previous footnote above
books,not_removed,have you asked over in rinfinitesummer andor rinfinitejest
books,not_removed,this checks out
books,not_removed,rinfinitejest is better for you in this case rinfinitesummer readers have only reached page or so
books,not_removed,infinite summer began already darn i was hoping to read along this summer but i am only halfway through
books,not_removed,started last week
books,not_removed,subscribed and i vouch this to anyone who feel guilty ashamed or too proud to admit that reading sparknotes cliffnotes etc really help in reading comprehension my professor in literary theory class himself pitched me the idea that these supplementary notes online really do help in reading even if they had already been demoted as pejorative especially in the academe most people would prefer to do the labor of reading by themselves to get pertinent information eg symbolisms metaphors allusions etc through their own perilous effort but sometimes its not too harmful to read an educated reading of the book that youre reading just dont overdo it
books,not_removed,wow just made a post about this subscribed im ready slapstick and entirely lost
books,not_removed,some initial posts will hel
books,not_removed,subscribed good idea
books,not_removed,subbed
books,not_removed,i try to do both
books,not_removed,read them in order better yet listen to the bbc radio show
books,not_removed,a word of warning they get progressively more depressing because the author was struggling with depression while the publisher demanded more books i think at one point the agent locked him in the hotel room and wouldnt let him out until x amount of pages were produced
books,not_removed,you can also listen to the audiobooks narrated by the author himself
books,not_removed,the order is very important i dont know why your friend would say that
books,not_removed,i concur with listening to the bbc audio series
books,not_removed,holy shit really time for a reread
books,not_removed,you should watch the movie wonderland its about the wonderland murders and john holmes involvement in them fantastic film
books,not_removed,many years ago my recollection is sad life
books,not_removed,well laurie holmes talks about this movie in the epilogue of this book and she is very critical the movie seems very far from the truth and even makes look good one killer who was living in the wonderland house but this might be entertaining on its own thank you
books,not_removed,still there are some books we read that may not have had the intended lifechanging impact anticipated until we were a lot older there is no intended lifechanging impact school children read adult books in order to learn essential reading skills necessary to enable them to enjoy adult books later in life this obviously is lifechanging but not in the way i think you meant it i think a lot of people completely miss the point of their own literature education its not for a kid to have an epiphany that steinbeck and shakespeare have captured the anxieties of their ages in a way that is meaningful and beautiful though obviously it would be great if that did happen its to prepare kids with the analytical skills as well as sociopolitical savvy for them to one day a few years later pick up the grapes of wrath or mobydick and be floored by the beauty and wisdom on offer in those great works
books,not_removed,dracula is the only book that i managed to read from my childhood although i have of mice and men planned when i read the book as a child i was interested in the concept but overall wasnt bothered to read any of it properly two years ago it was the first book i properly read and has kickstarted my love of books not only that i appreciate the book for what it is it is an amazing read and some of the chapters and scenes will stay with me one of my most loved books of all time
books,not_removed,i dont think schools especially at the younger grades have students read so they can experience the life changing moment reading at that time is mostly about getting them interested in books stories and writing as well as practicing literacy skills its better for a child to read something anything than to not read but not every school or parent agrees with that i was in an intensive after school tutoring for a while growing up and i remember reading books like the martian chronicles at age i had no idea what was going on i also read the pigman and some other more ageappropriate books that didnt change my life but really kept my interest in books and reading a lot of the books i read in high school didnt change my life but at least i could follow them and find them enjoyable at times i read east of eden last year and i know some people read that in high school but im really glad i didnt high school was a time where i read but didnt interact fully with the text i would read some then sparknotes some if i got busy to pass assignments and classes so i definitely wouldnt have gotten the same out of it
books,not_removed,it wasnt really a lifechanging impact but i understood the joy luck club on a much deeper level than when i first read it when i was twelve there were so many details and implications that i missed as a child the same goes for huckleberry finn i read it when i was nine but only really understood it on the most superficial level my depth of understanding and analysis of the entire book increased so much when i reread it at a later age
books,not_removed,i am legend i was a teen when i read it it was weird i never really thought much of the book when i read it at or but over the years i always think of the perspective from that book the whole time he thought he was doing right he was the good guy in the end not so much that lesson from that book sunk in better then any sunday school lesson and just so i have said it every single version of the movie has pailed in comparison to the book
books,not_removed,hiss noooooo im weird about books though so i keep them as pristine as possible i cant stand to have a ruined book
books,not_removed,i used to rereading a portrait of the artist recently was a treat like a journey back to a much younger self i dont do it now
books,not_removed,its amazing how polarizing this topic is i highlight in my ebooks but thats about it
books,not_removed,nooooooooooooo
books,not_removed,absolutely i generally just draw brackets around sentences or paragraphs that i find particularly interesting
books,not_removed,i dont feel good about writing in books i think the worse sin is folding books behind themselves something in me dies whenever i see that
books,not_removed,try post it notes you can write more too
books,not_removed,hell yeah thats the one thing that actually stuck from having to read and annotate books in school i especially like to sketch little illustrations edit i just realized that i only do it in paperbacks though
books,not_removed,sweet baby jesus no
books,not_removed,ive never really seen a reason for me specifically to write in anything other than textbooks and even then half of the reason is just the desire to draw dicks tits and yonic imagery i understand why others would do it though
books,not_removed,absolutely not weird thing is that im perfectly fine with folding the corner of a page as a bookmarkwith my own books of course
books,not_removed,nope if i want to make notes i copy the page
books,not_removed,i used to be neurotic about not doing it now i find its very handy when i want to reference something in a book and want to find it easily
books,not_removed,nooo i always hate my handwriting after several years and end up reading my own notes in an year old voice postits are better
books,not_removed,depends on the book if its like a fantasy probably not but if i am more involved ill write all over it underline things write things like roflmao
books,not_removed,ive only highlighted in one book house of god by samuel shem a couple of paragraphs really jumped out to me so i wanted to remember them but now i have the issue of not particularly caring to keep it now its finished and yet i do because ive highlighted it
books,not_removed,depends on my book if im reading a nonfiction book then yes if im reading anything else its mostly for pleasure so no
books,not_removed,in a fit of scholarly zeal i wrote in a few of my books during my college days thats late high school for the americans ive regretted it ever since
books,not_removed,yes i love writing in my books because its great being able to go back and see the notes i took i feel like i am leaving a bit of myself in the book even if i only scribbled a lol and it feels like it takes away the passiveness of reading and instead makes it an active activity plus it helps me stay on track and tie in bits and pieces of the book into the overall picture
books,not_removed,im a teacher so the books that i teach have my notes written all over them its fun going back into them and finding things i didnt notice or really think about the same way from one year to the next if its one that i happen to repeat however my books that i read for fun i do not write in or highlight in any way i dont really have a reason for that other than its perhaps how i differentiate work from recreation
books,not_removed,i write my full name and the date i finished the book i hope that one day someone finds the book in a used book store and locates me to chat about the book it would be very random and cool

books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests including asking if you should read a certain book in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,yeah i talked to some others and they had similar opinions im not going to read it thanks for the reply though
books,not_removed,this is the only book that ever really scared me i was not a stephen king fan when i first read it it was a nook special from b n so i purchased it and i am glad i did most people are aware that the book is a lot different than the movie there really is so much more to the book than what the movie was able to show for what its worth i am a big fan of the stanley kubrick movie as well the book delves so much more into the history of the hotel so many more ghosts appear than what is in the movie the hotel itself is an entity and there is a lot of background on jack torrence that would have been helpful to know in the movie as well i have since read several stephen king books some are good some i didnt really care for but the shining is truly a terrifying read and i would highly recommend it enjoy
books,not_removed,its classic king though be warned the film and movie are very different
books,not_removed,the biggest difference between the movie and the book in my opinion is how the father descends into madness in the movie its more of an internal force while the book is much more external forces the book and the movie are so different its almost hard to compare them the movie hits some of kings scarier scenes but leaves out a lot of little scary and awesome details if you ever saw the remake of the shining its more like that version but much better i personally recommend this book to everyone regardless on their stance on the horror genre
books,not_removed,the book is very very different from the film i mean there are still key elements in the film but there is lots of additional things in the novel i personally believe the novel to be better king does as well as he is notoriously bitter at the movie because he thinks it ruins jacks character my advice is to read the book then watch the film again for me after reading the book the movie seemed so much less satisfying not enough emotional payoff in the end missed lots of additional parts that are in the book not enough detail into the hotels history in the film not enough of jacks personal situation and relationship with his family not enough of the ghosts and memories of the hotel bear in mind that i am moving into working in film and have a degree in filmmaking and im fully admitting that i did not find a kubrick film to be as good as the source material ill be lucky if anyone hires me after this post edit just want to be clear the movie is a good movie and i like it a lot but when compared to the book the book wins hands down
books,not_removed,one of the first king books i read i always really liked the movie and i thought the book was great you get more insight into dannys psychic abilities
books,not_removed,read the damn book you wont regret it then read dr sleep
books,not_removed,ill simply say this sk is my favorite author and the shining is my favorite horror novel a and horror movie differences between them and all nothing tops the dread i felt readingwatching the shining
books,not_removed,i would add robert mccammons boys life to that list especially if you are a fan of stephen kings the body it is sad how criminally underappreciated mccammon is
books,not_removed,this book is amazing its one of the few books ive reread over and over personally i think the movie glossed over some of the scarier parts of the book i really cant describe how much this book is from the movie
books,not_removed,i thought the book itself was really good and the movie was okay the beginning is a bit slow in my opinion but towards the middleending is where it gets intense and things really start to get going
books,not_removed,i felt quite uncomfortable reading this book whether it was the hotel the atmosphere the catastrophic feeling or the state of mind of jack i loved this book but loathe it too for a couple of reasons not because the book is bad but for the overall feeling i had when reading it as well as thinking about it now i have nothing more to say about it right now i have yet to see the movie and im not entirely sure how i have dodged seeing it for this long
books,not_removed,i personally enjoyed the film more than the book kubricks shinning was an exemplary film while i thought the source materiel was simply a rather good horror novel however the comparison is rather meaningless the book is the book and the film is the film generally films are significantly worse than their linearly counterparts because films simply try to emulate the source materiel in every respect and cram in a bunch of unnecessary dialogue in too short a time span kubrick is one of the few filmmakers who understood that a film is an entirely different medium than books thus adaptions of books should be heavily altered if one wishes to make a good film its two very different ways to tell the same story and i simply found kubricks telling to be more tense engrossing and thoughtful nevertheless that should not detract from the book in any way it is a genuinely good piece of fiction even if youre not a fan of king youll find a terrifying and enjoyable read youll also find a bit more of the supernatural in the book compared to really one scene in the film
books,not_removed,i had never read much stephen king just the talisman which he cowrote with peter straub and had never seen the film also the horror genre is not my thing i have to say though it is an excellent book i never would have thought mere words on a page could be so frightening i had to restrict myself to reading it only in daylight my family laughed at me king is an excellent storyteller and i found it hard to put down youre in for a scary treat
books,not_removed,be ready for something different than the film if you mean the kubrick film kubrick took the bones heres a recovering alcoholic writer and his family living in a haunted hotel and then put a quite different story around those bones i liked it well enough its a page turner my only complaint is the same i have for any king that everything is boldly telegraphed you know what is eventually going to happen but not what will happen along the way king is most a writer who lets you enjoy the journey more than the destination and thats not a bad thing
books,not_removed,this comment is far more informative than i was expecting to get and i thank you immensely for the time you took to share i am honestly not too big a fan of stephen king i find he focuses on too much boring detail rather than actually developing a horror atmosphere though the stanley kubrick movie is one of my top favorites and there are a couple stephen king books i like alot pet semetary i bought a shirt with kubrick on it solely because of how much i love the film a grudge i hold against stephen is how much dislike he has for the movie version of his booklike cmon man dont be jealous lolll i am very happy to hear that there are more ghosts and more history on jack torrence i was literally just saying days ago that i love the movie and after the thousand times ive seen it still have so many questions about his character so that is fantastic to hear more of his history will be included im a massive horror fan and am difficult to scare so i look forward to starting this book with gusto in the morning edit added words typo
books,not_removed,yeah thats what im expecting im hoping that the long drawn out bouts of detail he is known for will be different in a good way this time around since the house is an entity itself the anxiety of the atmosphere in the story is something i can see being easier to write details about in a frightening way i am not a huge king fan but i do very much enjoy a few of his books and the shining film by kubrick is a masterpiece
books,not_removed,personally im a huge horror fan ive heard for a while now exactly what you said about the book and film being hard to compare i usually always prefer books to their movie adaptation and recently had a discussion with my boyfriend about whether the movie or book is better led to him telling me that books can easily be much scarier than movies due to the human imagination being scarier than anything else to which i agreed with so im extremely excited to hear that there are more details and history in this book cant wait to start it as my sunday morning read
books,not_removed,damn thank you for the brilliant comment im very excited to get more detail more ghosts and history on jack and overall more of the story i honestly have been slightly concerned that the movie wont be as incredible to me after reading i said in another comment that my boyfriend and i decided the book could definitely be scarier than the movie due to the human imagination being so terrifying and im hard to scare so im stoked to dive into the anxiety that is the shining btw badass youre workingabout to work in film my boyfriend is on the same path though hes more of a make your own special effectsdiy sam raimi from evil dead style of filmaker or rather soon to be technically a filmaker so i know a lot of second hand information in that area haha i wish good things for your movie future
books,not_removed,im looking forward to having more of the story to experience d
books,not_removed,aye aye capn im on it right now literally opening the book right now d
books,not_removed,this was one of my favorite comments to read lmao thank you for that wonderful beginning i so wish i could put off reading the novel when it starts to feel and look like fall but i simply cant force myself to wait two months lol im actually really looking forward to the differences in the book ive been hearing that theres a lot more detail and delves more into jacks history which i was literally just saying there is a lack of in the movie just a few days ago haha im sitting here with the book on my lap about to dive in
books,not_removed,i cant begin to describe how much i am looking forward to the dread and anxiety of this book hahaha im actually starting it right now
books,not_removed,thank you i love being recommended an author i will definitely check out mr mccammon
books,not_removed,i love the honesty and bluntness of this comment youre cool
books,not_removed,great perspective i admire the way you look at it i am an enormous fan of the movie and i do already see them as different things even without having read the book so im certain ill be able to separate them entirely after finishing it as well but i love your take on it and i appreciate the time you took to share d
books,not_removed,thats great to hear i love that you enjoyed it so much even though you arent into the horror genre i am looking to be scared as i dont scare easily and i love the anxiety that fills the movie your comment is promising thanks so much for your input
books,not_removed,wonderfully worded input thank you yes i havent even seen the made for tv mini series as my boyfriend loves the kubrick film as i do but hates the mini series lmao edit typo
books,not_removed,he is a brilliant author and on par with stephen king in my opinion its a shame hes not as well known
books,not_removed,do you have other recommendations by him i am planning on going to hpb this week and i like to buy in bulk so that ive got plenty of material as i read very quickly ill be done with the shining in days flat
books,not_removed,boys life is amazing and very similar in tone to the body coming of age in a small town in the and swan song which is mccammons version of the stand huge postapocalyptic novel he also has a series of historical mysteries about a detective in colonial america in the late century the first of which is speaks the nightbird just like stephen king though his body of work is very diverse and you cant go wrong with any of his books but those mentioned above are his most recommended work he also has a short story collection called blue world if youd like to try him in short form
books,not_removed,heres the japanese version it seems to be legal out of copyright
books,not_removed,and heres the english version in epub and mobi format again seems to be legit legal httpsarchiveorgdetailssanshironatsumesoseki you can read epub files in apples ibooks or the free ebook software httpscalibreebookcom

books,not_removed,probably the only required reading book from high school i genuinely enjoyed reading
books,not_removed,in australia trash means it is really terrible so your post makes no sense to me can you please rephrase in clear english so i can understand i have this on my toread list so i am keen to see your opinion
books,not_removed,its no delorous claiborne by stephen king
books,not_removed,how is it trash
books,not_removed,favorite book of all time required read in high school my friends and i still periodically joke about edmond dantes lurking in the shadows i recommend to everyone all the time the long con op is edmond dantes
books,not_removed,glad to know i just picked it up and i never read i just heard it was great and figured id dive in yea theres a lot of french locations that will be mostly meaningless to me and i have to google a word now and then but its pretty well defined early on and not abstract at all it seems to have the narrative blocking of a stage play which makes things easier to understand leavs enters returns etc
books,not_removed,i just finished rereading it earlier this month i think i enjoyed it more the second time around
books,not_removed,oh man some of these required to read books this summer are so slow its been putting my work ethic at risk the tiny pages one can be just read in a day because i have to but the ones that take multiple days weeks to read are so i read pages out of the first part and read the commentary and summary online while completely forgetting a second part even exist jump all the unnecessary parts exercise fast reading well that may be useful going forward and perhaps the reason we have to read these books lol and just basically do awful stuff i never found myself doing before but hey some of them are very enjoyable the name of the rose to name an example is great once you get past the ancient language and the description of the churchs front skip that and i promise everything will be fine i just want to be done with required books quickly so i can read something off my personal reading list that by now is becoming an expensive burden on my shelves
books,not_removed,in the us trash means terrible as well i dont know what op is talking about bc it contradicts his point
books,not_removed,maybe trashy would be better i mean its the century equivalent of those thrillers your mum reads only done really really well

books,not_removed,ive read maze runner one and this is easily as compulsive
books,not_removed,im the way through the possessed right now for context i love dostoyevsky the idiot crime and punishment and the brothers karamazov are some of my most cherished books of all time but like you im bored while reading the possessed and i have been bored since the beginning im just crazy enough that i have to finish books that i start so im still reading this accursed thing i kinda regret picking it up in the first place so i can tell you that it doesnt get any better after pages at least for some reason the possessed doesnt have the characters nor the philosophical discussion that kept me interested during the idiot brothers k and cp in the possessed we spend far too much time with the boring characters stepan trofimovitch etc and far too little with the interesting ones pyotr stepanovitch and stavrogin the religious and philosophical discussions are few and far between thats why i think its boring whats making you bored
books,not_removed,never read that one but i do love dostoyevsky crime and punishment is a masterpiece notes from the underground is great brothers karamazov is a good read too
books,not_removed,please post recommendation requests including should i read and should i continue reading requests in rsuggestmeabook or the weekly thread
books,not_removed,exactly you nailed it im bored and extremely disappointed for all the reasons you mentioned thank you i try not to give up on a book but if im persuaded its a waste i happily move on dostoyevsky you have failed me

books,not_removed,the alchemist by paulo coelho a cliche pseudophilosophical waste of time
books,not_removed,wuthering heights i was expecting to be swept away by gothic romance it is beautifully written and the way the story unfolds is engrossing but i found catherine and heathcliff as protagonists to be two of the most annoying self centered characters i had ever read until that is i read twilight which had been highly recommended to me by well read friends whose opinion i thought i could trust if i hadnt been trapped on an airplane at the time i would have thrown it across the room bella is by far the most useless character i have encountered a true waste of ink and paper as a narrative voice she is worse than nails on a chalkboard
books,not_removed,the great gatsby i was told it was going to be all sorts of amazing and would become my favourite book i thought it was terrible i didnt like any of the characters and couldnt have cared less what happened to any of them i felt like i was expected to like it because its a classic but ive read far better literature than this

books,not_removed,tree of smoke by denis johnson im not one to gripe about mfa style books but this epitomizes every problem that a modernday capitall literatury novel can have lack of purpose showing off with flowery prose that doesnt advance the story superficial use of historical setting quantity of characters over quality padded length and more if there was ever a book that vindicates the most common criticisms of things like the pulitzer prize and the national book award tree of smoke is it

books,not_removed,thats how i felt about the last book in the hunger games series i literally threw it across the room i was so annoyed
books,not_removed,thats exactly how i felt
books,not_removed,i read this series on a whim because i generally enjoyed the hunger games and figured what the hell another dystopian ya series couldnt be that bad right ive been cursing my inability to leave a series unfinished ever since
books,not_removed,i read a few chapters of twilight mostly so i didnt have to deal with any guilt talking shit on it before having read it i regret every letter
books,not_removed,oh god i hated wuthering heights with a passion i didnt like the characters or the writing and i felt like the whole story moved super slow i read it over the summer for a literature class really wanted to like it but i just wasnt able to
books,not_removed,why is this true
books,not_removed,agreed its legacy definitely outweighs the quality book i really enjoy ed anno dracula though its essentially a mix of dracula and alternate history
books,not_removed,i was so disappointed at what he did to the odd thomas books
books,not_removed,what was it then in your opinion curious
books,not_removed,i actually liked that book but the ending was very strange the title and everything in the story builds up that final meeting and while hearing hawthorne abendsen talk about the grasshopper lies heavy was very interesting but the book ends on a very anticlimactic note
books,not_removed,pattinson like stewart doesnt need to wipe away twilight because they both have had thriving careers since it ended
books,not_removed,yup thats the one its the script of the new play that premiered in west end to be fair though jkr technically didnt write it although she did consult on it it felt like poorly written fanfic i was cringing seeing my beloved characters being turned into caricatures i partly blame my own high expectations
books,not_removed,the thing was a mess to mestory was crap i dont care about some guys jewelry store other guys making jewelry and another guy questioning if the jewelry makes him feel a certain waythe plot was a great idea the story made no sense to me
books,not_removed,it has a logbook format for me its robinson crusoe in space the thing is there is little tension because we know beforehand that the author is going to survive so its boring in that kind of way i mean its no john carter there are no aliens no beautiful princesses to rescue and no enemies and unlike robinson crusoe it offers no philosophical reflection on human nature and theres no adopted child no cannibals and no pirates if you want that just read robinson crusoe still the martian was an excellent exercise of hard scifi everything in there save the sandstorm plot device at the beginning was not just physically possible but plausible scifi like this is extremely rare these days also it was written for space geeks and hard scifi fans not the general public
books,not_removed,agreed the exposition in the first few pages was so clumsy and forced that i couldnt keep going maybe i missed a good story but it was hiding under wordplay that made me cringe as another poster noted it was obvious it was written for hardened fans and that didnt do it any favors too many books in the genre suffer from lazy writing simply because the category is so niche its expected they can get away with it
books,not_removed,i feel like thats what the harry potter universe has become fanfic jk rowling just cant leave it alone at least fantastic beasts looks to be going in a new direction albeit in the same general universe
books,not_removed,lets be honest cursed child in the harry potter universe probably shouldnt have existed the original seven books should have been left alone im all for different stories about different characters set in the magical world like the fantastic beasts movie but cursed child was a disaster
books,not_removed,for me its go set a watchmen all it did was detract from to kill a mockingbird
books,not_removed,i personally hated stephen kingss sequel to the shining doctor sleep it was a mediocre king novel at best and a horrible sequel id have to say that jurassic park didnt need a sequel either
books,not_removed,catch closing time felt completely unnecessary and spoiled the cliffhanger ending to the first book wish i hadnt read it
books,not_removed,the old testament the new one was way too toned down to appeal to a wider audience
books,not_removed,i feel the same way about dune first book is a classic ignore the rest i just bought a copy of duneive heard so many good things about it dont know when ill get to it though so many others on my to read pile shame to hear about the rest of the dune series do you think its worth it giving them at least a glance or would i be wasting my time
books,not_removed,the mote in gods eye sequel was terrible original was genius
books,not_removed,theres three big classics of science fiction that got sequels which shouldnt have been bothered with enders game ironically the original was only fleshed out to novel length because card wanted to establish the main character for speaker for the dead and the subsequent novels but those were in no way as good as the original enders game is the epitome of hard scifi with a great single premise whereas the sequels drift further and further into weird unrelated directions rendezvous with rama it was never intended to have a sequel but clarke was persuaded to work with gentry lee on one and you can tell that its almost all lee different style different vision while not altogether terrible i find the original cleaner more focused and it doesnt explain too much of the mystery ringworld i never liked the original ringworld as much as some people because it seemed like the plot was really an excuse for the literary equivalent of scenery porn showing off all the stuff that the characters ran in to along the way but the sequel was pretty much just capitalizing on the success of the first and didnt live up to standards
books,not_removed,dune can get away with one or even two more books but after that herbert just beat a dead horse and then his son came along
books,not_removed,the sparrow by mary doria russell the first book comes with my highest level of recommendation its stayed with me over the years really should have just left it there no need for a follow up
books,not_removed,australian kids grew up reading the tomorrow series by john marsden it was absolutely iconic and then he rebooted the series
books,not_removed,not exactly one book but the initial earthsea trilogy should have stayed just that le guin returned to the story some years after writing the third book and in my opinion destroyed a lot of what was meaningful in the original trilogy
books,not_removed,after you by jojo moyes enjoyable but not really necessary
books,not_removed,thankfully the series is dying out and i havent heard much about it for years but the young adult series called rangers apprentice really should have stopped about halfway through or sooner as a teen that was the first series to truly disappoint me i havent trusted long fantasy series since and usually have to consult friends or reviews before i commit myself to reading books that i havent heard of rangers apprentice is the poster child of a series full of potential ruined by an author who started the series with no true vision in mind after a few books you realized he had no idea where he wanted the story to go and had no actual conclusion or ending in mind the first books are set within a fantasy style world with monsters and evil tyrants full of character development and good storytelling then the monsters somehow just go away in the next books never to be spoken of or heard from again along with the evil tyrant guy then the main characters start to basically reverse their development polarizing into just a bland portrait of themselves this boys a noble hero this girls a pretty diplomat this mans a hardened veteran blah blah blah the author eventually had to release a book called the lost chronicles or some crap like that in order to fill the giant gaping holes he left in the original books waittheyre married now when did that happen stuff like that it was just a disaster i donated all of my copies to goodwill and dont want to ever touch them again
books,not_removed,its ironic but as soon as i saw the title of this thread i thought of the vampire chronicles i think anne rices problem is that she cant write the present day as long as shes writing in a historical setting its good but as soon as the time switches to the present its awful the same thing happened in the witching hour
books,not_removed,charlie and the chocolate factory read the wikipedia page on the next book it gets quite ridiculous imo
books,not_removed,my sweet audrina by vc andrews should have stayed a stand alone book
books,not_removed,and all that and now all this only has one bit that is truly memorable
books,not_removed,the fourth girl with the dragon tattoo book especially since manuscripts exist from the official author but no they wanted to get greedy and just purchase another author to carry on with it
books,not_removed,this is somewhat opposite to the question posed but id like to give an example of a book series that defies a lot of preconceptions about sequels being bad brian jacquess redwall series is fantasy novels that follow a very specific formulaic plot and yet each book has characters who feel very different from previous characters who filled the same role vermin bad guy redwall warrior badger lord etc each story has dumb little dibbuns that get themselves in trouble yet they never feel repetitive each story has the bumbling vermin character for comedic relief yet each one is refreshing and so on and so forth it feels like redwall breaks every rule pertaining to what a sequel shouldnt be and i think that speaks volumes about a books heart and soul being more important than any character world or plot
books,not_removed,the girl with the dragon tattoo lisbeth had a backstory better left unexplored
books,not_removed,i feel the same way about interview with the vampire i also liked the vampire lestat and the the witching hour rice is a good writer but she really just doesnt know when to quit now lestat goes to atlantis ugh
books,not_removed,the giver dont get me wrong the sequels were good but the ending of book just stuck with me and im normally not a huge fan of the open for interpretation style of ending
books,not_removed,the gunslinger i hate all the subsequent books susanna is the worst character in any book ive ever read and that stupid sentient train seemed like a bad short story idea i loved the gunslinger as a stand alone novel the ending felt so complete bold and final
books,not_removed,have you seen the play it was clearly created specifically for the stage and seeing the production is really incredible the story is a bit weak but with the performances and the production values i hardly noticed
books,not_removed,lost world was pretty weak yeah but i disagree with you on dr sleep the allegorical use of alcoholism and domestic upheaval doesnt seem quite as hamfisted as in other king books and rose the hat is one of his more intriguing villains what keeps it from being objectively great is the shallowness of the other true knot members and the fact that the ghost of kubricks adaptation looms over anything shining related like a celluloid spectre i personally really enjoyed it
books,not_removed,i loved doctor sleep but i went on knowing it was completely different to the shining so i wasnt expecting it to be similar at all besides the history of the characters
books,not_removed,came here to say this is my favorite book but closing time is just awful i gave up before i was pages in
books,not_removed,personally id say the rest are definitely worth a read i loved messiah almost as much as the original and thought chapterhouse was excellent and thoroughly enjoyed the others though i havent read any by brian herbert kja yet youll hear a lot of different dune opinions some people think dune was the only good one some people think children of dune or messiah or god emperor was the last good one some people prefer just the first book and the last one frank herbert wrote chapterhouse even the books by brian herbert and kevin j anderson have their fans and theyre universally loathed otherwise
books,not_removed,dune messiah is a pretty good follow up which handles some of the fallout from the original novel i never bothered going farther than that because i knew from reading up on it that messiah provided as good an ending as any that said i dont think messiah necessarily adds too much to the original
books,not_removed,i liked the first three and then really started getting cheesed off and stopped reading the series basically dune is so outstanding id recommend stopping at the first
books,not_removed,i just got through the incredible slog that was children of dune and have no desire to continue it was boring and incomprehensible
books,not_removed,read the second and third if you like finish there
books,not_removed,some people like them some dont i recommend reading something else since you already read the best the series has to offer and it wasnt originally intended to be a series
books,not_removed,actually i think that mote did deserve a sequel just not the two we got thats right i said two and if you dont know the other one count yourself lucky
books,not_removed,totally agree the gripping hand was one of only two books i can remember just quitting partway through and not even thinking i will ever try again i left it in a hospital waiting room while waiting for a vasectomy i do like that expression though the gripping hand as opposed to on the other hand
books,not_removed,i thought speaker for the dead was great xenocide and children of the mind not so much the enders shadow series was awesome too
books,not_removed,gentry lee wrote all the follow ups clarke did that with all the co writing gigs he is credited to in the and
books,not_removed,honestly i only remember liking every second book in that series and yeah the sequel series was awful
books,not_removed,huh i remember reading the first couple of those years ago pity to hear that the series went so far down hill
books,not_removed,those books were the shit but i got bored around book also that was in the like the grade where id read anything and like it
books,not_removed,if youre talking about the one where charlie and willie wonka travel to a space hotel under siege by shapechanging aliens then i respectfully disagree and will defend that book until my last breath
books,not_removed,read the wiki but for the sake of your sanity dont read the sequel
books,not_removed,i loved the great glass elevator are you suggesting that tiny men making magic chocolate and sweets complete with a chocolate river magic shrinking ray and chewing gum that turns you into a blueberry isnt quite a ridiculous idea
books,not_removed,i remember vaguely reading it years ago something with weird aliens in an alien hotel it was weird but i did like it i guess because i was still a child
books,not_removed,would that be the arthurian cycle with the siege perilous and the excalibrake
books,not_removed,i enjoyed the second two books in hyperion but the first two were so much better
books,not_removed,i loved annihilation but have not been able to get into the sequel its such a dramatic shift in style and subject it doesnt even feel connected to the first book
books,not_removed,have you read wind through the keyhole its great
books,not_removed,strange i thought gunslinger was the weakest in the series i was blown away by how much more gripping drawing of the three was
books,not_removed,thats like saying jupiter ascending was worthwhile because it looked fantastic on screen i dont care how pretty it was or how fun it was for the small percentage of people who could see it if the story is crap then none of that should really matter especially when most people wont ever see it on stage
books,not_removed,a pretty production and good acting can only take it so far thats like putting icing and sprinkles on a cow patty and calling it a cake and by cow patty i mean cow shit the plot stinks theres no way around that
books,not_removed,i cant wait for the sequel to catcher in the rye
books,not_removed,this i even wondered whether he had a book about a boy who had visions and then just crowbarred in the connection to the shining as a standalone it was fine but it was undone by its own comparison to a far superior book
books,not_removed,i felt the same but when i finished it and read the last few pages of authors words about the book it changed my view and finnaly saw the true meaning behind the plot and loved it but on the other hand the book is not enjoyable alone and if it needs a few additional words to push it through then oh well
books,not_removed,i am aware of it and my husband read it and i think we even own it in paperback after my disgust with gripping he warned me off the third maybe its like highlander there should have been only one
books,not_removed,i loved all three of these and find them immensely more beautiful and thoughtprovoking than enders game eg was incredibly entertaining and i loved it as well but the others just have so much more depth
books,not_removed,i vaguely recall loving this book and realize i must reread it now
books,not_removed,i do like the vermicious knids
books,not_removed,truth i read the sequel when i was i blame it for all my paranoias
books,not_removed,no i want to though ive got a couple left in the original series
books,not_removed,i think i may be in the minority with my opinion gunslinger was a page turner for me and the rest have been a chore i keep hoping one will bring back the magic for me
books,not_removed,was it called the glass elevator
books,not_removed,well fair enough haha and for what its worth i read up to book five and found four to all be more like eachother than gunslinger
books,not_removed,the great glass elevator i think
books,not_removed,yes
books,not_removed,i would read book i did read book in fact its different but its good and while it adds to the world of the story more than the story itself i cant imagine reading book without it
books,not_removed,i didnt like the book much as you said its filled with clich√©s and i didnt think it was well written although that might change in the sequels i currently have no interest in reading if you like the military scifi genre i recommend the classics from which the clich√©s in this one come although unintentionally according to scalzi the forever war and starship troopers and to some extent enders game
books,not_removed,it was a fun read though not the best mil scifi ive read
books,not_removed,i had a lot of fun with this read a good quick read for a sci fi fix
books,not_removed,yeah ive been reading a mix of scifi mostly star wars eu and fantasy currently reading the lions of alrassan until if the winds of winter gets released
books,not_removed,i read all the books except zoes tale which i skipped and didnt miss in about a week and each time i started a new one i felt a bit jolted because as mentioned elsewhere it doesnt follow one group of characters and switches perspectives however after getting readjusted it felt natural each time and i really enjoyed the whole series
books,not_removed,i cant imagine reading book without it thats what i needed to know thanks i really appreciate it
books,not_removed,so the series progresses to be less a coherent throughline and more of a multiple pointofview take on everything in that universe
books,not_removed,what was the best mil scifi
books,not_removed,me too i wanted to take a break from the expanse for a bit as id read straight but wanted to stick around in the scifi genre because im on a kick it would seem
books,not_removed,hammers slammers by david drake
books,not_removed,cant you just read the same book youre simultaneously listening to on audible or whatever i dont really understand what youre asking for
books,not_removed,amazon has whispersync which does this
books,not_removed,if you buy a kindle book and its corresponding whispersync for voice supported audible book the kindle app for mobile does exactly this
books,not_removed,service that teaches you how and when to use capslock for emphasis
books,not_removed,google books has this feature on many ebooks
books,not_removed,personal choice a few authors do it the most mentioned in rbooks is cormac mccarthy schmoop has httpwwwshmoopcomangelasasheswritingstylehtml why frank mccourt writes in this style ditto they have httpwwwshmoopcomtheroadmccarthywritingstylehtml theyre right it creates a far more direct style personally i like it as long as its obviously contributing to the story in these cases it does the story is stronger
books,not_removed,its more common in literary fiction than this sub would have you to believe joyce mccarthy gaddis gass faulkner some authors prefer a more stripped down look on the page some are participating in a literary tradition of authors who use minimal punctuation some are trying to create a more forceful and immersive style some argue that punctuation can actually impede the readers comprehension and this i can agree with after finishing suttree no quotation marks it was jarring to read inherent vice include quotation marks frankly some of the other comments here are downright antiintellectual if youre finding that no quotation marks is really hindering your understanding of the novel then its very possible that you need to be a better reader there are plenty of clues to follow who is saying what in a mccarthy novel its possible that the scene is unclear because the author is a shit writer but mccourt and mccarthy and gass are not shit writers and sometimes the lack of clarity may be exactly what the author is going for intentionally making you struggle over understanding what is spoken dialogue and stream of consciousness narration for example again you can wave your hand and say its not your thing but why should every writer follow the same exact conventions thats like saying that all artists should use oil paints all musicians should play the same scale and chord progressions kind of a shame to dismiss all authors who do this as pretentious especially coming from a subreddit devoted to books before you jump to use that buzzword again might wanna ask yourself is it possible i am the one missing something here
books,not_removed,lots of books dont use quotation marks ulysses comes to mind jut because im reading it now it has to do with the style of the author
books,not_removed,i like when authors dont use quotation marks it gives the story more of an intimate feeling it shows that the precise formulation of the dialogue isnt terribly important as other users have mentioned it feels less like a script of course you wouldnt want to do it in stories where the dialogue alone carries most of the content
books,not_removed,why she asked why does he not use quotation marks because well he uttered utterly befuddled by the thought that it was unclear i mean its easy enough to understand no he looked brow furrowed head atilt as she flipped the pages back and forth no i cant understand it whos talking her head shaking side to side we are isnt that enough is there a legitimate reason for it sure he said i mean why not legitimate his head sank soft sigh resignation soft regret for having said it he recalled a line from the oxen of the sun unhappy woman she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate
books,not_removed,its been a feature of irish literature for over a century im not sure if joyce started it maybe as a way of identifying with french habits rather than english a lot of scots do it as well james kelman and alan warner come to mind
books,not_removed,jose saramago comes to mind for this style in his works it tends to add to the almost claustrophobic intimacy youre not hearing the story being told youre just there experiencing it with the character
books,not_removed,i just finished all things cease to appear not to long ago it was written this way at first it was super annoying bothered me but then my brain got used to it it seemed to flow pretty well after that i still prefer quotation marks though
books,not_removed,the answer is some authors and speedreaders are against quotation marks because they slow your brain down yeah i used em what they gonna do about it
books,not_removed,its taking the novel one step further away from being like a script or play to me it also keeps the narrative to one voice in my head as though the story is being told to me and the gruff voice speaking to me doesnt change itself for children or women
books,not_removed,i know of no valid reason to do that other than it being a stylistic oddity to draw attention to being different cormac mccarthy does some odd punctuation in some of his works too and it does nothing for me but draw me out of the story but for some people it works go figure i just think its pretentious nonsense
books,not_removed,i remember mccarthy saying in an interview once something like he doesnt like to clutter up his writing with a bunch of funny little marks
books,not_removed,i definitely do not agree that the story is stronger with lack of punctuation i think it needlessly reduces clarity
books,not_removed,what about authors who still use line breaks ive seen some use emdashes ‚Äî same idea
books,not_removed,i just think its pretentious nonsense this is almost always the truth at the core whether it is admitted to or not
books,not_removed,i tried to read a cormac mccarthy book and thought why doesnt this cocksucker use quotation marks ‚Äîjames ellroy
books,not_removed,i absolutely agree so many people say its style or artistic choice since when is breaking grammar rules for no reason an artistic choice
books,not_removed,its all a part of the authors style though you may think it reduces clarity but others might find that it helps blend stream of cosciousness more seemlessly into the narration sometimes absolute clarity is not an objective
books,not_removed,well he does have reasons
books,not_removed,interesting they are em dashes in typography world
books,not_removed,this seems like a classic example of too much of a good thing mccarthy says that his rejection of punctuation to whatever extent is about increasing clarity he learned this from simplifying english essays being that im in the middle of reading mills on liberty i can understand his intention however i think hes gone too far in the other direction to the point that hes defeated his own purpose his prose is less clear for his attempt at maximum clarity
books,not_removed,simplifying doesnt mean increased clarity or adding to the meaning of the book no intro to creative writing student would get away with it so i dont see how mccarthy gets a pass
books,not_removed,except mccarthys a bad ass besides creative writing students can get away with it
books,not_removed,so the essence of the duel and epilogue is this i wanted readers to live with both possible results for a bit of time then realize as the awareness turned that the grief was essentially equal whichever man died the point is that one of them had to given where the world had gone it was never a trick it was embedded in the underlying idea of the novel for me i also felt technically that this sort of device could not be first introduced at the very end it needed laying in as an element of the storytelling earlier and that is the point of the carnival scene when it also emerges late that it is velaz lying on the ground that scene is what in craft terms allows me to echo the process at the end there have been some readers who feel irritated and fooled and i admit it has always startled me this was central to the themes of the novel the experience i wanted to offer
books,not_removed,for years and years this was my favourite ggk book until being supplanted by lord of emperors upon an audiobook binge last year this is also among some of my friends one of the most hotly contested books because of the ending more than one has felt a little manipulated or betrayed because of the abrupt aboutface in the epilogue in interviews guy has said that he did the epilogue this way in order to create in the reader the sensation of both final combatants winning losing the last battle when ammar and rodrigos forces came together ive always loved what this did to me still does and it is part of what makes it one of my favourite books let alone ggk book though i understand why some of my friends feel differently i respectfully disagree with their stance of authorial betrayal andor manipulation also this book ripped me apart more often than most others this line jehane wait another voice from behind them a womans voice rodrigo turned very slowly your father wishes to examine the boy said eliane bet danel niagara falls
books,not_removed,ill be here tomorrow night doing an ama from pm edt to field probing questions about books single malt scotch the sad state of the yankees travel and puns and whatever else comes to mind catch you then
books,not_removed,hello all i promised id drop in here at times and i will just back from leg of tour for children of earth and sky and home for a bit more or less at some point if people want ill address the issue some have with the ending the ambiguity at end of the duel and the sleight of hand pen in the first part of epilogue ggk
books,not_removed,one of the most beautifully written and gripping books i have ever read despite it being relatively long i didnt want it to end the relationships between the main characters are very well built and that between ammar and rodrigo was so perfect it almost had to end in tragedy the fight scene between them was brilliantly written i was relieved that the scene not go into a massive amount of drawnout detail and writing it from the point of view of miranda and jehane was genius as it made us see it from their eyes and with their emotions i personally loved the ending i think that rodrigo would have been happy that his sons did not always live under his shadow and ammar deserved his happily ever after growing old among his friends i also appreciated the strong female characters in the book when reading the list of characters at the beginning i assumed that zabira would fall into the so sexy you dont notice shes a backstabbing whatsit concubine trope and jehane would be an utterly pragmatic frump who all the men love despite her intelligence and quick tongue i was delighted to be proven wrong great book
books,not_removed,truly a beautiful book i love how internally consistent and organic the world he built feels admittedly it draws a lot from our world the most organic of all worlds ggk never makes the mistake of sacrificing story for realism the book has so many people acting irrationally and contradictory and so many unbelievable coincidences that another author may have looked at it and been like no that would never happen but this fails on two levels first we impose a narrative structure on history so when narrative tries to imitate history it resonates more deeply when the narrative is rewarded second history is full of things that would be called unrealistic in other books ggk is a true talent his books are historical without being impersonal epic without being exhausting and beautiful without being flowery id love to see him tackle something closer to home like the enlightenment or colonialism i loved the baroque cycle by neal stephenson but i sometimes feel like he was too constrained by reality and replacing his meticulousness with ggks poetry would be really exciting
books,not_removed,i really enjoyed the books my only issues with it really it may only be confusion is the relationship between jehane and ammar from the beggining they showed some interest in each other but it didnt seem to progress that much that is until the night of the carnival at which point it immediately transitioned from that to full blown lovers did i miss something or should most of their relationship be assumed to have advanced off screen
books,not_removed,so i finished this one today just in time that ending was a pretty epic troll i definitely enjoyed the novel i thought the scenes were welldescribed i liked most of the characters i thought it was a bit cheesy at points but that is okay there was often writing like rodrigo ammar ghalib were the greatest swordsman ever and had never been knocked or beaten down since childhood etc or the perspective of one character would end on and then their life was changed forever that night and then cut to new perspective thats pretty typical stuff of epic fantasy but i always involuntarily roll my eyes at it the ending did keep me in some suspense of trying to figure out who in particular died its essentially misdirection which is a trick but i dont mind that i felt the saddest and most emotional part of the book was when rodrigo went up and held his son diego on the assumption he was dead this book does alot of fooling you overall i very much liked the book and would recommend it to others i also liked the fact it is written in a historical but technically alternate setting which gives it a stronger feeling of realism while also giving the author free reign on where to take the story without rewriting history i have heard good things about tigana and expect to pick that up some point in the future
books,not_removed,read it two summers ago and thought that even though its a fantasy novel set in an ancient imaginary world it truly resonated with our world what struck me with the novel was how ggk used ellipsis leaving major events untold or to the imagination of the reader the whole final battle between the two main characters could have been told as a long epic battle with tons of details but he chose to basically fade to black and let the reader fill in the blank not just a great fantasy novel but a great novel period
books,not_removed,i just finished reading this and it was beautiful and heartbreaking i loved the skill you used in hiding plot outcomes in the two scenes you mentioned even though my heart was in my throat the whole time during both parts
books,not_removed,i actually also just finished the book as well and it was so incredible i really like the ambiguity that you use in the carnival and at the final duel since my mind is racing from character to character trying to figure out who it was that had died i especially love the way that you developed both rodrigo and ammar to make us love them both normally when something tragic happens in a book im reading my mind is running from every possible scenario as to how that could have changed to make the outcome more positive but in the case of lions there was no change in the outcome that made me any happier which is a testament to how well you wrote both characters i loved this book so much im definitely going to recommend it to everyone i know thank you
books,not_removed,as in here in this thread or as in rbooks or riama thanks for communicating with your readers
books,not_removed,i feel like it was written so jehane appeared to be on the cusp of completely falling for rodrigo or ammar she is reluctant to give into such feelings but she has built up love and respect for both of these men over their time together some which did happen on and off screen thats why the night of the carnival could have gone either way but she makes her decision to go with ammar and sure enough he was already there waiting it simply just takes off from there relationships can take off like that sometimes especially between two people who have known each other for awhile
books,not_removed,i was looking to nitpick on this list but man looks like all the standards were well covered hammett steinbeck ellroy and even the less standard dick butler double points for the veronica mars inclusion the only book id add for consideration california by edan lepucki
books,not_removed,please read our httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules regarding booklists alternatively there is rbooklists
books,not_removed,great list washingtons would be much shorter but shares with california the distinction of one its best having roots in nc maupin for sf tom robbins for seattle and surrounding love that you have michelle tea on it every young person today should read valencia however there is a significant omission thomas pynchon the crying of lot vineland and inherent vice stand out pynchon is where the beat sensibility got an injection of science akmost a definition of the ethos of silicon valley read him if you havent

books,not_removed,many many thanks to you all so glad you all liked im kind of amad out and i have a book due on my editors desk next week so im done for now i think i answered everything but ill duck back a little later with fresh eyes just in case i missed something thanks again
books,not_removed,has there been any interest from producers in adapting your novels the fold into a television or miniseries whether that be fox syfy netflix amazon etc
books,not_removed,just wanted to say that i read your book and loved it ive been an avid reader for years but mostly read books written in my own language english books have never really grabbed me probably because of the language barrier and my lacking vocabolary but your book gave me back hope in reading books written in english not because your book was written poorly but it was good enough for me to use my dictionary dilligently i just could not turn the pages fast enough now both my sister and father have read it and they loved it as well both them and i recommend your book to our reading friends now to my question in the last section of the book when the house moves i hope this is allowed to say when the thread is spoiler tagged i felt that the story changed a lot from a spookymystery to way more action and perhaps a bit rushed were you intending for this part to have a different vibe were the characters meant to have spent more time there its by no means a complain i loved the part it just felt very different and was wondering if this was intended or perhaps an editorial choise i am very much looking forward to read the fold and your other works thanks for doing this ama regards christoffer
books,not_removed,i read the fold before discovering reading them in reverse order was actually kind of cool while reading scenes from the matrix kept popping into my head how nothing is what it seems and the government is here to help were you at all inspired by those movies
books,not_removed,im very excited you are doing this ama your books have been the majority of my audible credit uses for a few months and one of the few times i actually purchased one without a credit with the ex books how far in advance did you have this story planned did you know in ex heroes that project krypton was out there or in ex patriots that the corpse girl was wandering the desert edit changed have to how
books,not_removed,holy cow i read the fold then got and then bought all of exheroes great stuff man thanks for those the idea of a zombie apocalypse happening in a world with super heroes is gold i really dont have a question just wanted to fan boy out for a second btw a foldexheroes crossover would be extra gold
books,not_removed,who would you have play the lead roles were it made in to a movie
books,not_removed,if someone was looking for recommendations for a lovecraft type novel would you recommend or would recommending it spoil the twist
books,not_removed,have you ever seen a ghost
books,not_removed,would you ratherattempt to summit mt everest or spend month aboard a submerged submarine why
books,not_removed,whats the difference in the process like between writing a screenplay versus writing a novel
books,not_removed,if st george flew by hancock park would he see the ex version of the kavach building with its own machine chugging away unguarded i love the multiversal concept of extremely similar but different universes
books,not_removed,i wanted to know if you took any of your inspiration for the fold from sliders
books,not_removed,did you take inspiration for the main group members in from anyone in your life
books,not_removed,mr clines my wife and i love the ex series while i dont think well ever have our fill have you mentally sketeched out an end for our heroes
books,not_removed,mr clines huge fan of both the fold and i have not yet jumped into exheroes yet but have it in my list of things to listen too for the next installment of the aptly named koteroverse will it be an additional story adding to the core team similar to mike joining nate and friends or will it move onto a larger picture could it lead to a larger scale lovecraft epic with multiple installments has anyone approached you about a netflix or streaming service adaptation who would you want to play nate mike and veek thanks in advance for doing another ama really looking forward to reading more of your work
books,not_removed,no question just wanted to say i love all your books especially the fold thanks for being awesome
books,not_removed,huge fan of how the fold and are interconnected yet either can be read first personally i read the fold first in particular seems like it would translate well to an adventure game was it possible you had videogames on the mind when writing it
books,not_removed,i love all of your work ive always wondered is there a connection between the exheroes universe and the world of the junkie quatrain i know one character crosses over oh lord are they going to be accessed using the accidental world hopping from the fold giant clines crossover
books,not_removed,ive heard rumours of a sequel to the fold coming out is this true if so does it have a title yet and do you have an idea of when it would be coming out
books,not_removed,when youre in the process of writing a book whats your routine like do you wake up early do you have a special work computerroomcoffee drink do you try to hit a word limit let us take a peek inside your world
books,not_removed,thanks for doing this ama i love the ex series when my brother first described it to me i thought that it sounded amazing you got zombies in my superheroes you got superheroes in my zombies exheroes two great tastes that taste great together so since they kind of want us to ask questions here what type of superhero would you want to be in the ex world assuming you would want to be a hero rather than a zombie
books,not_removed,do you ever read amazon reviews i always heard that was some writers guilty pleasuredispleasure
books,not_removed,oh my god oh my god i was just thinking about finding a way to ask you a question yesterday ive just started excommunication and i have a question about dr sorenson in expatriots did sorenson know about agent smith when stealth finds shelly he seems to describe what happened to him talking about his aneurysms and having a lot on his mind but then theres nothing else mentioned was he just putting forward some kind of conjecture or did he know that smith was controlling people and it could kill them question about the fold will you be doing a follow up to the fold with mike working with this new group also im doing your audiobooks and they are tremendous the use of multiple narrators in the ex series adds a whole new dimension the fold is one of the best books ive ever listened to im around something books right now and i plan to start after i finish the ex series thanks for doing an ama and keep on writing
books,not_removed,first off im a big fan once i finished exheroes i immediately order the rest in the series although exisle i had to wait a few months for and the fold were great reads where i actually wrote down some of my theories about what was going to happen next since i was too busy with school to sit down and binge read it also i just want to say your humor in your books has made me laugh to the point where i had to put the book down and struggle to convey the humor to a family member my question for the exheroes series is have you thought of turning it into a screenplay of sorts and who would you like to see play some of the main characters do you think it would translate better for tv or film my question for the fold possible spoiler in the end of the book there is a recruitment scene in any future installments will we see more recruiting or some sort of team up where they deal with impending doom
books,not_removed,i love love love your books and i discovered you via this sub so i am very glad you are here no questions just a thank you
books,not_removed,mr clines ive listened to the fold and the exheroes series thru audible one of my favorite moments is in when they are traversing the land in the other dimension at the end but the distance is warping further and closer i loved that imagery the beastgod flying above its size and its volume the crushing effect on the characters ears epic thanks for the entertainment im looking forward to whatever is next cheers
books,not_removed,i just finished last night and it was fantastic i had downloaded the sample on amazon awhile ago and forgot why i started reading it and bought it and tore through it my question is regarding amazon samplesdo you have any control over how much of the book is in the sample because it seemed for it was a lot which was great because the story pace is slower in the beginning and i was definitely hooked by the time the sample was up
books,not_removed,was the ad in tf designed by nt like the building in ive read both and loved them but this connection stayed uncertain
books,not_removed,have you read infinite jest
books,not_removed,hey peter i love the ex series when can we expect to see a new one
books,not_removed,i am an aspiring writer at and love the exheroes series i read the book and immediately was hooked i asked myself why i didnt think of superheroeszombiesamazing truly big fan and cant wait for the next one i need a question here so whos youre favorite author of all time
books,not_removed,listened to the fold first then in the last two weeks both gave me that sense of wonder rendezvous with rama gave me many years ago thank you very much for that you are a very talented writer will there be more stories in this universe whats also very enjoyable is the different group dynamics in the two stories it was bittersweet when the gang was breaking up hope to find more interesting groups in your stories
books,not_removed,what inspired you to start writing
books,not_removed,i listened to the audiobook for and the scene where they open the door was one of most tense nailbiting experiences i had had in a long time loved the book and looking forward to reading more of your stuff
books,not_removed,are you aware your username reads pc lines
books,not_removed,im about halfway through the audiobook of so ill avoid the ama as i dont want any spoilers however so far the storys been great im still trying to figure out the cockroaches
books,not_removed,have you ever thought of doing a collab with another popular author
books,not_removed,upclines just wanted to say that your middleman name drop in the book and the dr who tool closet a page later made my week i wasnt aware anyone else in the universe watched that show before its untimely axe
books,not_removed,who have you met while working the con scene that had you starstruck
books,not_removed,hello total stranger ive never met before honestly the audiobooks are fascinating because there all these odd little nuances that get brought out that either never occurred to me or just make me look at things in a new way plus im always interested to see how someone else does a take on a character so listening to them always becomes this kind of surreal experience for me in a good way
books,not_removed,good grief its ray porter not to derail but huge fan ive listened to the audio books of and the fold a good or times each keep up the great work
books,not_removed,listened to both and the fold that you narrated excellent work really enjoyed your energy you brought to the characters
books,not_removed,how do you you get in the audiobookmaking business hey you have a nice voice read this ama within an ama sorry if this is rude
books,not_removed,utherayporter and upclines oh my god i am seriously having a little freak out right now is by far my favorite audio book of all time i recommend it to everyone who asks for book suggestions im not by any means a huge reader or even a semi big reader but had a huge effect on getting me back into readingaudiobook listening after not having read a book in years i really loved it i listened to the fold a little while after and it had the same effect on me where i found myself looking forward to my minute work breaks so that i could get a little more in it even caused a fight between me and my boyfriend during a road trip because he wouldnt stop talking during it i just wanted to let you know i thoroughly enjoy both of your styles and this is me saying please please please collaborate together again and preferably super soon because i have a hour plane ride coming up in february thank you so much for what you do
books,not_removed,omg i loved your narration so much so after i listened to and the fold i went and bought three more books you narrated what you did was just so incredibly unintrusive just adds so much to the enjoyment of the stories without inserting anything that felt out of place the best kind of narrator your sublime skills and mr clines great storytelling are such a great natural pair please do more of his books
books,not_removed,weird as hell the book came out at the end of a three year starving writer phase where my girlfriend and i were living well below the poverty line so it was very surreal to have this book my fourth and the one with such low expectations just keep growing and growing and growing and the audiobook exploded and well it still doesnt seem real half the time to be honest
books,not_removed,id really like to its all about making space in my schedule and also making sure theres actually a good story to tell i wouldnt want it to be a situation where im just cranking something out to cash in on the popularity of the first two books
books,not_removed,i have one somewhere but its a really ugly thing on a legal pad just for my own reference i was about fifty pages in and i realized i had to keep all the rooms straight if i can find themmaybe ill scan them and put them up on twitter or facebook or something
books,not_removed,the cockroaches do what roaches dothey slip through tiny holes to infest other places in an earlier draft of i had to do massive cuts at one point the family refers to them as harbinger bugs they also ate them ifwhen i get to do another book with the koturoverse theyll be discussed in greater detail
books,not_removed,actually it turned out that robert downey jr was a fan of and he snatched it up last year for his production company team downey theres a deal in place with them and wb tv and i believe the goal is to shoot a pilot this spring i believe brian mcgreevy hemlock grove is attached as an ep soooooo thats cool
books,not_removed,it had always been the plan to throw them into the deep end of the multiverse at the end yeah like chekovs phaser rifle you cant talk about it for two hundred pages and never actually do anything with it it wasnt rushed at all i think i may have spent more time on that part than any other the pacing was different there yes but that was very intentional it just wouldntve been believable for them to survive there a long time
books,not_removed,i agree with the pacing thing
books,not_removed,i don t think theres any storyteller that hasnt been influenced somehow by the matrix one way or another but no the real inspirationsetup was just a basic mystery start with what i know is going on then work backwards to see how people could misinterpret the clues theyre seeing
books,not_removed,i also read them in that order and i think it makes more sense that way
books,not_removed,most of the ex books have been written as single standalone books so there hasnt been a ton of farahead planning i never planned on anything past the first one and really expatriots to excommunication has been the only time i wrote absolutely knowing i was going to get the next book so a lot of the time id just be planting lots of small subtle seeds that wouldnt stand out much and hoping id get a chance to do something with them someday and then i look clever when people go back and notice them
books,not_removed,thanks for reading them all crossover probably not too likely but then again who knows what theyll let me get away with
books,not_removed,i guess well all see when warner bros finishes casting it although ive been saying for ages that amara karan should be veek and stephen lang would be a great tim
books,not_removed,hah tough call at this point i think its fairly well known in a lot of lovecraft circles although not everyone knows why its there honestly this was the big problem when i first tried to sell the book and one of the reasons i thought it would flop its very hard to describe without giving things away and once theyre given away so many folks approach it like ehhhh wasnt a big surprise i wouldve figured that out the way i first pitched it to people at cons when i was handselling it was how would you describe lost to someone without giving anything away and theyd usually laugh and then id say this books about a regular guy who moves into an old apartment building and weird stuff happens
books,not_removed,uhdoesnt asking this question spoil the twist
books,not_removed,maybe you can just say its weird fiction without being as precise
books,not_removed,you realize by mentioning a twist not to mention lovecraft you are partially spoiling the twist
books,not_removed,i have notaside from about a billion nightmares when i was a kid i did see a ufo once when i was little though when i was in the car with my grandmother and brother seriously
books,not_removed,probably everest ive got generations of new england blood so the cold isnt as much of a deterrent and im not claustraphobic but i do think never going outside would gnaw at me after a week or so
books,not_removed,as far as tearing hair out or thats actually a huge question because theres the personal process differences but also just the necessary differences between storytelling formats even different types of screenplays have different requirements in how the writer tells the story for me screenwriting tends to go faster because its minimal description and mostly dialogue but its also tougher for me to keep the story very clean and sleek because all that sidestuff is what i enjoy if you go to my website i actually just did a post on the blog last week about format differences
books,not_removed,mmmmmaaaaaayyybbbbeeee
books,not_removed,not any really id watched the first season of sliders so i knew the show but it honestly didnt cross my mind until maybe the third draft or so and then i was more worried that id accidentally copied something so i went back over the whole thing
books,not_removed,nobody in particular i think a lot of writers snag bits from different people to use but the characters tend to be original for me anyway so i could point to different little character aspects but its not as if xela is actually my friend phoebe or something like that
books,not_removed,kind of the whole series has really been kind of a bookbybook thingits very popular but its never been a massive hit ive talked with my editor about a book six and i know what id like to do for a book seven if we get there and that would probably close it out in my mind
books,not_removed,im going to answer a lot of that with a big mmmmaaayyybbeeeee because its asking about a book nobodys read that im still poking at and plotting out as for film stuff answered that above short form rdj team downey wbtv hopefully a pilot this spring for mike i would like them to resurrect alan rickman at his die hard prime
books,not_removed,thank you
books,not_removed,not at all im not really a huge gamer used to bebut not in years so my thoughts tend to fall more in bookscreenplaycomic categories really though this was always just a big sprawling book to me thats the only way i ever saw it
books,not_removed,theres not really a connection there is that one character who shows up but he tends to show up in almost everything i write if you look at my ranty writing blog he actually shows up in the suffering map my oftenmadeanexampleof awful first novel id love to do crossover stuff dont get me wrong but i think id probably do it more in the subtle stephen king way like how almost all of his books tie back to the dark tower
books,not_removed,probably no no idea at all in that order its still a very earlystages thing and i need to talk about it with my agent and editor and figure out schedules and the like talked a bit more about it above
books,not_removed,i tend to wake up around check social media and email im on the left coast so everyone in new york is up hours before me and then ill get on the treadmill for an hour or so i actually have a separate office yeah when im straight writing i usually do at least words a day editing i try to do at least double that usually around pages a day if im on a roll ill stay up late last night i think i got to bed around im very lucky that my girlfriends a writer too so were often on the same weird schedule or at least understanding of it did you want more specifics than that
books,not_removed,ive always loved the idea of being a speedster like the flash but i think such a character wouldnt last long in that world not on foot anyway not at all a hint about book six
books,not_removed,i tried for a while i think everybody likes seeing the people who enjoyed their work and personally i dont even mind good honest criticism but some of the stupid andor tryingtobesnarkycool stuff really wears you down fast ive never had patience for anyone who complains about a book or movie because they either werent paying attention or they just want to look clever so short answer no d
books,not_removed,these are all spoilery questions about other books shhhhhhh
books,not_removed,as far as goesthats not really up to me i dont shop an adaptation of the book to hollywood a studio gets interested they buy the rights and then they hire someone to do an adaptation sometimes the writers involved sometimes not and theres such a huge range of tv and film these days its hard to say that part without knowingassuming a lot more as for it is a little spoilery were talking spoilers not all the other books but ill say this who were the recruiters dont answer spoilers shhhhhh
books,not_removed,right now im a big fan of rick morty and also star wars rebels im waaaayyyy behind on anime i think the last was a weird fascination with the first season of yugioh i was one of those kids who got in early with star blazers and battle of the planets i have an odd affection for the anime adaptation of the guyver books ive got a pile of gundam episodes to watch at some point as for an exheroes series that all comes down to hollywood they hear people talking they get interested things happen there was one writerdirector who was really interested at one point but he got caught up in other projects
books,not_removed,no thank you
books,not_removed,thank you so much
books,not_removed,i dont have any control i think its up to the publisher but dont quote me on that it may be the publisher but within certain amazon guidelines now im curious and want to go find out
books,not_removed,nope id say more but i dont want to spoil that book for folks
books,not_removed,i have not its been on my to read list for about a decade now did you like it
books,not_removed,thank you alas probably not until because of a bunch of scheduling stuff the publisher had to move my next book paradox bound back to september of so i think the absolute best case would be the next february ive started it already hinted about something in another response its just putting it through the process to get it in your hands
books,not_removed,theres sooooooo many seriously kind of a copout answer i know but there have been so many who have been fantastic in so many ways i mean very short list off the top of my head ray bradbury stephen king erb lloyd alexander bill mantlo ac doyle f paul wilson and those are just the ones i grew up with now theres also dan abnett seanan mcguire craig dilouie autumn christian cherie priest adam christopher chuck wendig kristi charish i love words
books,not_removed,fingers crossed i really want to its just a fittingthingsintheschedule problem more than anything else now
books,not_removed,this is going to sound like such a crap stock answer i know but its true i can never remember a point in my life when i didnt want to tell stories i remember making up my own stories with my star wars figures and gi joes when i was little when i found my moms massive old smithcorona in the back of the closet i think my fate was sealed i got my very first rejection letter when i was eleveni wrote a really horrible uncanny xmen script and sent it in to marvel comics complete with colored pencil cover jim shooter sent me back a very nice letter that spoke to me like a professional whod just missed the target rather than a kid whod sent him a bunch of scrawled nonsense there were many many more rejections after that one
books,not_removed,thank you
books,not_removed,actually it reads p clines which is my name
books,not_removed,dont look up above we talk about the cockroaches dont look at it marion
books,not_removed,ive had a few people bounce ideas off me for books shareduniverse stories stuff like that the truth is though im a horrible control freak when it comes to my stories nobody would want to work with me
books,not_removed,wrong place use the larger comment box up above there is a little save button under it
books,not_removed,had to say hi you deserve every bit of success and more your books are great get over here to england and have a pint
books,not_removed,thats interesting can you give an example of some nuances that hadnt occurred to you either good or bad
books,not_removed,ahhh thank you for answering this ive spent many a night laying around wondering about a deeper significance to them looking forward to learning more also just thank you for writing your books are so unique and fresh but the characters feel like familiar friends its like riding a roller coaster and getting a hug at the same time bravo encore
books,not_removed,damn thats so cool
books,not_removed,oh nice
books,not_removed,holy shit im extremely excited for this
books,not_removed,yeah i figured but you dont ask you dont get
books,not_removed,thats exactly how i imagined tim when i was reading haha
books,not_removed,ha i picured stephen lang the whole time
books,not_removed,thats literally how i pitched this story to my friend she likes mysteries so its right up her alley
books,not_removed,the title says semispoilery so i figured it was safe
books,not_removed,in rfantasy and rbooks you get people looking for recommendations every once and a while for modern lovecraft type novels and i want to recommend but dont feel i can
books,not_removed,yes im very sorry i feel bad but was the book of the month and the topic says semispoilery
books,not_removed,tell the story man you cannot leave us hanging
books,not_removed,note to self continue preordering everything p clines writes
books,not_removed,seven thats a dozen or so too soon by my estimation
books,not_removed,alan rickman ugh right in my feels
books,not_removed,maybe its just that a good story translates regardless ive actually started getting into game dev again so that i can put my mental image of the kavach building on screen green roaches and all
books,not_removed,awesome thanks for the reply
books,not_removed,wow thanks for answering i would think a speedster would be more at risk from dwindling supplies than getting bitten by a zombie as long as you dont let yourself get cornered you would be fine until your heightened metabolism eats through the compounds sixmonth food supply in a week then the zombies might be the least of your problems keep up the good work and dont you dare get exed before you finish the series
books,not_removed,if you could have any input on whos who who would you prefer so when you were creatingwriting the characters was there someone you had in mind my bad thanks for answering my questions im looking forward to any further installments of yours
books,not_removed,i dont have any control i think its up to the publisher but dont quote me on that it may be the publisher but within certain amazon guidelines now im curious and want to go find out upclines
books,not_removed,thanks ill figure it out d
books,not_removed,awesome thanks for responding you are a great writer i enjoy your work immensely
books,not_removed,haha yeah i initially removed the comment but then saw the thread is marked for spoilers sogo for it
books,not_removed,given the title says semispoilery i dont think your question was inappropriate
books,not_removed,its not that exciting we were driving along an old road back in maine in my brother and i were in the back seat watching a plane up in the sky and then we noticed this big glowing ball a little bit behind it and we asked nana about it she looked up saw the glowing ball stopped the car and said i have no idea thats one of the bits i remember mostjust how confused she sounded we watched the plane and the ball until they went out of sight and then we went to the post office or grocery store or wherever we were going because hey it was the ufos ehhhh
books,not_removed,when i wrote i didnt have a single actor or actress in mind about two months after turning it in to the publisher though i saw the doctor who episode the god complex and it immediately hit me than amara karan would be a fantastic veek since then ive come to think stephen lang would make a great tim past that i just really havent put much thought into it i have them all in my head and thats how i see them
books,not_removed,do not post shallow content im sorry but your post currently counts as shallow content do you have something else to say about the book that you could edit into the text preferably your own thoughts about the book or at the least a description of the book without spoilers because this has been a very popular book in this sub you really need to write a pretty extensive post for it to stand alternatively you can use search or visit rreadyplayerone let me know if you edit it i can reinstate your post

books,not_removed,i must track her down just read extracts around the place
books,not_removed,im not familiar with that author what other books has he written
books,not_removed,i used to think that the same person had written lord of the flies and princess bride but its actually william golding and william goldman respectively
books,not_removed,uncle toms cabin was written by harriet beecher stowe
books,not_removed,little females little not females
books,not_removed,actually i was more interstellar in louis may alcott career he seems like an interesting character
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules promotional posts of any type are not allowed please see our rules wiki and faq for a list of alternative subreddits
books,not_removed,this explains why shes had such a long and successful career since he died
books,not_removed,i have also found a new respect for the driver of john lennons success yoko thats where creativity comes from fuck me
books,not_removed,cobain was a junky but he wrote all their stuff this book is trash as to being a father or managing hole he probably did little to none of that
books,not_removed,seems pretty easy to make such claims when the other person is dead
books,not_removed,lets see trust a book written by a person who knew none of the people involved or trust literally every other source available
books,not_removed,they would play stuff for each other he would give her suggestions on hole songs and vice versa but he in no way needed her help he wrote all his own songs and lyrics courtney has said numerous times that she envied his talent and that he was a genius
books,not_removed,according to brites httpwwwpoppyzbritecombiohtml around that same time rock diva courtney love contacted me and asked me to write her biography yes although she made clear from the beginning that she would not officially authorize the book it was courtneys idea shed read and liked lost souls and she wanted a version of her story written to counter all the negative biographies that were supposedly being written only one of these the hatchet job queen of noise has yet seen publication an editor at the house that published it reportedly said of my manuscript its responsible journalism and thats not what were looking for she would give me access to journals letters photographs and other material i could never have obtained without her in return she would have control over what did and didnt go in the book i dont consider the biography part of my real body of work but its a fairly juicy and readable piece of pop culture flotsam that financed a lot of travel short story writing and animal care so it sounds a bit selfserving at the same time obviously theres no denying that kurt was a mess a genius mess but still a mess read his journals and youll see that for yourself
books,not_removed,courtney love managed nirvana so fuck danny goldberg right you had no idea because its not true
books,not_removed,wow blast from the past was mostly garbage in the late not any more true today of course she was involved in the creative process thats sort of how musicians work youre a musician im a musician im in a band my roommate is a musician im dating a musician when my band is recording my roommate and my girlfriend are dropping by and helping
books,not_removed,the best part of this for me is that billy martin formerly known as poppy z brite has since come out as a trans man there has been a lot of theorizing in the trans community over the last few years that kurt cobain might have been trans as in might have wanted to come out as trans transition but never got a chance to and that this was a major factor in his suicide so in a sense when this book was written it was a closetedunarticulated trans person talking shit on another closetedunarticulated trans person nice
books,not_removed,thats why she has written so many great songs since huh
books,not_removed,um you could make a really serious argument that that happened truth i have more hole on my itunes than nirvana
books,not_removed,a genius mess you think so i remember reading some of his journals in high school and being disappointed by the lack of insight or original thought he had like he was a talented musician but im not sure how objectively intelligent he was above average for sure but i wouldt say a genius elliott smith on the other hand
books,not_removed,fuck i forgot about all of these songs
books,not_removed,did you read the published book or just excerpts because i found the journals stunning and yes genius this
books,not_removed,i read from the scanned pages of the actual journal but i didnt read all of it just the first pages so its entirely possible i missed the good parts
books,not_removed,i definitely recommend it
books,not_removed,i bought youth in revolt based on the cover i was browsing the racks at a used bookstore late one night and i just thought it looked funny and boy was it ever i spent the next week or so laughing out loud and blowing my drinks through my nose
books,not_removed,hey thanks for bringing this up for a while his wikipedia page was woefully out of date and when i went to go see if it was still out of date i found out a book got released last year a bit upset though it is not on nook i originally read the first book when i was a teen as it was the thickest book in the young adult section at the library and i thought the cover was interesting i think my favorite book in the series was probably the first one i thought some of the later books about his son and his nephew were a bit over the top i mean i know that the twisps are suppose to be the center characters of the story but it seems like everyone just sleeps with the most attractive person that is around them constantly even though all they have to offer is snarky comments i also have some people in my family who did the circus gig for a while so those parts of the books i always really enjoyed
books,not_removed,i read youth in revolt around the time that the movie came out because i love reading books before i watch the movie adaptation i started feeling like i wanted it to just end by the time i was in the last third or so but then once i was done i was really happy i read it and enjoyed it overall i never did read any of the rest in the series though maybe one day
books,not_removed,o youth in revolt is a fave of mine back before it was published i was working at a bookstore and we got an arc i couldnt put it down and my boss told me to just keep it as we were always overrun with review copies i still have it and i still love it ive read all of the books in the series and none even come close to youth in revolt theres a certain magic it has
books,not_removed,its not a collection of stories set in the got universe its a collection of short stories by various authors featuring one story by george set in the got universe
books,not_removed,twow after confirmed
books,not_removed,and probably not twow
books,not_removed,hope we will get more hedge knight stories
books,not_removed,like anybody gives a fuck now
books,not_removed,ugh george can you finish twow already im still going to read this when it gets released but still
books,not_removed,guys there are no pages im sorry
books,not_removed,one does not simply finish the winds of winter
books,not_removed,i want to complain about twow but at this point say it comes out this year then what another year wait while we shame each other for worrying about an old mans health solely because we want something from them i dont see the real life soiaf story ending happily at this point
books,not_removed,shewolves of winterfel is overdue
books,not_removed,is he writing them all or will it be an anthology of other writers
books,not_removed,is there any other grr books outside the song of ice and fire series worth reading
books,not_removed,where the fuck is the winds of winter can he get that out first pretty please
books,not_removed,whats with the title pretty weak george
books,not_removed,yep wildly misleading headline this is most likely to be another chunk from the complete history of the targaryen dynasty that he wrote up awhile back sons of the dragon so not having anything to do with either the events of the main series or the dunk and egg prequels
books,not_removed,so pretty much the exact same thing as dangerous women
books,not_removed,i hope sm stirlings in it i enjoyed his emberverse short story collection
books,not_removed,after but when
books,not_removed,there are supposed to be at least half a dozen more according to martin but whether he ever gets around to writing them is the question
books,not_removed,dunk and egg are my favorite
books,not_removed,if he spent half the time he spends writing pseudopolitical blogposts and hobnobbing around places talking about how difficult writing is actually writing hed have finished the series ages ago but you know writing is hard which is why hes constantly reminding everyone how hard it is on his umpteenth book tour and also why most writers eclipse his yearly output in about a week maybe two
books,not_removed,the dunk and egg series a spin off prequel is really good if you like the universe
books,not_removed,gotta milk that cash cow till its dry
books,not_removed,and rogues this is generally how he releases his short stories
books,not_removed,never the answer is never
books,not_removed,dont forget though grrm is not your bitch
books,not_removed,you mean hes living his life and enjoying it how dare he obviously the world revolves around you
books,not_removed,no but he is a bit of a conceited old fart talking about how people who didnt have enough money to attend cons in the good old days shouldnt attend cons now and somesuch because they dont get con life i published half a million word worth of fiction last year he just needs to put some effort into it and finish his series he keeps talking about it but like stephen king pointed out on stage with him others are working rather than talking
books,not_removed,nobut much like a certain mother of dragons grrms line life belongs not to him but to his people write the fucking book george
books,not_removed,damn stephen king said that to him when
books,not_removed,june of last year grrm did an interview with king and one of the questions was how do you write so fast after which he pointed out that king will write one book or several in the time it takes to write a chapter kings reply was that he treats it like a job and writes six pages a day grrms reply was along the lines of but dont you do other stuff like check your mail get stuck kings reply was basically its a job
books,not_removed,awesome
books,not_removed,please post recommendation requests including asking if you should read a certain book in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread seeing as this book is also a very popular topic of discussion in this sub i suggest you use the search function
books,not_removed,the two arent really related maybe it inspired berserk because theyre both fantasy i dont know anyway have you read the last volumes theyre pretty dull
books,not_removed,i havent read any of it yet
books,not_removed,its been a few years since i read itthat being said i thought the premise of the book was super neat a series of souls traveling throughout the ages the black plague killing off of europe how red heads became extremely rare it was interesting and led me to read some of ksr s other books specifically the mars trilogy
books,not_removed,i think what you are describing is a frame talenarrative the first one i can think of is the great gatsby nick caraway is the narrator and you get a little info on his life but the focus is on his own observations of gatsby he fills in gaps of knowledge by relating the impressionsknowledge of other peripheral characters and you can question whether he or they are reliable as sources of information or witnesses to the events in the life of gatsby but caraway himself does interact with gatsby perhaps more than your scenario posits i was reading up on this technique and i saw mention that it was used in heart of darkness by joseph conrad but its been years since i read that and i dont remember much basically according to a site i looked at an anonymous narrator hears and relates the story of marlow and the events in the congo and during the course of this the narrators own viewpoints begin to change going to reread it to see how it was used the most recent example ive read is the guernsey literary and potato peel pie by mary anne shaffer and annie barrows it is an epistolary novel and begins as a general series of letters about how the island of guernsey fared under nazi occupation but over the course of the letters you realize you are getting the story of a particular character and her impact on the community with both positive and negative povs depending on who writes a particular letter i quite enjoy this type of narrative structure but it can be difficult to pull off well epistolary novels with multiple contributors can be fun if the author is gifted at capturing different voices with the single narrator the author has to create a scenario for how the narrator has knowledge can that knowledge can be trusted by the reader is the narrator purely a bystander receiving and retelling or does it influence or get involved in the events in some way a fun example of the author handling these questions is the murder of roger ackroyd by agatha christie where the narrator is relating the events of a crime and how hercule poirot solves it the narrator filters information about people and events so the reader isnt privy to all the possible clues and at the time it was a big deal to have a detective story told like that
books,not_removed,wuthering heights is narrated by several people who are not really important to the story nelly a servant and a lodger who arrives one day
books,not_removed,the closest to this i can think of is the rest of us just live here by patrick ness its about a group of high school kids who have no special powers and just want to graduate but every now and again their mundane problems brush up against the vampires zombies aliens or apocalyptic scenarios that the nominal protagonists are dealing with so yes thats basically done from the pov of a disinterested party
books,not_removed,two different attempts at answer moby dick rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead
books,not_removed,i imagine itd be similar to a found footage movie think about it everything that happens to the people making the documentary is only dramatic because of stuff thats mostly irrelevant to their actions the documentary makers just discover some thing is happening and try to record it
books,not_removed,ive given this question thought before and the problem is twofold the character you follow is automatically the protagonist this would only work if you had already written the story that youre essentially trying to ignore and then its like fan fiction in fact i think the twilight lady tried to do this maybe with the male leads perspective instead or mayne she did write it i dont know it wouldnt be a very good book
books,not_removed,autobiography of a flea nsfw
books,not_removed,the roads to freedom by sartre have many shifting viewpoints
books,not_removed,its not a complete novel but theres a pretty fantastic chapter in thomas pynchons v that sort of fits the bill it tells the story of the assassination of a spy in egypt in the late but the story is pieced together from the viewpoints of different bystanders who only briefly cross paths with the involved parties so we manage to piece together the whole story but each sections narrator ends up finding out very little and basically remains completely uninvolved it might be close to what youre looking for if youre interested the chapter is entitled in which stencil a quickchange artist does eight impersonations and it stands on its own pretty well separate from the rest of the book
books,not_removed,httptvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpmainfirstpersonperipheralnarratorfrommaintheishmael outside of that many other bookslike lotr a song of fire and ice count of monte cristo use elements of this with scenes or even entire chapters of characters not interacting with the hero of the story
books,not_removed,rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead i think is that kind of thing you are looking for
books,not_removed,the sherlock holmes stories are all told by his friend watson while watson is not a disinterested side character he is most definitely not the hero of the stories he is just the one watching sherlock holmes in action and interpreting holmess analyses and thought processes for us sometimes he helps sometimes he just looks on and follows along with no idea whats going on sometimes he wasnt even involved and is writing down what he was told
books,not_removed,id say yes this sort of narrative framing has been done several times across many types of different stories its used quite heavily in the short story genre where a narrator will recount the stories its less about your character not being the protagonist your main character is inherently the protagonist but more about the way we the reader perceive what you may consider the bigger characters because we dont see things from their point of view or even an objective thirdparty point of view the important thing is that the point of view of your character who narrates the story suddenly becomes what matters to the reader as it is their experience however dull or insignificant it may be that then suddenly frames the story instead of a heroic journey for example
books,not_removed,a series of unfortunate events does this with lemony snicket narrating he plays a small part in the events but it basically ticks your boxes
books,not_removed,not entirely found footage is still pov of the people directly involved in the storyline what im suggesting is a completely impartial third party pov
books,not_removed,protagonist to us perhaps but not a protagonist to the story we hear about from their pov if that makes sense im lost how its like fan fic and the twilight lady had simply written the entire story from the vamps point of view and hes not a bystander she would have published it but then half of it got leaked online and she decided to not publish it
books,not_removed,i may be wrong as i never was interested in reading that series but dont those stories follow the lives of the beadulaire i know i most definitely spelt that wrong children
books,not_removed,their point is that whatever youre currently thinking of as the main storyline would end up just being a mostly obscured subplot what youre probably looking for is something where the main storyline is preset in other literature a play called the puffs does this really well with the harry potter storyline
books,not_removed,yep they do but narratedtold by someone unrelated which is how i interpreted what you were asking
books,not_removed,uhhhh i guess your answer technically does fit i dont really know how those stories are written but i think i was imaging the adventure not being the centre of the attention of the book
books,not_removed,ive read it and enjoyed it its quite dark and very grim its a short book so it wont take you long to get through it also the last of us took a lot of inspiration from it
books,not_removed,a kinde is quite a ways away from a primer also there is a strong push towards personal involvement by the voice actors as opposed to mass produced ripoffs
books,not_removed,kids these days never seen a space odyssey then
books,not_removed,nah they should include a kindle with every copy of the book sold trust me im an economist
books,not_removed,last time i watched was probably in remind me what the connection is i imagine they had something similar i just thing the diamond age description of a thin booklike device that essentially held the entire collection of all human knowledge in a format accessible to children was pretty on point for what a kindle or tablet i suppose is
books,not_removed,

books,not_removed,boys life is such a good book ive never met anyone else who had read it i picked it up randomly at a used book store when i was about and loved it so much oh man i want to read that again now thanks for this thread
books,not_removed,so basically the entire thread is just these are my three favorite books and its three fantasy books theres not even a discussion or point to this thread
books,not_removed,i read some or all of that series in my teens in the did love it immensely and at that time i think i preferred weird other world spec fic to this world is weird spec fic but in days since ive come to generally prefer this weird world variety though i still give the other world and space stuff a try every now again and have no beef against it
books,not_removed,sorry my simple thought about books i love failed to edify you hope you somehow still manage to have a great day
books,not_removed,i hope you learned your lesson the first rule is check with uprollyjean before posting anything to ensure it meets hisher approval
books,not_removed,first rule on the sub discussion is the goal there was no prompt for discussion or even a topic that could be broadly discussed outside of these are my three favorite books
books,not_removed,the pecksniffian air of that users reddit comment history is educational yes but perhaps not in the manner heshe intended
books,not_removed,im sure that your judgmental efforts toward conversational quality control on reddit are appreciated at least as much as the same efforts would be in real life someone somewhere thanks you for policing the sanctity of book talk im sure of it
books,not_removed,i come off as a dick but theres just so many low effort posts at the every least this thread could have asked readers what they thought of the authors the books what their three favorite books are
books,not_removed,well at least we got to discuss how important you think it is to speak up when a stranger fails to entertain you appropriately i wish you well and truly hope you have an otherwise happy life one that is not at all reflective of this interchange or any of your other several negative posts about other peoples posts
books,not_removed,considering your performance at karaoke in kansas city the other weekend how do you dare show your face in the company of civilized men
books,not_removed,in a mirror universe what would the evil goateed version of peadar be writing
books,not_removed,what inspired you to write this story were you a boarding school kid ever abducted by fairies or have you ever been a murderous supernatural creature
books,not_removed,hi peadar can you tell me about irish mythology how it affected your writing

books,not_removed,thanks for the ama do you have a writing routine when youre in the process of writing a book do you write at home in a study go to a coffee shop eat the same thing word goals whatever youd like to share about your work day would be very interesting
books,not_removed,you call yourself civilized you who wears the leaf of the maple without shame
books,not_removed,nice nonscary books about flowers and unicorns with gently blunted horns
books,not_removed,all of the above well i was a boarding school kid i travelled to school from the same bus station nessa takes and followed most of the same route to my school also obsessed for a time in my youth with the book of conquests as illustrated by the amazing jim fitzpatrick
books,not_removed,irish mythology is vast it contains everything from bawdy humour to appalling tragedy and yes monsters a very cool one covered in eyeballs lived in the river near the town where i grew up the nearby river was named the swilly which comes from the irish word for eyes sadly a saint killed that monster some time in the dark ages
books,not_removed,i absolutely adored the hobbit my father had the beautiful edition illustrated by tolkien himself liked biggles too and enid blyton but soon graduated to fantasy and the science fiction of harry harrison a great writer
books,not_removed,lord of the rings silver metal lover by tanith lee i claudius by robert graves the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy the short story collection story of your life and others very fond of the dm cornish ya monster blood tattoo books
books,not_removed,great question i have a few ideas on the backburner that i just cant get to work properly id like to write a good oldfashioned epic fantasy but one that would fool the readers into thinking it was fresh and original
books,not_removed,hi aly there is at least one brewery operating or taaft wouldnt have any beer to drink the most beautiful place in ireland is answered in the book cant remember what page its on i would eat somebody who is good at getting away with murder in the hopes that their skill will allow to commit many more crimes as for luxcon i dont know the answer to that yet i have already had two double bookings this year so that ill miss friday night at titancon and saturday at octocon
books,not_removed,on a proper writing day ie when im not editing etc i do about words
books,not_removed,i have a routine but not a very exciting one after breakfast i sit for two hours at home and try to grind out words then i go for a walk in the countryside to figure out what comes next i have lunch after that its another two hours and another words another walk and and thats it i wish i had something cool to relate maybe i should make something up
books,not_removed,with pride sir with pride and because of that insult i shall never eat lucky charms again
books,not_removed,why would flowers have horns blunted or otherwise
books,not_removed,these saints always spoiling everyones fun
books,not_removed,i am kind of sad that i never read enid blyton as a child she just is not a thing in the us and they sound like something i would have really enjoyed
books,not_removed,were you of the swallows and amazons generation or was that before your time
books,not_removed,as for luxcon i dont know the answer to that yet oh no it wouldnt be the same without you youre our lucky authorcharm or something
books,not_removed,i knew you were after them i knew it
books,not_removed,you will have to pose that question to the first goateewearing villain you encounter i am the good peadar
books,not_removed,oh yes all that praying and monsterslaying a very funny out of print book deals with this sort of thing the unfortunate fursey by mervyn wall medieval madness
books,not_removed,they were amazing at that age apparently or so the story goes she was not very nice to her own kids
books,not_removed,i grew up with the author we baked gingerbread men together that was in the days before they were called gingerbread people we watched the first crossing of the english channel by aerocopter
books,not_removed,the reason i ask is that the formative ya and mg stuff on your side of the atlantic is often so different from the stuff on this side and since ransome was roughly contemporaneous with we johns i was curious about how it all came together
books,not_removed,it might happen yet id like to go if i can afford it especially to see the city centre i just need to be careful not to overcommit too early
books,not_removed,you look very good for a yearold
books,not_removed,fair enough a lot of the formative stuff i read was indeed written long before my time i read a lot of enid blyton books for example these days teens have a huge selection of more recent stuff they can turn to and it tends to be in my opinion much easier to get into
books,not_removed,id love to show you around are you going to come to reddit more often now have a look over at rfantasy its a great community with lots of other authors posting

books,not_removed,thank you
books,not_removed,thank you for help i will edit my post
books,not_removed,mass production of printed books maybe flat out production stoppage of paper books never the comeback of vinyl is proof enough that certain mediums will never die theyll just cease to glow as bright once and a while and then come back shiny as fuck
books,not_removed,never happen some books are not just info dumps they become keepsakes have signed first editions by king gaiman etc that i read and proudly display on the bookshelf
books,not_removed,i think there are enough people who love printed books that they wont stop being made definitely less but not completely
books,not_removed,there isnt enough free ebooks access to paper books is better than ebooks and tablets
books,not_removed,ive wondered the same thing i actually listen to audio books alot at work and read on my kindle but my husband only reads paper books hed be very upset if paper books were no longer printed
books,not_removed,i doubt itll happen in my lifetime ebooks may someday be cheap enough and convenient enough for everyday reading but some people will still pay a premium for a nice hardcover paper has other benefits too like the archival thing you mention a well maintained book can last for a century or more
books,not_removed,nah just like vinyl is still being made even though its all about spotify or itunes or whatever i doubt print books will ever go out of style i myself love owning things and i still buy cds and i probably would buy vinyl if i had been born earlier and i would never stop buying print books i firmly believe as long as theres a market for these things theyll still be made
books,not_removed,i dont think so not any time soon anyway
books,not_removed,only when its brought up on rbooks then i think nah
books,not_removed,there will always be some throwback who makes actual paper books but as far as actual publishers go yes paper books will become an oddity printed books are already in decline since so many people just buy digital now i expect major publishers will likely allow people to custom order books but of their publishing will be digital within the next years frankly i think publishers should try to force people towards digital books anyways global warming is an actual thing and the more trees left alive the better since it is proven fact that trees absorb many global warming causing gasses and turn them to nice clean oxygen
books,not_removed,this i could see in a few hundred years that mass production wouldnt really be viable due to either lack of need lack of trees etc etc but there will always be that subset of culture who either will have it due to interest or just as a pure hey look at what i can afford kind of thing no matter how advanced we as a species become
books,not_removed,i can borrow ebooks from my local library and i doubt i am the only one with a library that does that
books,not_removed,the device you read it on still costs money
books,not_removed,ops question was if i ever wondered i answered in the affirmative but only when its brought up on books and when i wonder if books will ever stop being printed i think nah if you can point to my incivility ill gladly apologize for it was i succinct sure was i incivil nah there is no derision for the question there is derision for the question being asked multiple times
books,not_removed,could be but at that point i also dont think wed have need of it by now most kids are learning to use tablets before the age of assuming mankind continues down this path we wont have the physical desire to read from printed novels coming from someone who loves print novels fyi
books,not_removed,you mean the cell phone which almost everyone already has yeah good to know i thought there were free lol

books,not_removed,i am guessing you are a young or at least a new reader you are doing exactly the thing you are supposed to do to remedy your problem you are going online to see what you missed as you keep reading you will get better at catching these things even if you will still miss a lot you can go back and reread the books keeping an eye out for the things you are supposed to notice you can also write book reports about the books you are reading it sounds boring and silly but it really helps frame your mind while reading ps you can also come check out my sub rreadalong where i try to do that same thing you talk about dive into a deeper meaning if there is one and draw parallels
books,not_removed,i dont usually find some hidden meaning in books ive read sometimes i miss the themes id say yes if you want to find those meanings read the book the other commenter said to read but also appreciate what you get for you revel in the accomplishment of completing a journey sit down with the book and say how does this change me it may say something profound or it may simply be another book you read pick it up in a few years harry potter has a different meaning to me than it did when i was in elementary school thats the beauty of a book imo
books,not_removed,this subject has been very popular in the past please use reddit search andor check the rbookswikifaq
books,not_removed,correct im and never really read other than what was assigned in school after college i stopped entirely until roughly a year ago since then ive been reading at a pretty decent pace atleast compared to my previous pace which was zero lol thank you tho i will follow the sub for sure i think it will help having people to discuss with and i was thinking that maybe i should stop and review every few chapters out loud which would be somewhat similar to the book report
books,not_removed,thank you i will definitly pick it up
books,not_removed,thanks for the reply it helps me knowing im not entirely alone
books,not_removed,ok thank you sorry for repost
books,not_removed,i should stop and review every few chapters out loud or at the end of each partvolume doesnt have to be super smart just like wow jack is a total jerk but i dont think he killed steve or fred makes me think of elie from book xyz but she was all like we must run away and he is like if we dont stand and fight now we will always be running and i think fred is right i am slowly working through the science fiction masterworks but i got room in my schedule so if you want to read a book together just let me know before long youll be offering super insightful commentary d

books,not_removed,depending on what you like about it you may struggle to find something with the same feel as neverwhere jim butcher and the like are not thematically similar but if its urban fantasy you are after and enjoyed the setting of neverwhere try rivers of london by ben aaronovitch or even the felix castor books from mike carey if its more the style you enjoyed then read more of the authors work theyre all pretty good but stardust might be a good next step for the adventure element you may just have to join us in the club waiting for him to finish the seven sisters
books,not_removed,off topic question how do you pronounce the authors last name guyman or gayman
books,not_removed,neil gaiman and terry pratchett quickly became my two favorite authors a few years back amazing work
books,not_removed,please post recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or the weekly thread
books,not_removed,ooh awesome thank you ill check that out hes such a badass character
books,not_removed,the latter

books,not_removed,i think the most straightforward thing would be to ask him marilyn at the following site says she passes on fan inquiries to him as a favoryou can get her email address through the webmaster link toward the bottom of the page httpwwwillyriacomtobhphtml
books,not_removed,bit late here but on this website it says he retired from writing to raise his two sons near the end of the interview
books,not_removed,i never saw gilmore girls but judging by the list i think id like rory though she doesnt seem like the sort of girl whos read multiple books about the history of punk rock
books,not_removed,ive read of them others i started but didnt finish some i have zero interest in ever reading some i would like to read
books,not_removed,yes i know this list has been posted before but its been a rather long time plus with our upcoming reunion with the gilmore girls im sure people other than me would love to start the challenge
books,not_removed,dont let that school uniform fool you
books,not_removed,im glad you reposted this im going to print it out and cross off as i go thanks
books,not_removed,no problem im going to do the same
books,not_removed,theyre closer than a lot of book to movie pairs but i like the pacing of the book a lot better id say read the book first
books,not_removed,they are fairly similar in story but quite different in the movie mark watney is an astronaut that gets put in a bad situation but with help from nasa manages tell some jokes and to get home safely in the book mark watney has everything go wrong for him nearly everything he tries ends up failing for one reason or another yet you get to see him break down the problems and solve them stepbystep more than that you realize that things arent failing because mark is incompetent but because hes up against the impossible you get to feel the frustration and see mark watney decide to stay alive by overcoming overwhelming odds it isnt a one really bad thing happened and now i have to solve it story like the movie also how can mark be a space pirate if hes in communication with nasa they told him to go there and commandeer the mav he has permission in the movie its like aquaman talking to whales makes no sense
books,not_removed,in the movie you miss out on the oh f moment in the book when mark is halfway to the destination cant say much more without spoiling it but its one of the best parts of the book
books,not_removed,they did remove a scene in the movie which technically ruined a joke that they kept in
books,not_removed,i read the book before the movie came out the movie had in my opinion only of the book but in this it followed the book quite faithfully like someone already said the movie is more like a montage i think this is understandable since they had only hours to tell the story
books,not_removed,both good the book is funnier i think the movie ramps up the drama a bit more i read the book before watching the movie but you could do either i actually liked the last bit of the movie which was absent from the book
books,not_removed,the movie cut out all the insanely frustrating mental gymnastics he had to go through to complete each tedious task weir did a great job of portraying how dismal his situation was i liked both but the movie was definitely made to be appealing to the masses as blockbuster movies tend to be the book really made you think about being stuck on mars and how appealing a nice death by morphine would bebut for the incessant will to live
books,not_removed,they are pretty close probably as close as book and movie can be the movie has to cut out a lot of catastrophes for time reasons so the book is much more of a nailbiter than the film even is
books,not_removed,i freakin loved that book
books,not_removed,id say watch the movie first if you really like it theres a good chance its excellent then read the book the movie is a very good adaptation it basically compresses the book but you miss out on some of the best complications and fixes as well as some of the humour definitely worth looking into both if this type of sci fi is something youre in to
books,not_removed,this is definitely a book first type of situation i saw the movie first then read the book reading the book was not nearly as exciting as i think it would have been having not seen it they were both really great despite this though
books,not_removed,the movie had a slightly better ending imo but the book is better overall naturally they had to leave a lot of stuff out of the movie and the themes and scientific accuracy were watered down a bit the movie stayed true to the overall idea though and more or less did the book justice
books,not_removed,i watched the movie but did not read the book i was driving the other day though and listened to overdues podcast on the martian the book they do talk about similaritiesdifferences between the book and movie they also do their normal thing and talk about the themes and proscons of the story and writing etc if youre interested and have time to kill
books,not_removed,very close the main things missed are heavily time consuming projects for relatively minor fixes that wouldve forced a second movie and most of the mathsscience in his head that cant be represented in the movie
books,not_removed,echoing most comments here they are fairly close but there are some pacing differences both are excellent in their own right plus the movie gave me yet another example of flight controllers thinking that their issues are the fault of the instrumentation engineers when really the vehicle is disintegrating
books,not_removed,book ending is amazing im in the habit of book before movie now just because of this book
books,not_removed,its a freaking amazing book its one of the best adaptations of a book to movie there is right now there are of course parts not in the movie because of time constraints but they did an excellent job of capturing the characters essence i would however recommend listening to the audio version of the book because the narrator is really fantastic
books,not_removed,the book and the movie are made for very different audiences i watched the movie after the book and i was obviously disappointed that movie leaves out so much but then the book took me hrs to finish the movie is much shorter
books,not_removed,if you want to actually enjoy the movie watch it first the book is so much more detailed with the movie missing out of a lot of stuff some which i think made the movie seem bad for me i preferred the pacing of the book too
books,not_removed,they are pretty close i saw only one instance of major plot difference however the movie is very condensed a lot of the trials and tribulations the main character encounters are not shown and the lack of explanations sometimes makes some events in the movie look like deus ex machina
books,not_removed,very close and i liked them both for different reasons the book had a lot more of his internal dialogue discussing his logic and reasoningthe movie provided a better visual of the hab that he lived in nothing like what i had visualized
books,not_removed,basically the same the book reads like an adaptation of a film script of course the movie makes changes for pacing dear lord it would have been a bad bad bad movie if it followed page by page and included every last setback
books,not_removed,i agree with the pacing being different the movie somehow didnt portray the length of time the same way that the book did though that may be in part due to how it had to be organized for a movie adaption so id suggest reading the book first even if just for context of time spent on mars but the movie is equally fun and thrilling and i found some parts of the movie even better than what i could imagine by just reading the book
books,not_removed,i would actually suggest the movie first that way you can read the book in matt damons voice it makes things extra entertaining
books,not_removed,agreed what the movie lacks it time as such you dont see as much struggle trial and error loved the both
books,not_removed,definitely my heart was pounding through the last portion of the book not so much the movie
books,not_removed,there were two of them
books,not_removed,what was it be sure to mark it as a spoiler as needed
books,not_removed,im not kidding i think ive read it times now was going through a rough patch and rereading that book every night kept me anchored
books,not_removed,shit im already watching this oh well
books,not_removed,thank you for the link
books,not_removed,came here to say this the book fits in a few more storylines that ratchet up tension in different ways the movie changes a few things that help cut down on time but i think both do a good job getting the story across you may or may not disagree with their decisions but i think the movie is worth watching because damons performance is excellent and the adaptation is very enjoyable
books,not_removed,the movie just fades to black honestly a montage would probably have fit better
books,not_removed,the space pirate joke didnt work because they cut out the incident that made it technically correct
books,not_removed,i mean i enjoyed both despite seeing it first but i was a little sad i didnt read the book first because i love when a book has a lot of momentum and this was a great opportunity for that the movie is awesome though you wont be disappointed
books,not_removed,literally just a road
books,not_removed,the title is a little hard to read in that color on the front but otherwise it has a nice simplicity to it i like it
books,not_removed,my favorite penguin book cover is the book of disquiet by fernando pessoa
books,not_removed,im going to have to disagree with your cover the road is way to dark for that light of a road its not about the light and the wrong landscape also thats a really plain nondescript font says nothing about anything sorry not trying to be a dick but designing covers is part of what i do and those are the things i would immediately bring up if someone put that cover in front of me
books,not_removed,looks awfully idyllic for a book that aint idyllic at all
books,not_removed,looks awesome
books,not_removed,the clock without hands cover is lovely are they not really released in the us my favourites are the steinbeck book covers im trying to find as many as i can in this style because theyre so nice
books,not_removed,that was my thought as well too stereotypical of a picture for a book with so much depth
books,not_removed,yeah i agree with that i thought about using another style modern classics use where the title and author are at the top on a solid white background and the photograph is underneath
books,not_removed,i have that incredible cover to an incredible book
books,not_removed,from the response i do think youre right the picture could do with being darker andor greyscale and a bit more appropriate but some of your other points go against the purpose of the cover i made it following the aesthetic of modern classic covers they all have the same layout and the same font changing the font would mean going against the design for me you dont sound like a dick its good feedback heres what i was going for
books,not_removed,the picture is also too bright and sunny very very much unlike the book
books,not_removed,if you dont change the font youd need to change the image in my opinion modern classics have that font because they get super eye catchy images they can afford the rights to expensive art see in that case you have all those white hats leading the eye down a corridor of faces making themselves the focus of the cover the font allows the title take on a suplimentary role in your the light version or greyscale the image isnt powerful enough to stand alone maybe if the road was bolder or more of a centerpiece leading the eye into the title it could work but overall it has no real definition
books,not_removed,the kerning needs work too
books,not_removed,whats keming
books,not_removed,k e r n i n g its the amount of space between each letter something serious graphic designers put a lot of stock in
books,not_removed,i really enjoyed all the bright places i think it is really important that they are starting to talk about mental illness in ya i feel like depressionsuicide is becoming a more popular topic in the genre i did feel like the book seemed to meander a bit i gave it to one of my students last year grade and she lost interest in the middle because of it i read suicide notes from beautiful girls quickly after all the bright places it was a very different book than i expected it to be but it was still entertaining would recommend
books,not_removed,yes i read it not too long ago and enjoyed it i also felt like it had similar themes to tfios but liked this book more i also read quite a bit of ya of all ive read so far my favorite is ill give you the sun
books,not_removed,have never heard of it before will give it a go
books,not_removed,i have copies one to loan one to keep was just thinking about him and thought to have a look on reddit to see if there were discussions
books,not_removed,give yourself all the time in the world to read it an interesting paradox is that for all k is about communication and language he has managed to produce one of the most readerunfriendly books ever plus he is not a native english speaker polish and he wrote it at a time when reader friendly texts on complex subjects were rare however i have to say that it is absolutely worth it k himself recommends reading it several times
books,not_removed,oh awesome i finished reading ss about months ago in its entirety what were your favorite parts
books,not_removed,dont think i have favorites but what has been on my mind lately is the idea of fact being an abstraction of a whole and less than the whole this in relation to the recent emphasis on fact in the political news otherwise the book in its entirety has operated on me something like chaos theory in the sense that once you see it you see it everywhere
books,not_removed,i see ss applied nearly everywhere too in language behavior the animalism korzybski described timebinding the is of identity yeah its everywhere in our world lately ive been thinking about how korzybski predicted the collapse of civilization due to our timebinding i think the collapse scenario he described and the transition from the aristotelian to the nonaristotelian is currently underway across the planet what other parts of the book intrigued you
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,i love the last child by john hart
books,not_removed,i read a lot its mainly sci fi or baseball stuff and im looking for recommendations for other stuff or those type of books too let me know your favorite book and why i should read it there is a good chance that anything recommended will end up in my library queue just for reference some of my favorites include fight club fear and loathing in las vegas hitchhikers guide to the galaxy animal farm the dark tower series etc i missed that sorry
books,not_removed,i would really have liked for rowling to have done a novelization rather than just put out copies of the script but ill take what i can get
books,not_removed,thats interesting when this was first released it wasnt so much of a script and more of an encyclopedia of beasts i havent picked up a recent copy though
books,not_removed,yeah i remember the original fbwtf released with quidditch through the ages as a kinda textbook thing just for a charity thing this is the movie script of the movie in book form
books,not_removed,this is actually our you should join the
books,not_removed,i tried to keep my books in the best possible condition for so long but then i randomly chose to start marking them now i highlight underline and write in the margins because i know that ill never get rid of my books if you ever plan on selling them id avoid marking them even if you arent planning on selling them but you still feel weird about it you can always mark the spots you want to save with small
books,not_removed,theyre a thing if marking them up makes them a more useful or valuable thing to you go for it itll lower the resale value but beyond that you bought the thing so whatever makes it better for you which said fuck no never do that i like the postit flags if i really need to find something again
books,not_removed,i go through phases where ill underline interesting passages so long as it is my own book in pencil of course
books,not_removed,depends but i do ear mark my pages i hate book marks
books,not_removed,i do this with nonfiction mostly and then only if it is a hobby subject but i never mark fiction this is mainly because i read fiction in ebooks format only
books,not_removed,you might also like rstephenking
books,not_removed,heh i learned a little about the humor of people from maine and i wonder if this is an example of it and how it would sound like from him
books,not_removed,i mean i think it is regarded as one of the best yachildrens series unfortunately they screwed up the movie so it didnt really get the wider attention of harry potter and of course the fact is most people like bland heroes a childrens fantasy book response to paradise lost was always going to be a bit more niche
books,not_removed,im definitely in the minority here but i think its way overrated riddled with plot holes and preachier than the fucking bible i was very disappointed with the second and third books
books,not_removed,i just finished the first book yesterday i dont think ill be finishing the series tbh i didnt really like it the only thing i liked is the world and the ideas like the multiverse daemons dust and what not i thought the characters were bland and im not at all a fan of a plot riding on destiny i guess i liked lyra but idk the book just felt verybland to me not quite sure how to describe it i definitely see the appeal to the series though i think its just not for me
books,not_removed,i think it does get a lot of recognition but it is a lot more cerebral than harry potter great novels
books,not_removed,pullman is partly to blame he wanted to push a certain agenda especially in book and it just came off as super preachy not to mention he lost the momentum of the popularity by taking years to release the book of dust i loved the first two books and the divisive book ending but the antichristian crap he wanted to shove down my throat turned me off by the ending
books,not_removed,loved the series every time ive read it keep a look out for the bbc series thats currently in production
books,not_removed,i dont think you can compare hp and hdm other than them being in the same genre i am a huge fan of both and am quick to sing the praises of hdm but its not as mainstream for a reason it is both more extreme and more subtle at the same time the language and syntax are also a barrier
books,not_removed,i love love lyra but there is a big difference between book lyra and book lyra where i feel harry is a bit more consistent
books,not_removed,personally i found it a good read but didnt love it i think your comparison is a bit off though i think it is more in line with the chronicles of narnia than harry potter in terms of genre there is a lot of connection to theology not just fantasy and i think that makes it pretty different in terms of how it can be made into universal entertainment for children notice how even though the lion the witch and the wardrobe repeatedly gets made into different formats the rest never catches on much i think that is because theological symbolism really goes over kids heads they cant connect as well with epic time scales and they relate more to a very simple good guybad guy dynamic over a short time span
books,not_removed,people who know about the series appreciate the complexity and well thought out characters there was some religious controversy over the books as well and on top of an average movie that didnt help
books,not_removed,i just finished the trilogy too im a little disappointed by the ending doesnt seem to fit with the rest of the story too well but all in all an enjoyable read
books,not_removed,id say it is very much overrated to me when looking at things i find attractive in literature obviously i might not be part of the target audience the setting is a hodgepodge that is romped through much too quickly for the reader to take it in and the writer to utilize the locales i still remember the gypsy canals svalbard tibet purgatory the place with the wheeled creatures but they sound better in a list than they work in the novels compared to hp these and the dust daemon armoured bears elements are not cornerstones of worldbuilding that you can base a consistent setting that feels consistent in hp theres just one theme wizardry and everything in that setting follows it in such a way that the readers instinctively know and dont as it were whats around the corner and can insert themselves there and thats why its one of the most compelling and possibly the single most popular fictional setting the second thing that threw me was the writing i dont consider myself a skilled writer and certainly wasnt one when i read hdm years ago but i think i can spot when it isnt adequate rowlings is utilitarian its not great but it does the job while pullmans well i started underlining passages i found stylistically terrible or nonsensical the average came out to perhaps one or oneandahalf per page i know ya fiction is not usually a feast for languagelovers but i believe hdm to be deeply unsatisfying and at worst annoying in this regard the third thing is the religious themes im all for discussing and experimenting with those and am not at all bothered by christianity getting the short end of the stick in the novels but god damn was it fucking juvenile maybe theres a defence in saying he fit the level of subtlety to the perceived intellect of the audience but still
books,not_removed,while my favourite series is harry potter my favourite standalone trilogy is easily hdm i didnt find it preachy at all i thought the ending was perfect too
books,not_removed,under appreciated as a teenager his were the first books i found i literally pun intended couldnt put down they made me realise how books can open entire worlds in your soul and mind
books,not_removed,i thought the teen romance ending of hdm was a disappointment the work as a whole was more complex and subtle and deserved a more adult ending
books,not_removed,dont get me wrong his dark materials is an absolutely fantastic series but pullman just isnt as good a story teller as rowling hp isnt perfect but the way she tells it makes it as near as you can get ive found very few authors at her level
books,not_removed,i worked at a book store at the time when the movie was coming out and the books were being revived in preparation there was actually a lot of controversy surrounding them particularly because of the third book and a lot of parents didnt want to buy them for their kids his dark materials is pretty political and obviously so for a religious person it talks about a lot of nonos and while harry potter had a lot of controversy as well it never blatantly defied religion or held any strong political opinions that obviously reflect our own world so a lot more parents were fine with it also ya the movie sucked that really did it in
books,not_removed,i love both series ive been trying to decide if my year old daughter is mature enough to read hdm as an adult and a christian reading it there was a scene with god that made me have to put the book down for a minute i enjoyed his take on god and heaven i just had to reconcile it against my beliefs i do think shell like it i love the world that pullman created as an aside i had a similar reaction when reading the last book in the narnia series
books,not_removed,well a book doesnt exist if it isnt hyped and appreciated
books,not_removed,people shit on it for being antichristian but i didnt really find it to be that at all boreal was certainly antichristian given his actions but he was a single character others helped him he was shown to be rather unstable quite a few times and actually ended up playing a very minor role by the end i really liked the main character lyra i thought the trilogy was great over all the romance stuff near the end in the third book i could have done without seemed to kinda develop out of nowhere into this big plot point i didnt like it the movie was not good i dont think well see another attempt for quite some time if ever it could work as a tv show they could get or seasons out of it
books,not_removed,i think the strong atheist undertones probably hurts it overall popularity a bit its basically atheist chronicles of narnia except chronicles of narnia is a lot more subtle hdm is also pretty adult for a childrens book and i remember getting bored of all the scenes of lyra listening in on adult conversations full of exposition it definitely used to be put in the childrens book section before ya became such a big thing so that could be part of it difficult reading levels and super serious tone but marketed as a fun book about talking polar bears
books,not_removed,you may also enjoy the ruby and the smoke and the shadow in the north books and of a vastly underappreciated series by him which i love didnt necessarily love book but and i can wholeheartedly recommend however without getting too spoilery i can be more explicit via pm if you want both may be a bit of an emotionally challenging read after the loss of a spouse billie piper aka rose from dr who stars in the bbc adaptation which also gives me a nerdy little thrill im glad you found hdm to be a good read in what i imagine must be a really emotionally gutting time for you im truly sorry for your loss and i hope youll find things to comfort and soothe you on the page and off hugs
books,not_removed,i liked the golden compass quite a bit actually but never did finish the subtle knife just got kind of bored with it and had other books i wanted to read at the time might come back to it one day though
books,not_removed,from what i recall wasnt amber spyglass considered something of a weak finish i read golden compass and subtle knife didnt get around to but my friends all said it wasnt as good as the first two and was kind of preachy i always assumed that was why ill have to reread the first two and read the ending someday
books,not_removed,hold on did no one else realize op said they read all in four days that seems insane to me kudos to you however
books,not_removed,i loved these books its been a while since i read them but i was recently in a library and i happened on a comics adaptation of the first book and somehow ended up crying in sheer emotion just reading the end again
books,not_removed,i mean its not as well known as harry potter but i dont think youll find many people who have read both and think hp is better hp is easier to read it doesnt make you think some people like that
books,not_removed,its sexist patriarchal bullshit where are her dark materials
books,not_removed,i can see how they would be really difficult for film id love to see an hbo or netflix animated series
books,not_removed,i feel like im the only person who liked the movie granted i saw the movie before i read the books and ive since read the golden compass a couple times and i still like the movie i named my cats pantalaimon and kaisa serafina pekkalas daemon
books,not_removed,it is out of place with the first book i think casual readers can enjoy the first book and the third one requires some affinity for fantasy and scifi
books,not_removed,iirc the third book did get really weird the trilogy as a whole was pretty awesome though
books,not_removed,thank fuck i thought id be the only one in this thread whod feel this way all this preachy religious blahblah and the waaaaaaay overdramatic teen romance ermagerd well never see each other im gonna die no the fuck you wont grow the fuck up lyra
books,not_removed,ok youre exactly who i want to talk to then what did you find preachy his stance on god and religion i read it pretty quickly so im sure i missed the plot holes
books,not_removed,the first book is like a fairy tale that introduces the characters and some basic concepts the subtle knife is where it really takes off i read it in one sitting literally couldnt put it down its incredible
books,not_removed,i only read the first book i honestly found lyra annoying i may give it another shot at some point
books,not_removed,if you liked the concept of dust and multiple worlds then you might want to keep reading as the next two books focus much more on that i think many people drop the series because the first book is a more contained adventure and the latter two are more out there
books,not_removed,thats really interesting to me i saw it as antiorganizedreligion as opposed to antichristian i thought of the church as a stand in for an organized religious organization but the basic complaints corruption narrow mindedness control unquestioning followers i see these as problems of all organized religion
books,not_removed,didnt know there was one underway thanks
books,not_removed,this a lot of people make it out to be an eitheror scenario hp or hdm seinfeld or friends why cant i like both and then the opposite if you like x then youll love y uh no just because i like hp doesnt mean i like twilight i enjoyed both immensely but i wouldnt go as far as to really compare them other than being of similar genre and the thing with hp is that its more recent and the language is more relevant to todays readers i have to admit that there were a few parts of hdm that seemed slow or the language made me go huh and have to reread a passage or two i do believe that hdm will become more popular once the bbc series is released as long as its done well when the golden compass was turned into a film they really missed the mark the film was just missing something i also believe they tried to direct the film toward a younger audience than the target audience of the book i also believe this is what happened to eragon books were awesome movie left out so much and was essentially babified
books,not_removed,in what way dont you think a change makes sense considering her age and experience
books,not_removed,agreed for some reason book and have so many parts where she has tantrums and stamps her feet i remember that phrase coming up over and over
books,not_removed,i thought pullmans storytelling was fine but the big difference between golden compass and harry potter is the amount of focus you have to have to follow tgc in hp when a new magical item or social convention or whatever is introduced to the reader rowling quickly explains it by contrast tgc can feel a bit overwhelming because the first chapters introduce the jordan university many characters and titles daemons dust someone named stalislaus who has a hole in his head tartars someone named iofur who wants a daemon but doesnt have one severed children scientific experiements etcetc pullman forces the reader to put all the pieces together in time and dust isnt even explained by the end of book its a big demand on young readers to keep track of so many unexplained things and when you add the political and religious elements the story is just a lot more complicated than the straightforward and uncomplicated fantasy world in hp
books,not_removed,tbh im not religious but why not expose your daughter to the heretical books and have the discussion with her wouldnt her faith be strengthened i think the book has wonderful themes on courage sacrifice loyalty and love especially love the bond between a daemon and a human the fact that lyra and will develop their love after spending time together mothers love etc
books,not_removed,well the overall point was that the fall of man or original sin is a good and necessary thing so that is pretty heretical to christianity
books,not_removed,thank you for the recommendation and the warning ive saved it on goodreads but will hold off for now as hdm was already a bit tough i had a very hard time getting through the part around the land of the dead i dont believe in afterlife but even the fiction of such a land gave me heartache thank you for the kind words
books,not_removed,doesnt seem ridiculous to me pretty sure i finished those books in under a week without trying too hard but i read fast so ymmv
books,not_removed,have you read the books
books,not_removed,a bbc series is coming
books,not_removed,the movie itself is decent but i think the main problem everyone has with it is that it just doesnt come close to the book ive noticed a lot of people who watched it first like it a lot more than the people who read the books first those are great cat names btw
books,not_removed,i dunno i love science fiction and fantasy and i hated the third book
books,not_removed,chabon produced a book of essays on genre fiction called maps and legends very cool read there he argues that the reason for the difference between book one and three is lyra is sacrificing her free will for her destiny or from a literary perspective pullman sacrifices character development for plot development really fits the themes of the book and makes me appreciate book three a little more
books,not_removed,it ended well im just remembering those weird wheel legged creatures from the beginning
books,not_removed,lol yes dramatic i was more moved by lyra leaving pan behind than never being able to see will again i asked the other poster too what did you find preachy im not attacking just genuinely curious
books,not_removed,i do like me some out there plots i probably will read the next two books sometime they just arent priority anymore plus i got a gorgeous edition of the books so i feel obliged to finish
books,not_removed,i totally see what youre saying but pullman is no stranger for discussing christianity in his books see the good man jesus thats why i took it as an attack on christianity specifically plus he seems more discreet on other religions the only article i found him discussing islam for example is not to mention he compared american christians to sorry but he gets no respect for me because he doesnt have the guts of calling out every religion under sun shitting on christianity is so easy nowadays but i would be more impressed if people went after muslims they dont because they know there will be heavy repercussions for it he seems uninformed blinded by a hate of a religion that is truly subdued nowadays compared to others and cowardly by not coming forward to call the latter out
books,not_removed,i dont think it was a change of growth as she is quite capable in the first book and a bit of a natural born leader book two is a lot of whining and im scared will i found it jarring and annoying
books,not_removed,oh i absolutely will i totally agree and i think shes finally old enough to have those discussions now where did i put my copy of them
books,not_removed,valid point get this redditor to an ayn rand thread stat
books,not_removed,the wonderful differences in people im probably a slower reader anyway plus i dont get as much time to read as id like i just remember it took me probably the better part of a month just to get through one of those books it still sometimes blows my mind how fast others can read
books,not_removed,omg can you post your source
books,not_removed,hm maybe preachy isnt the right word but all that talk about virgins and innocence and purity i mean the daemons stopped changing forms when they became adults and lost their innocence theres something about it that i found really iffy and i read my fair share of novels that hammer down the point that you should never lose your childlike sense of innocence and wonder damn you all this religious stuff with the angels just really rubbed me the wrong way the killing god stuff is something youd hear from the average fourteenyearold subscriber of rratheism and i know that some people consider his dark materials antireligious because of the way pullman depicts the church and its officials but all i took away from it was another kind of lecture on how to really believe like in the right way dont know if thats the kind of explanation you were looking for and if you liked it thats okay with me but i just didnt care much for it
books,not_removed,i would guess that pullman as someone from england would necessarily focus his critique on christianity as hes better suited to pick apart the church that he finds around him in a similar fashion due to my own upbringing i am most critical of christianity especially catholicism which ive been surrounded by for years if pullman or i for that matter were from a predominately muslim country you bet your ass his critique of religion would focus on islam
books,not_removed,interesting i wasnt familiar with any of his other work thanks for explaining and including the links
books,not_removed,its been a long time since i read the books but heres some food for thought maybe shes less risk averse later not because shes more worried about herself but because shes worried about will people do change dramatically when they are in love
books,not_removed,i am not working at the moment and reading is my escape i read upwards of hours most days thats virtually impossible if you have a demanding job forget family and other commitments reading more is actually the best way to improve your speed and comprehension a great catch
books,not_removed,there are more recent articles if you google bbc his dark materials too but nothing i can find re cast yet
books,not_removed,id agree the last book was frustratingly preachy but it wasnt preaching for that purity and innocence stuff just the opposite pullmans point was to link the fall of man or original sin with the birth of human consciousness he was saying losing ones innocence is a good thing the killing god part wasnt really handled in a edgy you way at all
books,not_removed,that is reasonable
books,not_removed,no from what i remember it started happening as soon as she met him
books,not_removed,thanks
books,not_removed,its weird how you can take two completely opposite things from the same text isnt it
books,not_removed,yeah but im curious how you got that the books are warning against the loss of innocence when a it is what saves the worlds it saves the dust from draining away and b the villains are the ones doing that cutting daemons of children to prevent them from entering adolescence and inheriting original sin
books,not_removed,im not really sure how i got that it was a feeling i got while reading maybe it was this typical ya thing of children saving the world and for a book that was so intent on telling the reader that it is natural and necessary to enter adulthood and lose your childhood innocence it did rely on the innocence of its protagonists a lot all these times that lyra got out of a situation because she her daemon could still change forms or straight up because she was so trusting and naive at times being picked up by complete strangers and so on all this does make you feel like this innocence is a special thing maybe i got the impression that they got to fight the system because they were so innocent like i said it was a weird feeling i couldnt shake im guessing i would have felt very different if lyra werent a young girl of eleven but definitely a teenager at least thirteen or fourteen years old would have made for a very different novel and perhaps i wouldnt have found it so preachy
books,not_removed,ok now i kinda see what youre talking about and its definitely a theme in there though i still think in the end the preachy moral is about letting go of those aspects of childhood despite their advantages innocence is antithetical to living life which is why the children saved from original sin become basically zombies like how as a child lyra can read the golden compass without having to try too hard but by the end she loses that ability but they tell her she can learn to read it better than ever but she will have to work at it this time
books,not_removed,it reminds me of the httpssimplewikipediaorgwikimainpage
books,not_removed,that was beautiful thanks

books,not_removed,while the difficulty of milton can be interpreted a as a matter of knowledge i tend to feel its a matter of style it doesnt matter how much youve read before paradise lost is always going to be difficult to read with that in mind i would just dive in but reading it out loud might be the thing that keeps you getting through it each book is about long or read so not too much even if you dont get it at least youve seen and heard all the words and you can start to get on with it
books,not_removed,i would say that you are on the right track with the aeneid and metamorphoses i would also add dantes divine comedy and the bible as essential prerequisites maybe even chaucers canterbury tales you need to read the odyssey and the iliad to understand the aeneid and you need to read the aeneid and the bible to understand the divine comedy you could also just dive in the footnotes for paradise lost should help explain the influences
books,not_removed,the way i did it in highschool was just to dive in i was very interested in religion at the time and was eating up apocryphal works and more important literature relating to christianityspecifically angelsso i went after the divine comedy and paradise lost i read the divine comedy first which helped it is a translation so the prose will be simpler what really helped was like the divine comedy i went through and read the abstracts of each chapter throughout the book then went back through with that understanding and hit the verse im sure i still didnt pick up on every reference or turn of phrase but with that good understanding of where the story was and where it was going i never felt lost with a note here and there or a companion guide it would be easy if a little tedious to pick up on every bit this way as someone older and presumably better read i dont know if this is the most effective way but it left me with great respect for the work which i consider absolutely mustread as you said its supremely vivid in the imagery and its very shakespearean in its plot
books,not_removed,if im embarking on something epic i might read the cliff notes or at least keep it handy whilst i read it i never used to do this but i got about pages into paradise lost and felt like i didnt get it my husband really enjoys milton and i felt like i was missing out
books,not_removed,ukempff s comments are spot on for when you begin reading the book dont save the introduction and forward for last going deeper i would suggest that you try lycidas first which is a nice short hour or less read indicative of miltons style if you like his style i would return the copy of paradise lost you got and get an academic version with footnotes there are many references in paradise lost that require precise historical or cultural knowledge of things around that time in order to just jump into it youd need to prepare yourself to understand a wide range of references that can touch on theology politics and the general history of the time a daunting task to research individually an academic version with footnotes will make the read more pleasurable as you will not have to stop as often to figure out specific references
books,not_removed,it definitely is a matter of knowledge as much as style the difference is however that you can get used to the miltons style with time and effort the gap in knowledge cant be bridged by a more concentrated reading because the answers lie embedded elsewhere in third party literature and historical traditions if you dont understand an overt reference then you just wont get much of pl there is also the fact that you dont know what you dont know and hence you will be completely unaware that the covert or layered meanings are there at all therefore if youre worried that a lack of background knowledge is going to cut you off from better understanding it try picking up a copy of the norton critical edition it contains a huge number of footnotes that explain nuances in the text such as allusions to the greek epics biblical history and passages miltons meaning of words eg list means wish sublimed means vaporised equaled means killed etc and rearranges the syntax of important lines to make the meaning clearer among other useful things
books,not_removed,foreword to this edition and introduction usually found at the beginning of the book
books,not_removed,the bible and shakespeare hope thats not intimidating
books,not_removed,what a great suggestion i might give that a try myself
books,not_removed,i agree with this whole heartedly while i havent read every classical work of significant relevance to the paradise lostregained i am a religious studies ma and i still struggle with milton and it has everything to do with his writing style i dont think most folks can just casually read milton as he very much requires a close reading
books,not_removed,isabel rivers book classical and christian ideas in english renaissance poetry is another incredibly useful resource
books,not_removed,i typically dont read introductions until after ive read the text
books,not_removed,he does require close reading thinking back to first reading pl i guess what i remember being the hardest thing to get was the syntax the opening may have a relatively simple message of mans first disobedience sing heavenly muse but it takes an infinite time to get out having said that about syntax looking at it again even a phrase like mans first disobedience isnt the most accessible expression so its lots of things that mean we cant just casually read milton like we would a post on reddit or something
books,not_removed,i feel that and im usually the same way but if you havent read the things it references youre really going to want to read any intro and notes you can for this one

books,not_removed,i havent read the fountainhead but i have read atlas shrugged it took me about two years of off and on reading shit got dry as hell at some points assuming they are similar stylelayoutmessagewhatever some parts you just have to truck through i will say that because it was such a hard read at times i really appreciate the message much more
books,not_removed,summer reading junior year of high school got halfway through and decided to sparknotes it first book i ever sparksnoted i loved to read certainly not the last ayn rand broke my love for reading
books,not_removed,i love the founainhead it was life changing for me although it really is not for everyone
books,not_removed,yeah the novel escalates and concludes in a really satisfying way i can see getting bored around the novella of wynans biography after hes introduced but these sort of extended digressions are a part of long fiction
books,not_removed,me i started reading it the summer after high school s the rape scene really put me off then dominique got married to peter and i stopped reading completely perhaps i dont understand the book too well but i was just really annoyed by it i tried reading it later because i dont like leaving books unfinished however i just forgot what happened in the first half and was never motivated to continue reading it i do hope that i finish reading it some day
books,not_removed,to me this book was badly written but entertaining for all the wrong reasons mostly snark value dominique really needs therapy
books,not_removed,i enjoyed both fountainhead and atlas but agree they got a little dry at times rourke put up with a lot from dominique and she slept around the rape was shocking to some ive had people return the book i lent them when they got to that part its fascinating to me when i see people who have sold out like some of the characters did rourke never compromised on his designs but i always thought he could concede a little since it isnt his money funding the projects i look forward to reading them again and usually have to wait a few years it always amazes me that rand left russia learned english and wrote those books she was also involved with the movie and ironically compromised on the story to get it made anyone remember what color dominiques hair is i imagined it as jet black when i read it the first time
books,not_removed,its a fairly dull and poorly written book ayn rands novels only ever really existed to push forward her philosophy what you think of that philosophy is up to you but she wrote her books just to preach it not to have particularly engaging stories or characters as such you get a lot of really flat dialogue and boring obvious symbolism if you are interested in her philosophical ideas you are probably better off reading her non fiction where she just gets to the point a fiction writer she was not
books,not_removed,its her best book in my opinion finish it youll be glad you did
books,not_removed,have not read fountainhead love atlas shrugged one of my all time must reads her foresight was scary i will read fountainhead
books,not_removed,the only ayn rand book thats worth reading it got me interested in architecture
books,not_removed,i loved it but it is a bit odd at some points and i can understand why some people might not like it
books,not_removed,yea the author sucks thats why
books,not_removed,that book is poop
books,not_removed,the fountainhead is the dullest book i ever read i fell asleep twice while reading it and could only read about pages in one sitting the book was super flat no climax no interesting points nothing i think she did a great job showcasing her philosophy but it was a terribly boring story i didnt like how heavy handed she was with the symbolism either
books,not_removed,suggest you read nietzsche his message is similar but better formed and a hell of a lot more concise
books,not_removed,i like to read long fiction atlas shrugged is a harder read finished it in a few months enjoyed it but never had the slightest urge to visit it again i felt like i understood it well enough her novels are all worth reading and i happily reread the fountainhead a few years ago when it was a kindle deal
books,not_removed,that page manifesto near the end took me longer to read than the entire rest of the book never read a more dry mundane pages of literature in my life but i did enjoy the book minus that part
books,not_removed,the marriage put me off more than anything im just hoping all of dominiques dumb betrayals will come together in part four
books,not_removed,dominique lets begin your session should we yes now why are you being such a bitch am i i think so do you
books,not_removed,did you enjoy the movie by the way i only learned there was one just yesterday
books,not_removed,any particular book im interested in his work but havent gotten around to picking anything up
books,not_removed,yup i have some passages bookmarked but i dont intend on a reread any time soon i just started eisenhower in war and peace and will probably pick up a copy of the fountainhead after
books,not_removed,preach i read the manifesto in a day binge and could not believe how poorly written and ill thought out it was
books,not_removed,i saw it long time ago and barely remember it i had just finished the book and was a little disappointed about all that was left out of her masterpiece story about not addingsubtracting tofrom rourkes building designsseemed like she caved into the desires of hollywood i would like to see it again i think the acting wasnt too bad
books,not_removed,the will to power is pretty much ayn rands wet dream except unlike rand its better written
books,not_removed,who is john galt he is the dullest man in the world
books,not_removed,the same way you read about faster than light travel and flying humans and animals that talk and angels sword fighting in the street unless the book is trying to convince you they are telling the absolute truth just turn off of your brain and enjoy the ride
books,not_removed,have we got the same book by bacigalupi what flat earth stuff i dont recall that it is dystopian fiction anyway and there are several set in that world
books,not_removed,isnt the windup girl speculative climate scifi i guess im not understanding how it can be compared to a book forwarding flat earth theory or conspiracy theory about the moon landing speculative postapocalyptic or postclimate science fiction doesnt have to follow any modern scientific premise inherently thats kind of the point of fiction isnt it or are you saying the idea of climate change which kind of underlies the events that lead up to the story is wrong
books,not_removed,read every book based on its own merits and in the spirit it is intended if you try to apply real world science to all writing youre going to have a hard time reading the likes of harry potter comics got and other such shit
books,not_removed,its a mark of the time it was written in an age where a misconception was still just that cosmicomics by calvino has a decent number of factual inaccuracies but theyre part of fabricated tales anyway so whats wrong if one more detail which admittedly the writer thought was factual is added onto the pile of fiction
books,not_removed,thats how i felt when i read the bible üòï
books,not_removed,fantasy and way scifi i find easy to do that to its the light scifi that i have a hard time with
books,not_removed,i was just using those as examples i didnt mean that those were in the book specifically
books,not_removed,comics and wizards i find that easyish that i can just say oh its magic and be done with it even lots of other scifi i can pull that off it may just be my personal bias because i am working on joining that field i guess
books,not_removed,ok my mistake
books,not_removed,weve all been raised on reddit to believe that one day wed all be billionaires and youtube gods and pop stars but we wont and were slowly ignoring that fact and were very very offended
books,not_removed,he picks up a very interesting point in each paragraph and then drops it without any discussion comments conclusion a horribly unsatisfying read this article he talks about different themes but doesnt tell us about how those themes apply to the book
books,not_removed,i thought it was a commentary on what vs what really need we need a carwe dont necessarily have to spend the rest of our lives working to buy a porsche we need a housewe dont need to have a buy a mansion with rooms with it i think that it is a minimalistic take on lifeand the fact that he hates bill shatner
books,not_removed,does anyone know what what the book is trying to communicate i understand that its about the struggle of being masculine in the traditional stereotyped sense vs what naturally comes to us as a bunch of men being raised by women so whats the conclusion about this topic
books,not_removed,first rule of fight club dont talk about fight club
books,not_removed,this is one book i know for a fact im never going to read
books,not_removed,you broke the first rule about fight club so disappointed in you
books,not_removed,but my rare pepes are still worth something right
books,not_removed,did you read the book i think overall it was a struggle against consumerist lifestyles that life is much richer when you find your own narrative obviously it was a real struggle for the protagonist to find that life but by the end of the novel i think hes there there is a very minor theme about men being emasculated by modern society but the bigger picture is about living your own life not the one society dictates to you
books,not_removed,id say theres a major focus on the over saturation of consumerism in modern society keeping the masses placated content enough with their material gain to mindlessly go to work come home and throw their wages at the next purchase
books,not_removed,i hm i guess it isnt appealing to everyone and thats fine year old me that saw the movie and thought it was awesome is basically who you describe but what i liked about it mostly was the violence the nihilism and the main twist of the plot at you think you know some shit but as you get older you find out you were wrong also has been true of any age in retrospect something i try to keep in mind year old me today definitely resonates with much of what is discussed above regarding masculinity consumerism what it actually means to develop an identity in the modern world etc if it doesnt speak to you personally with those themes thats cool ive reread the book twice several years in between and both times i found it cathartic because i was frustrated at what was going on in my life and it felt like palahniuk was speaking to some aspects of what i saw as my difficulties whats interesting in this discussion so far is id never considered umisinformedideas point above that even though the characters in the book make attempts at rebelling against consumerism and the system you could argue that nothing about their lives really changes as a result of joining tylers gang i like this line of thinking because its yet another layer of the futility of it all that the book is examining reading ops link i found myself nodding very vigorously at the point about identifying societal problems but not having any solutions yet another layer of it that speaks to me at the end of the day thats why id say it matters because every time i read it i find something new to identify with what more does a piece of writing need to be relevant
books,not_removed,rbookscirclejerk
books,not_removed,what an ugly way to start a point did you read the book ill try not to be as condescending although saying that is a little condescending your bigger picture is durdens narrative youve drank the koolaid the men who join tylers cult also adopt this dogma they trade in their material needs and they no longer trade their wageable hours for some measly paycheck so that they can then squander that currency on some sort of self validation instead they spend their time doing durdens homework assignments so that they can use durdens token economy of generalized praise and social standing to fulfill their selfvalidation their boss and lifestyle doesnt really change the dynamic is the same theyre just punching in at a different office theyre not living their life theyve just gone from adhering to what popular media and advertising are telling them makes a man to listening and adhering to what durden thinks is what constitutes a man
books,not_removed,not bad so thats how the consumerism is shown hes just trying to live his own life and be happy with himself sounds like i should check out this book
books,not_removed,doesnt the title of the book seem to point more towards the masculinity theme also his personality disorder where one is a ladies man while the other is mildmannered it seems to point more towards the conflicting definitions of what is considered acceptable as a man im not sure how consumerism comes into play here
books,not_removed,it really is amazing how many layers there are to this story it can be as shallow or as deep as the interpreter wants it to be although as you pointed out seeing it as mainly a nihilistic fuckthesystem male fantasy is mostly an agerelated interpretation
books,not_removed,i saw the movie didnt like the premise and i dont really like the authors writing so not much there to make me want to read it but its good that its still relevant for people who enjoy it
books,not_removed,as a further comment on the theme of masculinity which is undeniably present but only as much as every other theme do you think it plausible that the idea of what it is to be a man is simply giving the motivation behind what drives events in the book a name take away the gender and you have simply a lack of control which psychology teaches us is a necessity to avoid losing our minds and engaging in sociopathic behavior so my point is and forgive me if i present it poorly theres some vacuous shit blaring out of the tv right now is the message less what makes a man and more why isnt my life my own
books,not_removed,it was an honest question as for his men yeah theyre just living in his lifestyle not making their own as much as they think they are
books,not_removed,i like your interpretation but i think it gives too much credit to chuck palahniuk ive read and enjoyed three of his novels but im not sure that he is the type to intentionally craft a deeper message than the one hes beating you over the head with maybe im not giving him enough credit
books,not_removed,take the confiscated luggage scene i had everything in that one bag when you travel a lot you learn to pack the same for every trip six white shirts two black trousers the bare minimum you need to survive consider a man who believes the contents of a single luggage bag are his everything a man who feels his survival at its foundation relies on having shirts and trousers etc fast forward to the car crash the mechanic launches into a very telling passage of durden dogma you have a class of young strong men and women and they want to give their lives to something advertising has these people chasing cars and clothes they dont need generations have been working in jobs they hate just so they can buy what they dont really need and finally without excerpt the entire motivation behind blowing up the credit companies towards the books end is to erase debt and free the working classes edit a word
books,not_removed,thats one of the great things about the filmbook is that it means different things to different people to you its about masculinity to him its about consumerism i think its more about consumerism but also about the idea everybody has the power to change and break free from their mold but hell isnt that also ironic considering jackstylers formation of an unquestioning cult many many different ideas edit names
books,not_removed,do you think it plausible that the idea of what it is to be a man is simply giving the motivation behind what drives events in the book a name im sorry to ask this but could you rephrase im having trouble understanding control in what sense are you talking about impulse control i work with populations that have poor impulse control and theyre definitely not running around engaging in sociopathic behavior thats a bit of a leap and psychology does not teach us that control is the gatekeeper to sanity there are many other factors at play
books,not_removed,haha thats a point sometimes the author just means that the curtains are blue
books,not_removed,sorry totally my fault loud environment botched expressions basically durden sees his followers as just people who dont feel in control but as they may not grasp this or empathise with the idea he uses masculinity as a buzz word something they can all relate to im referring to the locus of control specifically of the severe external variety which obviously doesnt drive people directly insane but after a prolonged period can chip away at the superego obviously the characters arent complete sociopaths but durdens charisma is enough to push them a little further into those realms
books,not_removed,ah ok i understand now yeah i can see that although i take the view that durden uses masculinity not as a way to provide control and enrich his followers but instead to abuse their insecurity and use it for his own megalomania to me durden is a cult leader not unlike any others his means dont necessarily end in mass suicide or death but he still gets off on being this deity on to your locus of control yes i agree durdens charisma does push them closer to those realms although i dont think their lack of locus of control is the tipping point i think its durdens manipulation of the situation gather a group of people get them angry at a vague authoritarian entity blame all their shortcomings on this entity and promise salvation after destruction of said entity all for the low price of doing everything i say and worshiping me oh and it has to be a masculinity thing because i hate marla singer cause she joined all my other selfhelp groups a side note its interesting how times have changed when this book was relevant cage fighting was seen as something so obviously in the realm of man that little questions were raised on whether durden was turning away women trying to join the club if no woman was ever told or if they simply didnt want to come now almost everyone can tell me who ronda rousey is was i think if this book was written now there would be a few butch lesbians in the club not a comment on the stereotype moreso a comment of chucks writing style
books,not_removed,the colour out of space is easily my favorite i liked the lurking fear and the thing on the doorstep a lot too
books,not_removed,rats in the walls the dunwich horror shadow over innsmouth
books,not_removed,the thing on the doorstep and rats in the walls also you should read the dunwich horror
books,not_removed,the reanimator
books,not_removed,cool air since nobody else is likely to bring it up and its genuinely one of my favourites its such a different story from him and it has an oddly timeless quality to it its really a good read without much of the typical lovecraft cliches and foibles mountains of madness as well of course eight foot albino cave penguins and the shoggoth
books,not_removed,i really enjoyed the mountains of madness despite its predictability
books,not_removed,the case of charles dexter ward is my favorite
books,not_removed,one of the lesser talked about stories that i enjoyed was the statement of randolph carter
books,not_removed,ex oblivione its a prose poem and not a story but please read it its beautiful
books,not_removed,the call of cthulhu is hard to beat
books,not_removed,cats of ulthar
books,not_removed,in no particular order the shadow over innsmouth the color out of space nyarlathotep the book
books,not_removed,from beyond its howie at his most enjoyably loopy but theres also something that really clicks with me on a subconscious level about the idea that monsters are always around me in another dimension
books,not_removed,dagon is my favorite i actually really enjoyed the movie that was made ten or fifteen years ago as well my favorite lovecraftian story is the willows by algernon blackwood
books,not_removed,the tomb and the music of erich zann a bit surprised that no one else mentioned those
books,not_removed,i was gonna buy a collection of his stories yesterday
books,not_removed,i really enjoyed the dreamquest of kadath i read a lot of his stories back to back in a kindle anthology and a lot of them blur into one lovecraftian blob but i do remember randolph carter and the moonbeasts well i also really liked herbert west reanimator and rats in the walls if you liked hp lovecrafts books i can recommend some of howards conan stories many of them have lovecraftian elements to them and are also free for kindle
books,not_removed,two of my favorites were polaris and beyond the walls of sleep
books,not_removed,im still getting through a lot of his more famous works but ive really enjoyed some of his tales that deal more with the dream world and arent necessarily strictly horror the white ship was one that really stuck with me it can be a bit wordy at times but i find the intense surrealism of it all to be very interesting and fun to read
books,not_removed,my favorites are the outsider and pickmans model even though they are quite predictable they have a certain grounded charm to them thats a breath of fresh air from lovecrafts normal or abnormal cosmic horror
books,not_removed,the call of cthulhu mostly because of metallica
books,not_removed,im sorry im new to rbooks but what does the red mark with a star on it mean it says you have is it like reddit gold
books,not_removed,thanks its been strange getting accustomed to his style but once youre immersed its nice and spooky
books,not_removed,thats kind of the problem isnt it that lovecraft is so ubiquitous referenced and homagedrippedofftributed that pretty much anyone whos got any interest in it probably know all the story beats without actually reading any of it its the john carter problem even if youve never seen the source youve been inundated with the successors to such a degree that its completely predictable
books,not_removed,the tomb was creepy as hell
books,not_removed,if you have a kindle you can get his collection for free
books,not_removed,do it his style is strange especially his early works but he gets so good
books,not_removed,thats my next read
books,not_removed,books has its own weird little point thing it just means im mildly active on the subreddit
books,not_removed,i think we expect more twists from modern material and forget how the older stuff was habitual its like watching old scifihorrormurder movies before everything became a trope and newer stuff had to be more inventive
books,not_removed,aah okay thanks
books,not_removed,the dresden files and the sandman slim series are both great they are urban fantasy
books,not_removed,i havent read them yet but i just watched the magicians on netflix and its based on a book series and the show was amazing so the books are on my must read list
books,not_removed,read jacqueline careys kushiels dart series if you want something sexy sometimes very graphic or the demon cycle by peter v brett if you want great magicfightingdemon wars both excellent series well written lots of character development and worldbuilding

books,not_removed,the books are so good theyre like harry potter for adults
books,not_removed,its a beautiful book the part towards end where they find themselves in sunderbans awed me been alfway through i imagined it couldnt get better but na salman just delivers till the last page also the concept of falling in love with a girl by seeing her bit by bit via a hole in sheet putting her together piece by piece just brilliant
books,not_removed,its a gorgeous book rushdie is one of our greatest living writers midnights children was the first book of his i read back in college and it blew me away since then ive read most of rushdies stuff and its all excellent shame and the satanic verses are great his newer stuff is good as well but theres something about vintage unpolished rushdie prose and storytelling that just zings off the page
books,not_removed,my brother read it first and said that it was nothing special i gave a go at it and i have to say it is one of the best books i have read got him to read it again and he finally understood the gravitas i would recommend you to read the great indian novel by shashi tharoor it mirrors midnights in its ambition and detail
books,not_removed,i read it for the first time this summer i also loved it gotta read more from rushdie at some point
books,not_removed,i tried reading it a few summers ago and never got around to finishing rushdie has major chops with his descriptive prose and level of detail but the book was just too dense for reason man
books,not_removed,in the sunderbans was my favorite chapter as well it was very life of piesque but better i had an hour between classes when i was reading that part and god i did not know what was happening around me that chapter was easily my favorite the couples brilliant book was just so much fun to read despite it being about saleems history so i was thinking about it yesterday and i feel like jamila singer represented pakistan just as saleem represented india perhaps this has already been said before but just the way she embodies the culture of the country and how saleem and her dont talk to each other as the war closes in india and pakistan siblings after the partition irreparable after the war and oh that chapter at the end of book how saleem obtained purity where he loses his memory in the blasts was great i feel so bad for saleem but rushdies description of depression was so good ah i just want to write rushdie a letter thanking him for giving the world such a wonderful book
books,not_removed,yes i am thinking of reading another rushdie book perhaps shame and then the satanic verses i think ill end up reading them all this book however deserves all the booker prizes it has received just brilliant i can read about saleems digressions all day not really because the book is too dense to be able to read all day i read it in a five hour flight once and i was exhausted when i got off the flight
books,not_removed,i just looked up the great indian novel it is definitely on my toread list
books,not_removed,i read the enchantress of florence in december its a good book it isnt nearly as difficult a read as midnights children but isnt as good either then again midnights children is a masterpiece
books,not_removed,it is dense definitely i started it in june and finished it today so id say be patient with the book what i really liked was that salman rushdie knew exactly how dense it was in the first book padma keeps telling him to hurry and stop digressing so i promise you you will feel very satisfied once you get through it its very rewarding that way
books,not_removed,ah i just want to write rushdie a letter thanking him for giving the world such a wonderful book you me rest of the book loving crowd
books,not_removed,she literally becomes the voice of pakistan in the book
books,not_removed,its on a list for a reread
books,not_removed,haha when you put it that way
books,not_removed,i have to agree with you i like to read at least one christmasy story every year and usually they are a waste of time this one was well written and i really enjoyed it i also made the peppermint mocha they drink throughoutbut it was not very good oh well plus yes i am a jay asher fan as well
books,not_removed,the first review visible on amazon is a warning against the trivialization of violence in teen dating because of that one incident with a knife in the boys life any thoughts on that
books,not_removed,caleb never harms sierra or anyone else during the course of the story so i think saying it trivializes dating violence is a stretch the story takes place when hes around years old and the knife incident with his sister takes place when hes around in middle school so basically still a child when it happened his sister wasnt physically harmed calebs story is radical and its designed to make people uncomfortable would i date someone if i knew they stabbed their sisters door repeatedly during an argument when they were imnot sure because like anyone else id be scared that a violent outburst like that could happen again and thats basically how everyone in the book sees caleb he lives in a small town and hes shunned and treated like a monster by everyone who knows him his best friends parents wont let their son near him he seems to spend all his time trying to make up for it working and spending all his tips to help families who cant afford christmas trees sierra is the only person who doesnt judge caleb for his past if he had actually stabbed his sister back then sierra says herself that she wouldnt trust him the same way while this book has a love story to me it was more about asking questions that dont have easy answers the knife incident happens when caleb is blaming himself for his parents divorcedepressionbrokenness and his sister blames him for things whenever they argued his response to that wasnt healthy and no one can know what would have happened if she didnt go hide in her room but its also pointed out that nothing was stopping him from opening the door if he were serious about harming her
books,not_removed,if you look on the back of the book and theres a little logo of a rose in a keyhole then it has some relation to the dark tower world i dont believe pet sematary is related to the dark tower some off hand that are related are it the stand hearts in atlantis insomnia salems lot theres a bunch more sometimes he relation will be nothing more than one line in an entire book or sometimes there can be a very strong connection between the two
books,not_removed,some are set in the same universe and refer to each other with small nods like the one you found however most of his books if not all are set in the same multiverse of parallel universes which are connected through his series the dark tower
books,not_removed,yes they are set in the same universe enjoy this by tessiegirl it isnt quite up to date but gives a nice idea of how everything is connected
books,not_removed,my buddies are all reading the dark tower and theyve said it references books outside of that particular series idk if they all are but some for sure
books,not_removed,i believe he maybe does easter eggs but after reading on writing his process indicates a much more sporadic way of coming up with ideas things that blossomed as a youth watching old scifi monster programs on tv in like the beforetimes the settings are similar to what he grew up with because hey write what you know hes remarkably pragmatic and hates redundancies as one of my friends who double dated with him at a prom said
books,not_removed,he mentions shawshank prison in a few of his booksoddly enough thats the only one thats coming to me right now
books,not_removed,apparently a lot of his books have a solar eclipse to show they take place at the same time
books,not_removed,i just thought of a couple more sheriff alan pangborn needful things dark half mentioned in a couple others and sheriff george bannerman dead zone kia in cujo mentioned in a couple others oh and another fairly obvious one the town of derry itself
books,not_removed,i would recommend dark tower series to clear much of that up for you in my opinion yes its the same universe
books,not_removed,i need to read the dark tower series then im making my way through his mysterythriller and scifi novels not big on horror and ive noticed mentions to other books and such i had heard about connections with dark tower but having only read one book of that series i didnt know what they were i know randall flagg who i know from the stand is supposed to be a big deal in other books
books,not_removed,ive noticed this too its only on more recent editions though
books,not_removed,thats very cool ive just starting getting into steven king and seeing this is getting me excited to keep reading
books,not_removed,its has jake talking about being worried about being sent to shawshank and he spends some time in derry it and then the bill hodges trilogy which i just started end of watch mentions it as a tv miniseries and shawshank redemptions movie soundtrack soit seems some stuff is connected while other stuff sees the booksmovies as fiction
books,not_removed,its not a lot but two if im remembering correctly
books,not_removed,also check out the entertainment weekly issue from last week the cover is about the the new dark tower tv show coming out and it has a nifty little bit about all the books of kings that are in the same universe he said he never planned it but when it would happen organically he would just go with it or something like that pretty cool
books,not_removed,all his books are connected for the most part but they arent all taking place in the same reality
books,not_removed,in the more literal sense ishmael is saying that you dont enjoy things if theyre in a state of perfection what hes saying is that you enjoy some things by what they arent you notice and appreciate comforts more when youre aware of their opposite you appreciate warmth as comfort when youre actively not being cold in this example the pleasurable sense of luxury comes from the fact that you could be cold but you arent im rusty and dont have the text in front of me so i dont know why hes bringing it up in this passage for context it is entirely possible he was speaking ironically or sarcastically theres a lot of that that generally goes undiscussed in discussing this novel
books,not_removed,exact repost of
books,not_removed,only read man in the high castle which should i try next
books,not_removed,its been years but i am still struck by how prescient dicks prediction of news clowns was many people get their news from such clowns as john oliver rather than people like the great reporters of dicks time
books,not_removed,ive read a lot of dicks works and short stories i know he was a prolific writer but i think ive covered at least everything thats he published and is still available in print for some reason i wasnt very struck by flow my tears ive had the same experience with the man in the high castle they were alright i guess but i think maybe the hype around them tainted my experience i should reread flow my tears some time because its been a while but i remember thinking some of the ideas in that book were better used in other books particularly i liked ubik and palmer eldritch alot better also a scanner darkly hmmjust thinking about the book flow my tears though has me wanting to read it again
books,not_removed,ubik is great flow my tears is as well
books,not_removed,the three stigmata of palmer eldritch is probably my favorite but that and ubik are both kind of mind fucks do androids dream of electric sheep is also really good shorter accessible and its what blade runner was based on
books,not_removed,john oliver trevor noah bill maher certainly serve as the lefts news clowns but dont forget the right has rush limbaugh ann coulter bill oreilly none of these people are traditional journalists they all exist to serve their respective echochambers and dont get crazy about which side has more news clowns or which sides clowns are more legitimate editorial bill oreilly is just the flipside to editorial keith olbermanboth once upon a time journalistsand thats stretching it in dicks corpofascist worlds figures like these just exist to entertain and prop up the institutions they represent with their echochamber reinforced opinions applying dicks view john oliver or ann coulter is not to blame they only exist to keep us believing in the institutions we choose to believe exist
books,not_removed,well i understand what youre talking about but on the subject of this book its note relevant also the news clown from my perspective has always encompassed the good morning america style performance the youre just waking up and were there with you bullshit i dont care what you think about john oliver hes at the very least relevant but i dont see him as the dystopian positive newscaster of a dick novel typically that type of person is ingrained within the structure of the prevalent government the person to show the spin in a certain way

books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests including asking if you should read a certain book in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,fitzgerald is my favorite author and bd is my favorite book by him its important to read it from an autobiographical view every character is a figment of fitzgeralds imagination desperately trying to get out bd is basically a diary of sorts it will tell you more about fitzgerald than any of the characters in it heres a review no spoilers i did of it a while ago it may help you add some context to this beautiful piece of art please feel free to ask me any question about this book regarding its literary worth and i will happily extrapolate fitzgeralds mindset when writing a particular character or scene seriously when i read this book it felt like every sentence was like fitzgerald speaking directly to my soul
books,not_removed,this side of paradise has some of fitzgeralds best quotes in my opinion i dont want to repeat my innocence i want the pleasure of losing it again youll find another god banish the thought why dont you tell me that if the girl had been worth having shed have waited for you no sir the girl really worth having wont wait for anybody edit for clarity
books,not_removed,i tried about ten years ago i really tried but just found it boring im not sure how i feel about scott i n general
books,not_removed,im not a fan of fitzgerald i felt the same way when i read this book his prose is amazing how he writes is beautiful whats he writes about not so much
books,not_removed,i know myself but that is all from the end of tsop i still think about that quote a lot i was reading tbad when i visited fitzgeralds grave it is a bit boring compared to his other books as i have said in another fitzgerald post he is better to read in publication order you can better see his growth as a writer if you read in order also the books are largely autobiographical so they are a nice timeline in his and zeldas life
books,not_removed,i agree his prose is beautiful i remember getting angry with the characters in the beautiful and damned because they were such spoiled pampered brats i wanted to yell grow up and get a job fire the maid and do your own damn housework i did enjoy it though
books,not_removed,i dislike them i just find paper books easier to read then again i only have a laptop or phone to read them on so if i had a tablet or something that i could have a big easy on the eyes screen and better controls i wouldnt mind them
books,not_removed,i still prefer paper books mostly because i love the smell and because it feels great turning the pages however environmental awareness and allergies shelves accumulate a lot of dust have me shifting towards ebooks
books,not_removed,i use an iphone and when i read on it i am constantly scrolling up and it just spoils the whole experience for me a good way to read books is to buy them inexpensively at a thrift store and donate them back when youre done
books,not_removed,i like ebooks mainly because im tired of moving boxes of books the last time i had boxes and the movers almost quit on me the density of ebooks is nice also i can back them up to a cloud server i dont buy drmd books
books,not_removed,the storage is great still not the same as page turning lots of free options for ebooks especially classics
books,not_removed,this subject has been very popular in the past please use reddit search andor check the rbookswikifaq
books,not_removed,i really like reading on a eink display it is almost like paper
books,not_removed,buying classics is just great i got all books written by karl may and jules verne for ‚Ç¨ ca pages d
books,not_removed,thats what ive heard but i cant find any that are as big as id like i like seeing pages at once especially for things that are designed for it
books,not_removed,never heard about such an ebook either i just stick to the onepagedesign
books,not_removed,do not post shallow content im sorry but your post currently counts as shallow content do you have something else to say about the book that you could edit into the text preferably your own thoughts about the book or at the least a description of the book without spoilers i recommend that you make a new post with some additional info but you can also update this one if you decide to update let me know and ill reapprove your post
books,not_removed,ive read about a million the chosen one goes on a quest for the ultimate power to defeat the ultimate bad guy plotlines in sffantasy books itd be hard to make a list itd just go on and on and onsometimes theres an interesting twist to it sometimes they distinguish themselves by being just superbly writtengreat worldbuildingetc
books,not_removed,not so much plots but john green gets a lot of criticism regarding identical characters in his novels margoalaska paper towns looking for alaska was a big one in a review i read once
books,not_removed,the amber wizard copied its villain from memory sorrow and thorn by tad williams no seriously both series have a dead storm king from a long dead elfanalog race who wants to return from the dead with the assistance of his redrobed priest mages and wreak havoc on the modern humans and rule the world in both series the heroes stop the storm king at the moment of his resurrection i believe forbes series was eventually canceled
books,not_removed,they are very different when you get down to it but swan song by robert mccammon and the stand by stephen king are similar enough to be almost ridiculous both start with a world ending event that reduces the worlds population to around of what it was followed by the buildup of two factions of people each led by a stand in for the devil the man with the scarlet eye in ss and the walkin dude in ts both shapeshifters with demonic powers and a stand in for gods prophet swan in ss and mother abigail in ts
books,not_removed,in addition to the chosen one on an epic quest to defeat the evil villain bent on dominating the world who most likely had their heart broken ive read way too many classics that involve an upper class woman falling in love with a middle class man but having to delicately navigate through the upper class political scene and avoid marrying some mean but not evil upper class man falling from grace scandal around her or her family and then finally reuniting with her one true love the last classic i read with the above plot was great and had a nice twist that really hit me in the feels its not so much the plot that drives books with such a generic formula but rather the writing and character development
books,not_removed,the tennis stars balls by stephen fry is pretty much a modern version of the count of monte cristo i cant remember but i think he was quite open about this at the time
books,not_removed,i took theater for my major in college i forget the exact number but there are only about thirty plot lines in existence i cant name them all anymore i drank that knowledge away
books,not_removed,thats because this is the most ancient and integral plot structure to humanity have you read the theory by joseph campbell all stories have been told before cf httpsenwikipediaorgwikistructuralism
books,not_removed,i read both but like swan song better the world was darker and grittier it would be front the nukes the characters were barely surviving i do love sk but in this instance ss won
books,not_removed,exactly
books,not_removed,i gave up reading for nearly two years because of that i spent some time looking for stories without equilibriumproblemquestequilibrium cycles and failed i spent a while looking for stories where i didnt recognise any tropes and where none of the standard plotlines applied and failed so i just stopped reading humans are really crap at being original now i mostly read for world building and avoid anything where people do very much does anyone write alternate universe encyclopedias and almanacs
books,not_removed,swan song just had so many cheesy moments a magical crown that gives people hope when they touch it a demon who wants to destroy peoples hope for the future those growths over peoples faces that crack open and receal a persons inner face the password to stop the doomsday device being amen sisters burial on top of the mountain just as he sun finally comes back to the world book actually raised my cholestoral level
books,not_removed,normal problem solution new normal is the formulation of every plot ever though youre saying you gave up reading because the things you were reading had stories
books,not_removed,look into literature works especially modern literature
books,not_removed,usually the standard tropes are recycled because they satisfy people if youre open to ambiguity and anticlimax then you can appreciate a wider variety of books
books,not_removed,loved book raised my cholesterol level
books,not_removed,i gave up reading for the same reason i dont like paintings or stage magic once you learn to see the brushstrokes its impossible not to do so and becomes just a tedious experience
books,not_removed,i am very fond of ambiguity and anticlimax theyre much more realistic
books,not_removed,this probably isnt the list you might be expecting theres some disturbing works on the list that are nonetheless influential and a part of our nations history
books,not_removed,such a fascinating and terrifying list thank you for sharing
books,not_removed,i dont care for the list a better idea would be what books of the past are most influential to us now instead of what was influential then lets lift up thoes who were before their time
books,not_removed,what thread are you referring to the most recent thread i can find on the topic of trigger warnings is months old edit are you talking about the thread there it looks like the user deleted their comments
books,not_removed,its the scolastic one
books,not_removed,its not a thread specific on trigger warnings its the top one about retrofitted books and eventually that topic showed up
books,not_removed,just got to that one and edited my comment as you responded it looks like the comment thread in there you are referring to was deleted by the user
books,not_removed,yeah i saw several removed comments so its possible that it was one person arguing his points but then decided to delete all his comments that does look dubious though and im worried about mod censorship just for differences in belief
books,not_removed,im going through the reported comments from that thread just now before that everything removed was either deleted by the user or removed by automod name calling and such it looks like one or more users removed all of their comments in there
books,not_removed,thanks ill delete my post now
books,not_removed,no problem user input is important
books,not_removed,history i love history far too much
books,not_removed,i really like to read travel journals someone who writes about an epic trip they did preferably a few decades ago when the world wasnt so readily available
books,not_removed,i read a lot of memoirs most from stand up comedians they are hilarious and i personally love stand up so it is an interest for me my most recent favourite is parsnips buttered by joe lycett i would youtube some of his stuff before buying it though to check if you like his style other than that i read history books it started when i did my degree and now i just pick up ones i think ill like also some political memoirs and some feminist texts thrown in oh and i am really fond of bill bryson
books,not_removed,i must confess i can only read nonfiction in audiobook form it puts me to sleep otherwise even if im interested in the topic yes im a cretin however i do listen to a lot of audio nonfiction i mostly choose science technology history or pop psychsociology for example salt diamond stiff the emperor of all maladies thinking fast and slow the wisdom of crowds predictably irrational consider the fork mindless eating guns germs steel i can dig up links if youre interested too sleepy to do it tonight occasionally some traditional history biographies or memoirs sneak in there
books,not_removed,my favorites are memoirs and pop science books sometimes i like more sciencey science books if theyre related to what i studied in college biology psychology neuroscience i also like reading books about dogs especially canine cognition but also training books breed guides etc just cause
books,not_removed,i like first person histories big picture history written or ghost written by famous people doesnt interest me as much as the common persons experiences and interpretation of events
books,not_removed,im mostly a fiction reader too but i love books about psychology i think its fascinating to think about what goes on in peoples heads
books,not_removed,psychology theoriescase studies about psychological disorders also true crime oh and also personal essays jenny lawson david sedaris samantha irby roxanne gay etc
books,not_removed,im a sucker for an interesting biography most recently of american presidents meachams american lion andrew jackson and millards destiny of the republic james garfield are brilliant a river of doubt theodore roosevelt is next on my reading list
books,not_removed,with the exception of emotional stories about just people suffering and nothing else i enjoy all mysterious crime science anything im just generally not interested in suffering stories im not saying only good things can happen i love reading about crime but i feel i can get too much of these big sad emotions and to me it can start feeling too much and comical very fast
books,not_removed,ive read two memoirs lately that have given me a new take on nonfiction crapalachia by scott mcclanahan and sirens by joshua mohr were both excellent reads david foster wallace has some amazing nonfiction as well
books,not_removed,i still read more fiction than nonfiction but when i do read nonfiction i tend to go for history about fairly broad topics for example ancient rome as opposed to ancient rome under one particular ruler occasionally ill mix in some physics or math reading as well
books,not_removed,history mostly us and european also literary criticism most of my nonfiction reading is geared toward enhancing my fiction reading
books,not_removed,when i was a teenager most of the nonfiction books i read were memoirs from famous rock musicians that definitely changed in university where i began reading more about history not only due to the fact that i was studying it but also because i enjoyed going further into several more interesting topics we never got to cover in class i was also very into what tom wolfe the journalist describes as new journalism for awhile joan didion is amazing
books,not_removed,i love journalism especially from the us century pulling up archives of newyorker the atlantic nyt paris review boston globe time or any other literaryminded newssource also many celebrated authors paid the bills with journalism at times people hype fear and loathing in lv but hsts gonzo papers are so much better also i love essays having to do with lit theory or lit criticism oscar wilde matthew arnold nabokov the inklings thomas huxley and of course the greeks who started it are great to start with as far as books as opposed to essays and reports i guess the main nonfiction for me would be philosophytheology which maybe isnt for everyone
books,not_removed,lots of different kinds but i suppose the thread uniting the books is life just finished one bird at a time and i contain multitudes
books,not_removed,i like research driven books on psychology books like influence grit peak and thinking fast and slow
books,not_removed,history is probably the nonfiction i read the most but i also like books on social studies and political events
books,not_removed,history or science
books,not_removed,history psychology memoirs travel biographies personal growth inspirationalso many books so little time
books,not_removed,i have a lot of fun reading science nonfiction books theres a lot of topics in science that i find interesting but i have difficulty grasping more specific and advanced content in new research and academic publications so i try to seek out more general knowledge and build my understanding through books and podcasts
books,not_removed,philosophy political theory criticalliterary theory some psychology and essay collections
books,not_removed,i go for the lighter stuff not these heavy history or science tomes other people are mentioning
books,not_removed,science or history ive really learned a lot better than school jajaj
books,not_removed,i prefer stories that involve an adventure of some sort
books,not_removed,im really into item or topic histories eg bloodwork a book on the history of blood transfusion spice the history and role spices played in the developing world etc edit also anything by mary roach
books,not_removed,i read a ton of psychological and self help books i suppose they fall into this category partly because i want to be a social worker partly because i have my own stuff i deal with
books,not_removed,i love history im currently reading the white war by mark thompson which is about italys war against the hapsburg empire during the years and it is absolutely fascinating i enjoy reading history because i learn so much more than i ever did at school
books,not_removed,history and longform journalism eg science for laymen politics
books,not_removed,my nonfic reading is generally autobiosmemoirs history often wwii related but certainly not always science religionmythology or truecrime it only makes up a small portion of my reading i tend to read around a dozen a year out of or so total books
books,not_removed,reformation history anything about cryptography quantum physics for the layperson
books,not_removed,mostly biographies business selfimprovement psychology critical thinking science religion history
books,not_removed,looking back at my nonfiction reading from most of the books i read are story driven nonfiction ie the author follows a specific timeline interacts with the main characters gives opinions on the people in the story these books have mostly been scientific eg mooallems wild ones and levins black hole blues and dont really explain concepts and gives facts but rather shed light on the stories and people you might not otherwise hear about id recommended taking a look at brian pickings for those kind of reads
books,not_removed,i actually just finished reading a book about coffee how to brew it the different techniques and where coffee is grown and produced it was interesting and taught me about the industry edit i read book about subjects i am interested to learn more about as i have also read book about the making of certain films or law
books,not_removed,humor anything by david sedaris is well worth a read augusten burroughs is another good one although less consistent i always recommend ellen degeneress books to people but i think preconceived ideas about what theyll be like keep the suggestions from being taken i also like popscience and books on strange topics recently read mary roachs book on cadavers and learned some interesting things although i expected a little more weirdness i guess travel books are good too especially when the author has a sense of humor
books,not_removed,about of my collection is just made up of biographies i also gravitate a lot towards film criticism or behindthescenes books
books,not_removed,usually something to do with urban planning or architecture since thats what im interested in failing that history
books,not_removed,i read some science but mainly stick to cookbooksfoodie stuff and biographiesmemoirs
books,not_removed,memoirsessays comedians journalists authors poets humor comedians mostly travelogues bryson bourdain pop psychology sociology anthropology science econ history linguistics i guess i refer to a genre as pop not because its fluff but because its comparatively easy to read written for a wide audience and on a compelling subject matter im not really looking to become a subject matter expert but just to read about things that i dont already know or to look at common subjects through the lenses of different fieldsdisciplines i like books on cognition abnormal psychology especially case studies i like books about this weird thing we do or the world during timeera i like books about evolutionary biology and ecology i have a few books about the history of the english language which i havent had a chance to read yet thats the kind of stuff i find compelling i guess observations about the way things are and speculations on why things are this way and not that
books,not_removed,i like reading about people i love bossypants oliver sacks and the irregulars equally because they focus on personal anecdotes and of course i cant forget about david sedaris and james herriot
books,not_removed,science usually biology id like to expand to other genres as well biographies of scientist and historical figures usually prominent women id like to read more historical non fiction
books,not_removed,i read a book about the history of encryption lately and it was very interesting called the code book have to look up the author though
books,not_removed,i am almost years old have been reading voraciously for yearsalmost all nonfiction about the only fiction ive ever read was when i was in hscollege my favorite nonfiction books are mostly autobiographies or books by people who were around other famous people ie employees of the kennedy family or autobiographies by people who lived under oppressive regimes china under the cultural revolution the ussr under communism etc probably just to reassure myself that life in the usa is pretty good despite the current situation also stories about people who have gone through difficult times but hung in there survived i like obscure books most of which i have to look for online because they arent to be found in any secondhand bookstore it really doesnt matter to me what the book is about as long as it is in a writing style that interests me heres a list of some of my favorite books a few of which can be found in used bookstores all over but the shoutingrick bragg colors of the mountainsounds of the riverda chen black on red my years in the ussrrobert robinson in cold bloodtruman capote just the way the story is narrated is brilliant but a very sad book too stubborn to diecato jamarillo the egg ibetty macdonald arctic homesteadnorma cobb tishaanne hobbs purdy mig pilotjohn barron on the wrong side my life in the kgbstanislav levchenko the kennedy caserita dallas torn lace curtainfrank saunders haywirebrooke hayward the animals came in one by onebuster lloydjones gifted handsdr ben carson fat girljudith moore the prizewinner of defiance ohioterry ryan richiethomas thompson wait till next yeardoris kearns goodwin mans search for meaningvictor frankel the last lecturerandy pausch tuesdays with morriemitch albom dewey the library catvicki myron life is so goodgeorge dawson not without my daughterbetty mahmoody black boyrichard wright marie a true storypeter maas all of frank mccourt also love reading about manmade disasters so i have books about the new london texas school explosion the chicago iroquois theater fire the station fire in ri the ola school fire in chicago in the winecoff hotel fire in atlanta in the cocoanut grove fire in boston in the beverly hills supper club fire in ive had to go online for all of these books theyre usually sold in the local bookstores of where the disasters took place but ive learned you can find almost anything you want on amazon my dream is to be able to buy all the books i want theres so much on there
books,not_removed,lately ive been reading a lot of books about religion my big project last year was to read the bible itself and that led me to bible commentaries like torah for dummies by arthur kurzweil or a visual walk through genesis by stephen miller sam harriss waking up about selfexploration through meditation karen armstrongs the case for god a history of religious practice and thought and brian leiters why tolerate religion an essay that uses various frameworks to decide whether matters of religion should be privileged over other cultural or ethical matters i also like memoirs especially comedians reading their own audiobooks comedians know the value of solid delivery and id imagine theyve practiced before stepping into the recording studio i dont always get that sense from tv stars and businessmen
books,not_removed,wonder if romance of the three kingdoms count
books,not_removed,the sharpe series started me down the hole now im reading actual nonfiction history im not sure what to think of myself
books,not_removed,history is my favorite too followed by biography
books,not_removed,now that you mention it i would probably love to read something like that
books,not_removed,i adore bill bryson
books,not_removed,i never thought of that im definitely going to give it a try
books,not_removed,thats a great idea
books,not_removed,i would highly recommend the men who united the states by simmons winchester if you havent already very well written and told through a few different points of view geographers explorers etc
books,not_removed,same here i love books like that nudge is a great one to start with
books,not_removed,joan didion is great
books,not_removed,totally agree if you dont know their work yet i recommend gay talese and tom wolfe
books,not_removed,like what just curious neither history nor science need to be heavy
books,not_removed,i wanted to do this and got completely lost in where to start
books,not_removed,i read one where a swedish socialist i think it was in the saved up money by working as a hot dog seller one of the funniest bits was when he was on a boat from china i think going to japan tiny bunk beds with other chinese dudes for a few days and he was so annoyed that every morning all the chinese people would go up on deck and stand there spitting for a while he thought it was seriously gross two days later he stood there among them hooking up loogies himself
books,not_removed,for something in this vein i recommend the lost city of z by david grann about the adventures of an amazon explorer in the early reads like fiction and was written fairly recently bonus its been made into a movie coming out this year
books,not_removed,he has such a lovely way of describing travel that just makes you want to visit that place
books,not_removed,thanks
books,not_removed,for example pistols and petticoats years of lady detectives in fact and fiction by erika janik so its historical but its not about a particular time period or event i guess im imagining most people are talking about jeff shaara and david mccullough type historical books ive also recently read haunted on ghosts witches vampires zombies and other monsters of the natural and supernatural worlds by leo braudy grunt by mary roach science but lite and dave barrys latest book of essays which is humor
books,not_removed,i started with an abbreviated readthrough of the bible either online or in the books themselves you can find for part or all of the book i did the day overview shown here it covers about of the total volume of the book focusing on the passages that are most commonly referenced or most important to the overall story the project was a lot more fun than i expected so i went for a full reading in about five pages per day for the whole year i read torah for dummies because i felt that i needed some historic context and after that i just started browsing the religion section of my librarys overdrive catalog rewinding a bit further i started on the bible because of what id read in thomas c fosters how to read literature like a professor foster recommended that in order to more readily recognize allusions and metaphor in modern works one should read the works that they drew from like the greeks the bible folk tales and shakespeare thats all i originally ally wanted to read enough of the bible to catch bible references in literature i hear jane eyre is loaded with them edit to add another question people often have is which translation to use for my first pass i used the new international version niv its a more colloquial translation so its relatively easy for a modern independent reader to understand of course that also means that the translator has done some interpretation for you so i wouldnt rely on it alone for indepth study translation is mostly a matter of personal preference though protestant bibles are all going to have the same content so where they mostly differ is their if you want something thatll take a little more work to read but maintains more of the oldschool poetic feel i also like the new king james version nkjv and the holman christian standard bible hcsb also if a book calls itself a study bible that means that it includes additional stuff like interpretation commentary crossreferencing maps archaeological findings or discussion questions
books,not_removed,its true and hes so clever and witty i can feel the places he describes
books,not_removed,the braudy and roach books both look interesting im going to look into them thanks
books,not_removed,the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy by douglas adams has been a favorite of mine for years now

books,not_removed,ready player one was supper good i would read it if you enjoy sifi at all
books,not_removed,of mice and men is something that i didnt like when i had to read it in school hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is one of the funniest books ive read ready player one if you grew up in the and played arcade games it will give you a nostalgia trip the shining one of the creepiest books ive read even if the movie had overshadowed it for me now wild great imagery and i could feel her struggle trying to find herself
books,not_removed,havent read most of these books but most of them ive heard are really good you got lucky
books,not_removed,another vote for hitchhikers guide because if the worlds going to explode might as well laugh about it
books,not_removed,i really enjoyed the maze runner but felt let down by the rest of the trilogy it was like the author put all his best effort into the first one and got roped into a series and kinda phoned in the rest of it loved hitchhikers guide and i see a few ive been meaning to get to but havent
books,not_removed,hitchhikers guide now many books make you laugh out loud ready player one just all around awesome and good to read before the spielberg movie comes out soon fault in our stars though i would read something anything else by john green first fault is quite serious and his other books have more quirky humour
books,not_removed,my favorite book is enders game so ive heard this should be right up my alley thanks for the reply
books,not_removed,i dont have time to read books this fall or any other season let alone all of them about one topic let alone all of them being queerfeminist heres books about garbagemen you should read next month no
books,not_removed,i dont think any detailed knowledge of the time period is necessary to enjoy the book
books,not_removed,definitely improved vocabularyspelling they also really opened my eyes to just how awful the writing in video game storytelling is in games also exposure to new ideas and themes
books,not_removed,its helped me develop a quicker wit i find myself to be a more conversant person by having more thoughtful responses in a discussion after ive read than when i havent it also calms me down in social situations because it gives me a stronger ability to work with ideas in social situations im often silent and uncomfortable otherwise these effects holds regardless of what ive read but because i didnt grow up with it its not a habit and when i dont read the effects wears off so i read as much for its benefit of being a mental exercise as it is an enjoyable pass time
books,not_removed,it gives me stimulation anywhere i could possibly be in checkout line at grocery store waiting for oil change downtime at work eating lunch if alone where before the stimulation id crave could only be found in front of a tv or computer at home i used to do everything to get in front of my tv as fast as i can now im able to focus on whats in front of me better and more peacefully
books,not_removed,i already had a pretty good vocabulary and could speak well in structured situations but i would say im better at spontaneous discussion theres a reason have you read any good books lately is a standard line for making small talk even if you dont read any of the same authors books present ideas and dilemmas that could make for interesting conversation
books,not_removed,started reading at age just two years ago ive definitely noticed a change in my vocab and speech unfortunately it hasnt done my memory any good
books,not_removed,as a foreigner english is not my native language reading english books do help me a lot in real life situations personally i think book readers tend to be more patientcalm than nonreaders
books,not_removed,i second this minus the spelling man i still suck at that and i have spell check computers to blame for this however certainly my vocab has improved immensely i never considered reading until grade english class my professor taught us beowulf a story i instantly fell in love with from there i dove into the sub fantasy genre

books,not_removed,benefit how enjoy what youre reading more just because you read it faster id say probably not since reading should be done at your leisure and not at some warp speed learning memory techniques sounds useful but im not sure what else besides mnemonics method of loci they could teach hopefully someone else who has taken the course will point you in the right direction whether its worth the cost‚Äîespecially if it could cause a decrease in reading comprehension
books,not_removed,sure i used to do it now i read for a different reason but nonfiction i used to bang right through that stuff at years old i read alive the andes plane crash book in two hours i still remember quite a bit from it to this day nearly well forty years later but now now reading is something i do when i am chilling out and enjoying time away from the everyday stuff why rush it and certainly wrt fiction i dont really hurry up it can be done i would not pay for it though i learned how to do it from an advertisement that used to be in all the magazines of the period learn to group words eye skip run along with a finger then eventually you can run a finger down the center of a page and read a line at a time it isnt less enjoyable for nonfiction and yes you do retain it unless you are going too fast
books,not_removed,yes it is you should try it
books,not_removed,not for comprehension
books,not_removed,great question i implemented tim ferriss method not sure if theres multiple styles or anything and ive found that my only limitations is my own reading comprehension level if youre reading a book that isnt very challenging vocabulary wise then speed reading is an incredibly effective and amazing tool to use if a piece of literature is filled to the max with difficult words that youre peripheral vision wont be able to pick up then youre going to be lost if you want to read something very carefully then normal reading is the way to go but learn how to do it i personally love it crazy how the pages can fly
books,not_removed,if your reading tech manuals you can usually get the gist of the information the problem is that you only get that not the details or specific information ive tried this with big tech manuals and i could fumble through the job but i had to go back constantly
books,not_removed,whats that supposed to mean
books,not_removed,ok gonna buy the course then just one more question does it work with technical material
books,not_removed,dont really understand why you were down voted this sub can be weird sometimes
books,not_removed,im not really familiar with the ryanverse but here httpsenwikipediaorgwikijackryancharacter has a chronological listing of the novels the character appeared in working backwards from sum of all fears you might be able to figure it out
books,not_removed,yeah i did that earlier and there doesnt appear to be anything specific to the stars in any of the preceding books the best i could assume is star for red october and the star for clear and present danger that leaves patriot games and cardinal in the kremlin as possible novels when he got the star i could probably assume that it was the latter since he was only with the cia for part of patriot games but i was hoping for something definitive like i said its been bugging me
books,not_removed,i think the star would be for the operation at the end of cardinal
books,not_removed,it is very much part of a trilogy the arch of her powers spans all three books so in a discovery of witches youve only gotten as far as how she has seen her power up to this point in her life i refer to the series as being what i had hoped for from twilightwhich i gave up on after books it is filled with fantasy romantic and vampire cliches but it has a somewhat older older educated protagonist with her own life and support structure ill hold off on saying what else i like as it would give away plot points in the next book id recommend as a similar but shorter and lighter story the first two books are out but ive seen no word on the third
books,not_removed,if you thought the end of the book is sluggish id suggest skipping the second book entirely it adds nothing they go back in time and live there for the entire thing its dull and i barely made it through that being said i think the third book was good and worth reading if you enjoyed most of the first one
books,not_removed,i noped out halfway through because nothing happened except throwing more powers at the protagonist
books,not_removed,someone on this sub recommended the kate daniels series by ilona andrews to me and i love them witches are more minor characters and not introduced until the third book but the main character has natural magic talents first book is called magic bites and the whole series is fun light and has romance in it i would highly suggest you read them
books,not_removed,the first book did lack a lot of character development but like already mentioned it is definitely a trilogy read and i promise she does learn how to control her powers i took a long break between book and and by the time i got into the second i really enjoyed the whole story but i loved the historical parts about the second book i recommend the night circus by erin morgenstern if you liked the magical aspect of the book and the historian by elizabeth kostova if you enjoyed the historical aspects happy reading
books,not_removed,same here i keep telling myself ill go back and finish it but its been months i dont think it is happening
books,not_removed,i was with it all the way up to ninjapowers
books,not_removed,i really enjoyed this book its a classic pageturner with an interesting hook
books,not_removed,terrible book mandibles by shriver is way better hystopia is dull too
books,not_removed,i work in a university library is very true for academic libraries as well we will purchase almost anything a student staff or faculty requests if we have the money we know someone wants it way easier than guessing what people need
books,not_removed,other librarians hate her number will make your jaw drop
books,not_removed,no you just know that in most library systems local holds are filled first to save money on delivery costs so even if someone else was in line for the book before you youre closer and thus the winner this doesnt work everywhere in fact it doesnt work in the three largest counties in my state also i hate when i run out of renewals too but i think its likely selfish to try and get the book again instead of letting others borrow it if youve already had your chance if there are no other holds or a lot of copies then i take back this objection run out of checkout time for your ebook keep it anyway you downloaded an ebook and your weeks are almost up oh noes but wait just turn off the devices wifi your book wont disappear on you if you can reset the date on your device this may work as well this will not hold for all libraries but most have constrictions on ebooks that are basically the same as real books aka they can only check out a limited number of copies at a time this means that while this exploit may work for you it could potentially keep others from getting their chance to read the book have a rarecool item bought for you sort of this is actually pretty good advice dont get demanding about it but theres no harm in trying
books,not_removed,trick as others have pointed out wont work in a lot of public library systems the real pro tip for holds is if the request list is a few hundred long not uncommon for the new york public library my system try to find the large print version and request that
books,not_removed,just remove the drm
books,not_removed,man seriously dont do the first one thats super dicktastic unless no one else has a hold on it
books,not_removed,ok super click baity title but good advice nonetheless i know ive had problems with ebooks before so next time ill try the wifi trick it lets the next person with a hold download it though right
books,not_removed,another public librarian here will not work in most libraries because we have our software rigged to prevent it if we let people place their book on hold over and over half our shelves would be empty some systems also have rules that an item cant be rechecked out to you or anyone in your household for hours after you return it so other people have a chance to grab it on the shelf i have also never heard of a library system having a policy about putting local holds in priority over system wide holds that seems incredibly unfair to me
books,not_removed,this one isnt book related but have a test that needs to be proctored talk to your local librarian most public libraries will offer proctoring services for free or super cheap typically you dont even need a library card to utilize this service
books,not_removed,re this used to work for my kindle but no more amazon got smart and forces the delete even without connecting to wifi just gotta read faster or request again sheesh
books,not_removed,number may not work on other systems i work in an academic library and our system gets a little weird when you try to place a hold on a book you currently have checked out if its not so popular you can typically bring the book back and well check it in and check it back out as long as no other holds have been placed now if you somehow managed to place a hold on the item you currently have out the hold might be for a different copy of the same title soooo you wont be getting the book back until a specific copy arrives
books,not_removed,in the system i work in this will sometimes work depending on the situation but most of the time it will not especially if its someone within the county already has a hold on it if no one has a hold on it most of the time we will just renew it or recheck it out to someone especially if it is a low circ book go for it in our system the license automatically gets reopened for checkout being in a public library and part of a large consortium of counties around if we cant get you the book for free through a consortium loan chances are its a specialized book mostly suited for an academic library and we will not purchase it like someone else said about it earlier though dont expect them to buy it for you and have that attitude theres a review process that takes a while especially if its a hard to get book that could be expensive
books,not_removed,what i do when i run out of renewals is go into the website at least or days before i have to return the book and put another copy on hold usually it arrives just when i am returning the one i have it just seems the most considerate way to do it
books,not_removed,run out of checkout time for your ebook just turn off the devices wifi your book wont disappear on you i do this all the time if you read on a dedicated ereader and not a tablet that you actually need the wifi its awesome also i think if you get an ebook from the library through your kindleamazon account then you still get the matchmaker deal for the audiobook i havent tried it yet so instead of the ebook costing an audible credit its way reduced at like bucks edit i dont have any active loans out so im not sure if this still works
books,not_removed,alt just keep the book until you are done especially if you have made serious progress reading it it is a dick move if that is longer than a week you dont devote yourself to completing it right away and the waitlist is long but it will only cost or so in fines
books,not_removed,i know this is an old post but i just wanted to confirm im starting the long journey of learning japanese i wanted the first textbook from the genki series nobody in my library loan network had it or really any decent books for learning japanese the librarian asked if i wanted them to order it uhhh yes it should be here soon
books,not_removed,number and seem to be just ways you can be a dick and game the system i know i know let he without sin etc
books,not_removed,whoa this post wasnt meant to be sarcastic these are some jerk moves and as a librarian you should know that
books,not_removed,this is so interesting and educational thanks
books,not_removed,these are all interesting tips i realize it can be hard to get a book again soon if you live in a small county with small or very few libraries i live in the dc metro area so i have the alexandria fairfax county arlington dc libraries from which to get my books or ebooks even still there are some books where im like in line even if there are copies of a book i will put a hold on the book at all the libraries so usually by the time i have to turn one in i only have to wait a day or two to get it from another library and just pick back up where i left off when im done i cancel all my remaining holds also if i have a book and have to turn it in i check to see if its available in overdrive as an ebook if so i turn in my paper book and just pick up where i left off on overdrive some books like the martian or the fifth season the wait was so long at every library and on overdrive i just went ahead and bought it they are both very good books so it was well worth it
books,not_removed,never knew about the first two tricks i am loving the second one
books,not_removed,bear in mind that depending on your town the last three months of the year could be marchaprilmay julyaugustseptember or octobernovemberdecember
books,not_removed,the very best time to approach a librarian is the last months of the year when they have to finish spending their budget i dont know where these libraries are that have the luxury of excess budget but we very clearly tell people that anything requested from october on cant even be ordered until january we allocate our budget to make sure we can purchase new materials and by that late in the year everything else is gone
books,not_removed,librarians are awesomes the uk is slowly losing them cuts cuts and more cuts however what a lot of people dont know the backbone of our modern library service was based on donations by wealthy philanthropists carnegie being one of the most famous wealthy s these days have no public spirit
books,not_removed,good luck pulling number at my branch which is one of across the state people try it often and it never works the line is the line deal with it
books,not_removed,but wait just turn off the devices wifi your book wont disappear on you if you can reset the date on your device this may work as well isnt it possible to find where the file is stored and just copy it
books,not_removed,great tips thank you
books,not_removed,i dont understand why a person would do any of these instead of shelling out big bucks nine dollars usually to amazon for an electronic copy of a book
books,not_removed,whats a library
books,not_removed,i used my high school library so much that the librarians would ask me for requests when they made their purchase orders it was a really nice thing
books,not_removed,yeah number one wouldnt work for me id be back of the line and my library actually has something where you cant return a book and check it out straight away for like hours and i think its cause people used to do this it also annoys me if people would do this if im next in line you had plenty of time give someone else a chance
books,not_removed,this doesnt work everywhere in fact it doesnt work in the three largest counties in my state probably because they are large the larger the librarysystem the more chance that theres a local hold ahead of yours i think its likely selfish to try and get the book again instead of letting others borrow it yes and no if its a very popular book and youre going to take another two weeks to read it thats probably immoral but if its not a popular book or youre one chapter away from finishing i say go for it you are basically just saving the library the cost of delivering the book to you another time ebooks that are basically the same as real books aka they can only check out a limited number of copies at a time this means that while this exploit may work for you it could potentially keep others from getting their chance to read the book not in the overdrive system which i believe is one of if not the biggest provider in overdrive the ebook is returned on the due date regardless of what happens on your device its your device that gets tricked or rather not told to delete the ebook when you turn off its wifi so no worries there no one will be deprived of the ebook because you kept it
books,not_removed,it doesnt work where i live either and they dont allow renewals on books with holds at all what does work is calling up and politely explaining that you unexpectedly cant get to the library during its increasingly short opening hours until monday and you tried to renew but there are holds so would they mind manually changing the due date to then so you dont get fined thanks so much if it were just a day or two you wouldnt mind but the fine over a week really adds up fwiw if it is just a day or two i just pay up on the fine its like and if i finish it sooner than monday then so much the better
books,not_removed,as far as the ebook thing it should still work ive done this before the ebook copylicense is returned to the library the day its due and somebody else checks it out the book is removed from your account and you cant open it on new devices or redownload it but a kindle thats not linked to wifi doesnt automatically update its library so its unaware that you no longer have the book it shouldnt affect the library at all thats the beauty of ebooks its licenses they have a limit of not copies its digital content after all
books,not_removed,im curious why would there be constrictions on ebooks the only thing i can figure is that by creating a scarcity people would be encouraged to buy the book instead of waiting
books,not_removed,thats what i do i have about books on my kindle that i got through my library
books,not_removed,the whole concept of ebook loans is so laughably nonsensical that theres pretty much no reason not to
books,not_removed,i do it all the time if you have a dedicated ereader that you dont need the wifi for like you just use it for reading and not for internetting the book will just disappear when you reconnect it to wifi no fines
books,not_removed,yup at least on all overdrive systems
books,not_removed,i have also never heard of a library system having a policy about putting local holds in priority over system wide holds that seems incredibly unfair to me right because youve been waiting on hold for weeks to get this book and youre next on the list then the due dates change and youre still waiting
books,not_removed,mine has a notary theyve notarized all sorts of documents for me for free this has saved me tons of timemoney because my library is closer than the kinkos that has the service
books,not_removed,i assume that you are not a librarian in an english speaking country based on your edit i wonder if its a cultural difference some cultures look at certain actions as egotistic while others look at them as practical bartering is a great example in some cultures expected in others rude as an aside google chrome normally puts lines under misspelled words with the proper setup its the only way my posts dont contain misspelled words and it helps me
books,not_removed,really i have the paperwhite and that still works for me when did it change for you
books,not_removed,it still works for me i do that all the time
books,not_removed,i used to use that trick that sucks it doesnt work anymore
books,not_removed,works for me on overdrive and kindle in androidland
books,not_removed,what kindle do you have
books,not_removed,hey thats great good luck learning japanese
books,not_removed,yeah i agree if you cant finish it in time just buy the book i guess dont keep other people who have it on hold from reading it
books,not_removed,what state are you in only branches of libraries
books,not_removed,some people dont have the extra money some people want to save that money some people read a lot and bucks twice a week really adds up some people dont like ereaders some people like supporting their local libraries just a few possible reasons
books,not_removed,that seems like a good system to me ill admit ive done this before but only when there were no holds and multiple free copies and i certainly wouldnt feel cheated if i had been disallowed playing that game with a popular book seems wrong to me
books,not_removed,this is true in my system as well the blingybeep will surely be to fill a hold for someone else before you for anything popular also if you try this at the wrong time of day your hold for that same title could be filled by a librarian in the system who is working on a paging list and be marked in transit in the system which means the hold is technically filled so the copy you bring in wont override that iethe copy you just handed in wont trigger your hold and if that book in your hand is from a different library than the one youre returning too its highly likely its being sent back to the owning library or you the patron can call them to make the decision about their material this is very common in libraries that are part of a network
books,not_removed,my library is the same way get a family member or a friend you can trust to help you hack this my dad kept checking out a certain few books by taking me to the library with him and when whichever of us wasnt the one returning the item would say if there are no holds on that id love to check it out worked like a charm for over a year
books,not_removed,but if its not a popular book or youre one chapter away from finishing i say go for it you are basically just saving the library the cost of delivering the book to you another time im perfectly willing to concede this in fact i tried to do that in my original post i just know that near me there are a lot of books that are practically impossible to borrow years long lists necessary so i am fairly sensitive to attempts to keep the book after multiple renewals in overdrive the ebook is returned on the due date regardless of what happens on your device huh i didnt know this thanks for the new info i have never concerned myself to much with elending because i dont like ereaders and avoid them like the plague
books,not_removed,additionally with overdrive if the datetime on your device dont match the datetime on the servers most likely theirs then you will be locked out of all your ebooks we get people calling us quite regularly because theyve changed those settings and suddenly cant read anything theyve borrowed
books,not_removed,our late fees are cents a day with a max fine of i guess this isnt typical edit apologies those were prices the current rate is cents per day with a max fine of
books,not_removed,exactly
books,not_removed,yeah all the librarians ive met are really cool about late stuff and helping you from getting fined
books,not_removed,thank you for being this kind of patron sincerely
books,not_removed,i believe its a compromise with the publishers the publishers dont want them just buying a single ebooks and replacing a bunch of physical books but i know some libraries have different licenses my academic library had no limit on the number of ebooks
books,not_removed,licensing you can read a ton here or just google it youll find lots of articles written about the issue its frustrating for patrons because they dont realize its the publishers that are jerks most services like overdrive have nonconcurrent copies so only one person can use a license at a time hoopla on the other hand has concurrent use of their digital audiobooks no ebooks on that platform though ebooks are very expensive upfront but then see a lower costperuse if its a popular title waiting stinks and i hope the publishers will become less greedy over time
books,not_removed,you know you can just pirate them if youre not going to obtain them legally right
books,not_removed,my primary reason was so i could read it on multiple devices heck usually if i want to support the author ill buy the ebook via google and dedrm it so i can read it without red tape
books,not_removed,unfortunately i usually use my kindle as a tablet too ill probably still use this trick at some point but so far its never come to that
books,not_removed,exactly i could see it being reasonable in a consortium system where your service area spans a significantly large area im talking a good chunk of an entire state maybe then you create some scheme where geography is a factor but for your average system thats serving a county or a municipality nope nope nope one list to serve them all
books,not_removed,that too even when they charge some nominal fee at least you know that fee is going towards some common good ie keeping a public library open
books,not_removed,if born and raised americans dont see this as selfish its on us
books,not_removed,fullblown american here on ops list is selfish the library system near me allows a very generous weeks with renewals on most books thats weeks just over months to read a book its one thing if its a huge book that nobody else is requesting but otherwise thats really selfish a library is for loaning books not so one person can monopolize one book so nobody else can take it out my local library will eventually not allow you to get that book out anymore and will tell you that you need to buy yourself a copy
books,not_removed,kindle fire hd gen
books,not_removed,some people read a lot and bucks twice a week really adds up this one would not seem to apply since libraries typically lend for two or three weeks if youre reading a book or two a week it should be very rare that you have a situation where you cant finish one before it is due on those rare occasions perhaps you should shell out the ¬¢ to for a day or two of late fees if your library doesnt have a grace period
books,not_removed,yeah i tried it once and they had to override the system to let me get it out with a popular book no chance youre put in back of the queue and they wont put you ahead for any reason
books,not_removed,what titles have you seen with year wait times
books,not_removed,thats pretty atypical in my experience yeah one of my local libraries has late fees of a day with no max fine as far as i can tell
books,not_removed,ours are ¬¢ a day with a max fine of i think dvds might be different
books,not_removed,that was my library late fee in my hometown now does and for dvds and i live in nyc which does for books for dvds
books,not_removed,you probably are dealing with circulation staff most of whom usually arent professional librarians but they are super important to keeping things running around here
books,not_removed,hoopla has a great selection of graphic novels i really love it though seven titles a month is limiting patience is worth it though
books,not_removed,meh i like getting them straight from amazons servers because i know theyll look right on my kindle and the formatting hasnt been mangled by starting as an epub thats been converted to mobi then pdf then back to epub and finally an azw also theyll be up to date with any corrections and i dont have to use any sketchy websites to find them all and all its just more convenient
books,not_removed,i was born and raised american albeit many years ago and i see most of the ops suggestions as being very selfish i tend to be a very slow reader so i dont use my local library much since i know that ill have to be renewing books at least once to finish them if it is an older or less popular book that doesnt have a waiting list ill go for it but otherwise ill buy my own copy
books,not_removed,american culture is a mixed bag of nuts im a merican that sees as not being selfish in certain cases either way im not one to judge the biggest reason is some libraries give two weeks without renewal for popular books many people cant guarantee the time to read page books in two weeks america isnt the best place for generalizations as libraries are decentralized and cultures change from town to town in some areas
books,not_removed,it was in response to someone suggesting buying every book
books,not_removed,my local library has a few new york times best seller list books with hold lists that just wont die down they have multiple copies of popular books like this and a few of each get put on what they call the lucky day shelf meaning they wont be used to fill holds and patrons who want to cut their wait can check one out if they happen upon it
books,not_removed,my library has at least a few titles a year that get ridiculous hold lists usually a title has a large hold list off the bat and then keeps getting discussed for awards through the year and the holds keep coming goldfinch was one all the light was the most recent i remember also atul gawandes last one
books,not_removed,ive seen quite a few i cant remember a ton now because i never read a lot of them but its particularly bad with ya fiction or any book that is fairly popular for example davinci code in probably wouldve had a year or more wait we dont generally have more than five or six copies of even exceedingly popular books we have checkout periods of four weeks and its not even remotely rare to find books with holds sometimes even more it got so bad that i started buying most of the books i want to read the ya fiction is particularly bad because i would age out of books by the time i could get them for example i finally got to the top of the list for one of the percy jackson books junior year of high school after requesting it in middle school i had forgotten id even placed the hold
books,not_removed,¬¢ a day for regular media books cds dvds here more for some specialty items seven day grace period though
books,not_removed,were exactly the same with dvds being
books,not_removed,yesssss love it sadly they are pay per use which is why it libraries usually have to limit use
books,not_removed,perhaps you are right the way i read it he was suggesting buying a book when you are not able to finish a library copy in the normal checkout period rather than resorting to one of the suggestions for keeping it longer when the rules prevent you from just renewing
books,not_removed,my library implemented a lucky day shelf too was nice to find a little gem once in a while and encourages people to actually walk into our facilities
books,not_removed,the lucky day shelf is such a good idea i know in certain branches of the nypl they have a libraryuse only copy so if youre determined enough you can visit the branch and read that copy
books,not_removed,most libraries will have a hold ratio meaning that they try to have copy of the book per certain number of holds depends on the system and their budget and type of material what the ratio will be this helps to try to get the book in the hands of our customers faster ymmv
books,not_removed,shouldnt your acquisitions department have some kind of metric to address that though we have an automatic system in place that generates requests to purchase additional copies of books with seven or more outstanding holds per copy the only time we see waitlists of a year or more are with dvds which we have no such policy for
books,not_removed,yes i feel like we definitely have more patrons and i think peoples moods have improved too even if it isnt actually their lucky day
books,not_removed,yep i work in a large network and we routinely have hundreds of copies of a title that unfortunately all get weeded shortly after and for those titles we still had a hold list for over a year
books,not_removed,some smaller libraries dont have those sorts of resources and getting more than a few copies of a book that wont matter once that hold list is exhausted doesnt make a lot of sense
books,not_removed,i dont know if they have a metric of some kind but if they do its apparently got a very high threshold
books,not_removed,but my library isnt small its in one of the largest counties in my state and its in a major metro area my girlfriend lives in the next largest county with less funding for their libraries and they purchase many more materials and i understand that they cant go crazy with acquisitions but multiyear hold lists are a problem it basically makes the library useless for popular material its one thing to wait a few months but a year or more thats too much if you want people to use your service
books,not_removed,if you are looking for some inspiration take a look at what we published in
books,not_removed,the girl on the train is a great book with a similar vibe and the film is in production right now for release october this year so may be worth reading soon
books,not_removed,try asking in the weekly recommendation thread or in rsuggestmeabook
books,not_removed,its in postproduction
books,not_removed,to be completely honest my definition of in production ranges from writing the script to it literally coming out tomorrow i dont keep myself knowledged on the actual terms thanks though
books,not_removed,thats okay im happy to enlighten
books,not_removed,see also posted a few minutes before this post
books,not_removed,oh shit i didnt mean to repost my bad
books,not_removed,stop this disinformation at the same time that all traditional print sales were up online traditional that is not selfpublished print book sales were also up in fact amazon traditional print book sales grew by which outpaced all brick and mortar stores furthermore all both selfpublished and traditional ebooks grew by on amazon it was only traditional ebooks that shrank finally online book sales accounted for of all book sales in
books,not_removed,i still get ebooks because its hard to travel with heavy books like mein kampf
books,not_removed,ebooks suck
books,not_removed,oh man are we at a point now where traditional ebooks are a thing compared to something else newer
books,not_removed,it sounds like youve got an agenda
books,not_removed,enjoy your downvotes this sub doesnt like real books
books,not_removed,i have read all the books the english books are sperated in books in german in about weeks and reall enjoyed them a year later i binge watched all available seasons in my opinion its the better order
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests including asking if you should read a certain book in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,sure you can should you no not at all those titles are not age appropriate
books,not_removed,you can but you may as well hit em with it and at least in the case of moby dick thats gonna be a damn good thrashing but probably still less damaging than reading it i can only talk about moby dick and leagues but they are youth books at best i think at that age i was pretty crazy about the very hungry caterpillar i hear dr seuss is also very popular at that age and does count as a classic it does help to look for quotes or samples from the books in question towards thee i roll thou alldestroying but unconquering whale to the last i grapple with thee from hells heart i stab at thee for hates sake i spit my last breath at thee sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool and since neither can be mine let me then tow to pieces while still chasing thee though tied to thee thou damned whale
books,not_removed,if you would like to read classics to young children i highly recommend httpswwwgoodreadscomgenresgreatillustratedclassics i personally read some of these books when i was or and i read the jungle book treasure island robinson crusoe robin hood and a christmas carol you can even buy them on kindle these are classics made for young children to read the actual unabridged mody dick is not really a childrens read i have not read it but a huge chunk of it is mostly about whaling they do have editions for the three books you have already bought
books,not_removed,im pretty sure i just saw something about a recent scientific study showing it doesnt freaking matter what you read to your kids when theyre that young as long as its not scary or obscene the point is youre taking time to focus on them and exposing them to language they wouldnt normally hear sure start with any seuss or where the sidewalk ends but follow that up with gilgamesh the hero or hitch hikers guide to the galaxy
books,not_removed,at that age they probably wont care what the words are saying
books,not_removed,if you want to them to go to sleep but they may get restless and give you attitudethese are not for children they have always been for adults
books,not_removed,httpwwwmycozyclassicscombooks or httpsbabylitcomcollectionsbooksclassiclit only theres lots of classic childrens books that are wonderful introductions to reading brown bear brown bear curious george goodnight moon alexander and the terrible horrible no good very bad day madeline caps for sale dr seuss anything theres no way a threeyearold will have the vocabulary or attention span to enjoy the original versions let alone three of them at once i second usubtleobserver with recommending the great illustrated classics when the children can read it on their own
books,not_removed,thank you everyone for your comments i will just hide the books and give it to them at the right time by the way the books are great illustrated classics they were in french though so i a cannot understand a word
books,not_removed,i was a preschool teacher for year olds i used to read chapter books to them but i would not read md or might work for a yo but a lot of it would go over their heads get the original not disneyfied versions of the winnie the pooh books and the wind in the willows the use of language is delightful and the characters and their travails are identifiable for a young child the hobbit was intended for children and is a good choice too there are so many wonderful longer picture books to choose from as well with well developed characters and plots
books,not_removed,but you must read treasure island like a pirate its a law

books,not_removed,i had some version of these that were small square books i cannot remember the publisher etc they were thick little squares and every other page was a picture black and white showing the action to this day for some of the classics this isnmy only exposure p
books,not_removed,in my experience recent fantasy epics have shied away from that sort of totalitarian evil as protagonist gentlemen bastards kingkiller chronicles the first law have all broken with that concept pretty starkly
books,not_removed,as others have mentioned the genre has been moving away from that for the last years or more to the point that the exceptions are in no way the minority
books,not_removed,in the beginning there was nothing then the lord spoke and it was the lord of the rings separating light from dark now several decades on fantasy has started to move beyond that the first book in the witcher series havent read beyond it yet is definitely a man vs nature story goodevil works best in man vs man conflicts although man vs society can pull it off well as well man vs nature andor self get too grey however fantasy novels work best with man vs man conflicts if you highlight society as your antagonistic force youre ignoring all the potential fantasy has to be uniqueafter all societies tend to be pretty similar in many regards if you make the conflict man vs self thats an internal conflict entirely so again you miss opportunity man vs nature has the chance to veer too far into the realm of imagination becoming no longer accessible to most audiences whos willing to sit through chapters about inane fantastical trivia if anyone were then people wouldnt complain about moby dicks consistent whaling tidbits pretty fantastical although definitely about real things not right but based on real things and readership of the silmarillion would be far higher than it is so man vs man gives you the opportunity to differentiate from nonfantasy but keeps the story relatable
books,not_removed,warhammer and warhammer are the exact opposite every faction believes they are fighting for the greater good and there is a shit load of grey area in warhammer the space marines super mutant humans basically serve the emperor who basically just sacrifices millions of souls every day to remain immortal edit misspelled words
books,not_removed,with all due respect i think you are oversimplifying i am an avid reader of the fantasy genre and while yes there are many booksseries that follow that particular template there are also an equal amount that are complex original and do not
books,not_removed,i actually think there is a decent amount of fantasy out there that at least attempts to give insight into why the villain is the way they are once you understand the story behind an evil character its a lot easier to empathize with him s jaime lannister also if your looking for a decent fantasy series with a lot of moral gray area check out the godless world trilogy by brian ruckley
books,not_removed,the big bad is the most effective way to provide a single unified evil which is so lacking in reality its like a balm for realworld frustrations corruption and petty evil is so rampant and diffuse today
books,not_removed,a lot of people are pointing to recent changes in fantay that have reduced the amount of pure evil bad guys id like to throw in that while lord of the rings and books heavily inspired by it attract a great amount of attention they have in fact never been the majority of fantasy works just picking works from before fantasy without irredemably dark big bads include the last unicorn by peter s beagle earthsea series by ursula k le guin the chronicles of amber by roger zelazny the mists of avalon by marion zimmer bradley discworld series by terry pratchett book of the new sun by gene wolfe dragonriders of pern series by anne mccaffery the once and future king by t h white watership down by richard adams the princess bride by william goldman others like the conan or elric stories you can debate i think the protagonists of these stories are presented in a morally ambiguous enough light that i wouldnt call them good vs evil but again its arguable the good vs evil style of fantasy has always been one subgenre albeit one with enormous popular success it is not now and likely never has been the overwhelming majority of fantasy made
books,not_removed,its made fun of early on in piers anthonys xanth series theres an exiled person thats basically a bogeyman but in reality he just disagreed with the establishment over the nature of migration and magical power the main protagonist of that story was also exiled met this guy and ended up helping him come back to xanth where he managed to take over and actually improve the place mind you anthony jumped the shark and xanth as a series went downhill
books,not_removed,thats only at the shallow end of fantasy the multivolume epic cash in craze if you look at something like the mabinogion the broken sword earthsea conan fafhrd and the gray mouser etc you find all kinds of things
books,not_removed,the stormlight archives doesnt have an ultimate evil at least not yet there was at least a bit of nuance with the opposing force in words of radiance the morality of the overarching power is ambiguous at this point
books,not_removed,deleted
books,not_removed,some people have stated that the genre as a whole has moved away from this trope but honestly i feel that its still alive and well theres almost always if not a singular ultimate evil then some kind of extradimensional race of cthulus trying to get in and wipe everything out dresden files monster hunter int averted in first law or the sort of regular level bad guy who makes a reasonably believable character goes for the threat of worldreality destruction if he doesnt get what he wants red rising way too many japanese manga its like authors feel they need to raise the stakes of an already interestingmeaningful conflict by throwing in by the way if the heroes fail reality shatters and time stops
books,not_removed,if you want a very interesting take on what exactly is good and evil in a fantasy world read the prince of thorns trilogy
books,not_removed,the best fiction regardless of genre is the kind that doesnt have polar good vs polar evil because thats not how life is everybodys a little of both everything is a bit complex i prefer authors who are able to create realistic characters in realistic situations there can still be a lot of tension and suspense it doesnt need to always be save the universe from total annihilation by the blackclad laughing bad guy
books,not_removed,while its not a book i find i am reminded of ultima iv quest of the avatar no foozle your task was to model and understand goodness culminating in bringing together a codex where underlying values of its facets were made clear
books,not_removed,in the id have agreed ultimate evils all over the place back then nowadays though im just not seeing it fantasys worked really hard as a genre to get away from that whole concept sure it still exists but looking at my shelf im hardpressed to find more than a handful of evil for evils sake force of darkness bad guys
books,not_removed,even lotr has shades of grey hobbits are painted as the good and sauron is the evil but in between there is a little bit of everything are elves good or bad are all the elves all good or all bad or are there some elf groups that are better or worse than their cousins which humans are good how about dwarves are orcs evil or is it that they are stripped of their will to do good
books,not_removed,of course there are exceptions but those are in the minority what do you guys think honestly in the last years your complaint is the minority too much modern fantasy is grey with every major character being a terribly flawed individual you can barely relate to let alone root for also id say many people read fantasy because they want such clear lines its a refreshing change from real life i like a mix some clearly bad some clearly good and a bunch in the middle
books,not_removed,have you ever looked at a song of ice and fire martin deliberately goes so far in the other direction specifically so that there arent good guys and bad guys for me i personally find it impossible to get very emotionally invested in any of the characters because of it but it may be just what youre looking for if the show hasnt spoiled it for you already that is also you might check out brent weeks night angel series
books,not_removed,i think its because the genre generally taps into mythical archetypes which are also found in religions the heros journey as it were marks an individuals prevailing against an opponent to find the ultimate good
books,not_removed,every villain in discworld you can empathise with they have a good reason for whatever theyre doing maybe it hurts people usually they have another reason causing them to be villainous in monstrous regiment technically fantasy with trolls and vampires its just a war between petty nations the villains being more or less like us i think in neil gaimens fantasy also the case
books,not_removed,theres a whole new wave of fantasy called grimdark that is all about gray morality try authors like abercrombie or mark lawrence and many many others
books,not_removed,i think its funny that you mention lotr and wot as the two examples because i have a theory that theyre actually the same world in different ages and that the dark one is actually melkormorgoth this aside i think its worth noting that for wot while the do is the principle villainantagonist and rand makes it clear from book that he has no hesitation about killing him theyre arent thousands of pages written about this conflict it instead focuses on the myriad of evils men cook up themselves the more we get to know the forsaken the more were made aware that theyre not gods but very petty people with hang ups jealousy envy pride ambition greed sadism etc who just happen to also have incredible powers my point being the book is still very full of grey and covers far more than just good vs evil it starts out that way but few books in it becomes a whole lot more complex
books,not_removed,i agree with you totally on the first law its my favorite aspect of the series however kingkiller clearly has an ultimate evil in the works actively trying to wipe outsubjugate life also i have a strong suspicion that thats where mr bad mage in gb is heading hes going to crock up some kind of world destruction spell edit when i mentioned kingkiller i was thinking of a somewhat different series followup point though way too many series try to up the stakes of a conflict to make it more dramatic or get the reader to care about the outcome for some reason otherwise well written series often stray into the if the bad guy wins time stops and reality breaks so that youre forced to root for the protagonist so that even if the antagonist isnt evil hes effectively so misguided that hes totally in the wrong
books,not_removed,youve named some exceptions yes however i disagree a little bit about the first law by the end it becomes pretty clear that the ultimate evil is s even if theres misdirection the overall message of the story though that all the fighting was pointless is new and refreshing though
books,not_removed,edward w robertsons cycle of arawn books toe the line on this really well magic of a strength to end the world is encountered but not in the hands of a strict or allpowerful antagonist and even then only briefly and the vast majority of the series antagonists are human or at least quite mortal
books,not_removed,can you list some nonpopular examples im curious because with a few exceptions even most moral gray kind of stories devolve down to fighting some sort of ultimate evil somewhere down the line
books,not_removed,so while i agree that antagonists are increasingly of a somewhat grey nature the stakes of conflict tend to be raised ever higher in modern fantasy so that the existence of reality is at stake even though the antagonist might not be strictly evil theres no room to support him because if he gets his way he abuses the power cosmic insert mystical boondoggle until the universe shuts down
books,not_removed,sapkowski has an amazing amazing magazine article that among other things talks about fantasy archetypes also its pretty much the snarkiest thing ive ever read its called pir√≥g albo nie ma z≈Çota w szarych g√≥rach and for some unknown reason its still havent been translated to english i was lucky that theres a russian translation
books,not_removed,eh id say there are still plenty of modern series that rely on this traitor son series for instance fantastic books but still have world eating antagonist
books,not_removed,and the emperor of mankinds antagonists chaos gods and daemons of the warp which are exactly the type of generic fantasy evil described
books,not_removed,just because the protagonists arent good doesnt mean the antagonists arent pure evil chaos gods ctan or at least effectively evil urge to dominate andor kill all other life plenty of fantasy series use morally gray protagonists to combat ultimate evils
books,not_removed,just because there are exceptions doesnt mean this trope isnt overused in the genre as a whole i will note for you though that many modern fantasies start out original however novels in everything coalesces into fighting some sort of ultimate evil as a way to end the series
books,not_removed,which was precisely tolkiens motivation in creating arda he was under no illusion that the blackandwhite morality that existed in his stories held in the real world what he was doing was consciously creating a reality that was more how we feel things should be than how things are
books,not_removed,really hoped somebody would mention the book of the new sun though i suppose the twin antagonists of entropy and human nature sort of meet his definition
books,not_removed,the first ten books or so are good stuff particularly for young readers and a lot of his other earlier works are impressively original he actually in a way has the opposite problem from what the op was talking about with most characters being a unrealistically friendly and reasonable
books,not_removed,mind you anthony jumped the shark and xanth as a series went downhill i took the whole concept of xanth as a shark jumping a shark through shark infested waters
books,not_removed,really i love sanderson but s odium the manifestation of divine hatred does not scream ultimate evil to you
books,not_removed,um there is a s dark god taking control named odium i dont know what about that doesnt scream ultimate evil he is literally named s odium
books,not_removed,dont forget harry potter voldemort being the incarnation of wrong corruption murder and evil in the world
books,not_removed,i could name tons of nonclones that also follow the above pattern abhorsen series all the antagonists are evil undead who hate the living because theyre undead percy jackson most of the antagonists are just evil gods evil titans etc harry potter even if there is a backstory and there are reasons voldemort functions as nothing more than ultimate evil even todays popular moral grays occasionally has this element a game of thrones breaks the mold for the most part but still its quite obvious the white walkers are going to be the ultimate mindless evil that everyone has unite against
books,not_removed,have you ever looked at a song of ice and fire martin deliberately goes so far in the other direction specifically so that there arent good guys and bad guys in asoiaf it mostly just seems like there are no good guys everyone is varying shades of awful
books,not_removed,i agree with most of got however its quite obvious the white walkers are going to eventually pull the story into fighting the ultimate evil direction
books,not_removed,honestly i think the idea that asoiaf shuns good vs evil is kinda just a meme we perpetuate without any basis in fact rob and stannis are the only real tragic heroes in the bunch but theyre both out of the game early on rob bought it outright and no one really thought stannis had a shot after the blackwater after book we were left with basically just purely good and evil characters with token levels of relatability for the villains and minor stints holding the idiotball for the heroes it just seems like we hold them up as paragons of moral and literary complexity when they really arent a lot of the fan favourite characters are really onenote varys and littlefinger are just plot advancement machines without any significant arc whatsoever its been painfully obvious that dany is endgame since the second book and exactly noone believed jon was dead oberyns death was kind of obvious if tyrion had been acquitted the plot would have just kind of stopped in fact if you think about it martin hasnt really offed a main hero since the red wedding hes seriously losing credibility one the no one is safe front and the others are a pretty blatant pure evil big bad yeah the night king might have some motivation that makes him the hero of another story but this late in the game thats just waving your hands and going ooooooooo look how gray everything is full disclosure i really dont like the books very much but i also dont think you need moral complexity for the story to be good see lotr
books,not_removed,an ultracampy everyones a douchebag because i just wanted to be different and special by subverting the trope in this ohsosuperior manner is not exactly selling the book to me i would liken it to changing a classic recipe by radically altering the ingredient list even though you know that the food critic is coming specifically to have the regular because its his favorite
books,not_removed,robert jordan started wot writing the eye of the world purposefully as an homage to lord of the rings
books,not_removed,while i agree that the forsaken are people with backstories and imperfections theres the still the aspect of their morality ive read the entire series and i dont think ive ever thought once that hey the main cast shouldnt be fighting the forsworn or theyre actually morally gray and are somewhat creatures of circumstance the morality of the forsworn were really never in question as a reader or as a character in the series one never really questions or has to think about fighting them because despite all their complexities they still fit quite neatly under the label evil
books,not_removed,the events of lotr and wot both take place in the third age of their respective worlds though i suppose its possible they just lost count p
books,not_removed,first of all prove to me that the chandrian are an ultimate evil rather then second the most important antagonist in the king killer chronicles so far has been ambrose who is rich but not an ultimate evil force
books,not_removed,eh bayaz isnt really ultimate evil material hes selfish and arrogant in the extreme but none of his motivations really fall outside the bounds of regular human stuff he wants power and control but hes only cruel and violent to the extent that he thinks will further his own goals hes interested in preserving stability and civilization and promoting commerce and doesnt kill people unless they actively oppose his plans hes more of a total dick than an ultimate evil
books,not_removed,i disagree s bayaz is a complete shit but hes definitely not evil hes machiavellian to the extreme and a complete megalomaniac but at the end of the day the union and all of its relative successes compared to the shit show that other nations are in the series are owed to bayaz
books,not_removed,bayaz is too much of a dues ex machina to be the ultimate evil though hes like gandalf but not benevolent
books,not_removed,sure these are all series as song of ice and fire by george rr martin although i guess this counts as popular the malazan book of the fallen by steven erikson the chronicles of the black company by glen cook the broken empire by mark lawrence ursula k leguins earthsea books the first law trilogy by joe abercrombie a land fit for heroes by richard k morgan
books,not_removed,i would also add basically all of guy gavriel kays novels maybe his first book trilogy as an exception because it was his take on tolkiens style all of his novels are essentially stand alone and have very morally grey plots and characters
books,not_removed,i saw the black company by glen cook listed id also recommend the garret novels by glen cook the first of which is sweet silver blues
books,not_removed,if actually say fantasy doesnt become magical realism magical realism itself has always been fantasy its just it doesnt fall under the term the same way that epics or high fantasies do
books,not_removed,link to the russian i need the practice
books,not_removed,and slaver star gods which trap souls in living metal bit were overthrown and a swarm of alien locusts and numberless violent warmongering thugs and backstabbing jackasses bent on making their own god and some space commies too i guess is unique in that every faction is the ultimate evil to every other faction and thats ignoring the fact that of the conflict is that the right hand vs left hand of the totalitarian theocratic bureaucracy causing itself
books,not_removed,its everyone vs everyone in that universe aliens ratmen you can read books from every faction as well so chaos vs eldar etc
books,not_removed,when every faction is hellbent on conquering the universe and destroying every other faction its hardly the norm i think youre right though theyre all generic factions weve seen in other stories one way or another but since everyone is somewhat evil or pragmatic enough to toss aside their sanity and morality for the sake of survival it doesnt feel youre a generic story about heroes saving the world from the ultimate evil there are no heroes and evil fights evil as much as it fights the less evil factions
books,not_removed,a justification for action you can wholeheartedly grab your weapons in the face of such evil i think you are right too fantasy is about potential
books,not_removed,didnt start out that way two things led to it first his obsession with sex started interfering with the rest of the content of the work and second he increasingly turned to readersubmitted content essentially making madlibs out of the books i read the first xanth books in a matter of weeks ran out of books when i came back to read cube route ha ha i couldnt stomach it tried reading bio of a space tyrant but the initial rapescene put me off read mute found it readable but the protagonists behavior from essentially having what amounted to a ring of gyges for a mutation superpower and his subsequent sexploits was a bit of a turnoff i suppose the writing is a bit more honest in that a lot of people probably would unashamedly do what he did if they would immediately be forgotten but oh well his later aprentice adept series headed down this rabbithole and so did the dooon books never read pornucopia ive heard it has some rather disturbing content as well
books,not_removed,maybe my memory isnt very good what main bad guy oh maybe the guy who owned szeth the link didnt take me anywhere
books,not_removed,re abhorsen and hp i think its pretty notable that in both cases the villain is characterized by a destructive inability to cope with mortality and the plot requires the protagonist to succeed where the villain failed i think in that lens the villain represents a sort of immaturity to be overcome rather than a person which makes sense given the target age group
books,not_removed,deleted
books,not_removed,martin has explicitly said that he dislikes the ultimate evil trope and that the others have motivations beyond just mindless destruction in fact a big chunk of the fanbase subscribes to theories where they are actually retaliating against human imperialism or are outright benevolent personally i think that takes things a bit far notevil isnt the same thing as good
books,not_removed,voldemort functions as nothing more than ultimate evil hes a case study on people who have power and want more less a symbol of evil than politician who happens to have the ability to warp reality
books,not_removed,well he is mostly writing about humans so
books,not_removed,thats assuming he doesnt give the night king a relatable motivation
books,not_removed,assuming george ever gets to that point before he pulls a robert jordan i dont know if id call them an ultimate evil though just a supernatural evil
books,not_removed,got into an argument with someone on today who actually wants this to happen boring
books,not_removed,honestly i think the idea that asoiaf shuns good vs evil is kinda just a meme we perpetuate without any basis in fact maybe so but its from grrms own words from the talk he gave during his feast for crows signing tour he went on at some length about it when he wasnt griping about copyrights and wells great grandkids not getting any money from the war of the worlds movie that had just been released at the time
books,not_removed,varys and littlefinger are just plot advancement machines yep side players so why do you mention them its been painfully obvious that dany is endgame since the second book invade and take back her kingdom with dragons yeah thats what she wants but how will it turn out oberyns death was kind of obvious if tyrion had been acquitted the plot would have just kind of stopped i disagree completely acquitted and innocent are independent concepts and thats clearly part of the feel of asoiaf might have taken a few weeks of treating him like shit before he snapped and did the same thing or simply left before snapping thats all before you realize that tyrions plotline is just one piece of the story and not required anyway he could have been killed and wed still have books to read though that would suck i love his character
books,not_removed,right that factors into my theory but my theory is more that they are actually the same world in different ages so sauron and morgoth are principle antagonists in both series but with different names
books,not_removed,i realize now i shouldnt have used the forsaken as an example but rather the myriad of non darkfriend villains in the novels
books,not_removed,the chandrian an evil mystery group of immortal killers that kill anyone who knows about them and whose leader is a fallen hero bent on destroying the world because he cant forget his lovers sacrifice arent the main evil villains youre totally right that its spoiled rich kid and that mean ninja bitch thanks for totally demolishing uthelogicengine s point
books,not_removed,yeah bayaz is what happens when a mage lives long enough that he cant bring himself to see normal humans as real people any more and the stakes are high enough that youre never quite sure whether hes completely in the wrong
books,not_removed,i mean id consider him as evil as a person can be but this is very different that the ultimate evil that fantasy traditionally focused on either way we agree that hes still a counter example to ops post
books,not_removed,dues ex machina how is he a dues ex machina
books,not_removed,ublizzgrarg dont start reading this list with malazan book of the fallen because if you do everything afterward will be like ashes in your mouth
books,not_removed,sooogonna have to disagree with some of this list just because the protagonist is grey morally doesnt mean the antagonist isnt evil for black company the dominator is basically the definition of ultimate evil in the broken empire the dead king fills that pretty well subverted a bit at the end and also strays into the reality breaks if the hero doesnt win trope which i really hate got obviously has the white walkers who exist to wipe out humanity also i would add the witcher onto this while immensely popular video games not that many people have read the books especially those that only have fan translations
books,not_removed,it is
books,not_removed,the taus are bros tho
books,not_removed,ok to be honest i grew out of them long before you did i might have read through but the whole point of xanth was the sheer absurdity the sharks were doing kick lines pretty much from the get go adept and space tyrant seemed like adolescent escapism for the most part and fun when they werent trying to be edgy in the way teenagers like to think theyre edgy tarot is similarly deep though it does raise some interesting things to think about if youre the target age group and havent been exposed to much outside your comfort zone i enjoyed them but theyre really targeted at people less than half my age
books,not_removed,odium the god of hate
books,not_removed,clone i have to disagree with that simplification there are no real plot similarities between lotr and hp in my mind everything is vastly different lotr is a low magic setting while hp is so high magic that nearly every character in every book has abilities lotr has a myriad of races some good and some evil hp only has humans and a few references and appearances by magical races the plots and characters themselves have no corollaries there is no hermoine granger in lotr there is no gimli in hp
books,not_removed,hp is definitively not a lotr clone not even close
books,not_removed,ive read quite a lot of ya fantasy with morally grey antagonists and main characters the young elites series which im currently reading has a main character that starts out as morally grey protagonist and progresses into a full on complex villain by the book i do tend to stay away from the extremely popular mainstream ya shit so that could be it
books,not_removed,eh i dont really think its safe to say that ya readers need easier concepts to digest they arent childrens books and even children will ask but why is that character the bad guy what made them bad and will often be dissatisfied with the answer because theyre just bad
books,not_removed,their primary motive is discussed in the latest season of got which has overtaken the novels
books,not_removed,youre a bad person
books,not_removed,i mention varys and littlefinger because theyre at the core of most of the plot moving lf basically causes the war of the five kings theyre just plot devices all the secondary characters are which is completely fine but you dont also then get to pretend that every minor character is important and fleshed out which a lot of bookfans do how will it turn out shes going to win this is the thing i was trying to highlight i completely dont believe that these books are going to subvert my expectations anymore i just flatly dont trust grrm when he says ohohoh anything can happen better watch out like the shit with aegon im sorry but grrm has too much basic competence as a storyteller to introduce the endgame winner in the third act of the story that would be fucking awful and dumb i believe that aegon is actually a targaryen or that he will win or that dany wont sit on the iron throne and im sorry but for you to convince me that anyone can die you have to actually kill main characters and have them stay dead one or two from act before we knew who the endgame cast was isnt enough but again its ok to have a story that doesnt subvert your expectations so many people mock stories for retelling classic myths but thats stupid weve been relentlessly deconstructing everything recently and i find it incredibly stale i dont care if your story follows a master plot its ok to not break peoples necks twists are not the same thing as complexity or nuance see m night shamalan and obviously i know innocence and acquittal are different things but if tyrion had won the trial his story would have stalled narratively the previous books had focused his story on tywin relentlessly pushing tyrion further and further his whole conflict is with tywin and to resolve that conflict tyrion had to be pushed farther than hed ever been pushed as soon as cercie accused him it was obvious that the trial would be the thing that sent his plot over the edge into the next part of his arc really this isnt rocket surgery and yeah everybody loves tyrion which is why hes safe at this point all the main cast who made it past affc are completely plot armored until the big finale because we now have too much plot inertia wrapped up in them to let them go thats why jons temporary corpsitude wasnt suspenseful at all without him the plot in the north is seriously hamstrung and i have to stress again that i absolutely dont mind books where i can see the end coming a mile away its the journey not the destination but can we please stop pretending that asoiaf is this amazing genredefying opus when its clearly not its an enjoyable perfectly serviceable fantasy epic and it doesnt have to change english literature forever to be that i suppose i should clarify that my disdain fore the books is mostly about grrms writing style the story is plenty interesting
books,not_removed,sorry if i wasnt clear i was referring to the theory that the chandrian while not good guys are far less sinister then they appear
books,not_removed,all we know is the chandrian kill those who know their true names we actually know nothing except heresay and conjecture about what they actually want the spread of rumor and reputation being far different then the real story is kind of a theme in the book
books,not_removed,i cant understand fantasy readers love of that series i tried really hard to get through it but had to stop at book six
books,not_removed,yea but the dominator is only the villain for like two books and in all the other the villains are all morally grey the lady soulcatcher etc
books,not_removed,got obviously has the white walkers who exist to wipe out humanity thats what humanity thinks we dont exactly get a pov character to explain their motivations perhaps humans are the original aggressors here and its just vengeance perhaps theyre on a holy quest to bestow immortality on humanity
books,not_removed,ehhhh relatively they come across as good compared to the other actions but their treatment of people who dont feel like joining the greater good and their creepy caste system is pretty brutal
books,not_removed,oh yeahforgot about him
books,not_removed,i wouldnt say no similarities it wouldnt be farfetched to consider the horcruxes similar to the one ring
books,not_removed,i thought everyone knew harry potter was based on star wars
books,not_removed,deleted
books,not_removed,how so we find out that they were created by the children to fight human encroachment but theyre clearly not operating under their original mandate and im quite skeptical that their motivations or origin in the show are representative of the books given how much else has changed
books,not_removed,which has overtaken diverged from the novels ftfy honestly despite starting as nearly a scene for scene remake i dont know anyone who thinks of them as the same thing any more
books,not_removed,oh lets be fair the guy will barely crank out book per decade entropy is not on his side here
books,not_removed,but you arent wrong op is complaining about ultimate evil antagonists and the chandrian arent the antagonist of the series at least right now theyre the inciting incident and the mcguffin yeah they get the ball rolling but its not them that spend the majority of the books preventing the protagonist from obtaining his goals
books,not_removed,i failed the first time but the second time i made my own reading order and couldnt put the series down until i finished
books,not_removed,why didnt you like it
books,not_removed,it has its highs and lows but for me its highs were mindblowing and theres also a lot of hilarious bits
books,not_removed,its like reading a textbook to me i couldnt get past the first half of book one lol
books,not_removed,didnt try hard enough trust me youre an outlier here
books,not_removed,so while i agree that humans are far from blameless in the matter it doesnt change the nature of the white walkers they were explicitly created to wipe human life from the earth thats basically the fantasy definition of ultimate evil
books,not_removed,i mean overall yeah but when you look at all the other factions theyre kittens they also allow converts unlike basically all the other factions that just want to purge everything i guess the normal eldars dont really care
books,not_removed,i honestly just dont think thats true thats the only thing that separates ya from adult i think thats one thing that doesnt separate them ya deals with some heavy topics suicide teen pregnancy depression rape shootings etc what part of that is easier to digest than adult topics i think what separates ya and adult fiction is that the protagonist is a teen they deal with teenrelated problems and maybe the book itself is shorter and filled with more dialogue than an adult fiction book i dont think it has anything to do with the complexity of the issues in the story
books,not_removed,thats what i was implying their primary motivation was destroy humans but the night king has seemed to regain sentience
books,not_removed,its okay i bet his fans are consistently mailing him salads
books,not_removed,not the person you replied to but the first book was one of my least favorite reading experiences of all time characters im given no reason to care about with objectives im given no reason to care about acting out of motivations im given no ability to understand it sounds like something dismissive or generic to say but in this case i mean it i really just didnt give a shit what was going to happen to anyone because there was such an overwhelming lack of personality random illustrative spoilers follow and the world just has such weird power jumps this tyrant is supposed to be the sort of threat that could lay waste to the world so only the lord of moonspawn could take it down but nevermind an odd plant prison that has never been brought up before brings it down also the adjunct has a demon in the bottle we didnt hear about until now that is apparently just as powerful so apparently these heroic figures arent that stand out oh also apparently the head of the assassins guild is a high mage that has no trouble tearing through multiple members of the mages council at once then the only part of the story that interested me shadowthrone amounted to exactly nothing all this build up with the rope possession and his role then the lord of moonspawn just says go home shadowthrone half way through the book and that arc is over
books,not_removed,ive only read the first book and i hated it but ill give it this krappa is a character archetype that i normally loathe but holy shit he is well written legitimately funny
books,not_removed,thats really harsh on most history text books
books,not_removed,purge the alien burn the heretic
books,not_removed,from the look of him if hes been eating them he hasnt let it cut into his caloric budget
books,not_removed,it wasnt even a crack about his weight just his age
books,not_removed,yea book isnt all that great he takes or books to really fall into the groove shadowthrone is quite an impactful piece in the end
books,not_removed,the ancientunstoppableevilturnsouttobestoppableafterall is what youd call subversion of expectations erikson does a lot of that fantasy literature in general has people conditioned to believe that the ancient evils imprisoned for millennia must be packing some serious heat erikson plays into that but makes it clear that things have changed quite a bit since said ancient evil was around and honestly your complaint seems to be mostly that you assume understanding of the malazan universe right from the getgo this is simply not the case for a new reader and indeed erikson deliberately misleads the reader on many occasions by presenting biased views via choice povs this is a common technique employed by many authors also shadowthrone is arguably the main player of the series even though he has few scenes id also like to add that there is a ton of character development but as with so much in the series you have to work for it to get it to me that makes for a more enjoyable reading experience and it certainly makes rereads that much better but i suppose a lot of people expect erikson to hold their hands even though he explicitly says in both the foreword and in interviews that he doesnt do that sort of thing i know i sound condescending but when you say shit like there was such an overwhelming lack of personality i start doubting if you actually read the same book as me
books,not_removed,i think you mean kruppe and hes alright but hes far from the best character in the series as everybody says whenever malazan in mentionned the first book was written years before the and it shows had to power through most of it book is amazeballs though id insist and read book and if you still dont like it yeah its probably not for you
books,not_removed,well come on theyd be awfully wilted by the time they get there the lettuce would resemble swamp thing
books,not_removed,yeah ive read that a lot of it is just build and its pretty clear that i havent seen the last of these characters i just spent a lot of hours reading something that i couldnt wait to see the end of im one of those have to finish a book no matter what types it didnt exactly have me rushing to grab book
books,not_removed,subversion of expectations only works if it serves a compelling narrative or feed in to something greater the primary antagonist and balance point of the entire threat being done by a deus ex machina of the highest order is just boring darth vader dying in transit to a defective transport ship would certainly subvert expectations but it would also be a completely uninteresting story people always go to you wont understand the universe at first but thats not my complaint im not losing sleep over the fact that i dont know all the gods or how warrens work i didnt like how characters motivations felt completely unbelievable to me paran seems motivated by fuck all until he finds himself angry at being a pawn of the gods we are given no explanation as to why the adjunct is so fanatically loyal to the empress later on she starts questioning the whole thing suddenly philosophizing about how horrible war is and how we should all be nicer to each other but while doing so still casually causes massive damage and completes her mission hairlock is just a crazy person tattersail goes in twenty pages from never having met the bridgeburners to suddenly wailing over how she could protect them then in an odd tangent she dies and is reincarnated i just didnt find a reason to care about any of these arbitrary feeling people or the factions they represent even the conflicts lacked enough definition to get me invested i understand that the author wants to reveal the universe gradually but why would i feel any suspense or excitement over rake fighting some giant demon if that demon was just introduced out of nowhere from a bottle in the adjuncts pocket does it represent a serious threat to rake hell if i know to be honest you do sound a bit condescending i dont care what erikson said in interviews im not saying hes a bad writer im not saying that he failed in what he set out to do im saying i didnt enjoy the book which is an opinion im allowed to have regardless of if the things i hated were intentional i dont need to understanding the universe right from the getgo but if i dont know enough to understand the stakes of the conflicts care about the characters or their factions or otherwise have any stake in what happens then why would i care about the story glad to hear that shadowthrone becomes a bigger part of the series but that doesnt do anything to help book the most interesting character with a ton of buildup for his agent just completely checked out after a brief conversation half way through the book
books,not_removed,i mean its nice that there is character development in the series but you have to put at least some of it in the first book if you want people to keep reading also when your big scenes sound like this this one dude is super powerful and badass but wait this other guy is also super duper duper powerful and badass and now they are going to fight because reasons you start to lose your audience
books,not_removed,thats a fair and valid reason excuse the minor spoiler but the characters in the first book play more of a backseat role
books,not_removed,we are given no explanation as to why the adjunct is so fanatically loyal to the empress i never got the sense that lorns loyalty was anything beyond what might be expected of someone in her position her loyalty is primarily to the empire and also in the dinner scene with dujek and co dujek says something about how in order to fulfil your role as the adjunct you have to let go of personal agendas and lorn takes this to heart tattersail goes in twenty pages from never having met the bridgeburners to suddenly wailing over how she could protect them first of all the bridgeburners are kind of a big deal everyone in the malazan army knows them by reputation at least also she is still angry at herself for not protecting the soldiers in the army after she failed to protect them in the battle and pale she doesnt want any more soldiers to die if she can help it to quote a common refrain from gardens of the moon always an even trade which basically means we will make sure no one stabs you as long as you make sure no one magicks us the most interesting character with a ton of buildup for his agent just completely checked out after a brief conversation half way through the book do cut him some slack that was a conversation with anomander rake badass extraordinaire and i realize that the series isnt for everyone personally i think its because there are so many things in it which is perfect for a literary omnivore like me but for people who really dont like certain things there is a good chance of that certain thing being in malazan and turning them off the series but i still think that character motivations are throughout the series as clear or vague as needs be and also book is by far the weakest in the series
books,not_removed,some of it is in the first book admittedly the first book is the weakest by far in the series due largely to it being written so long before the rest but there definitely is character development in the first book
books,not_removed,perhaps i should be more clear my reasoning for thinking that the adjunct was that loyal was because you would need to be to get to that position to give up your identity in the name of service i know the bridgeburners story well i dont know it i understand their importance insofar as you hear about it in the first book and ill admit that the general relationship between soldiery and mages was one of the better parts of worldbuilding tattersail just gets really emotionally involved really quickly i had similar feeling about she and parans sudden romance and i didnt mean that to be a criticism of shadowthrone abvously rakes sword is about the goddamn scariest thing in existence more a criticism of how the plot was handled than trying to call shadowthrone a pussy i might give book another shot i didnt realize until this thread that they were written year apart i want to like the series as a general rule i like difficult reading card carrying joyce reader here and i was thrilled when i learned that there was a book extremely long and detailed fantasy epic that id never touched clearly i didnt take the letdown well but i might give it another shot if only to meet the bad motherfucker that fights with two scimitars
books,not_removed,i would certainly recommend trying out book a lot of people dont really get hooked until then and it is way better than the first one some find it a little slow at the start but erikson is known for his explosive endings
books,not_removed,saw the movie before i read the book they are so different but both great in their own right the movie is slower darker and changes major parts of the story but i loved it the book really is a page turner i read it in days but i probably could have killed it in one sitting if i had the time hell of a story
books,not_removed,good movie but so many differences its tough to compare watch it in months or so when the book is not fresh in your mind
books,not_removed,theres no wolf fight so just get yourself ready for that disappointment right now
books,not_removed,film is better inarritu is a great director plus great performances by the entire cast just make it great and the bear attack wow saw it in the cinema and it was epic as was the part by the river bank i much prefer the ending in the film too the book was too anticlimactic
books,not_removed,do you think it would be better if you did it the other way round
books,not_removed,i was hoping for that as well i will say though that i preferred the movie ending compared to the book
books,not_removed,not trying to cop out but i think they are such different stories that it wouldnt really matter which one you experienced first all i can say is that i watched the movie about months before i read the book and i enjoyed both immensely
books,not_removed,i only say this because i read the martian before i watched it and i wish i had done it the other way around
books,not_removed,so did i and i dont regret it i dont know what to tell you man other than i saw the revenant before i read it and loved both i really dont think you can go wrong on this one
books,not_removed,removed we dont allow imageonly links in rbooks furthermore this list also breaks our low quality book list rule
books,not_removed,well i dont fling my food everywhere for starters ive never had an issue getting food on it
books,not_removed,you keep it off to the side and if something gets on it you clean it it is enjoyable and efficient
books,not_removed,i read whilst reading breakfast and lunch usually because its usually porridge or cereal and a sandwich however i find it more effort than its worth for dinner which requires both hands usually for the cutlery
books,not_removed,i have an origami case that i use to prop it up vertically if im not at a table i will just prop it up with my leg or hold it with a hand while i eat i dont really read while i eat though
books,not_removed,i hold it in one hand and eat with the other using a clean finger to tap the screen to turn the page now if im eating something that requires both hands and no silverware bbq ribs or something then i set my kindle aside and watch tv they are cleanable so its not a big deal
books,not_removed,i bought a waterproofed kindle and read it everywhere
books,not_removed,you dont even need to touch the screen to change page sensors are on the sides of the screen just as the lights on the paperwhite just get your finger close enough to the screen and itll switch
books,not_removed,i think youll enjoy it and also id recommend pullmans novel the good man jesus and the scoundrel christ im kind of late to it about years were you the worlds most literate yearold
books,not_removed,i think that reading it as an adult youll find things that you would have missed as a younger reader when i first read them i missed all the religious criticism about which the catholic church became so angry
books,not_removed,i enjoyed it at that age it definitely feels a bit young though youre not years late sheesh its still a fun interesting read and id recommend it
books,not_removed,i recommended this series to my mum im seventeen and she really enjoyed them we both agreed that the books were a lot better than the films
books,not_removed,years too late do you think its a book for toddlers im sure youll be fine i see it recommended to adults all the time theres nothing to lose so you might as well give it a try
books,not_removed,yeah i read it last yearage its really good
books,not_removed,i read at and it was awesome it has philosophical elements but i wouldnt read too much into it as there are massive plot holes in the trilogy massive the plot holes however are easily bridged by the beauty of pullmans story
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,i recommended them to my boyfriend when we were like and he enjoyed them more than i had when i was actually he enjoyed them so much it prompted me to read them again
books,not_removed,if you can get past the clear mockery of christianity the rushed or untouched subplots and the hax mc guffins the heroes use its ok
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,i love bm and i dont consider myself a mccarthy fanatic its his best novel for me and if theres anything i think youre missing its what a unique reading experience it is even by mccarthys standards the passages you nitpicked while id have to return to them and probably read the book again to give you a real answer its been five or six years dont strike me as trying too hard or at least not in the context of the novel which is quite an overachiever for its length and for mccarthys usual output i think the vast majority of the novel is gorgeous and more importantly it is a very unique reading experience ive never read another novel that reads quite like blood meridian and both passages you listed emphasize that its also very compelling with an incredible cast of villains and violence executed in a very entertaining and stylish manner like i said its been years but some scenes still stick with me like when they are shooting chickens with their new guns or when the kid is told the story of how they met the judge and when the one dude cant remember his name pours liquor on the guy in the street and lights him on fire and his body is described like a dead curled up spider to compare i read outer dark recently which is much more restrained and while it might have the most beautiful language of any of mccarthys novels seriously the language is nuts more minimal than bm but hits so hard the plot and the characters are nowhere near as engaging the villains of the novel are similar to the judge but far less interesting and while there are a few amazing scenes i think it made me appreciate bm even more for the highs mccarthy attempts to reach and which i think the book hits pretty consistently some might take it as trying too hard but you cant write a novel like that without just going for it and i think the novels style and reading experience are distinct from any other novel ive read including stuff by mccarthy who i would consider somewhat one dimensional outside of bm when he shortens the sentences up like the first one you listed its made more powerful because of the changeup from the long flowing lines that define most of the novel i dont say this to disagree with you or question your opinion i can see why the novel wouldnt be for everybody but if i was to make an argument for what about bm is truly special it would be the characters the strength of some of the scenes and the exceptionally unique style its mccarthy firing on all cylinders at all times and its glorious also to paraphrase bolano if you write too well youll make other writers jealous and theyll say things like oh look hes saying im a writer thats a silly critique and while theres a lot to be said for restrained minimal prose theres just as much to be said if not more for throwing caution to the wind and trying to do something special inevitably you make yourself an easier target but anyone who reads this and says the writing isnt something special even if its not for them simply isnt cut out for maximalistheavily stylistic writing if you arent into it thats fine but if you like writers who take risks youll understand what comes with them and thats all part of the fun thats what makes it unique and a oneofakind read that last bit is just my two cents though
books,not_removed,i keep interested by penciling in the quotation marks he leaves out
books,not_removed,yes mccarthy often tries too fucking hard to be a writer and yes it gets in the fucking way refusing to mar his literature with quote marks really bugs me and yes there are passages of varying length where i have no idea what hes talking about at least faulkner would let you backtrack through the strings of clauses digressions incidents whatevers to make sense of his art its like mccarthy better be trying to be confusing or he should pass the joint and go take a nap nevertheless he remains one of my favorite authors except for the pretty horses crap i couldnt stomach after the first few chapters of the first in the trilogy ive read blood meridian times iirc though i relate more to child of god dont ask why im warning yall you see its not that mccarthy is such a great writer that not digging all his shit makes me an ignorant rube its that mccarthy is one of those fascinating brilliant eccentrics whos been called a genius so often and called himself so probably many more times and certainly much earlier that he puts on airs and can be a dick sometimes the only proper response is to roll your eyes and push on making what sense you can of his extravagant purpleness at least i only choose to read his oeuvre as opposed to having been forced to have him as my daddy so op youre correct pay no attention to those slavish natures who insist you kowtow to the flaming deity despite clearly seeing the little old man whose curtain has been drawn its not that theres anything wrong with your judgment or your art appreciation skillz its that nobody not even a great writer can possibly avoid falling flat on his face sometimes even ace frehley admitted that he wasnt taking dives for the sake of the show he was falling off his foothigh shoes from being drunk off his ass for none are perfect not even charles cormac mccarthy the ol guy can write but he shaw do love his hocuspocus that he can tell a story even so that you can make sense of his narrative even if you skip his violet effusions entirely thats what makes him a writer worth reading as opposed to oh a recently selfmartyred prodigy who could published a short work of characterization so searingly essentially accurate that it made me wince to find myself there but who chose instead to become great with a novel thats got to be footnotes theres no need to wrestle mightily with blood meridian unless you really have to unless youre getting paid to review or teach it and really need the money or unless your gpa depends on sucking off a teacher who will clearly fail anyone who wont join in worshipping the great writer you dont even have to like it as far as im concerned though i myself give it stars out of there is no dunce cap to be forever affixed atop your pate nor should you or anyone try to read anything by the great and powerful comac and afterwards conclude that youre just not cut out for intentionally difficult literature there are lots of things that id see as even worse in that way that i cant even get through the first chpater of without a migraine coming on that might very well strike you as fucking easy and whats the problem dude id like to send a message to mesage to my year old self that the joke is that chimps cant read its a matter of taste not intelligence or judgment sometimes really smart people have really stupid taste and sometimes thing catch on because they reinforce the circle jerk at the smart kids table you know the kind of people who populate the secret history dont sweat it it aint no thing i say this as an grade dropout who according to every test one amused teacher could find to throw at me had a college reading level at age who later hung out as a year old with a bunch of studious kids from the local quaker high school thus i learned that smart chicks can be sexy as long as i dont have to tie them up and pee on them first my credentials are impeccable unless youre an undergraduate who already knows everything
books,not_removed,mccarthy does write sentences using a string of words that have no business being next to each other under normal circumstances it worked often enough for me to overlook the times when it didnt and my highlights go from marking out sometimes two perfectly matched words to entire paragraphs the prose reminds me of that scene from faust where mephistopheles enshrouds the town with his black wings symbolising the omnipresence of evil thats the landscape in blood meridian where its true geology is not stone but fear bm is a book of heavy materialism its focus is on the physical aspects of the world as well as the physical actions of the characters which is why there is nothing written about the emotions or states of mind of any of the characters it describes only what they do without reference to their motivations except what can be understood from dialogue thats probably also why there is no punctuation either because the words are not speech theyre just sounds in a meaningless world with all motion and no action sounds that just happen to be observed by a reader who knows what they signify in the same way their motions become intelligible as actions because we imbue them with humanlike intentions and meaning hence what is meant by the order in creation which you see is that which you have put there like a string in a maze so that you shall not lose your way for existence has its own order and that no mans mind can compass that mind itself being but a fact among others the fear and violence of the novel almost doesnt come from the characters it is immanent in the world and permeates everything there is nothing resembling humanity to be found anywhere just human animals and the natural forces of war and fear that work through men to fit the nature of the world they inhabit such is the bleakness of mccarthys world
books,not_removed,i tossed the book across the room of the way through and i didnt pick it back up my main objection to the book is that the people in it just arent people whats horrifying about men like the ones mccarthy is fixated on is not what they do but what they do after and before what they do they laugh they sing they cook meals they play games they have sex etc because they didnt do this really they lacked almost entirely the capacity to truly shock me in the way a lot of nonfiction and fiction has shocked me mccarthys men just seem to move listlessly through the desert being violent then being serious and philosophical mccarthy just has no grasp of the trivial aspects of human life he just doesnt care about them so his characters dont live they are just ponderous ideas to me i was also bothered by the prose which i found made sense but was needlessly elaborate in a lot of places for no reason other than making it sound elevated it might be kind of heinous of me to say but blood meridian felt like a great longish short story stretched out over pages especially because of the camp after camp scene after scene thing
books,not_removed,it certainly was an experience reading it ive only read it once before and that was because i let someone else borrow it i want to reread it really soon because theres still certain lines that stick out to me and replay in my head but the toll it takes to read bm will postpone that for a while i liked it a lot i just didnt understand much the ending was perhaps the most chilling ending to a story ive ever read perhaps next time ill take my time so i can really get whats going on
books,not_removed,great answer thanks for writing i definitely agree that there are lots of really memorable moments i dont remember the last time a book disturbed me as much as the passage early on when captain whites party is massacred and yeah it really is gorgeous in lots of places im not sure i agree with the part about maximalist writers though i love joyce and dfw who are in some respects even more abstruse i personally think the difference comes from the fact that for those two the confusing prose seems to be pretty unfiltered and natural whereas for mccarthy it was quite obviously a very deliberate effort not that thats a bad thing at at all just personal taste i guess
books,not_removed,i dont agree with this although i do understand where youre coming from but i just want you to know that i love the idea of its not what they do its what they do before or after thats a really interesting observation and one ive never heard from another writerreader although i feel like i shouldve lol and hey id say pick it back up and finish that shit because i dont think you necessarily need what you want from it the fact that the main character is just called the kid sort of establishes that we wont get the chance to know these characters on a super personal level and there is some inbetween too i havent read it in forever but the novel does hit more variety half way through from what i can recall there are moments of calm even if they are always laden with dread and the scalpers do turn up in towns at least a couple times and partake in a different sort of pleasure off the top of my head lol and sorry if its a spoiler but i always think of the judge and glanton getting their new matching suits black and white which beyond the potentially heavy handed metaphor is an example of what youre talking about cause these guys are dirty i can see why somebody wouldnt like this novel but sort of like american psycho i feel like it truly does what it sets out to do and certain things are lost in that uncompromising nature blood meridian for all its verbosity feels at times like something you could hear around a campfire its not particularly humanizing but it is very human and its better for it in any case i love your observation that is something i will think about in books to come
books,not_removed,for sure dude i can see your point and theres no doubt mccarthy falls into kind of a weird category because even in bm hes still writing like he usually does just with everything amped way up im not sure if youve read more mccarthy but compared to his other novels at least the or ive read havent read them all bm is pretty unique its the closest thing he has to a maximalist novel in terms of style although hes definitely still worlds away from a joyce or dfw mainly because he does his thing and he sticks to it i wouldnt describe him as maximalist but so idk why i went there but i guess i just wanted to rail against the idea of overwriting or trying to show how good a writer he is because that criticism has always irked me hes good as fuck it takes a lot of balls to go for it though and even with joyce or dfw those guys are absolute perfectionists who poured over those passages thousands of times these writers get called pretentious sometimes but man somebodys gotta try to write the crazy pyrotechnic epics right i mean with dfw the pale king is only pages and thats just what was deemed usable he had something like four thousand pages of drafting for that and those might not even have made the cut if he was given proper time to finish it so id say those guys are even more deliberate than mccarthy and pynchon when he did gravitys rainbow the legend goes that he was hand writing it and reassembling it later in a blacked out apartment out in ca utterly deliberate laser focused and yet that novel feels loose and unfiltered in a way that nothing else really does it has such a willingness to go anywhere and do anything and take any risk while gaddis has always enthralled me on the other hand for how weirdly classical it is or beckett for how totally weird it is still like nothing else all these years later i dont mean to jerk off all these guys and if you think mccarthy felt forced then that is your right thats a justified reaction far form the worst reaction you could have lol the tone hes going for in bm is pretty unique and again i gotta say i really do need to read it again its been quite a few years but idk its always been my favorite of his because he just lets go with it i think you can feel it while any novel by an author of that caliber is going to be reworked again and again i truly do think bm has a very in the moment feel and the flowing nature of it is something that can only be produced by giving in and going for it like those passages you listed sound like something id write drunk at am lol it mightve been reworked a lot but he had to have just bled on the page to get that many freaking paragraphs about the same thing im getting a little too self indulgent here and theres no technical wizardry to latch on to although in many ways that is the easiest thing to critique dfw and pynchon both get slagged at times for getting too caught up in the acronyms and the weirdness people have a knee jerk reaction to it but bm is just a damn good story and the way it is told is wild and unrestrained and easy to fall in love with at least for me it feels needlessly challenging at times but shit sometimes a book needs to feel that way no doubt there might be a few slip ups but damn when the end product is that good who can argue its by far my fav from him and while i dont hold mccarthy in the same esteem as a technical writer he does his thing but he only does his thing as some of those other guys bm is one hell of a story and i wouldnt have that novel any other way its rapturous like only a handful of novels are and maximalist novels rarely are even though thats of my favorite novels are maximalist and bm doesnt make the cut personal taste for sure and i hope i dont come across as defensive i havent thought about the novel in awhile and it was fun to remember what a ride it was while the novel might not make any philosophical point it still takes mccarthys usual themes and applies them better than any of his other novels i loved glanton and the whole riverboat bit and his death anyway sorry to bog you the fuck down in text i liked the way you approached the question and i wanted to reciprocate in a meaningful way i love hearing your take on it and it challenges my own perceptions of the novel i really do need to read the it again and more mccarthy outer dark was gorgeous but was a chore to get through for me my friend has been telling me to read suttree forever but all his shit kind of feels the same thats always been my biggest problem with mccarthy all best and happy reading
books,not_removed,blood median is on my toreread pile but im probably going to try something else by him first ive been told the road has a central fatherson relationship while being similar and i think i might end up liking it more im glad you like the observation for me violence has a great moral importance so context is extremely important to it i think one of the reasons true crime is so huge is because theres so much inherent moral as well as psychological and prurient interest in the context of violence i also think the saturation of violence plus the dullness of the nonviolent sections minus the personal reception of violence by the characters ends up leaving us devoid of context through which we can understand whats happening in the book i think the virtues of the book the allegory the vivid character of the judge etc these could have all easily been captured in pages where a visit like the one youre describing would be a much larger part of what i was reading and so it would serve to balance things more american psycho a different topic is just willfully annoying to the reader and makes huge demands on him or her without an equivalent payoff unless they hold unusual reading experiences to have a very high value and i dont excuse that kind of thing out of respect for design i have better things to do with my life than read tedious and extensive references and i think all but a few leisured scholars do too its also a short story that was stretched too long but i love his first novel
books,not_removed,for me this was a terrific cautionary tale and i feel that ishiguro did a great job of slowly paying out the sense of dread to the reader i think the story is intended to start out as a typical bildungsroman boarding school tale but it inevitably carries us toward a horrific conclusion the true caution in this tale and in all really effective cautionary tales is that terrible terrible things can be camouflaged in virtuous facades carers and donors are granted a short existence in the service of a surrounding population that are blissfully ignorant of their ultimate sacrifice while reaping their organs you can overlay this structure on any system of social classes consider immigrant farm workers growing food for a middle class also consider how various examples of nationalism have played out throughout history ishiguros talent is the ability to obscure the horror so artfully for such a long portion of the narrative only to reveal the truth of ruths and tommys ultimate sacrifice and miss emilys and marieclaudes confessions at the end for another example of a delayed horrific payoff see ishiguros the buried giant for another look at a future with similar moral compromises see margaret atwoods oryx and crake
books,not_removed,definitely a melancholy book im with you in that none of the ch at actors really grabbed me the way those of my favorite books do but some characters just appeal to people differently it was the only ishiguro book ive read and it was certainly beautifully written ive been meaning to pick up some of his others
books,not_removed,i only read i love ishiguros writing but had no interest in the story i wasnt interested in the characters either that said it seems to grab the attention of a lot of people which is great remains of the day was such a beautiful book and maybe people who read never let me go will feel inspired to read that or artist of the floating world or nocturnes which is a wonderful series of short stories
books,not_removed,couldnt stand the characters in this book ruth jesus christ such a massive pain in the arse from beginning to end story felt like a waste of time too although the slow reveal of the world they live in was well done glad i was done with it in the end though and im not sure if i should try his other works or not
books,not_removed,great insights i will think about what youre saying i like how thoughts like that can influence opinions on books in a post hoc manner what i also liked was the told and not told phrase because kazuo managed to show us the lives of the students exactly from their perspective we were told and not told
books,not_removed,i definitely do recommend remains of the day i was expecting something like that from never let me go i guess the writing was just as well but the story itself was great
books,not_removed,so im going off of memory here which may be incomplete but would give you a starting place to experiment with your own stuff i think vlc player will do everything on your list except hold the last spot on a playlist if you exit the program overdrive has or at least used to im pretty sure they still do a desktop version of their mobile software that does everything you want but overdrive is strictly for eaudiobooks that you check out of your local library i know that amazons whispersync technology will also hold your place but then youre also still stuck with amazon and wont be able to export to a windows player to play without breaking the drm my suspicion if you want something that will hold the spot that you last played is that youll need something that connects with the cloud like the overdrive app i cant remember if itunes remembers a playlist that was previously open once you close the application i feel like it does but i could be wrong
books,not_removed,angels vox for windows
books,not_removed,thanks for the replies im a cheapskate and didnt want to pay for angels vox i found that aimp seems to fit the bill httpwwwaimpruindexphp happy listening
books,not_removed,you cant know good unless you know bad first
books,not_removed,you cant have a rainbow without the rain basically you cant appreciate having good things in your life if you only have nice things in your life if you have never experienced pain and suffering you really dont know how good it feels to be happy and safe
books,not_removed,that only by contrast and comparison can we measure our own comfort in the simplest interpretation it means that unless we stick out a foot and feel the cold we have no idea how warm we really are but to step back it could mean that unless we know how other people live ‚Äî the rich and poor alike ‚Äî we have no idea how lucky we are we think we are struggling until we see someone whose entire worldly goods fit in a shopping cart we think we are well off until we see the stately homes and fine cars that the rich enjoy
books,not_removed,the first words really say it in order to truly enjoy something there has to be a touch of hardship in the moment in essence it is impossible to know how warm and comfortable you are and thus fully enjoy it if you are entirely warm and comfortable
books,not_removed,dont do this kids homework
books,not_removed,you only know that youve been high when youre feeling low you only hate the road when youre missing home you only know you love her when you let her go
books,not_removed,i guess everyones about covered it but i love how it also implies that our system of assigning values to objects things events people is really really vague and what makes us happy today may have done so only because something made us sad before so we have a relative scale we dont measure something as imagining an imaginary unit of happiness this makes me happy but as this gives me more units of happiness than that its also a nice strategy to kid yourself into being happy when you are really sad the idea that when this passes it will make the coming time seem even better
books,not_removed,a friend of mine when he was in the army told me about the time he was on exercise practicing being at war out in the middle of nowhere in wales when it was freezing cold and pissing down with rain the whole time he was on stag rotation in the middle of the night keeping a look out while someone else sleeps hed had about hours sleep over the last few days and nights on top of physical exercise hiking kitweapons cleaning and maneuvers it was his turn to get some sleep at about and he knew hed be woken up again in an hour for his shift he said he peeled off his soaking wet clothes and put on the other cold damp uniform that was supposed to dry during the day in the rain somehow and finally climbed into his sleeping bag in a partially flooded hole hed dug in the ground that was in the wisdom of the instructors to function as his bed for the time being he curled up sleep deprived for days in his cold wet clothes in his cold wet hole under a leaking makeshift canopy in his flimsy damp sleeping bag oddly enough he said he has never experienced comfort like that moment where he pulled his sleeping bag over his head and tucked himself away in his hole he was so exhausted and frozen and desperate that anything that even remotely resembled comfort was heaven to him he still maintains that hed love to be back in wales knowing he had that hours rest to look forward to
books,not_removed,to feel good you first have to feel bad
books,not_removed,you dont appreciate what it means to be warm and comfortable until your sleeping outside on a cold night because your house burned down is what i got from that
books,not_removed,everyone here has answered youre question id like to add a tangent this idea is the basis of buddhas teachings that all is suffering this might be an avenue in what i assume is your class
books,not_removed,another way to express what everyone else is already confirming its talking about the nature of duality
books,not_removed,duality no light without dark no heat without warmth no good without evil eg manichaeism viz ahab and the whale
books,not_removed,without suffering you cannot know joy
books,not_removed,he is being philosophical in a yin yang way does that help
books,not_removed,simplest and best answer might be worth mentioning the context the chapter describes ishmael and queequeg sharing a bed together for the first time a frightening concept to ishmael a good christian but in the end they both like it so much they find it hard to sleep read into that however you want
books,not_removed,im not sure you know what simplest means
books,not_removed,even if this is his homework what wrong is there in helping as long as hes curious enough about what the answer is that he resorts to asking the internet for help that demonstrates enough of a desire to learn
books,not_removed,im not sure you can read in the simplest interpretation it means that unless we stick out a foot and feel the cold we have no idea how warm we really are
books,not_removed,yep not the simplest
books,not_removed,you might be borderline illiterate if you cant understand what hes saying
books,not_removed,i understand the passage its a simple passage to begin with but op stated that their response was the most simplistic it is not do you know what simple means
books,not_removed,so youre just being pedantic to start an unnecessary argument got it
books,not_removed,no argument needed i just want you to understand that in my opinion there are easier ways to state the meaning of the passage and i feel op was analogous in their response as opposed to being direct imo being analogous in explaining a passage full of metaphors does not give a proper representation of the meaning and further convolutes the topic stop taking things personally
books,not_removed,a video trailer of my new book
books,not_removed,my love life resembles jorahs
books,not_removed,esther greenwood the bell jar
books,not_removed,hermione granger first book character that ever i truly related to
books,not_removed,yeah and sometimes it actually makes you feel a little ashamed i related to the younger scarlett ohara when i read her perspective precivil war and during it because of a similar fascination with an unattainable guy needless to say it was embarrassing and eyeopening
books,not_removed,i find the snark and attitude of harry dresden very relatable i may also be a wizard living in chicago
books,not_removed,tsukuru tazaki i often feel a sense of alienation even amongst close friends and i completely understand this character his motivations his reactions his decisions are exactly how i would be in his place he reminds me so strongly of myself that it freaks me out a bit
books,not_removed,i just reread an old favorite a life many people of my type had but i was right there with her throughout
books,not_removed,as an author sometimes i feel like theyre in my head
books,not_removed,not surprised no but its always a good feeling
books,not_removed,i just finished the girls and the very last page beach scene was depressingly relatable for me
books,not_removed,i relate to them so much i end up having a crush on them character crushes can be painful but they have benefits cheap no long term disappointment no risk of pregnancy and they wont turn up at your house
books,not_removed,artemis out of artemis fowl
books,not_removed,anna sergeevna odintsova in fathers and sons says that she doesnt want to live and that her life felt empty even though she had wits means and love because she doesnt want anything and doesnt care about anything i really identified with that last week
books,not_removed,that was definitely what kept me thinking about the magicians by lev grossman long after i finished the book the teen boy in swamplandia by karen russell always seemed very authentic to me even though i read the book in adulthood
books,not_removed,youre in love with a year old and act extremely inapptopriate with her against her will
books,not_removed,right im not british but i was always the studious girl with really bushy dark hair and i embraced it i changed schools a lot and i can relate to her feeling out of place in their first year side note she got her teeth fixed at and i had braces at side side note i can totally imagine myself saying just because you have the emotional range of a teaspoon doesnt mean everyone does

books,not_removed,great find
books,not_removed,this is a really great find
books,not_removed,i was sick as hell just before thanksgiving and my loving wife knew i would love this and put it on for me easily one of my favorates from the last few years eagerly awaiting the next book the narration i thought was excellently done
books,not_removed,alright op i finished the book yesterday pm me if you want to discuss
books,not_removed,late to the party i like to think the personality difference can be explained away as just how you would perceive yourself could you imagine walking into a room full of yous who all shared the same memories but had lived separate lives for the last x amount of years if i spent decades negotiating and planning a serious project i would have a more serious outlook than i would have if id spent that time studying a new species somewhere light years away plus can you imagine having to defer to a more senior you i think this book not only has great humour excellent plotline and character growth but it also raises some pretty deep concepts of what it is to be you and how you define your sense of self the second book is out soon so hopefully all will be answered i still like my take on it though haha
books,not_removed,literally just started it hes on the launchpad right now give me a couple days
books,not_removed,i also just downloaded the audiobook the other day though i just started a different book but ill bail on that one and put this one on instead
books,not_removed,i thought the personality splits was pretty well explained away quantum level differences i think it was way way outside my area of expertise but it was definitely plausible enough for me to suspend disbelief enough to enjoy the book
books,not_removed,continuing the book this week right now im on chapter getting pretty crazy and im interested to see what happens
books,not_removed,i believe its going to be a trilogy so there should be more books to tie those things up im a bit concerned about humans meeting the deltoids even bob couldnt help butting in with them imagine if the faith contingent found out about them
books,not_removed,the reader in the audiobook was excellent
books,not_removed,what did you think how did you feel about the different personalities of the clones sure it would have been a boring book if they were all the same but it seemed a bit convenient that they werent its also a pretty dim view of humanity as a whole but i dont think i disagree with it
books,not_removed,i just got to this part today too i wish i had the text the part where hes talking about the change in political rule seemed eerily foreboding
books,not_removed,spoilers ahead i agree about the dim view of humanity if the population is in that kind of a situation and then someone comes along to save us i think that there will be tremendous arguments and cults who dont believe in being saved and tough decisions made on who to save first i thought the personalities were a great touch it reminded me of the michael keaton movie multiplicity to name one homer was kind of confusing because with that name youd think hes be a little dense and less intelligent than the rest but hes out there problem solving was a bit hard to take i was almost expecting one to appear and go rogue and not want to go along with the plans or something the deltans were quite interesting too though kinda distracted from the main plot were there plans to put some of the humans on that planet too it all ended quite abruptly there was really no final wrapup or and they all lived happily ever after what finnaly came of the deltans and what happened once the humans got to the other planets what about madieros
books,not_removed,audible me too eskimo audible brothers
books,not_removed,in regards to homer he chose that name for himself because he thought it would be funny on the deltans bob said to himself that he could cross the deltans planet off the list for colonization because it already had intelligent life also taylor announced on his website that the next book would be out in march so all those unanswered questions will be answered
books,not_removed,i personally think super you was pretty great as a person who is quite antiself help books i got it because i like the author but mainly because it doesnt oversell and is just direct and practical i also loved how it talks about kind of taking out your memories and framing them from different perspectives
books,not_removed,the road less traveled not the poem the book different author
books,not_removed,in the genre i only found this one to be of any use i will qualify this by saying i have negative opinion of self help books they coming in two categories there is you can do anything life is amazing you just got to work a week and then there is it is okay to be mediocre ill allow a third of meditation books while not exactly self help books they are around the block without knowing what you are looking for out of a self help book i have some food for thought buckets of money or any investment book why money is a major stressor in a persons life an understand of how to invest is comforting a cookbook a person has to eat good diet and putting a meal together improves the way you feel about yourself while making your body feel better diary will help you organize your own thoughts and keep important information some where i keep a budget and insecure ramblings in mine both help hitchhikers guide to the galaxyany humorous book a good laugh and positivity rarely hurts

books,not_removed,it was okay everybody assures me that my complaints will be resolved as the series unfolds but i found agot to be too predictable and the characters too thin and there was so much padding i can see how cate and tyrions meeting at the inn is crucial to the larger plot but did we really need to see every detail of their road trip
books,not_removed,yes there part of the elric saga im not sure about what fits into the series i just bought the six books that make up the main series online without doing too much research theyre fun and imaginative silly and frustrating at the same time still im into it
books,not_removed,the library didnt have the third one qq i liked the first two though they were a lot better than the typical ya fiction very wellwritten very engaging avoided a lot of the cliches i was looking for and nothing of gaimans approaches american gods for me but fortunately the milk was adorable and hilarious
books,not_removed,not quite finished with it yet but im really liking it its very different its kind of slowmoving but its just so well puttogether that you dont mind the imitation of the victorian tone is spoton and hilarious and the worldbuilding is really neat
books,not_removed,i was so conflicted the luminaries on one hand the way the story was constructed and came together was incredible on the other hand for some reason i hated every character in the book i couldnt sympathize with any of them i also understand what catton was going for with the structure of the book which is admirable but i just mostly found it annoying by about half way through the book i was intrigued with the plot but also wanted it to be over just wasnt for me i think im definitely going to give her other book the rehearsal a try though
books,not_removed,i enjoyed the door immensely emmerence is such a strong impenetrable character thats also so incredibly vulnerable and tragic cant wait to read it again as well as szabos other work hope you enjoy it as well
books,not_removed,oh its definitely my favorite titlecover of the stories are all interconnected which i really loved if you enjoy tsar definitely pick up his novel a constellation of vital phenomena
books,not_removed,yeah ive been meaning to get around to him for a while im not really sure vonnegut is for me tbh he more amuses me rather than inspire the irrepressible laughter he seems to give other readers unfortunately i liked both but i think i preferred the setting and plot of brave new world but it was quite a dry read i found whilst i liked the writing style more of but was quite dissapointed by the ending
books,not_removed,i think the secret is not to try to figure it out its more of a thriller than a mystery the main character is in kind of a fog so you should allow yourself to feel that fog along with her
books,not_removed,i slowly got used to the voice style in it it became more apparent why the narrators voice was the way it was as the story progressed really good book a powerful and despondent commentary on altruism and passivity in society
books,not_removed,well yes not published or anything but i do have things im working on on writing was on sale at a bookstore so i picked it up lucky me a really good read about writing editing and just a look into how stephen king does his thing
books,not_removed,thats the third david mitchell ive read the other two being cloud atlas and bone clocks i enjoyed those but slade house really sucked me in also i think its like a spiritual sequel to bone clocks so if you liked that i highly recommend you pick up slade house
books,not_removed,they whole series was really good i was sad when i finished it
books,not_removed,i hated it very very much turned me off john green haha
books,not_removed,twilight really wasnt the worst thing to be honest i found myself getting into it but then we broke up and she took her books back lmfao i wasnt gonna go spend money to read that bullshit and that a child called it was a heart fuck im tellin you i was in grade wantin to cry for ol boy
books,not_removed,after ive read atlas shrugged last year i just could not help reading this one also these are the books that greatly influenced my way of thinking quite a lot of good ideas can be found there
books,not_removed,thank you its just that i set a goal of and at this point i realised i wont be able to do that
books,not_removed,yes i found a couple of books hard to get through
books,not_removed,i think i had too high expectations for stardust as i loved both neverwhere and american gods it just felt like an enjoyable but simple fantasyfolktale story i read lyras oxford last year i like then both for giving further background to his dark materials but couldnt justify giving either of then the ratings of the novels
books,not_removed,ive read the first few vampire books when i was younger translated to my native language now i read them in english the whole series i actually had a ton of fun especially with the books when they were in the mountain and it kinda broke me not going to spoil to others but the person who did the bad very very bad thing that part the dresden files is just pure hilarious fun the first few are a bit meh but then the protagonist brings a trex back to life to ride her to battle with a buddy sitting behind him and stuff its so crazy yeah no box sets i guess its because its so long books so far i have to admit i am not a big sanderson fan he didnt click with me but i loved grossman also yancey surprised me so much the monstrumologist was the darkest coolest ya book ive ever read seriously also sebastien de castell is someone i definitely recommend i read his book about a week ago and i adored it
books,not_removed,i completely forgot about the darren shan books this thread is like a trip down memory lane for me right now
books,not_removed,i didnt find it awful i just disliked the end with the girl living happily ever after even though she murdered and raped people and all she was a horrible person and i couldnt like her
books,not_removed,yeah its for tracking a couple of my other goals this year im trying to read around a femalemale author split so its an easy way to keep tabs on that week to week im also trying to read at least new releases obviously ive blown through that goal and keep my toread list of books ive bought but havent yet actually read down under all year i keep doing this stupid thing where ill buy a bookand then go and borrow a bunch of different books from the library and read those instead so im trying to stop that the luminaries is one of those books i wouldnt even hesitate to call a work of art its so wellcrafted and really does feel like an century novel that said it was a tough one to read its dense like an century novel its full of paragraphs that span multiple pages without a line break like an century novel its got that multinarrator structure where one character delivers a longass monologue and then another character responds with his own longass monologue like an century novelit took a lot of effort and im still not sure it was entertaining enough or important enough thematically to have been worth it jamaica inn isnt du mauriers best so far my favorite of her novels have been rebecca and my cousin rachel jamaica inn ended up being a pulpy historical romance with a silly pirate murder suspense subplot fun but not great du maurier is really hit or miss i wouldnt recommend rule britannia by her either which i also read this year rebecca and my cousin rachel thoughamazing the collector i really loved especially the second half which is when i think the book really elevates itself from being your standard silence of the lambsesque stalker creepout book it ended up being a really well done surprisingly complex read and a major pageturner i finished it in a day its not that long
books,not_removed,how was infinite jest i enjoyed it but need to read it again i think itll make even more sense the second go around patrick rothfuss oh my god arent those books amazing tnotw yes wmf started off great and then began to wear on me you know its a fantasy book when the main character is a teenage ginger kid that somehow everyone wants to sleep with riiiiight
books,not_removed,its all a matter of taste i actually really enjoyed ready player one it was amusing and full of throwback references that i liked i would consider it a great vacation or beach type read its not dense and you wont be pondering the deep philosophical points it makes months from now but that doesnt mean you cant enjoy it
books,not_removed,oh man where do i start i liked it a lot its a hilarious twisted seafaring epic that captures what it would be like to grow up in marstal during peacetime and both world wars reddit is right to recommend it though i wouldnt necessarily consider it one of my must reads i enjoyed the cuckoos calling especially since ive always been a fan or rowlings writing style the ending felt like something that happens too often in this type of novel i suppose thats because similar situations happen in reallife crimes as well
books,not_removed,its worth your time if you enjoy chatty memoirs shonda inspires me with her ambition and takenoshit confidence so i really enjoyed reading about her journey of saying yes to everything good
books,not_removed,i found it captivating despite being a little bit predictable i had to pull over on my way home from work to keep reading because i was so anxious to finish the last chapters the characters felt very believable and real and while there are many critics who think this book sends a dangerous message about the worth of disabled people i interpreted it as a story about life and the importance of making your own choices jojo moyes handled a difficult theme in a way that was both thoughtful and tragic the quality of the movie was diminished because they gutted the main characters personality and took away some important events for the sake of time its still pretty charming in its own right if you read the book first
books,not_removed,havent read black swan green its the next mitchell novel on my list but jacob de zoet is very good not quite as good as cloud atlas though so id recommend putting that one on your list
books,not_removed,hmm probably a it was a pretty easy read it brought up a few interesting thoughts and questions as i went along but it didnt really leave a memorable impression it was just ok
books,not_removed,i havent read slaughterhousfive but i absolutely love cats cradle i read it for the first time about a year ago and i knew from the moment i finished it that i wanted to reread it its far superior to breakfast of champions but boc is still pretty good imo i strongly recommend it plus its not too long so if you dont like it its not such a time sink
books,not_removed,ive read the maze runner series actually i quite enjoyed it the first book is great and while the others arent at quite as interesting the whole maze thing was really intriguing it was still a cool series theyre coming out with another prequel about how thomas and wicked created the maze other series ive read are the mortal instruments the infernal devices the golden compass the house of night kissed by an angel shiver hush hush and miss peregrines home for peculiar children
books,not_removed,it was so refreshing the setting and the lore cannot be more different and earthsea feels more magical and mysterious more alien than a classic high fantasy setting also ive seen the lotr movies like a thousand times by now so the basic story its very familiar
books,not_removed,not to be contrarian but honestly it was not a book i cared for at all i am not planning to go back for the sequels i read it for my book clubs pick for may chosen to coincide for the release of the in the trilogy for those who were already reading the series it was the suggestion of a good friend and fellow book club member whose opinion i absolutely respect but on this one we definitely differed for me the book seemed like it needed an editor to rip out about pages in the middle it just dragged dreadfully and only seemed to pick up the pace in the last pages that would probably have been ok if it wasnt pages to slog through
books,not_removed,oh gods yes it is an amazing book those two are the only gaiman i have read and i was hooked read each in a day anansi boys has a different feel and tone than american gods but it is spectacular it was a bit slower to read at first and it isnt as broad scope as american gods but again spectacular
books,not_removed,amazing series and im waiting to get the next two of his dark materials from the library i already have the amber spyglass but im next in line to get the subtle knife
books,not_removed,yeah but then again i should disclose that i dont really watch television much or play video games
books,not_removed,i liked it true it wasnt big on plot but i found something cozy about the whole thing and i really enjoyed the very evocative writing i liked the wreath but found it a little plodding so it was nice to have something quick and fanciful afterwards i will say i found his intro about how lots of people wouldnt get it to be pretentious and obnoxious but i can agree maybe that its the sort of book one has to be in the right mood for now id rather be reading the doors of stone but i still did enjoy it
books,not_removed,sandman really was amazing the night angel trilogy was okay i gave the first and last books a and the a there was a lot i did like and the worldbuilding was well done the characters especially in the book started to grate a little with lots of angsty moping and stories that didnt feel like they were really going anywhere
books,not_removed,no the author did a horrible job capturing the characters and the theme of the books it wasnt a bad book but it was definitely not next millenium my biggest pet peeve is he didnt even give us a time frame of when it wasnt it sounded like it had been years but some parts made me think it was more about or no mention of miriam wu and no mention of the women blomkvist was falling in love with at the end of the girl who a kicked the hornets nest a big theme of the millenium book series is violencehate against women there was none of that really one women was being beaten but that was just a plot driver not a focus the only good thing was he didnt make blomkvist gods gift to all women
books,not_removed,i honestly just didnt really enjoy it i read it on recommendation as i liked the name of the wind but i found locke lamora a bit tedious
books,not_removed,yes and no i really didnt want to it to end at all honestly but was pretty satisfied overall i was glad the second half moved a lot quicker than the first
books,not_removed,ive read most of mccarthys stuff cant go wrong with blood meridian or suttree but i might recommend all the pretty horses before tackling either of those i might add that galveston is written by the same guy who wrote true detective on hbo worth checking out if youre a fan of the show
books,not_removed,breakfast of champions went pretty deep into the meta fiction which was awesome to see an author do that ive read a lot and ive never seen an author quite do what vonnegut did
books,not_removed,you should read mother night also about vonneguts time in wwii but it is vastly different from slaughterhouse v
books,not_removed,no i decided to start with atss my particular part is page
books,not_removed,well shiti always thought droll meantyeah boring huh ah well thanks
books,not_removed,the movie was standard and it was a pretty good cast the book was justflat
books,not_removed,read any other gaiman
books,not_removed,thats martins style if you didnt like it in agot i cant imagine youre going to like the rest of the series
books,not_removed,yeah man that elric were some of the first proper adult books i read when i was younger like seriously i went from a series of unfortunate events to elric killing his wife who got warped into a monster also just slaughtering everyone with a homicidal sword
books,not_removed,you have to read the amber spyglass you justyou just have to ocean at the end of the lane i loved american gods i love everything ive read it all but ocean is where its at for me i need to reread american gods though also stardust stardust was very perfect though that might just be the book appealing to the britishness in me
books,not_removed,oh that sounds exactly like i would like it cheers
books,not_removed,recommend or not
books,not_removed,i think im a huge fan of vonneguts style the only time ive laughed out loud was when he illustrated his level of maturity with his image of an asshole at the start of breakfast of champions everything else ive just appreciated but i like what he does and how he brings it all together i think the ending of though it did totally drop the plot was pure genius every single thread came together and every single little iota of that world suddenly made sense and i just appreciated how well it was done i think i need to reread bnw to get the full impact of the plot or maybe i was just expecting more and i didnt find it
books,not_removed,ive never read stephen king but on writing was still a really great book a lot of genuinely helpful pieces of advice and i went out and bought misery because i decided it was time i read him
books,not_removed,goddamn now i really have to read it i knew i should have picked up that hardcopy when my bookstore had it in
books,not_removed,oh i really liked itmy favourite john green
books,not_removed,hated it too very shallow book in my opinion
books,not_removed,no the twilight books werent handsdown terrible but the film gave them a really bad rep and the films were fucking terrible ive got the whole child called it trilogy i have the whole thing to look forward to
books,not_removed,i like the idea of reading atlas shrugged then i realise i dont want to read a book thats so long thats just a manifesto of someones beliefs
books,not_removed,i think being british makes stardust much more enjoyable i dont know why i hated it the first time i read it and then the second time i kind of got my head around it and the britishness of it hit me now i frickin love it i was so disappointed with lyras oxford maybe for messing with my idea of lyra as anything but an year old girl but also i think just because it wasnt offering a lot in the north was much better in my opinion but still only really a short
books,not_removed,so many things to add to my toread list i think im just going to have to go to through this whole thread and add things as i go
books,not_removed,i do this thing where i buy four books and read onenot that im a slowreader just an eager buyer your goals are much more involved than mine so far all ive tried to do is branch out of fiction so far all ive done is the sandman and dr faustus thats an interesting review of the luminaries now i dont know if i want to read it moreor less i thought the writing in jamaica inn was great and i was talking to my mom about how she loved it for being a love story and i just downright said it bloody well wasnt a love story she meets the bloke four or five times and hes a cunt to her every time but ive been to the jamaica inn in cornwall and over those bodmin moors i wasnt sure about the collector i think when the perspective changed i lost it for a little while and then got a bit more invested into the story after i settled into it it was a good book but not one that i was blown away by
books,not_removed,was reading ij hella difficult did it take a very long time i know what you mean about wmf but i didnt see that as too much of an issue it was a bit too much to buy when the sexgoddess thought he was amazing and was totally blown away by how it was his first time but then you spend more time thinking about it and you realise its him telling his own story its probably filled with little fallacies that could be a part of the story
books,not_removed,i have a few bloated books on my shelf so when i feel like reading one i will definitely get round to we the drowned the ending really let me down i dont read a lot of crime or thriller work but i made an exception for rowling story and book were good ending colossally let it down
books,not_removed,i was really intrigued by how she would handle the topic of disability it sounds like a very interesting story and ill add it to my list to pick up at the bookstore next time i go thank you
books,not_removed,your review sums up my exact experience with this book it was very captivating
books,not_removed,read cloud atlas while i liked it i wasnt blown away not nearly as much as the bone clocks i will probably get round to jacob de zoet then i havent read mitchells short form so that might be interesting
books,not_removed,yeah i do think i will get cats cradle next i enjoyed the other two books not to and even though vonnegut is remember for most of the people i come across say that cats cradle is better
books,not_removed,youre right about tmr great first book that slowly declined but was still i think a great trilogy overall better than the hunger games also the golden compass you mean the best trilogy ever conceived by human minds the amber spyglass is my single favourite book of all time because it is mindblowingly amazing
books,not_removed,yes i will agree i think i know the part youre referencing and it did make the entire book feel a bit bloated still as i sat there thinking about it i realised it was still an important part to the story and in fact to the entire trilogy so even though it does mean the first book drags a bit it really cant be done away with
books,not_removed,read everything else by gaiman not like all the books ever
books,not_removed,not gonna lie and im not really sorry to say it but abhorsen trilogy doesnt hold even an ember to his dark materials ok thats a bit of an exaggeration and an injustice to garth nix but stillhdm is better
books,not_removed,need to reread the sandman i think i missed a lot i suppose im bias against night angel because its the first adult fantasy i read leapt straight from eragon into that and so ive always really liked it also assassins
books,not_removed,well thats the nail in the coffin for me id heard bad things but hadnt quite made up my mind now i have i can just read the trilogy as is
books,not_removed,why all the pretty horses
books,not_removed,i mean if a book or author is doing nothing for you dont feel like you have to push through i really think atss gets better as it progresses if you are interested in hosseinis work the kite runner is really good as well
books,not_removed,no have you
books,not_removed,oel didnt really resonate with me im not sure why but im very fond of stardust as well and i love the movie even more than the book
books,not_removed,i dont think its for everyone but i think the people who do like it know pretty much instantly xd
books,not_removed,thats a tough one id say if you already have it or can find it for cheap go for it
books,not_removed,yeah im not really passing judgement on him until i read a little more of his work ive only read boc and i did like but i just couldnt grasp that they would go through all that effort just for one person you know i just quite like how between and bnw and maybe a bit of a clockwork orange you get something resembing todays world
books,not_removed,i wanted to read the second one but my school cut the honor system cuz and graders arent responsible and wouldnt return the books since there was no accounting for who took what who knew kids were bad at things
books,not_removed,im british so perhaps that aspect of stardust was lost on me i definitely get the dislike of grown up lyra its like finding out alice is married and living in tunbridge wells
books,not_removed,story of my life
books,not_removed,thats what makes that series so great imo you have to remember the narrative is coming from the main character
books,not_removed,i read it a while ago now and dont remember too much but i do remember enjoying it thoroughly the whole idea of daemons how do you pronounce that i always thought it was similar to demon but instead of the de sound a day sound i do remember being sad at the end because lyra and will were separated
books,not_removed,im glad to hear it if whoever has the frickin book would give it up to me now that would be great
books,not_removed,just a suggestion blood meridian and suttree are his denser novels reading the road or no country for old men and then maybe all the pretty horses or child of god can acclimate you to the more complex work not to say the road and no country etc is simplistic or inferior just a little less challenging a read id say
books,not_removed,i really couldnt read a clockwork orangemaybe i should try again i just hated the language but yes i think whats great about both books is they remain relevant and are in some cases even more relevant today than they were when they were published
books,not_removed,eh you werent missing out on a lot they went downhill almost vertically and then faceplanted the tarmac with the blatant cashgrab that was the last one
books,not_removed,hullo fellow brit i mgiht be wrong about stardust thats just how i felt but it was a hearkening back to english fairy tales the things i grew up on
books,not_removed,the first time i read it i pronounced it damons then at the front it actually says to just pronounce it demon yeah i reread for the first time in nearly ten years last year i was i cried like a little girl
books,not_removed,i did read the road honestly i wasnt a huge fan the writing style just tired me out and it all started to bleed into one storyi just wasnt overwhelmed i got blood meridian because i liked the road enough to give mccarthy another try and reddit kept on going on about blood meridian if you think suttree is betterwell ill see how i get on with bm
books,not_removed,i really liked the prose and how they keep the dialogue the same for the films to a high level so the quotes really stand out was it the nadsat that you didnt like because there are plenty of online resources to help with that i cant recommend it enough a great book and film i found i would like to reread them both one day in maybe years and see if they still apply which i think they will
books,not_removed,yea i saw the movie the book ending probably wouldve made me wwant to jump out of my skin soo much time for a shit ending im assuming its in or around the same ending in both the book and movie
books,not_removed,i did like the fairy tale aspect although i would argue he is not purely drawing on english fairy tales i just expected more from gaiman i think it would be deserving of a reread in a few years
books,not_removed,ill probably reread it in a few years its hard to find time to reread series when theres so many other books i havent read yet
books,not_removed,i read it when i was quite young younger than maybe even a bit more it was on the folks shelf and id seen the dvd cover beethoven and uberviolence fuck yes which is how all young boys minds work obviously but i think a big part of then was yes the nadsat i could probably more or less make it out now and i really should give it another go
books,not_removed,no idea i didnt see all the movies saw the first two heard enough about the others to get the gist
books,not_removed,i hear you so many books i want to reread that i would just hate myself for if i did
books,not_removed,haha oh god its probably a good thing you hadnt read it then some of the scenes in it are awful significantly worse than the film yeah the nadsat is kind of annoying but some words pretty much occur every other page and theres online glossaries and it stops being so irrtating about halfway through its only a short read and its probably one of my favourite books
books,not_removed,didnt miss too much sparkling fairies depressed teens you got the whole story in the first one lmao oh yea werewolves too
books,not_removed,i know its still downstairs so maybe ill take a bite out of it over breakfastsee how well the first few pages sit with me
books,not_removed,not even real werewolves
books,not_removed,yeah id give it pages or so
books,not_removed,i feel like either option would be a good choice is it noble to give the profits to the victims of the holocaust absolutely i think that is a wonderful idea and deserves to be encouraged but i also think that donating the profits to other community organizations that foster tolerance and fight against hate is a worthy use of the money the central evil of the holocaust isnt the group that it targeted but that it targeted groups of people based on largely immutable characteristics and ingrained hatred in society when people say never again they dont just mean that genocide against the jews should never happen but that genocide against any group should never be allowed to happen again
books,not_removed,has anyone actually read mein kampf is it a coherent book or is it just the ravings of a madman
books,not_removed,beside all madnesses about political point of view the book itself is a really good book you can look up some comments about the book on amazon you should look for a good translation version without any biases
books,not_removed,i have that problem too especially if i read a lot before going to bed ill continue a dialog in my head in a style that matches the writing of the book im reading glad to know im not the only one
books,not_removed,how come my hypothesis your inner monologue so to call it can exist in many forms some things we verbalise some things we visualise or experience as shapes and so on if you really load up your brain on a certain type of verbalisation it on some level starts to experience that type of language as apparently rather relevant so your inner monologue starts also being related to it think of it as a cable between the inner monologue and the part of your vocalisation that has been heavily trained to read a certain type of book you brain has concluded that that connection is very important so it increases its amplitude after a while when it turns out verbalisation is not important it just reduces the amplitude until you no longer experience the verbalisation based on the book the takeaway from this is also that what you experience as normal as opposed to the book narration is in fact a specific mode of thinking of your brain in other words you have an unconscious way of framing everything you see and only realise it when the normal tone of it changes
books,not_removed,i think its just a sign that the book was good enough that you immersed enjoy
books,not_removed,i do that in fact i want it to happen sometimes ill put down the book right after a game changing section and my mind will start running with my own version dialogue and all its fun
books,not_removed,i get this all the time its like the voice of the author his rhythm and cadence and what not sort of rambles on in my head as im trying to sleep
books,not_removed,love reddit i thought i had a loose wire guess a few of us do happens to me all the time esp with the long epics asoif girl w dragon tattoo but really any author with a strong voice
books,not_removed,ive had that my biggest problem right now is getting out of the voice of the previous author andor narrator when i start a new book immediately following i finished the light of the fireflies and immediately started house of leaves a sheltered young boy to delusional multiple narrators was not an easy shift to make
books,not_removed,this happens to me when i finish a good book i tend to mull over it sometimes for a couple of days like for example i finished the fever code two days ago and am still thinking about it the ending makes you rethink a lot
books,not_removed,do you hear the words in your head when you read
books,not_removed,me too thanks
books,not_removed,im on hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and i found myself saying weird stuffmaking weird comments because that was the style of the book you are definitely not alone
books,not_removed,when i went through a phase of reading a lot of spy thrillers i started talking like a spy it just seemed to take over my imagination i remember calling some office asking them if they could patch me through to soandso i wonder if some people are just more suggestable
books,not_removed,omg this happens to me too last night i kept saying shit like he felt a queer sensation in his midsection after approaching the amiable fellow in my head because i read too much king the day before
books,not_removed,perfectly said ive done this many times
books,not_removed,this happens to me too although for me its more prevalent when i spend the day binge watching something on netflix
books,not_removed,sometimes if i spend too much time with someone i start to imitate their way of speaking unconsciously wonder if its the same phenomenon
books,not_removed,me too it makes insomnia that much worse though ill be kept up all night and the words from whatever i was reading wont go away
books,not_removed,yes my lips move as i read
books,not_removed,i feel its necessary if you wanna get immersed in a book i try to create characters images and voices and visualize scenes none of this can be done by skimming at least for me
books,not_removed,i dont skim i just stop processing the words as words i find it jarring when i come across a sentence that i do have to hear in my head to understand
books,not_removed,tell me maam is it a pleasure to burn
books,not_removed,your kid is i would make a reasonable guess that she has already tried french kissing assuming this isnt a troll keeping books like this from teenagers will not stop them
books,not_removed,heres to hoping this is a troll post if not i feel bad for ops kids
books,not_removed,the history of literature is that fiction was originally suppressed because it was lies but once fiction was understood to be suggestive rather than factual it attained a status equal to other contemporary literature the bible included speaking of the bible let your daughter read the song of solomon then stand against fiction in schools
books,not_removed,had to come back to answer the original title of books corrupt our children life corrupts everybody but thatsnot a bad thing

books,not_removed,disclaimer i dont know if these are taught in some school systems but they werent in mine or those of the majority of my college classmates any faulkner but particularly the unvanquished go down moses or light in august all of them explore different elements of the pre postcivil war south that are important to society and particularly those of us who live outside and dont understand the south they are particularly good at exploring southern whites confused and contradictory view of the blacks they lived alongside in society without understanding that mindset one cannot understand the south or a large contingent of racists from this nations history these books are complicated and confusing so they need a heavy hand from the teacher to explain the attitudes and interactions but i believe that properly taught they would inform students about history and even about current society a secondary recommendation id make is salvation on sand mountain snake handling and redemption in southern appalachia by dennis covington i think the book is beautifully written a great introduction to creative nonfiction and a wonderful lesson in empathy for other cultures most of us me included in the past think that snake handling churches are crazy and possibly just pulled in my a hoax because theyre gullible or stupid but what one learns from this book is that they arent crazy or stupid or ignorant of dangers they have a different culture and different values this book really teaches you to empathize with a foreign culture and examine their practices with a more open and charitable attitude
books,not_removed,animal farm enders game passing their eyes were watching god joe college tom perrotta shakespeare and lots more many high schoolers dont read enough
books,not_removed,the stranger by albert camus this book should be read and analyzed in schools it would really open up peoples minds in a way that is a bit more philosophicalexistential
books,not_removed,definitely slaughterhouse five such a great example of ptsd and does an excellent job of showcasing the adverse effects of war
books,not_removed,ralph ellisonthe invisible man
books,not_removed,dune read early and often so much scifi and recent read last years fiction isnt taught but probably should be i read as summer reading aka it was ignored and bnw was in the curriculum but dune vonnegut kerouac all absent
books,not_removed,these all sound fantastic faulkner is a must and i really want to read more of his work
books,not_removed,theirs a high school that my exs little brother went to that teaches of those
books,not_removed,very true sometimes i feel like i am the only one that read the boos cover to cover its sad how little some of my peers cared about great literature
books,not_removed,we read it in my junior year brilliant work already loved camus and part of our works in translation unit
books,not_removed,i agree slaughterhousefive is actually an ideal book to teach in high school because its a quick fun read so its easy to get kids interested in it but it also has an incredible message
books,not_removed,im listening to the audiobook right now and its great im surprised people seem to have forgotten about it in the educational setting as a white male its given me more perspective on what it was like to be a free black man before the civil rights movement than anything ive every read seen or been told
books,not_removed,i have heard very good things about this book
books,not_removed,definitely agree that science fiction isnt taught enough or in enough depth also you didnt read in school ts been a long time since i read though i read that and vonnegut outside of school as well i havent gotten around to kerouac yet nor dune both however are on my reading list
books,not_removed,i took a faulkner and oconnor class in college faulkner and it was a great experience i learned so much about him and america i heartily recommend his writing if you dont mind a recommendation list these is my ranking of the novels ive read go down moses the unvanquished the sound and the fury as i lay dying light in august i have absalom absalom on my shelf and i look forward to it
books,not_removed,my high school had most of them but i think we only did their eyes were watching god because it was an ib school and we only taught anima farm and enders game in the freshman class for the lowlevel students so a lot of us never ran into them in school
books,not_removed,high schooler here most of us read sophomore year in my schools curriculum that and frankenstein are the only scifi we read
books,not_removed,absalom is faulkner at peak devastating
books,not_removed,fantastic thank you
books,not_removed,im excited to read it i really like faulkner and i know the books reputation im reading sometimes a great notion right now and they are apparently similar
books,not_removed,its a great book truly but i hope you like italics pages of full nonstop italics

books,not_removed,middlesex by eugenides american pastoral by roth both capture the essence of americanness that few others can middlesex by showing by generations how a family became american and became embroiled in some of its history american pastoral by juxtaposing twoi dont want to say opposing americansbut ways of being americana getahead dad who made his way up in the family business to create sanctuary and middleclass life for his family and his daughter who under the umbrella of that security lashed out at injustices she saw in the world dark horse the sellout by paul beatty lets bring segregation and slavery back
books,not_removed,this question gets asked a lot and for many east of eden is understandably their goto answer for others its fitzgeralds gatsby especially if youre talking about a novel that captures a certain periodtime and some its melvilles moby dick and we get readers who lament why author x author y and author z arent on the list defining the greatest novel of a country is a hard thing to do especially if you start defining the parameters by which youre citing it as the greatest your choice of grapes of wrath is because it captures the essence of being american at a particular time but does that make it the greatest or more so continues to define what it means to be american today or across the ages although the struggle of families trying to survive is a universal one theres a lot more room in which to define the novel and certainly what might be the greatest american novel
books,not_removed,ill probably change my mind after more thought but for now gravitys rainbow pynchon
books,not_removed,the beautiful and damned by f scott fitzgerald not only does it capture new york nightlife and the idealism that fitzgerald is famous for but it is also a devastating tale of nouveaux riches reckless ambition and squandered talent one of the greatest works of literature ever
books,not_removed,to kill a mockingbird by harper lee
books,not_removed,it comes down to moby dick or invisible man for me
books,not_removed,huck finn
books,not_removed,the joy luck club by amy tan it captures the immigrant experience the challenges of biculturalism and the spirit of america
books,not_removed,beloved by toni morrison
books,not_removed,a bit of a different approach for an answer the spy by james fenimore cooper that alongside washington irvings the sketch book of geoffrey crayon are both greatly written and more important and impactful than nearly any other piece of american literature they both cover a lot of american values as well criticisms of them irving did focus quite heavily on england for many of his stories as well but his writing was a foundation for american literature as well as coopers
books,not_removed,heller
books,not_removed,it by stephen king setting aside the horrific antagonist the novel paints the reader a nearly palpable experience in derry maine taking you foreward and backward through time as seamlessly as walking up and down your driveway in the morning to collect the paper while at the same time delivering top notch characters with intimate and detailed histories once you pick this book up you will never forget pennywise the clown or bill and his friends as they confront the embodiment of their decrepit and dying town
books,not_removed,if you want to just base it on how well it portrays a certain era of america and its people then i think youd also need to consider little women by louisa may alcott she captures the broad experiences on a family especially its females as they fumble through the ordinary parts of life just after the civil war most of all it continues to be relevant in ways that people dont often consider jos story especially captures what so many women continue to encounter the oft debated glass ceiling and general social pressure to be feminine or the bell jar which could have been the fate of a jo in the for me it read like a women who wasnt ruled by her emotions and the expectations of others for women but she gave it a try got swept up and it literally made her crazy for trying to do what society thought she should
books,not_removed,as i lay dying by william faulkner
books,not_removed,the scarlet letter by nathaniel hawthorne i thought this one should be mentioned trying to pick an objective great personally i would probably pick something by vonnegut sirens of titan or god bless you mr rosewater damn it babies youve got to be kind
books,not_removed,spiderman
books,not_removed,the sound and the fury
books,not_removed,what is american novel i seriously dont know
books,not_removed,this is what i came in here to say its a tossup between this and mason dixon at least for me i think pynchon has an impressive grasp on america and the anxieties of the nation throughout historical events against the day was also fantastic in this regard and you could probably argue it for the answer to this question as well i think the recognitions by william gaddis also has a strong case for being the great american novel
books,not_removed,i love that book but i think if were talking great american novels then id pick light in august or the sound and the fury for faulkner
books,not_removed,thank you can you suggest one
books,not_removed,last question is american novels hard to understand
books,not_removed,thanks
books,not_removed,do not post shallow content im sorry but your post currently counts as shallow content do you have something else to say about the book that you could edit into the text preferably your own thoughts about the book or at the least a description of the book without spoilers let me know if you edit it i can reinstate your post
books,not_removed,if im not mistaken danielewski also did house of leaves check it out if you havent already
books,not_removed,sorry i misread the shallow comment rule as more of an antibot measure i dont have much to add on the matter as i have not read either of these books yet ill delete my post
books,not_removed,thats what got me into danieleski in the first place
books,not_removed,the goal of the shallow content rule is to make sure theres something for the community to respond to either the thoughts of op or some questions that cant be answered with yes or no
books,not_removed,removed story already posted

books,not_removed,im gunna leave it as a coffee table book and hope someone one day gets the reference what is the reference
books,not_removed,the book itself is a reference to the dark tower
books,not_removed,ahh ok
books,not_removed,this spent several of my younger years as my very favorite book when ive reread it since ive started rereading it backwards as in i start with the rocket and end with the veldt not like each word in reverse order of its appearance i recommend it as a practice it flows better
books,not_removed,thats a cool idea i think ill give it go after i knock a few more books of my toread list

books,not_removed,funny you mention stephen king i am going through the stand right now i was talking to my so about it the other day part of me wonders if randal flag was all that bad he was pretty straight up with people while mother abigails people were lying to their own people randal helped his people out of tight spots while abigail s people had to fend for themselves basically if i were in that situation and had survived i would have told both sizes to pound sand they were both dicks
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,so the duffer bros say stephen king is one of their biggest influences but not a single king book on this list so many references to it in stranger things the body what stand by me was based on has the same feel el reminded me a lot of charlie from firestarter as well as the doe being quite a bit like the shop from the same novel
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,summer of night anyone
books,not_removed,wow they are mentionning the lost estate my favorite book ever background i am french and always wondered why i never found any referende to this masterpiece oustide of france i can somewhat see how this book might relate to stranger things but dont expect a adventure the whole story takes place in another area and does not have the vibe we love anyway for once that this book is mentionned i just wanted to share it with you guys this is a gem
books,not_removed,it was like if king wrote etclose encounterspoltergeist mashup
books,not_removed,agreed the show owes kings the mist and fire starter but it also borrows heavily from danielewkis house of leaves i liked st quite a bit but i think that knowing these works st loses out on originality
books,not_removed,i also got an it vibe from the group of misfits quite similar to the losers band
books,not_removed,i dont quite see how it borrows heavily from house of leaves you might have just as easily said it borrows heavily from the yellow wallpaper at the mountains of madness or the lion the witch and the wardrobe you could probably have listed any book really or as many books as you wanted to stranger things draws from a great many sources the others check powder check bmx bandits sure why not good storytellers always borrow ideas storylines and characters its what they do really youd be hardpressed to think of an idea that has any semblance of originality and thats not just a sign of the times its always been that way truly original ideas come about only by accident and they are incredibly rare events
books,not_removed,especially with the slingshot edit also the very first scene of the series was quite similar to the beginning of the stand
books,not_removed,truly original ideas come about only by accident and they are incredibly rare events there arent really any new ideas but there are original executions
books,not_removed,i reread your response and repeat that i agree with you one of my favorite authors is neil gaiman and his work is almost entirely derived from myth i also appreciate his response to interview questions about the similarities between his comic books of magic and the harry potter books which came out after you are correct in that pure originality does not exist and again i really enjoyed st but i could see the inspirations quite clearly
books,not_removed,i agree with you the st has multiple influences the ones you listed are certainly there that said the scene with wills mom viewing the gate in the wall of the living room then running outside to check the architecture of the house the government explorerspelunker the maze the monster as minotaur the booming the show stranger things borrows heavily from house of leaves
books,not_removed,indeed nice reference i havent thought of that even though ive read the stand twice until you mentioned it
books,not_removed,the description sounds like something by georges perec life a users manual maybe that was an entire novel of turning mundane minutae into something mildly rhythmic a touch poetic and part of something much bigger
books,not_removed,deleted
books,not_removed,im about of the way through it at the moment i find it strangely compelling and kind of creepy im not sure i could explain why though its definately not a book i could read for very long in one sitting i can quite easily see why people would hate it
books,not_removed,and havent disliked a book that much since probably nell zinks the wallcreeper wallcreeper was fucking trash i loved bennetts pond though
books,not_removed,hmm i find it very odd that you can absorb from an audio book faster than you can read most people can read text at a higher pace than a narrator can read a book out loud im not sure about what your difficulty is if you are simply a slower reader as in you read word a second while an audio book narrator can read words a second perhaps the only strategy is to practice reading more and faster the more you read the faster your pace of reading becomes and eventually i believe with most people they can read words faster than they can listen to a narrator since with reading out loud the bottleneck for most people lies in how fast you can pronounce words not how fast you can read them if your difficulty is that you can absorb content faster aurally instead of visually as in you understand a story when someone is telling it to you faster than when you read it a good strategy would be to try and mentally read out loud when you are reading if you can imagine the words being pronounced it might help you absorb it faster finally i realized that with your favorite authors some of them are really really hard to read ayn rand fills atlas shrugged with long winding rants that completely break character and earnest hemingway fills for whom the bell tolls with faux broken spanish these books are really really hard for a reader to read and visualize so perhaps listening to them is easier to absorb
books,not_removed,i love to read in the bath and in bed at night
books,not_removed,it depends what you are reading and the purpose for reading it if its for research into an area you already have some degree of expertise in then you can take more liberties skimming and scanning for pertinent information
books,not_removed,this subject has been very popular in the past please use reddit search andor check the rbookswikifaq
books,not_removed,theres a story i think by robert heinlein where someone is bragging how fast their kid reads the child this guy is talking to says something like i had that problem too it took me forever to slow down to words a minute or some ridiculously high number the point being that for comprehension slower is better it doesnt have to be a race for what its worth i think ra lafferty had the same thing going on in primary education of the cameroi a wonderful short story about a group of school board members from earth who visit cameroi a planet of super geniuses its hilarious
books,not_removed,when listening to ab a book in with my eyes closed can be gone through comparatively reading a book may take a week im most interested in imagining all the details as fast as possible and between those two are perspectives reading become confusing for me words dont become tangible enough for me tell me what you do when you come across an interesting excerpt and you continue reading but in the back of your mind you just want to just go back and reread over and over that line im obsessed with wanting to feel touch the meaning of the text by understanding it fully and i just cant yes the vocabulary they use i dont know the definitions id imagine for people that have read for decades they pick up every word know every definition the hidden meanings the authors true reasoning while enjoying the words
books,not_removed,i do like that idea do you gather everything to make it perfect or can you just hop right in and begin
books,not_removed,true for me i take all reading in a form as research learning philosophy enjoyment its a anxious disorder theres always something to run across and im too scared to skip over it so i just make sure to read it once what about you
books,not_removed,oh i know it began not what the title says something on the lines of is the voice of an audiobook better than how your brain reads are audiobooks the subtitles of movies
books,not_removed,i just make sure my book is ready in the side and a glass of whatever my chosen poison is that night sometimes some tea light candles and then away i go best off having a towel nearby incase of accidents

books,not_removed,my sister did this with instructional books on jewelry making and she hasnt really made much or anything
books,not_removed,thanks for sharing this its interesting to hear about the experience of aspiring authors‚Äîi think its something that i take for granted every day good luck with everything
books,not_removed,sad as it is for many writers who dont people very well selfpublished authors have to promote themselves putting it on amazon is only the first step in a very long walk
books,not_removed,i have a friend who does all right he sells books a month but he has a dozen titles all self published
books,not_removed,we do not allow selfpromotion on rbooks your post might be better suited for rwroteabook or a similar subreddit
books,not_removed,fair enough
books,not_removed,how about some shakespeare reading romeo and juliet and king lear at school were some of the first books that made me curious lord of the flies and animal farm are other books i remember reading at school that i really enjoyed reading those books was the start of my interest in literature and probably a pretty good inroad to enjoying classics
books,not_removed,i really loved great expectations by charles dickens i found it fairly easy to read and it was a great story also if you like something a bit strange and funny which could also change your life read some vonnegut one other recommendation if you want to read something beautifully disturbing then read nabokovs lolita the language flows so nicely and the story will make you feel both disgusted and yet sympathetic at the same time it is truly a masterpiece
books,not_removed,hmm sounds like the problem is maybe more the time period than anything else longer sentencesparagraphs and unfamiliar sentence structure and maybe words that are not in common usage any more or is it a difficulty because of the setting like you have no context for the politics or social mores of the daythough i think ulysses is probably a struggle for most pride and prejudice isnt difficult to follow storywise perhaps take it in steps going back in time by publication date audiobooks can also be very helpful since many times its the rhythm and intonations of the language that can make the words easier to figure out a good narrator can really be helpful with that and it helps if the plot is easy to follow or fun or you already know it stuff like the three musketeers king solomons mines ivanhoe and while you say youre not talking about young adultchildrens books you might actually start with a few childrens classics just to get accustomed to the language i think youll find many of them have more sophisticated language than youd expect for children books like black beauty little lord fauntleroy the story of the treasure seekers have simple stories that are easy to follow which will make getting used to the language easier plus theyre pretty short if its more about the history then i highly suggest reading the wikipedia page for each book or author before you read the book please dont worry about spoilers classics are never about the plot twist and then exploring links you find there to get a feel for the authors time other than that you can always read some history books and some basic philosophy or find classics that are annotated
books,not_removed,try a christmas carol its written in that oldfashioned way that seems to give you trouble but its like really short
books,not_removed,please post recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or the weekly thread
books,not_removed,so what can i do to expand my area of interest im sure that there are good books out there that i would enjoy but i can never find myself interested enough to pick them up thanks im not sure youll like this answer but the first step of the solution is to browse around pick one up and read it try browsing various sections of somewhere where you can see and flip through actual books like your local library or bookstore im sure youll find one that looks interesting
books,not_removed,read books in different genres that still have something in common with books you like so if you like call of the wild and white fang for something besides american history and historical fiction you could read about modern travel writing or stories set in alaska or the yukon wilderness survival memoirs or stories books where animals are the main characters mythology about wolves books with werewolf protagonists books about animal behavior or wildlife conservation other jack london novels according to wikipedia he has a dystopian novel books about sailing and the south pacific and books about workers rights plenty of variety there you might find a new topic you enjoy if there are authors you already really like give everything they wrote a try even if its in a different genre than youre used to then if you liked any of what you read of the above branch out even more if you liked say books about alaskan fishermen you might get into books about sailing in general if you find you like yukon survival books try survival books about other places desert islands jungles postapocalyptic wastelands war zones whatever interests you you could move from reading about the yukon to reading about the arctic or the siberian tundra or the mongolian steppes which could then stimulate an interest in oil exploration or ice age fossils who knows and so on and so on your interest in different topics will grow naturally keep at it what type of movies tv shows or video games do you like you could try finding books that are similar to other media you enjoy
books,not_removed,i had similar issues as you until recently what i did to expand my horizons was to grab a literary list of the best novels in recent memory and just slog through it everytime i feel as if im treading familiar ground too much i grab a book from the list and start reading i follow this its a list of books recommended by professionals from various fields theres also httpthegreatestbooksorg and
books,not_removed,well i mean setting has little to do with the authors voice although some genres are quite limiting try and see what you liked about those kinds of books i started out only liking some fantasy books until i realized that it was world building that i was really interested in so i expanded to science fantasy and fiction of course im also interested in alot of books for alot of different reasons which bleed over into alot of different genres
books,not_removed,really the only thing is to walk around the library check out blurbs and backcovers and pick something that looks interesting beyond that you can google best and check out various lists and pick up some stuff that sounds good ive recently made a point to read more books by women so i did that and got a bunch of good recs even from places like npr flavorwire and even buzzfeed rfantasy has a bunch of lists and recommendation tools for exploring that genre
books,not_removed,i like to go into an independent bookstore you could try a chain but i find it works best at an indie store and talk to the staff when i was trying to break into adult fiction thats what i did something along the lines of i really like reading x y and z what would you recommend that i try in and then give their suggestions a go they wont always be right but i find i often love the books suggested to me
books,not_removed,i think a good tip would be to find other genres that intersect with genres you enjoy perhaps try some sort of fantasy novel for instance a song of fire and ice has a lot of their own made up history added in and i believe the author george rr martin got a lot of inspiration from battles and actual history its got dragons but besides that its all realistic and it has a massive scope these are huge books with a large story to tell really entertaining to read also
books,not_removed,asoiaf just set me off on a fantasy binge even more so a fiction binge its been fiction straight for years basically haha im in mistborn universe right now damn
books,not_removed,that was awesome

books,not_removed,i like admire this guy do people generally follow your rules either that or they go home people either have to follow the orderly processes here or theyre asked to leave what am i supposed to do sit here as the owner of the bookstore and put up with some miscreant the customer isnt always right i am people dont like that they think i should be groveling‚Äîi dont grovel edit changed the lword in his honor

books,not_removed,sounds like a lovely bookstore actually he has a lot of the same pet peeves as i do about peoples habits in bookstores
books,not_removed,i would really like such a bookstore in my area for those who have read the article
books,not_removed,that guy is a pretentious dickhead i would rather just go to barnes and nobles and thats saying something because im all for supporting mom and pop stores usually at least bn lets me browse in peace
books,not_removed,i read anthem but it was about years ago so i dont remember it very specifically what i do remember though is that i did not like it at all i did however really like the giver it was my favorite book when i was younger so it is interesting to me that you would make this comparison even though as you point out there are very clear similarities again i dont remember very many specifics from anthem but i think the difference that stands out to me is that the giver is much more openended ayn rand saw herself as both a novelist and a philosopher and so her books are written to illustrate her philosophy and world view the giver on the other hand is more subtle and was not written to make a specific point but to tell a narrative that asks questions without definite answers also what i disliked so much about anthem was that its conclusion was that the ego was most important of all that individualism was more important than community the giver does not make that conclusion jonass society was called the community but the one of the biggest issues was that they had taken all of the meaning out of its relationships his heroic act at the end of the book was not one of defiant individualism but an effort to try to restore the realness of relationships within his community
books,not_removed,havent read the giver but i am halfway throught the movie now that you mention it i do see a lot of parallels
books,not_removed,i feel like the giver and anthem are similar in some major points throughout the story however the story of the giver continues on through three more books gathering blue messenger and son if you havent read lois lowrys whole quartet of this series i would say theyre worth reading you will get more out of the message when the stories of all of the books tie in together at the end also its interesting to try and connect the dots throughout the stories anthem is a stand alone novel that packs a powerful literary punch to the heart both anthem and the giver are short and really make you think and consider the world we live in and how different things would be if we lived in those sort of societies upon finishing the giver you are left with burning questions which is the same feeling you get after finishing anthem however with the giver you have three more books that will answer your questions and leave you with a more solidified outcome at the end of anthem the best you can do is reflect and imagine the different possible outcomes from the scenario given in my opinion anthem left more of an impression and the incredible story was enhanced by the style of writing ayn rand used which was very precise and brief id say and absolutely beautiful
books,not_removed,wow fantastic i didnt even think of that jonas escapingwas in hopes of everyone seeing colors equality was just in it for himself and others like him now that you mentioned it anthem is kinda of a strange read i guess i enjoyed it so much because it was unlike most things ive read
books,not_removed,ugh im years old and first read the giver when i was i waited years for this movie to be made and was sorely disappointed do yourself a favor and read the book
books,not_removed,i had an english teacher made us spend most of the school year reading anthem the foundtain head and atlas shrugged talk about indoctrination oddly enough as an adult i would often go sailing with him and through conversation found he is an ardent liberal now im not sure if he was trying to convince of us to love or hate ayn rand
books,not_removed,bout the same age and just found out a couple years ago that it has other books in the series have you checked them out
books,not_removed,i thought the book was kinda meh when i read it somewhere around that age too i didnt pay attention to the plotline all that well wasnt appealing i was only intrigued by how they didnt see colour from the best of my knowledge the book never bothered to explain it i was disappointed in that even if it was a movie i didnt want to watch it based on its premise so you can imagine my opinions at the time when the teacher was pitching this book where i wouldnt want to even bother watching it for hours let alone reading it for weeks
books,not_removed,yeah i found out several years ago and just havent gotten around to getting them its rare i read anymore birthdays coming up i should start dropping hints to folks lol
books,not_removed,if i recall correctly it was explained with sameness
books,not_removed,thats awesome good for you for sticking to that

books,not_removed,i see eschaton as a sort of parody of the wargames children make up and of the extreme physical and mental demands made of children at eta the rules are so complicated that you need a computer out there on a trolley with specialised software to keep score even though the game is played just by lobbing tennis balls at clothes on the floor will help you with the acronyms without spoilers
books,not_removed,dont mind me
books,not_removed,did you even bother to search theres hundreds of threads and literally a new one every day asking about it and even entire subreddits devoted to it
books,not_removed,agreed the eschaton chapter probably has less to do with remembering all the minutiae and is more of invitation to emerge yourself as far as your imagination will let you having read it a few years ago i remember more about that chapter than any other and its probably because my mind was in overdrive trying to imagine the scene

books,not_removed,i loved him as a teenager i liked his books because there was this grittiness to them that i couldnt find in stephen kings novels this sort of sadistic perverse darkness that as an adolescent i found really thrilling his books are rather cliched but in a really charming way kind of like old horror movies its been a while since ive read him and i might actually unearth my old paperbacks and give him a whirl above all i remember having a lot of fun with his books
books,not_removed,ive read a couple of them the woods are dark was good while reading it but fairly unmemorable i liked darkness tell us i particularly liked the explanation about how its a lot harder to dismiss fears about whats lurking in the dark when you dont have electric lights which is one reason why a lot of socalled primitive cultures believe more strongly in the supernatural ive been wanting to read quake the cover makes it look like disaster schlock but thats how all covers were designed back then so one cant really tell also on my list is one rainy night and resurrection dreams the latter is about an egyptian mummy
books,not_removed,i read the cellar and the woods are dark and thought his pacing was excellent and there was some great bgrade entertainment i followed up with resurrection dreams and didnt care for it i gave up reading the traveling vampire show because i was into it and almost nothing of significance had happened the reverse of the pacing i thought he was great at in the earlier books i think ive had my fill of laymon the way everything is always tied to sex is also annoying he adds a paragraph about putting on a seatbelt because it gives him the opportunity to talk about how it fits between a pair of breasts he adds a paragraph about a woman leaning over the table to get some ketchup so he can describe how her breasts accidentally graze a jar of pickles sexuality is awesome but this is just juvenile and obnoxious
books,not_removed,darkness tell us is another of my favorites love the twist the supernatural elements as well as the central relationship and the main characters are all english majors so you cant go wrong there one rainy night is decent as is resurrection thats not the one about the mummy though youve got it confused with to wake the dead quake is pretty good also probably my favorite of the ones you mentioned aside from darkness
books,not_removed,good to know thanks
books,not_removed,the fact you skipped over ketchup tells me we should never eat in front of each other
books,not_removed,i will put a book down if the first sentence doesnt immediately thrill me since i dont get to read very many books purely for pleasure i have no time to waste on a book whose every sentence isnt a delight
books,not_removed,ive always thought of doing this sort of an idea as a podcast once a month everyone reads the same three books a great classic a best seller from the previous month and then a cheap crappy book that costs a quarter at the local rummage place get drunk discuss apparently thats not a podcast people would want to listen to and no one wants to do it with me
books,not_removed,tipsy book review
books,not_removed,whoa dude that sounds fun as hell lol count me in

books,not_removed,please post recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or the weekly thread
books,not_removed,had our independent bookstore broken into a few years back pretty boring overall we never leave money in the store and always leave the cash register open for that very reason so they came in through the back roller door pried it open with a carjack i think kicked in the back store door door seperating the back storage area and the main store seemingly wandered around and left nothing stolen at all since there was no money so we bent the roller door back into shape and landlord paid for a new door latch police said it was a known guy who did it had gloves nothing could be done and life went on
books,not_removed,that is the most overwritten thing ive read since my college creative writing course
books,not_removed,nice piece but i cant help but be confused by the tips at the end i dont know of any thief wholl stop to make sure the bookstore theyre robbing is or isnt independentlyowned
books,not_removed,stealing books is a centenary practice it is not a good practice though in some cases it can be deemed respectable as it may come to constitute a form of redistribution of our greatest wealth but even in a trade like this one there is a code of conduct any bibliopirate worthy of his or her guild must follow at least three norms never steal a book by an author who is still alive never steal a book published by an independent press never steal a book from an independent bookstore i really dont like this bit
books,not_removed,apparently theft is honorable so long as it lives up to their totally subjective standards lmao theyre all for the free flow of information so long as it doesnt take place with them involved
books,not_removed,wonder if they have any dictionaries containing the word robbery
books,not_removed,when i see pics of the they are immediately identifiable i think this photo has the same level of identifiability but for a different category i cant put my finger on it though
books,not_removed,for a good seconds i thought it was separate photos
books,not_removed,no victims no suspects no witnesses it is just a thing that happened not to be pedantic but the bookstore would be the victim in this case its also not a robbery no one came in with masks and guns during posted store hours this is a commercial burglary burglary is the act of breaking and entering with the intent to commit a crime
books,not_removed,really angry about this post how about never steal from a bookstore any as much as i love my indep stores here in manhattan i am disgusted by the idea that someone would think stealing a book from say bn is ok if you dont want to buy a book go to the library
books,not_removed,my neighbor has one of those charming little community libraries set up in her front yard all the books get stolen about once a month
books,not_removed,at least they didnt take the espresso machine its the main source of income of independent bookstores and bookends and mugs with quotes on them
books,not_removed,the fuck is a bibliopirate
books,not_removed,nice and all but until the thief is caught and killed justice hasnt been done
books,not_removed,youd think with all those books around them on a daily basis theyd know the difference between a burglary and a robbery
books,not_removed,how about they invest in cameras and better insurance cameras are cheap
books,not_removed,thought it was two pictures
books,not_removed,never underestimate the tacoma creatures someone walked out of my front door with our tv while my roommate napped downstairs at least thats the story he told me when i came home and our tv was gone
books,not_removed,usually inside job learn to not keep money in drawer over night learn to leave drawer open over night for robbers easy see no cash so they dont break your stuff most expensive part of robbery is the repairs to doors drawers and windows not the actual money
books,not_removed,they werent robbed they were burglarized
books,not_removed,aww man i love brazos this sucks
books,not_removed,because we are part of the book community which has no borders the boutique bookstore goes for the throat fucking savage
books,not_removed,i feel bad that they were robbed but the flipped birds just kind of ruined it for me
books,not_removed,implying redistribution of wealth is a good thing
books,not_removed,so narcissistic crime happens to everyone no one is special or passed over cause theyve got a love for what they do in fact that should make it easier to take as they didnt take what you love only money fucking get over yourselves this is no different than knocking off a closed gas station
books,not_removed,now they hit reddit which is the meta cash
books,not_removed,they have a book i want guess they are getting my support
books,not_removed,ironically the best place to hide your money is inside books because they never get stolen by these kinds of people if these assholes read more they would not have to steal
books,not_removed,independent bookstore in my city was victim of a broken water pipe in an appartment above the store they had to throw away a lot of their unique collection of books damage between to ‚Ç¨ luckily they worked very hard to be open again fast and they got a lot of support so everybody who can support the store above do so source in dutch
books,not_removed,peace among worlds
books,not_removed,tbh if you load a truck full of college textbooks and then offload them online you could probably make a decent amount of money pretty innovative though illegal way to source books
books,not_removed,you know the thieves werent very smart the book store probably had valuable books or collectibles that would have been worth more than the registers contents
books,not_removed,people coming together makes me feel good inside
books,not_removed,this article was difficult to get through they dont even say if anything was taken and then the rules for stealing it like targets bookstores like barnes and nobles but dont touch our little independent store thats against the rules
books,not_removed,houston
books,not_removed,thats a lot of hipsters
books,not_removed,they were just getting ahead lol
books,not_removed,i bought a book to support my fellow independent book press fellows im going to go swing down to my local indie store as well and have them spread the word gotta help each other when things get crappy might help discover some local writers too like the awesome poets on button poetry who are published in indie bookstores across the country book
books,not_removed,watch out weve literally got a badass over here
books,not_removed,their soap boxing at the end made the whole thing feel cheap stealing books is a centenary practice it is not a good practice though in some cases it can be deemed respectable as it may come to constitute a form of redistribution of our greatest wealth but even in a trade like this one there is a code of conduct any bibliopirate worthy of his or her guild must follow at least three norms never steal a book by an author who is still alive never steal a book published by an independent press never steal a book from an independent bookstore vl brazos bookstore bibliopirates why not just say dont steal all together is it okay if i go steal a book from barnes noble also why cant i steal from an indie bookstore
books,not_removed,wow look at all those pissed off hillary clinton voters
books,not_removed,when your bookstore gets burglarized robbery is a crime against persons burglary is a crime against property
books,not_removed,why is seth rogan working at a bookstore now i cant be the only one who sees it
books,not_removed,the number of commenters taking the writing piece at the end literally is kinda scary oo
books,not_removed,i would rob you again look like a bunch of losers
books,not_removed,someone tried to burn down a bookstore and i helped with clean up day it was freedom press in london anarchists and left wing shop and second time its been fire bombed no one was caught but they get targeted by far right a lot sadly thier insurance had ended but upside lot of people got it i and running again
books,not_removed,whos to say that they didnt do it themselves and reap the benefits from the free publicity
books,not_removed,just made this account because of this article ive been stealing books since i have books totaling to tax not included ive only stolen from big book chains and while i agree on only stealing from nonindependent stores i do not believe in stealing books from only authors who are not alive anyways i always thought we were called biblioklepts i dont think bibliopirates are anything more than common thieves stealing from the registers they dont really want the books
books,not_removed,you cant steal ebooks just saying
books,not_removed,do landlords usually have to pay for shit like this
books,not_removed,keeping the register open this is how you can save some much money on a robbery if they are willing enough to break in they will smash break steal your register to get inside leave it open for em
books,not_removed,they could sell the books hahaha they dumb af
books,not_removed,one of those ethical burglars that only robs from the filthy conglomerates
books,not_removed,i think the funniest bit is that no one would have robbed that place why would a bookstore have money and if they do why leave it there overnight it was very likely an inside job probably an ex worker
books,not_removed,its okay to steal if its not from us thats the way i read that
books,not_removed,yeah if they want our greatest wealth they can go to gutenbergorg like a civilized human
books,not_removed,its so cringy im a nerd i do nerdy things and im not ashamed but this reads like it was written by someone who has forgotten where pretend things end and reality begins
books,not_removed,i think she was just trying to make them feel better
books,not_removed,its the standard stealing from big chains doesnt harm anyone thinking which is unfortunately mistaken
books,not_removed,the person who wrote that should have their house burglarized and all their possessions taken errrr redistributed
books,not_removed,why do some people automatically try to make independent equal unsuccessful i mean wouldnt amazon technically be considered an independent bookseller and independent book publisher who just happened to branch into a few other businesses
books,not_removed,i thought it was funny ¬Ø„ÉÑ¬Ø
books,not_removed,im just finishing atlas shrugged so this makes me more angry than it would normally
books,not_removed,yeah robbery and burglary are two different things if theyd been robbed it would have been a lot more traumatic
books,not_removed,hahaha cant stand this either
books,not_removed,the dream of the is alive in portland
books,not_removed,it took me through the article and to this comment
books,not_removed,i just scrolled up to check the photographys as poorly done as the article
books,not_removed,didnt read the article but i just wanted to point out the gender symmetry of the photo k bye
books,not_removed,interesting there are several around my neighborhood that always seem to be well stocked
books,not_removed,library i thought
books,not_removed,also took place in texas
books,not_removed,on the run from johnny law aint no trip to cleveland
books,not_removed,if they are the ones who wrote this article i have very little faith in their reading and writing abilities ot photography skills
books,not_removed,its one thing when a teen does it in a facebook pic to look edgy its another when your book store gets robbed you hope the perp will see the pic
books,not_removed,nah they may be the purveyors of only the finest products of the human race in all their inky papery holiness but these dudes and dudettes just sell the things id be pretty pissed and if all these people wanted to do to express annoyance was pop a finger up then rock on book bros
books,not_removed,sips on rose petal himalayan tea
books,not_removed,literarily
books,not_removed,oh come now theyre berners for sure
books,not_removed,this is copypasta or im having serious d√©j√† vu or im psychic
books,not_removed,why is it ok to steal from nonindependent book stores but not independent book stores theyre both businesses they book had to pay money to get those books in their store the only bad argument is that well the big store has so much money theyre rich it doesnt hurt them and again that is a bad argument
books,not_removed,curious whats the difference in stealing between the two businesses do you not see stealing a living authors work as hurting them isnt the information in the book the most valuable part
books,not_removed,im not sure what the proper term is but it im selling an ebook and youre only supposed to be allowed to read it if you pay and you find a way to read it without paying you did something wrong call it stealing call it theft of digital property the laws havent quite caught up yet to the technology but its getting more and more clear that digital stuff is just as legit as physical stuff
books,not_removed,middle of the night no cameras no witnesses they knew it was the same guy as a stack of other breakins in the area since they were all done in a similar way but didnt know who he was they sweeped the store found absolutely nothing useful so theres nothing they could do to help
books,not_removed,knowing someone committed a crime doesnt magically land them in police custody
books,not_removed,when they say yeah we know this guy they mean probably fuckin dave again theyd still need other evidence to link him to the crime judges tend not to go for probably
books,not_removed,it is not about what you know its about what you can prove in court
books,not_removed,my guess is that they thought they knew who had done it if they knew for sure ie had evidence then theyd had done something about it having a hunch isnt enough for conviction
books,not_removed,cops think of the usual suspects in their minds however they know he leaves little to no evidence and only crime is b e no no use in arresting anyone
books,not_removed,just fyi robbery is assault during the commission of theft example beating someone up then taking their money burglary is breaking into or entering a building without consent with the intention to commit assault theft or any felony
books,not_removed,this exact same thing happened when my car got broken into cop told me that they had a very good idea who did it and that there was basically nothing they could do because there were no witnesses and no real evidence the arrest is only part of the process the other part is getting a conviction you cant get a conviction without some evidence and actual evidence is thin on the ground in a lot of breakins
books,not_removed,its not a robbery just sayin
books,not_removed,when i got carjacked at gunpoint in jackson ms the cops told me oh we know those guys and put up their pens and pads never heard from them again but literally found my truck in a gas station parking lot the following summer which was pretty coolinteresting
books,not_removed,had gloves just because they knew read were pretty sure who did it doesnt mean they had enough evidence to arrestconvict
books,not_removed,courts require solid evidence unless he outright confessed then there isnt really anything that can be done
books,not_removed,dude its crazy this is a throwaway known burglar nothing can be done about me i wear gloves and a mask victims have given my first and last name to police nothing i drink and take lots of drugs known as a nice guygal if someone steals from you beat the shit out of them with your friends if they want to fight then shoot them police are a joke
books,not_removed,it helps that it was a police matter and not the bookstores fault the bookstore made an effort to help by bending the door back thats why they get the rent
books,not_removed,no commercial rentsleasesat least here at extremely focused toward benefiting the owners the peoplecompany who have the lease pay for absolutely everything window damage broken doors broken ac units the only things the owners pay for are structural and concrete damage the pros of having a land developing father haha you get lots of useful advice about weird niche stuff only reason landlords paid in our case was they were behind on a huge number of things and we had bargaining power
books,not_removed,plot twist he was stealing to feed that family and now they have medical bills
books,not_removed,na buglers want easy stuff books are heavy and worth almost nothing and collectible stuff requires knowledge and patience to work out on top of that any collectible thing they take from us is likely to get them caught we are a smallish town and the only secondhand bookstore if they steal collectible stuff from us and try to sell them we can find them easily like i said in another comment our house got robbed in march the burglers took all the really valuable easy to sell stuff and only went into the lounge and left literally missed a jar of money my gf was saving in the kitchen a camera and a bunch more all missed because they wanted easy to sell and easy to carry stuff
books,not_removed,now come up with a good method on selling hot books without getting caught
books,not_removed,more free advertising perhaps if so good for them independent book stores can definitely use it
books,not_removed,front page karma
books,not_removed,if modern day robin hood needs books i think hed even skip the chains and just download ebooks
books,not_removed,i actually knew a guy who committed grand theft larceny he and the crew he worked with really did only hit major chains not only were they guaranteed to be insured anyhow but the crew actually didnt want to hurt the little guy
books,not_removed,it works when stores hang a sign that reads dont loot black owned though
books,not_removed,yeah i loved the whole not from independent book stores oh so you mean stores like yours how convenient
books,not_removed,dont steal from living authors that logic is dumb as fuck
books,not_removed,its okay to steal if its not from us thats the way i read that im shocked at the number of people who are okay with stealing from large faceless corporations i wonder if they realize or care that most of the investors in large companies are regular folks who have invested through their retirement funds
books,not_removed,exactly or you can always just use local library
books,not_removed,why would i go to gutenbergorg to read gravitys rainbow
books,not_removed,i agree with the logic of everything you said stealing with accordance to those rules probably minimizes negative utility lesser evil if you will be stealing anyway but i think things like this have no place being posted on a public page of the independent bookstore it almost sounds like they agree with it while comfortably shielding themselves from possible ethical thieves by being independent bookstore themselves and whats this with the fancy capitalisation and wording bibliopirate worthy of his or her guild wat if you steal things you are a not some fancy fighter for the redistribution of our greatest wealth in some cases it can be deemed respectable as it may come to constitute a form of redistribution of our greatest wealth nope and even for books in public domain someone still had to format the text arrange it into pages sometimes illustrate print and bind it then deliever to the bookstore
books,not_removed,in common usage theyre synonyms and many dictionaries reflect that
books,not_removed,it really isnt the sudden influx of people in the last years have made homes unaffordable fucked traffic and driven a good chunk of the iconic local businesses under for more profitable corporate fare
books,not_removed,born oregonian here fuck portland
books,not_removed,same here we have one in our front lawn and so many people dropped books off that my husband had to build a bigger box
books,not_removed,yep very different teenagers have the somewhat valid excuse of being in a hormonal development stage but these are supposedly adults lets hope those assholes get a chance to learn the difference between burglary and robbery
books,not_removed,nothing evokes my sympathy like a bunch of ignorant clerks making obscene gestures at me
books,not_removed,you forgot the whiskey
books,not_removed,cant we just agree that stealing is wrong in general the moral exception is when you dont have enough food to feed yourself so you steal some i wont judge someone for that but stealing is kind of shitty
books,not_removed,nothing useful what a dropkick books are always useful he should a have swiped a couple
books,not_removed,sort of like when they know of a mob boss but have nothing they can legally pin them with
books,not_removed,also knowing who did it doesnt mean theres enough evidence to convict someone
books,not_removed,god damn it dave
books,not_removed,what part of town were you in
books,not_removed,not a second of sleep was lost that night edit i reread the comment jesus umicroham his family go for the guy responsible sure but youre kinda fucked fam
books,not_removed,bugling is not really that easy
books,not_removed,im sorry that must feel awful but most books are pretty good value if they desperate enough to rob a store they could sell them at pawn shops or online i love books btw i was just commenting on the story
books,not_removed,now heres a thought is the publicity and financial gained worth more than whatever was broken if so im just saying businesses do all kinds of things for profit
books,not_removed,no no robinhood distributes what he steals so he breaks into barnes and nobles to steal books he scans and uploads
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,and yet this logic is the very basis of copyright pretty much all over the globe the duration of copyright is defined relative to the authors death they are pretty progressive with death or backwards if you want to see it that way since copyright was once more like that for example lifeofauthor in france in the late century edit just realized that the rules might not be intended for pirating books exclusively the term bibliopirate threw me off and i immediately assumed ebooks if it is indeed meant for physical books dumb is the right term
books,not_removed,whats dumb about not wanting to steal from living authors but being ok stealing a dead persons writings
books,not_removed,or how many jobs corporations create or the good many of them do for community
books,not_removed,isnt that the place where hobos go to use the free computers and rub one out
books,not_removed,i will always check my library first and make a point to pay for books i love
books,not_removed,because everyone at the library will know you read those pages about eating poo
books,not_removed,youd go to libgen for that that way youre not stealing already purchased goods from a book store
books,not_removed,thanks for commenting your thoughts and opinions are important
books,not_removed,youve just described almost every major metropolitan area in the world post
books,not_removed,or covering his tracks harambewasaninsidejob staywoke
books,not_removed,then again based on some thread i read yesterday apparently the police rarely do anything in the case of robberies exactly right on top of the story i had my house broken into back in march cops came in next day did a fingerprint sweep even showed me where there were marks in the dust that showed he had gloves no witnesses middle of the day nothing they could do
books,not_removed,federal state or crown prosecution services are operating on very limited budgets and cant generally afford to prosecute cases that are unlikely to end in a conviction its pretty hard to gather enough evidence to actually incriminate a person in a robbery while they say its a known person how do they know beyond a reasonable doubt that it was that particular person and not some other robber in addition even if they do successfully convict the punishment for robbery is so small that its almost not worth the time to go through with an actual dedicated robbery conviction unless theres a lot of robbery sentences or its part of a bigger trial in canada youll get six months or a fine for committing robbery itll cost a lot more than that to successfully bring this person to trial it just isnt costeffective to try people for robbery most of the time
books,not_removed,burglaries not robberies the cops get very pissy about robberies burglaries are much harder to deal with because of sharply limited information unless youve got actual evidence pictures or whatever or someone saw themgot their license plate number the cops have little ability to catch the person
books,not_removed,its a little ambiguous too there may be a string of robberies utilizing the same method but they dont know the guys name just that its the same guy it could also mean they know exactly who did it but there isnt anywhere near enough proof to even bring the guy in
books,not_removed,i would say the bad part but thats a bit redundant it was right by state st and medgar evers blvd
books,not_removed,cue epic crime wave
books,not_removed,sorry there is a cultural misunderstanding here i keep forgetting that other cultures dont believe in the merits of kin liability going after someone doesnt change their behavior it just makes them angry this is why incarceration hardly works going after their family always makes them comply it is morally okay because rotten apples fall from rotten trees the family of an offender has to be at least as horrible as the offender especially the parents who raised them the person who agreed to be such a horrible persons spouse and the children they have raised themselves in their rotten ways
books,not_removed,online maybe but have you ever tried to sell a mass market paperback to a pawn shop youd make more money trying to sell it in a yard sale
books,not_removed,there arent any numbers given to draw any sort of conclusions so if you are pessimistic youd wonder but lets hope this was a feel good or feel better story
books,not_removed,or he just seeds his torrents like a true hero
books,not_removed,nope cant say ive ever stolen something from a store in my life especially stores with things that i enjoy and want to stay open
books,not_removed,because stealing is stealing youre mostly harming the bookstore and partly harming the authors family or whoever the author gave the rights to basically if its not yours taking it without permission is wrong thats how our society functions
books,not_removed,our library just instituted a fee for using the computers if you dont have a library card probably for this very reason
books,not_removed,no its the place with three good books and maybe ten bad ones and a few tenyearold computers too but hey you can order like at least five other good books if youre willing to wait a few weeks
books,not_removed,wasnt the writer the owner or employee they did write the headline edit lol
books,not_removed,jimmiesrustled
books,not_removed,yes people make mistakes and that person took the time to correct them
books,not_removed,its amazing what you can do when you put your mind to it
books,not_removed,moral of the story wear gloves wait i meandont rob people because its bad nice save
books,not_removed,sounds like a good opportunity to rob yourself for a bunch of high value items and call the insurance company if they wont even investigate
books,not_removed,yeah thats a pretty tough part seems like there was a shooting on medgar evers at least once a week when i lived there i got a gun pulled on me by a crackhead in the roses parking lot on clinton blvd once several years ago
books,not_removed,was that supposed to change my opinion because x is still zero zero seconds of sleep zero fucks given ill sleep like a baby
books,not_removed,the family of an offender has to be at least as horrible as the offender exactly how far does this go are grandparents and grandchildren implicated aunts and uncles first cousins cousins cousins all of humanity comes from a common ancestor so by this logic you must be at least as horrible as adolf hitler and joseph stalin right
books,not_removed,it was intended as a joke borders failed and barnes noble has to really branch out in what they sell including listing third party items online like amazon does the point being that chains need equal respect as independent stores
books,not_removed,before this goes too far im defining textbooks as cash grabs instead of actual books
books,not_removed,the limit set up by copyright law is too far after the death of the creator in my opinion
books,not_removed,if youre stealing from a bookstore then the store is the only one to suffer not the publishers or authors family because they already got paid for that book by the store stealing is still wrong just thought i would point that out
books,not_removed,im not saying its ok to steal books from bookstores but i dont think its morally wrong to steal the text of books whose authors are dead because i think lifetime is a reasonable length for copyright
books,not_removed,spooks c
books,not_removed,sure but there are degrees of wrongness in the case of stealing i would argue that the level of wrongness is directly related to the pain and suffering it causes its more wrong to steal a loaf of bread from a single mother with no other food for the week than it is to steal a loaf of bread from walmart for example we could go a step further and add consideration of the thiefs motive a single mother stealing a loaf of bread from walmart to feed herself and her children is less wrong than someone who steals a loaf of bread from walmart as a lark
books,not_removed,hey you got two bucks for a bit of booze dont lie to me buddy thats two bucks for xhamster isnt it
books,not_removed,this is reddit what is logic and how do i purchase it
books,not_removed,and dont do anything that warrants a dna test
books,not_removed,this would make it insurance fraud the company would probably push for you to be tried
books,not_removed,ironically insurance companies are a lot more thorough than cops a lot of the time while investigating theft i believe a lot of them require you to have basic antitheft measures like security systems and theyll send their own people to investigate and make sure it actually does look like a legit robbery they probably keep an eye on you afterwards too in order to make sure you are not in fact committing insurance fraud
books,not_removed,as far as you need to go to reestablish law and order
books,not_removed,i dont think anyone is going to contest that
books,not_removed,i agree but that doesnt make stealing ok
books,not_removed,something something jean valjean i agree however i cant really see a justification for stealing from a bookstore
books,not_removed,like leaving a note taunting the police i left my dna everywhere but wore gloves so you cant dust for prints with the sugar from your doughnuts youll never catch me because you pigs are too lazy to do a dna test youre just fools who show up and cant do anything to help because of your laziness why do you even bother to show up when people call ive left my dna everywhere but you wont do shit wait a second you could hire some tourist not your handwriting to write a letter like that and keep it in case youre ever robbed handle it with gloves and keep it fingerprint free would this work would the taunt be enough to get them to do a dna test they might not believe a robber would write them a note like that
books,not_removed,if i can only fap to completion midburglary what business do you have telling me not to
books,not_removed,but how would they find out if robberies are so poorly investigated
books,not_removed,i know its fraud if the police dont investigate they would never even have a reason to suspect me
books,not_removed,so how are the philippines this time of year
books,not_removed,for reals unless they had some valuable one of a kind edition and it went of like a certain casino heist movie than i dont see the point of robbing a book store someone call nicholas cage
books,not_removed,ahhh too bad you licked the envelope you just dun fucked up seriously dont taunt the cops the thing is that we can process an insanely small amount of dna the size of your thumb print is more than enough to give tons of dna to do a profile also handwriting profiling is pretty bogus but having some stranger write a note for you taunting the cops is pretty memorable if its a weird enough of a crime the person will definitely be like say thats the note i caught esp if they get codised over it
books,not_removed,its not lazy to not do a dna test unless there is blood or other bodily fluid or left behind clothing or hair obviously not a residents theres no point theyd get results matching everyone in the house far more than they would the robber and anyone who had visited in months maybe years
books,not_removed,well my ma is in forensic anthropology with an emphasis in genetics so sucks to be you as this is my business
books,not_removed,the insurance fraud department does their own secondary investigation
books,not_removed,a previous room mate of mine had long strawberry blonde hair every once in a while i am mercilessly attacked by one even though she moved out almost years ago
books,not_removed,this is a good point i agree
books,not_removed,can confirm almost before the fire was out when my stepdads horse barn burnt down right at the height of the last recession when a lot of people were burning their stuff down to get out of making payments the insurance guys sent their own people in to have a poke around
books,not_removed,sounds like you have a hairy situation on your hands and everywhere else too
books,not_removed,i thought moby dick read like a precursor to pynchons style but i havent read much else of herman melville so im not sure if he always wrote like that or if it was a one off
books,not_removed,pynchon was the first the last and the only to write in his pynchons style but that applies to almost any author i neither have read anything of gaddis but i guess his style is distinguishable from pynchons similar works of authors who experimented with narrative structures whose works were published before pynchons first novel and therefore might have influenced pynchon could be john hawkes the cannibal william burroughs naked lunch or samuel becketts molloy among many others
books,not_removed,hes only like gaddis in so far as they both are uncoventional writers i find them both very unique in their own distinctive ways very difficult to compare them otherwise unless you are just talking avout personal preference
books,not_removed,unconventionality stream of consciousness timeflipping odyssey like adventure strict prose and maximalism are not things pynchon did first pynchon however is the only person who can write like pynchon which mostly has to due with subject matter the extreme perversions arent even original humans have been writing down crazy sex stuff since people found the time to write and draw crazy sex stuff so no but he is the one and only pynchon
books,not_removed,there are many similarities between gaddis and pynchon recognitions came out twenty years prior to gravitys rainbow the two works of theirs i find the most similar however there is no evidence that i can find that pynchon had read recognitions before writing gr in recognitions there is without a doubt a very pynchonesque style that precedes pynchon but whether or not this actually affected pynchon who was presumably taking speed and psychedelics in his weird garret somewhere is unknown i can say with some confidence that both writers were influenced by joyce
books,not_removed,i think all writers take at least some influence from writers who came before them wikipedia said httpsiimgurcomhaccaslpng
books,not_removed,i adore mieville easily one of the most imaginative writers around id recommend the city the city as a starting point
books,not_removed,i just finished reading the last days of new paris i found it a hard slog at times and contemplated putting it aside several times in the end i was glad to have stuck with it an oddly beautiful story
books,not_removed,im currently reading his short story collection three moments of an explosion my favorite story of his so far though is reports of certain events in london which i read in a different collection i also liked his dial h comic run
books,not_removed,now flip it around and imagine a horror novel written by dr seuss
books,not_removed,blaine is a pain
books,not_removed,are those children laughing or screaming
books,not_removed,but we all know its by claudia inez y bachman its all gone
books,not_removed,see you later alligator after a while crocodile dont forget to write blaine the mono
books,not_removed,thats strange i swear i had a copy of this as a child but it was written by claudia y inez bachman
books,not_removed,my first car was a magenta saturn named blaine because it was always breaking down and trying to kill me i am currently pregnant i absolutely need this in my life yes i know not to actually read this to my baby unless i want him to become a sociopath but by god i will use him as an excuse to buy a kids book am i the only one who found it hilarious that its flagged on amazon as a best seller in childrens books about trains
books,not_removed,the best part about blaine is his all caps rage
books,not_removed,next stop topeka

books,not_removed,i pray for the holy god bomb to descend from on high and wipe clean this nightmare train say god say god bomb
books,not_removed,blaine the pink ass locomotivated motherfucker ok so as i wrote that i got to thinking is it possible king invented blainecharlie a crazy train because of the word itself locomotive loco i have deep reservations about the movie
books,not_removed,blaine is the scariest character in a book ive ever read it still haunts me years later
books,not_removed,i have to assume the he did not write the book comments are from the ones who just looked at the book cover and not read the article i would have loved to read this book as a child though think i may still pick it up
books,not_removed,okay so all at once i learned about the near release of a children book on charlie the choo choo and the movie adaptation of the dark tower god i should really have electricity installed in my cave
books,not_removed,oh man the ignorance in this thread is so badddddd i laugh everytime someone says stephen king did not write the book pahahahaha
books,not_removed,for the love of bob read more than the first paragraph of an article
books,not_removed,i love how the majority of the commenters didnt even bother to read a tiniest bit of the article rbooks my ass
books,not_removed,forgive my ignorance but is beryl evans a pseudonym for stephen king
books,not_removed,i dont think this is new i think this is the same charlie as the one in book three of the dark tower series its even using the same illustrations
books,not_removed,blaine is a pain
books,not_removed,already did before he wrote it wanna hear a riddle
books,not_removed,that train is stoned

books,not_removed,looks dank af
books,not_removed,blaine is a pain
books,not_removed,jack torrance should have been the pen name

books,not_removed,anyone here ever read the dark tower books this is kind of cool
books,not_removed,this man has scarred my life tt
books,not_removed,i love how the majority of the commenters didnt even bother to read a tiniest bit of the article rbooks my ass
books,not_removed,dude your really just jumping around saying people arent intellectually curious do you get off on that shit look at your post history and tell me you dont have anger issues barley been on reddit a month and youve already talked that much shit get a life
books,not_removed,til the work dolorous i thought it was a typo so i googled and now i know what that dolorous means feeling or expressing great sorrow or distress
books,not_removed,am i the only one not feelings these illustrations charlie is just very obviously evil and i always pictured him as much more subtle in his malevolencethe whole are the children crying or screaming thingthis just really comes across as a horror story about an evil train
books,not_removed,herr is a different horror story congratulations today is not your day youve got brains in your head but you feel like youre dead youve got feet in your shoes but they wont move you can steer yourself in any direction but instead you stand there frozen in rejection as you melt into your couch hearing there is no place for you and knowing everybody ignores you no doubt your zip is zapped your pop is snapped depression mounts as you sit in your house no meaningful contribution no signs of resolution oh the places you wont go thanks in advance for correcting my grammar
books,not_removed,i think im going to have to save this thread as proof that even in rbooks people cant read
books,not_removed,classic stephen

books,not_removed,why do i suddenly remember tuturu the tank engine
books,not_removed,it wasnt written by king
books,not_removed,this isnt by stephen king
books,not_removed,googled it says the book was written by a beryl ethans
books,not_removed,is anyone going to point out that this book is clearly not written by stephen king only recommended by him edit ahhah makes sense now
books,not_removed,stephen king didnt write this you twit
books,not_removed,misleading title
books,not_removed,book wasnt written by stephen king
books,not_removed,does the train use children as fuel
books,not_removed,please stephen just stop
books,not_removed,im confused i may be missing something here but is this book actually written by king or does it just have that quote saying if he wrote a childrens book it would be just like this
books,not_removed,how exactly is this a book by stephen king
books,not_removed,cept its not by stephen king
books,not_removed,its not by steven king hes just quoted on the cover
books,not_removed,why does the article say the book is by stephen king triggered
books,not_removed,not by stephen king though
books,not_removed,its not written by him though
books,not_removed,the only thing written by king is the blerb on the dust jacket
books,not_removed,long long ago but not too far away was the land where the spoochies frolicked and played they danced through the fields through the meadows theyd run near the stone on the hole the first spoochy came from it was so long ago that no one remembered the story of how came to be their first member but no spoochy cared or gave it a thought for spoochies were hardly a curious lot so when the stone on the hole gave a shudder not one single spoochy made much as a mutter none of them knew what this motion portended the tenthousandth day had finally ended now all the sweet spoochies were asleep for the night all huddled and snuggled and bundled just right dreaming the dreams that all spoochies do of eating floop pudding in their spoochy canoes but little spoochina the youngest of all awoke with a start to a noise down the hall she shivered and shuddered then slipped out of bed and crept to the door with a feeling of dread with each step she took a malevolence grew erasing her thoughts of those spoochie canoes the darkness expanded and swallowed her whole it crushed all her bones and tore at her soul it flooded her mouth and wrapped round her spine split open her skull and entered her mind oh the horrors the darkness let in an endless progression of madness and sin she wriggled and twisted and screamed through the pain but the darkness pushed deeper till nothing remained for an infinite time or perhaps just a moment what once was spoochina succumbed to this torment and then in an instant as quick as it came the darkness relented and something remained the something knew nothing of spoochie canoes of snuggles and cuddles or tooty kazoos black pits for eyes mouth like a slit dreams of floop pudding meant nothing to it nightmares composed this sinister shade murder and madness and torture its trade joints cracking backwards the creature did rise extended its hands fingers like knives and leapt towards the bedroom with staggering speed where brother and sister were still fast asleep it burst through the door and onto the bed snatched up dear brother and bit through his head onto sister fell what remained of his jaw the rest of his flesh hung from somethings black maw sister awoke to this startling sight my god spoochina she bellowed in fright through dear brothers flesh the thing tried to speak but all that came out was an inhuman shriek heat blasted forth from its mouth into space and melted the skin off of sweet sisters face her liquified body sloughed onto her brother as the thing left the room to find father and mother the floorboards buckled and cracked underfoot behind flowed a streak of crimson and soot it licked at the smell of the sweat and the fear and followed the sound of the whispers and tears there huddled before it clutching each other were the cowering forms of father and mother foamflecked and wild they whimpered and stuttered pleading for mercy they wailed and they blubbered they offered it all the floop pudding it craved they cried out to their gods st spoochbert and dave they hoped someone heard them but nobody could just a hole in the world where their daughter once stood the dark drew them in their eyes were transfixed as it peeled back its skin and opened its lips revealing the evils too deep to behold from the dawn of time to the end of the world no spoochys mind could outlast that strain they fried and they snapped and they both went insane clawing and biting with unholy power pop turned to ma and began to devour he plucked out her eyes and swallowed them whole he gorged on her feet and chewed off their soles his mouth filled with meat till he couldnt hold more then he coughed and he choked and he died on the floor the carnage complete the house sat in silence a hellish expanse transformed by the violence the thing glided forth slick on the ground down the dirt road and into the town it poisoned the meadows and blighted the fields it burned up the lake where the floop canoes wheeled it gobbled the children and all the old nans till not one single spoochy was left in the land when it was over the thing returned home to the edge of the wood to the hole with the stone it rolled back the boulder peered into the black and slunk down the hole to never look back deeper and deeper down the pit oh so vile it sank to the bottom and spat out the child blinded by agony she writhed in the dirt the last of the spoochies just madness and hurt no one can say for how long she lie at the bottom of the earth or how she survived but through some cruel twist of fate she lived and then up from the depths of her gut sprang him perfectly pink fat as a lamb happy and bouncy and ready to jam a wee baby spoochy a picture of health had somehow emerged from inside herself she reeled back in shock and clutched at her chest to see such a pure thing to her was grotesque her mind warped by all of the torment shed seen she flung him away with a jerk and a scream up up through the earth he flew above him a sliver of light grew and grew he reached out and pushed that stone plug at last and flopped out of the hole and into the grass my my he said as he looked all around i suppose im the first spoochy that ever was found this meadow looks lovely the floop plants abound and a lake for my tooty kazoo canoe rounds he decided to settle here in this land and though he was lonely he had a plan he remembered a girl spoochy down in a hole hed go and get her and make her his own and life would be pleasant and theyd have a brood theyd live on floop pudding in spoochy canoes the whole world before them theyd have their way nothing would hurt themfor ten thousand more days edit im editing up here now i cant add links cuz im out of space ill figure it out edit wow first gold glad everyone enjoyed it ill try to finishexpand the story a bit today i understand the ending is a bit abrupt and the characterization of the thing is underdeveloped edit to those brave souls that want to illustrate this absolutely if anyone actually does this i will definitely um flesh it out into a full on childrens nightmare book edit yes shriek is better there are a few word choice changes ill make im gonna leave the original alone though edit wow more gold letip ledoot letcetera i have done a few more stanzas in the front as a setup working on tying it all together now goal is still before halloween ends but im pst so some east coasters and beyond might get cheated edit i finished it apologies for the formatting ill fix it later hope its everything you all imagined edit fixed formatting and moved the complete work to the top of the post edit obligitory frothing gold comment im not going to do it this instant but i plan to link everyones contributions here so everyone can see and listen to all the cool stuff youre all making apologies if any spoooooooky ghost edits mess up your recordings im still trying to ah diversify the word stock edit anyone knows any publishers that release this kind of thing let me know hard to find a childrens book publisher that would deal with this content the original post all the sweet spoochies were asleep for the night all huddled and snuggled and bundled just right dreaming the dreams that all spoochies do of eating floop pudding in their spoochie canoes but little spoochina the youngest of all awoke with a start to a

books,not_removed,i will stab him in the guts and i will stab him in the nuts i will stab him in the eyes and i will stab him till he cries
books,not_removed,watch the babadook for that kinda thing that shit is fucked up
books,not_removed,so a bad shroom trip
books,not_removed,i personally love roald dahls adult short stories
books,not_removed,you mean everything seuss wrote wasnt already a horror
books,not_removed,and that is the truth
books,not_removed,first thing i thought of when i read this article i have not read the books in a couple years i think i will now
books,not_removed,why did the dead baby cross the road because it was stapled to the chicken edit since this is such a poor taste joke anyone who hasnt read the related stephen king gunslinger book series this joke is directly related to another evil train just fyi
books,not_removed,he wont play silly games
books,not_removed,yes they are
books,not_removed,dont ask me silly questions i wont play silly games
books,not_removed,good eye i like how observant you are
books,not_removed,you bet
books,not_removed,hopefully im not telling you things you know but this is from the dark tower series king describes this scene in the book and implicitly says that the children look like theyre laughing at first but if you look too long you cant help but think it looks like theyre screaming
books,not_removed,screaming in a spasm of laughter
books,not_removed,and joined the manson family
books,not_removed,cocanie sounds perfectly harmless for a childrens book get in my cart kids ive got some cocanie
books,not_removed,thomas the cocaine engine
books,not_removed,my first thought was of the thomas the tank mod for skyrim but with the creepiness dialed way up
books,not_removed,dont you think stephen king looks unsettling i will scare you he always says yeah well you dont need to write books to reach that particular goal
books,not_removed,yeah manhattan restaurant of the mind right i miss that store
books,not_removed,see the turtle of enormous girth on his shell he holds the earth his thought is slow but always kind he holds us all within his mind on his back all vows are made he sees the truth but maynt aid he loves the land and loves the sea and even loves a child like me
books,not_removed,richard bachman is another king pseudonym
books,not_removed,gotta take care of the chap right
books,not_removed,see you later alligator after a while crocodile dont forget to write
books,not_removed,kill us if you will but command me nothing the gunslinger roared fuck that book was good
books,not_removed,heres hoping idris brings it to the role
books,not_removed,it was stapled to the chicken
books,not_removed,take that you dopey f
books,not_removed,they cant possibly fit it all into films each book needed more than hours
books,not_removed,knowing kings fondness for popular music i wonder if he based it on going off the rails on a crazy train
books,not_removed,i like the casting luthor actor is just perfect and the fact that it will be alternative reality continuation so they cant really destroy the books if it is bad since it will be a separate story but the way movies are made recently it might not be good i would much prefer a high budget tv series like westworld game of thrones or at least walking dead on the other hand it wont be worse than the cell movie they made recently which was a low budget disaster
books,not_removed,just think of it as an adaption to the world another roland in a different world still on the wheel following the path of the beam if you want it be perfect to the books it will just break your heart ive been thinking about it and i like to think its just roland on the wheel like tries ago so it wont be what sai king wrote exactly just a different view if that helps any
books,not_removed,but a lot of people hate it i really think idras elba is gonna be a fucking great roland his presence as an actor just dominates the screen as i invision roland would
books,not_removed,pretty sure he was inspired by thomas the tank engine series as a kid the pics of that smiling engine creeped me out
books,not_removed,yes it is the artical even states this edit im leaving it maybe itll shame me into better spelling
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,rtfa this entire thread is making me weep for humanity how can people in a subreddit about reading be so antiintellectual and not even bother clicking on the link to read the article
books,not_removed,the article says basically exactly this in the paragraph
books,not_removed,it is the same book the illustrations are new but match the descriptions written in the text for example note that the children on the cover look to be screaming not laughing
books,not_removed,that is the point king actually created the childrens book he referenced in the series it was only jakes book in the printed text of the dark tower before
books,not_removed,from the article youre commenting on both the book and evans appear in the third installment of kings dark tower series the waste lands published in
books,not_removed,a lot of dark tower characters are in his other works its kinda his thing
books,not_removed,rtfa bro
books,not_removed,right not new at all jake of new york has a history with charlie
books,not_removed,this thread is stoned
books,not_removed,rmadlads
books,not_removed,i really dig wolves the next book song of susannah is where i felt the lul in the series regardless its definitely worth finishing
books,not_removed,do you want scared children because this is how you get scared children
books,not_removed,this isnt really an adaptation just the embodiment of an already existing story within another story
books,not_removed,yes one of kings characters wrote it for him
books,not_removed,if you learnt to read you would find it is king wrote it under the pseudonym beryl evans
books,not_removed,and this is what beryl looks like
books,not_removed,oh you want to bet
books,not_removed,i take it you have never read the dark tower
books,not_removed,yes it was read the second paragraph of the article
books,not_removed,he wrote it under a pseudonym many writers do this king has written under a couple including richard bachman and beryl evans
books,not_removed,because he wrote it he wrote it under another pen name and commented on it as mr king
books,not_removed,because of the way it is
books,not_removed,so are you unable to read or just unwilling
books,not_removed,in stephen kings dark tower series there is a book called charlie the choo choo written by beryl evans so yeah stephen king wrote this book
books,not_removed,i cant tell if youre kidding or serious and only looked at the pictures
books,not_removed,considering this is rbooks you should probably read at least sentences of what youre commenting on
books,not_removed,you didnt read the article i see
books,not_removed,dumbass
books,not_removed,except it is
books,not_removed,it is by stephen king its a reference to blane the mono in the dark tower series by king its a book that jake buys from a nyc bookshop which enables them to beat an evil monorail in a riddling contest sounds crazy when you write it down lol
books,not_removed,didnt read the article did you
books,not_removed,because it is
books,not_removed,how
books,not_removed,who is it by
books,not_removed,read the articlethe second paragraph
books,not_removed,it helps to read more than the headline
books,not_removed,he wrote it under a pseudonym the article clearly states this
books,not_removed,and if you took another to read the article you wouldnt be making a fool out of yourself
books,not_removed,the hell have you been
books,not_removed,i lost it at tooty kazoos really did not expect how dark this got all the sweet spoochies were asleep for the night all huddled and snuggled and bundled just right to her melted body sloughed onto her brother as the thing left the room to find father and mother happy halloween

books,not_removed,welcome to dr seuss bsides edit nailed the possessive form misspelled name
books,not_removed,i loved this and wanted to edit it nightmares are from what this creature was made this line could bear rewording maybe nightmares the base of this creatures make murder and madness and torture its stake joints cracked backwards the creature did rise extended its hands fingers like knives this was the most confusing point in the whole thing maybe cracking joints backwards something did rise extended its hands and its fingers like knives anyway just having fun here enjoyed this a lot edit oh meant to add that this reminded me of nothing so much as roald dahls revolting rhymes example as soon as wolf began to feel that he would like a decent meal he went and knocked on grandmas door when grandma opened it she saw the sharp white teeth the horrid grin and wolfie said may i come in poor grandmamma was terrified hes going to eat me up she cried and she was absolutely right he ate her up in one big bite

books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,this is absolutely incredible so perfectly grotesque and horrifying if this gets illustrated and published i am definitely buying it
books,not_removed,i love it but if im being totally honest i liked your earlier edit more when it stopped with the creature leaving to find father and mother i think its a lot scarier being left open like that rather than wrapping everything up in a neat little looping bow thats just imho of course
books,not_removed,i really enjoyed this have your upvote
books,not_removed,why does he think hes the first spoochy if he knows about spoochina
books,not_removed,damn it got even better

books,not_removed,this is amazing corey taylor should narrate this
books,not_removed,if drseuss were a serial killer this is what he would write and why is the second saint just named dave i normally dont enjoy long post but this one is well worth the read
books,not_removed,very well done
books,not_removed,wow just wow thats so well done just saw this linked from another sub and i had to comment just to a express my appreciation for your talent and b make sure i have a easy way to link back to this im going to read it to my wife later for sure
books,not_removed,im also going to have a go at illustrating it commenting now so ill remember the spot
books,not_removed,i was thinking about your title and if you have little spoochina by in a single line with seen here wearing a frightening toup√©e following itd still follow the rhyme scheme a little food for thought
books,not_removed,but all that came out was an inhuman screech that is fucking awesome well done but may i humbly suggest shriek
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,and i will stab him till he cries so only once for most people
books,not_removed,holy shit story idea where a serial killer is mentally challenged be back in a couple years
books,not_removed,and i will call him george
books,not_removed,no this time you will not get away this time you are going to pay extract your eyeballs with a pair of plyers no longer will you read walmart flyers
books,not_removed,say thankee sai
books,not_removed,ruth
books,not_removed,reread them last year and currently working through the latest comic books id better add this to the list
books,not_removed,blaine is a pain and thats the truth
books,not_removed,i pull this one out when bad jokes start happening at parties it gets good reactions unfortunately its my only joke
books,not_removed,they are yes
books,not_removed,they are ruint
books,not_removed,he knows of course he knows we all know we all follow the beam
books,not_removed,he lacks the swastika carved into his front end
books,not_removed,i wish i could give you gold
books,not_removed,that sounds really wrong out of context get in my cart kids ive got some cocanie
books,not_removed,that was owned by the guy with the deli right where that big tower is now
books,not_removed,its a reference tothe dark tower series by king
books,not_removed,heres a name suggestion mordred
books,not_removed,i rode that train for years waiting for wizard and glass conceptionrelease wikipedia says it was about years between those two but it felt like longer
books,not_removed,i hope so the directingediting scares me as well the way theyve framed it maybe thats better than going with the books as they stand but man im nervous
books,not_removed,people get so angry when i tell this joke its like i stapled their baby shit in their shoe and told a really bad joke all at the same time but i love it
books,not_removed,ok so as i wrote that i got to thinking is it possible king invented blainecharlie a crazy train because of the word itself locomotive loco dark tower spoilers they arent its a sequel and as far as i understand it the first film takes elements from all the books and it looks like the film series will do that for the sequels as well were getting a similiar story but in a different order of events for example in the trailer roland is shooting at a giant rat in the woods with jake this is clearly supposed to be a nod to the wastelands where roland eddie and susannah encounter shardik the bear guardian in the woods the rat is also a guardian so the story is flipped around a bit it seems i wouldnt be surprised if the first film ends with the man in black supposedly dying like in gunslinger and eddiesusannah being introduced in the next film that being said i am also worried
books,not_removed,well wizard and glass is going to be a television series in so well get a tv series out of it
books,not_removed,oh lord so much wrong here tell me how idris elba is perfect how on earth is a swole black dude just perfect for the pale gaunt sick and dying roland described in the books not to mention the fact that he is clearly white its a weird discomfort hollywood has with not having enough diversity but i wish they wouldnt mess with cannon like a characters physical features also i read somewhere this is to be a movie then rolled down into a tv series also the cell wasnt recently it was around years ago now and visually it was pretty amazing if need to watch it again to see how it aged
books,not_removed,inspired by thomas the tank engine you say its hard see the connection between them you sir have the observation skills of dried apricot
books,not_removed,artical
books,not_removed,so he made an authors blurb for his own book wouldnt that be cheating
books,not_removed,whats a bindlewurdle
books,not_removed,ya it says so in the article actually
books,not_removed,i did read the article and it does not say anywhere other than the title that stephen king wrote it i was wondering if this was a mistake or if it was accurate is it possible that people who jump down strangers throats over simple questions of clarification that are more poisonous to humanity
books,not_removed,this is reddit most of the time people dont read any of the article let alone the second paragraph
books,not_removed,the cover is not that picture was in the trade edition of the wastelands
books,not_removed,it is clear that you are lazy and not particularly intellectually curious because you didnt even bother to click on the link and read the article where this is explained in detail so why are you in this subreddit you clearly most certainly do not actually read
books,not_removed,rwastelands
books,not_removed,awesome ill try to pick it back up again i actually wanna reread the whole series
books,not_removed,not saying it is i just want a childrens book adaptation of christine now
books,not_removed,oh my bad i didnt realize thank you for clarifying
books,not_removed,this is rbooks not rreadingfullarticles you may be asking too much of reddit
books,not_removed,thanks for explaining much appreciated
books,not_removed,mindfreaaakkkkk
books,not_removed,you would think that the people at rbooks would read better the book is by beryl evans king has only commented on it
books,not_removed,steven king
books,not_removed,oh well then thats awesome
books,not_removed,st spoochbert and dave is where i lost it this was fantastic
books,not_removed,or we could just go with the cat comes back which i always found pretty terrifying
books,not_removed,theres no words its perfect
books,not_removed,did you if so thanks i was going to but work got busy
books,not_removed,just got a message so maybe well get to see that
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,now wheres that meme i was looking for
books,not_removed,you asked for it
books,not_removed,this pleases me greatly
books,not_removed,definitely let me know if you do id be floored to see someones visual interpretation of this i can do many things but drawing isnt one of them sadly
books,not_removed,for the sake of all of our inner demons please do
books,not_removed,good to know i did this on mobile so i have no idea what the formatting looks like on desktop is it that bad i can edit it if its terrible
books,not_removed,paging uawildsketchappeared
books,not_removed,just because you asked so nice
books,not_removed,i legit read it in the voice of the narrator from the grinch i lost it at tooty kazoos
books,not_removed,someone did a reading of this in rbestof id link it but im using bacon on mobile
books,not_removed,thanks i almost went darker with some more explicit mind rape imagery but realized that i made her the littlest spoochie and most people would have basically a cindylou who thing from hertrying to keep my fun reddit verses free of child rape mind or otherwise
books,not_removed,it was st spoochbert the brave until the very end i didnt like how the singular of gods sounded so i needed a one syllable name that rhymed with brave all praise be to dave
books,not_removed,careful with that can of worms
books,not_removed,those revolting rhymes were my favorites as a kid im recalling the one about the pig eating the farmer preemptively i do like the original and think youve done a great job with the poemstory
books,not_removed,you zeroed in on a couple lines that bothered me the most good eye i went with nightmares composed this sinister shade i still havent quite got the second i see where youre going cracking instead of cracked is definitely better although im unsure about the word flip i really want arose instead of did rise but then i lose my rhyme knives exposed would handle that but i like knives at the end to run into the second half of the stanza
books,not_removed,i figured since this all started from steven king hype and dark tower is all hip right now id base the story on a cycle
books,not_removed,neither vincent price yo
books,not_removed,you called it bro
books,not_removed,good one im not editing this comment but im working on a rewriteexpansion later today id love to finish this by tonight for a true halloween horror story experience im also changing pushed further to pushed deeper becauseimplications
books,not_removed,glad i could help i didnt do anything huge for halloween today so this is my way of getting in the spirit
books,not_removed,good catch on the first autocorrect its vs its is the worst on the second the cadence matching depends largely on how much you pause after the comma following so the rest of the line has an every third syllable accent so buhbuhbahbuhbuhbahbuhbuhbahbuh if you pause slightly after so that should match up perfectly that being said there are some imperfect cadences still in here im debating whether a little more natural feel is best or if i should really try to lock it in perfectly
books,not_removed,each generation even moreso
books,not_removed,i am pretty terrible with titles most of my music is the song i was actually going to ask for title suggestions in an edit what ive got the littlest spoochie the last spoochie spoochina meets the darkness a spoochy in the dark minor variations of those possibly adding the tale of or the story of in front suggestions are very welcome
books,not_removed,its really kind of surreal to me just how many people this post hit even now i can refresh the page over and over and the votes keep going up and down i wish i could see a percentage this post is getting a lot of downvotes maybe a bit too much for some anyway im glad you love it ive probably read through it times since i posted making sure the meter is right and the words arent repetitive we live with the spoochies now for a while
books,not_removed,ha if you want to set it up and administrate im fine with that you can be producer or publisher or whatever probably a tough sell without illustration samples people probably want to know what theyre backing im gonna focus on finishing honestly it probably only needs to be twice as long to feel complete look for updates later this evening edit or four times as long
books,not_removed,the first bit of the post before the edits took about minutes im a songwriter and id describe my method as channeling sometimes something sparks and i see the whole thing laid out before me so i just stream of consciousness start going thats why the formatting sucks and i double some words im doing this on mobile so i only see tiny chunks at a time this was a fun exercise though i havent written anything besides music since middle school
books,not_removed,send me a pic if you do id like to see that
books,not_removed,all good i got mah goldz if you enjoy it thats enough for me
books,not_removed,if you end up doing this youll be the you only i got a few pms and several comments here but so far no one has illustrated anything other than the one drawing done the day i posted i was just randomly talking about this yesterday my brotherinlaw was asking if anything ever came of the post ie did i publish or find an illustrator because he was considering doing storyboard style sketches just to get something going i might do my own vo there are several online already from others but as the original author id like to try my own i cant even draw stick figures so im lost there really appreciate any effort you make im honestly still floored this connected with so many people id love to have something more put together to put out next halloween since this whole thing was a halloween post to begin with cheers so glad you enjoyed the post
books,not_removed,yes and i humbly accept the note if this gets published some crazy how someday ill make sure to put all the helpful reditors in the acknowledgements
books,not_removed,there are a few cadence things i would change and some word repetition i fired this off in like minutes in the end people seem to love it so i dont want to fuck with it ill expand it in another postcomment
books,not_removed,im having a very bad day so i have to thank you for that much needed laugh
books,not_removed,i would honestly read that i hope no one steals your idea
books,not_removed,do you know that king had a pretty similar idea to this and wrote a book called blaze
books,not_removed,say thankya big big
books,not_removed,are the comics good ive read tdt prior and always wanted more background more stories
books,not_removed,i like stopped after the book where they throw plates at doctor doom robots anything good afterwards
books,not_removed,dont ask him silly questions
books,not_removed,my only joke is equally as dumb but blaine would have gotten it whats the difference between beer nuts and deer nuts beer nuts are deer nuts are under a buck yuck yuck yuck lol
books,not_removed,are they yes
books,not_removed,cranum no yes mr blakely yes
books,not_removed,roont
books,not_removed,god i need to reread this series and its been less than a year when i read it first so good
books,not_removed,its probably hidden behind that top headlight
books,not_removed,wish granted you can
books,not_removed,you can just click give gold and follow the instructions on your screen
books,not_removed,i mean no context is really appropriate for that
books,not_removed,but hes not wrong
books,not_removed,what did you make of wizard and glass i personally thought it was absolutely outstanding but i didnt have to wait six years for it
books,not_removed,so glad im not the only one who tells this joke
books,not_removed,what trailer
books,not_removed,not the cell just cell with john cusack and sam jackson just came out was terrible
books,not_removed,from my understanding the movie is suppose to take place after the books the storyline is reset once he passes through the door yet again and things have changed roland isnt necessarily exactly the same every time he passes through the door nor is the world around him
books,not_removed,the pale gaunt sick and dying roland described in the books you do realise this isnt the same story from the books right that was cycle this is cycle its a totally different story totally different stuff happens the drawing will be different theres absolutely nothing in there saying roland will be gaunt or pale or sick or dying its kind of the entire point of the books that things are different every single time
books,not_removed,it says a lot about our society that if you have a problem with elba in that role you must be racist i love elba but hes not roland the movie is clearly going its own way and im a little disappointed id love to see something closer to kings vision
books,not_removed,clint eastwood is roland now that hes too old it really doesnt matter who they cast
books,not_removed,its a weird discomfort hollywood has with not having enough diversity but i wish they wouldnt mess with cannon like a characters physical features hold on let me get this straight you are asserting that changing the races of white characters so that can be played by minority actors is the problem with hollywood this is bizzaro land level irony
books,not_removed,im beginning to think theres tons wrong with demanding that the race or sex of an actor hold them back from what fictional characters they play especially when the original creator is still alive and doesnt have a problem elba will do the role justice if you need the actor to fit the description of words on a page written over years ago then i dont think theres any pleasing you anyway edit to clarify id understand your point if it were about susannah whose race is an undeniably driving factor in her character in the books ive got trepidations about how theyll handle her in the movies but rolands race had no effect on the overall story at all
books,not_removed,have you seen luther the way he walks talks and behaves is just like i imagined roland would he is an amazing actor i bet he can play sick and dying when needed
books,not_removed,i am of course talking about the book which jake found about blaine the mono not the actual computer blaine gee lets see both have anthropomorphic trains who can talk have creepy smiles king specifically says blaine was supposed to entertain kids but the kids were afraid of it there are multiple stories of kids being scared of thomas
books,not_removed,haha yeah i fucked that one
books,not_removed,rkenm
books,not_removed,i think its hilarious
books,not_removed,a made up word that one vogon jeltz put into a poem he read to some space stowaways before executing them via airlock
books,not_removed,thanks
books,not_removed,the article was pretty clear honey
books,not_removed,hell i dont even read the title anymore what are we talking about
books,not_removed,this is rbooks not reading
books,not_removed,well its kinda hard too see an article through the ads especially on mobile
books,not_removed,if you read the article or look through the thread youd know he used a pseudonym for this and the book even directly pulled from his dark tower series
books,not_removed,beryl evans is kings pen name
books,not_removed,dude read the article he wrote it under a pseudonym
books,not_removed,that wasnt in the original version i read the fact that he actually kinda topped the original with the edit is pretty crazy no kubla kahn this
books,not_removed,the cat comes back new alternate title to httpsenwikipediaorgwikipetsematary p
books,not_removed,i learned not too long ago that the cat comes back was another of his cold war allegories which made it a lot less scary than the concept of voom was to me as a child
books,not_removed,work but theres reddit
books,not_removed,had to run home immediately after posting that but i just did
books,not_removed,question is do we want to see that yes update just saw that no
books,not_removed,you better give me a message when yall do that
books,not_removed,awesome this has huge potential hope i see a physical release
books,not_removed,i know and its fantastic
books,not_removed,i now ask for you to get paid for writing if you dont already
books,not_removed,heres my attempt
books,not_removed,each couplet is on a single line but at least the couplets are separate not terrible
books,not_removed,dude that is amazing you deserve the gold you got
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,thanks for being a good sport about it i saw you were responding well to comments so i figured id chime in but always am wary about critiquing someone on reddit i like the new version too hope you had a great halloween
books,not_removed,yup cool rereading it with the pause and it works if this does get published there are ways this could be spaced on the page that might force a pause when read your point on imperfect cadences for whatever reason reminded me of tolkiens foreword to the second edition of lotr i have received that the passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially approved the most critical reader of all myself now finds many defects minor and major but being fortunately under no obligation either to review the book or to write it again he will pass over these in silence except one that has been noted by others the book is too short
books,not_removed,thats absolutely amazing i love the entire story youve fleshed it out into
books,not_removed,hell yeah i did if this doesnt go down in reddit history i will be very dissapointed
books,not_removed,im generally interested ill pm you a few sketches of past works
books,not_removed,haha too late suckers i already wrote one whole paragraph in a word document that i wont open again until i clean my computer in years
books,not_removed,i own blaze but never got around to reading it
books,not_removed,im a huge dark tower junkie and i couldnt get into the comics might try again with the movie coming out
books,not_removed,personally im not a huge fan of the comics but there are some good ones
books,not_removed,ive loved all the comics thus far they started with sai king oking and directing everything but they took on a life of their own and have been more or less really well written the stories are good but some of the narrating dialogue is average but they really filled out the historical details of the pregunslinger book and focused alot on the early days of roland the fall of gilead with alot about the elder gunslingers and their battle against farson one of my fav parts is that cort had a niece aileen who becomes a pretty badass gunslinger in her own right all in all it is intended to be a continuation of the cycle with some of the small details changing this time around the wheel of ka they are also really beautifully drawn
books,not_removed,yeah dragons come
books,not_removed,they yes are
books,not_removed,they are yes
books,not_removed,they are kids brooint
books,not_removed,i cant afford to guild him
books,not_removed,clearly you arent a big name hollywood person
books,not_removed,yea ive read the series
books,not_removed,i had no complaints i felt like it filled in the backstory quite well the flashback format worked out better than i thought i was quite nervous to begin with to be fair i was a bit sad that the journey didnt progress much not to mention that everything outside of the train rides end and the flashback plotline seemed weak but since that was just a small fraction of the book it wasnt that big of a deal the next books did a better job with handling the present parts of the story so no harm no foul the comics are great by the way if you havent read them and if you enjoyed wizard and glass then theyre almost a must read
books,not_removed,the leaked trailer it was missing quite a few special effects but its out there if you know where to look properly
books,not_removed,its in a thread in rdarktower somewhere
books,not_removed,ah fuck a john cusack film that sucked hes one of my all time favourite actors i love the guy
books,not_removed,book was average too though
books,not_removed,is just a fan theory the book says countless and that still doesnt change who roland is
books,not_removed,the wheel is always turning i say this is a different roland from the books walking the same path or close enough for ka
books,not_removed,it says a lot about a person that they have a problem with elba in the role not because elba doesnt have the acting chops but because the character hes playing was originally white
books,not_removed,making roland black is dumb hollywood making major motoko a white american is dumb hollywood making north african kings from the egyptian era a bunch of white american dudes is dumb hollywood what im saying is hollywood is dumb and uncomfortable with itself when they pass stupid stuff like this
books,not_removed,uh yes it did you mentioned susannah well rolands whiteness is one of the things that set detta off and made her go nuts eventually causing the breakdown that gave he and eddie the chance to help her fix herself she couldnt stand having a white man in her head plus having susannah as the only black member of the group adds to her character throughout
books,not_removed,sure just make susannah a white gender fluid russian so its years old might as well mix it right up dumbass
books,not_removed,should have been matthew mcconaughy as roland
books,not_removed,no matter reading your name out loud more than made up for it
books,not_removed,very tongue in cheek
books,not_removed,something about childrens books i think
books,not_removed,me too thanks
books,not_removed,am on mobile had no problems no popups just the usual inline ads which are fine with me ill take a few ads over having to pay a subscription fee for content like this
books,not_removed,its fine on mobile youre just lazy and not intellectually curious which is ironic considering the subreddit youre at sigh the world is fucked
books,not_removed,what boy do i feel stupid
books,not_removed,alternate alternate title httpsenwikipediaorgwikithecatreturns
books,not_removed,here
books,not_removed,you and me both im a musiciansongwriter but far from getting paid for that maybe someday maybe someone illustrates this i finish the story and reddit gets its first halloween collab childrens book
books,not_removed,horrible that is horrible and i mean that to be the highest of praise it creeps me out very nicely its exactly wrong enough to be prefect and the girl looks seussish too
books,not_removed,dont know how i missed it awesome the cracking bone scene was the very first image i had in my head when i started this i knew she would kill her family and i wanted her crushed and enveloped by darkness
books,not_removed,fixed
books,not_removed,it all depends on intent and tone i guess everyone for the most part was positive and polite so ill return that i also realize im on mobile im going to miss things and repeat words and no writer ever gets by with no editing
books,not_removed,hmmm the tenthousandth day isnt bad
books,not_removed,not kings best work but it is a readable book if youre on a plane or any long ride
books,not_removed,and may you have twice the upvotes
books,not_removed,ah yes my waking dreams as i write this with my upper foot toes
books,not_removed,yes they are
books,not_removed,yes are they
books,not_removed,interesting perspective thanks i still havent finished song of susannah yet so no spoilers please im sure ill get round to the comics at some point
books,not_removed,agh im trying but i got nothin so far
books,not_removed,roland is a powerful knight in an ancient order of gunslingers hes powerful proud and regal and as the adventure goes on he gets more and more worn down
books,not_removed,this is already the established case for the movie for instance he already has the horn its another turn of the wheel
books,not_removed,but because the character hes playing was originally white or because the character hes playing was a lanky emaciated gunslinger on the verge of death kept alive by pure grit and mean determination sorry if mark wahlberg was cast id have the same complaint you can call it racism all you want but thats such a sad copoutand kind of undermines real racial issues when you fling the term around so cavalierly ps for future reference im black i can stand up for myself in the face of racial injustice thanks dont need guilty white knights to tell me whats offensive
books,not_removed,caring what race a character is in a fictional novel is dumber than anything you listed you dont make roland black you make roland idris elba who just so happens to be black why on earth would you care if hes black you dont think black people can be gaunt you dont think elba can lose weight look at bale in machinist vs batman
books,not_removed,the entire point of dettas character was that she was full of irrational hate no matter what roland and eddie being white was the excuse she used to justify her hatred not the reason if roland had been black she would have called him an uncle tom and then carried on exactly as she did in the drawing of the three and i dont think being the only black one was nearly as important to her character as being the only one who has dealt with racial discrimination is which wouldnt have to be changed even if roland is black
books,not_removed,you could literally do that with any of the other characters too additionally you could do that with the fact that hes a rich black man from another world where he didnt have to go through the shit she did im not even saying that she needs to be black they could pull the same dynamic through other means as well roland does not need to be white to tell this story it has no affect on the story that cant be circumvented the rage people are showing over the casting of a black man as this character is beyond childish
books,not_removed,as multiple people have already said its not the same story so am pretty sure none of what you mentioned happens
books,not_removed,yes for kids teaching your toddler to grok the science tree
books,not_removed,spoopy childrens books me thinks but i dont know for certain
books,not_removed,love how people want everything for free and without ads and want other people to work for free but they shall get paid
books,not_removed,you would think that the people at rbooks would read better
books,not_removed,sometimes cats come back again
books,not_removed,yeah thats the thing i wanted to see at in the morning i regret everything
books,not_removed,i see spoochina has some canadian ghoul in her
books,not_removed,oh jebus gosh i sleep facing the door my feet will be tingling all night
books,not_removed,okay seriously a properly illustrated book could do really well i would shop this idea around go the fuck to sleep went over very very well if i remember correctly
books,not_removed,ill buy a copy and read it to my nephew what i dont know why hes crying he said he wanted a bedtime story
books,not_removed,rnocontext
books,not_removed,i hit it twice didnt go up tho
books,not_removed,are yes they
books,not_removed,is judge my name
books,not_removed,the only thing and its not a spoiler since its an prologueepilogue type thing i tell people is this it is that when book rolls around listen to the author really listen he knows better than the constant reader
books,not_removed,he has the horn d
books,not_removed,i would say its not racist or even necessarily a diversity hire its a fictional character hes a damned good actor this is a reimagining of a made up person the director likely has something in mind that he believes this casting can bring to the role if we were talking about telling a story from a person throughout history and changed their race i would question the judgement daniel day lewis as martin luther king jr would be an odd choice i think he could play the part but unless there is an artistic reason to put that spin on it then it probably wouldnt make sense
books,not_removed,ive seen screenshots of elba in his costume hes a tank and his getup looks more like assassins creed than dark tower roland is white susannah told us as much hes basically clint eastwood everyone is so painfully liberal these days hollywood would reroll frodo as vietnamese and wed all have to think its just great i know it doesnt make me racist or some other easy target nonsense it just pisses me off that hollywood cant align itself with the stories its telling idris missed out on bond as far as i know but roland was not the role for him
books,not_removed,i would hardly say i was raging i just think its a pointlessly stupid casting choice when roland is literally based off of a clint eastwood character hes a quintessential cowboy
books,not_removed,cast a lean black man an older black man an american for fucking sure not a giant english black dude its as pathetic as casting tom cruise as jack reacher
books,not_removed,the mindset of a consumer not a creator
books,not_removed,yeah yeah yeah deleting my shame is an option but im leaving this up for your amusement
books,not_removed,seriously its surprising how many people are failing the headline only test here i expected a few but damn its a bit more than a handful
books,not_removed,kit
books,not_removed,what
books,not_removed,all those grumpy parents lol
books,not_removed,ka is a wheel
books,not_removed,me too thanks
books,not_removed,and thats the truth
books,not_removed,yes they are
books,not_removed,ill try and remember that
books,not_removed,yep one of the earliest official tweets about the movie showed it
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,all fine really great discussion my main point is this if i state my opinion that i dont think elbas a good fit for the role people crawl out of the woodwork to call me a racist which is bullshit its like calling someone sexist because they thought the new ghostbusters movie was terrible something is very wrong with our society when you cant hold an opinion without it becoming a race or gender issue if walhberg got the role and i said i didnt think he was a good fit nobody would politicize it wed just discuss
books,not_removed,thinking hes a tank and his costume mismatches the story are all valid points and fans have long decried these kinds of things when works they love are reinterpreted saying this fictional character is white makes no sense it doesnt matter thats where you lose me
books,not_removed,south park candian reference
books,not_removed,her mouth its like how south park shows canadians
books,not_removed,i own the book so hes not wrong
books,not_removed,all paths follow the beam
books,not_removed,include me in the screenshot
books,not_removed,nice deletion of your utter flame comment below id respond to it here but theres no point i think thinking elba isnt fit for the role isnt racist up until the point where you say the reason he isnt fit for the role is his skin color from that point on you are firmly in the center of the literal definition of racism thinking the ghostbusters movie was terrible isnt sexist it was terrible thinking it was terrible because the leads were female definitely is sexist you can hold an opinion without it being a race or gender issue but you cant hold an opinion about race or gender and then say its sad that society is making it the issue and not you
books,not_removed,i get it now i thought there was a canadian myth or sonething
books,not_removed,and all the beams are guarded can confirm am guardian
books,not_removed,dont worry i did
books,not_removed,slaughter house
books,not_removed,winds of war and the sequel war and remembrance by herman wouk they are fiction but really really amazing also if youve got lots of time on your hands you could dig into william churchills the second world war series six volumes consisting of the gathering storm their finest hour the grand alliance the hinge of fate closing the ring triumph and tragedy
books,not_removed,europe central by william t vollmann is fabulously dense and a most enjoyable read
books,not_removed,its not a real story but its historical fiction and still a fun read its from the perspective of a gypsy boy during the holocaust its called milkweed and is written by jerry spineli its one of my favorite books
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,highly suggest these books
books,not_removed,youre confusing aladdin and alibaba and the forty thieves
books,not_removed,id suggest a couple of books the elements of style by william strunk jr and eb white yes that eb white it is a great book because it is very compact and cheap but it will teach you all of the important grammatical and structural elements of writing this is important because it will let you see a lot of the small clues that reading comprehension tests give to indicate the correct answer manual for writers of research papers theses and dissertations by kate l turabian this will do a lot of the same things as the first book i recommended it includes lots of information on grammar and structure it gives advice for writers about how to make their writing clearer and better you will just need to reverse the advice after you understand these concepts i recommend reading difficult novels this will test your skills and push you further id particularly recommend faulkner or kesey as they both have books with very difficult sections and theyre really good another book ill recommend even though its similar to the practice book you already have is the lb book of gre practice problems by manhattan prep these should be similar to those on the mcat and they are a wonderful test of reading comprehension altogether these three books minus the novels only cost on amazon you might also be able to find them at a library but itll be nice to have your own copies you can keep for reference and write in the novels you can definitely find at a library or you can expand your library of novels best of luck on the mcat i took the gre so i at least partially understand your pain
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,thanks a ton this will help a lot apparently the post just got moderated and i broke a rule so ill probably repost this in one of his suggested subs
books,not_removed,oh thats too bad i think these are really the basics that will help you a lot but i hope others can provide some good advice feel free to pm me if you ever want to talk about it
books,not_removed,he has many more wait until you read king rat if you like historical fiction books where you learn a ton and get a good story space by james michener russia or london by edward ruthford pillars of the earth by ken follet and agony and the ecatasy by irving stone are all wonderful books and authors edit forgot bernard cornwell and patrick obrian and hilary mantel edit damn this blew up great authors all around iggulden and smith and everybody else edit dont deserve it but thanks for the gold
books,not_removed,im on page and still have no idea what toranagas plan is
books,not_removed,thanks that was really cool of you to post that you know they made a miniseries of it i think in the late in case you want to try and find it at the time it ran it was on fire everybody watched it
books,not_removed,i would recommend musashi its a book about a real samurai set in the same era written just under years ago one of my favourite books of all time
books,not_removed,musashi by eiji yoshikawa is worth a read as well
books,not_removed,just wait till you read noble house then my parents and i love james clavell and we all think that his hong kong books tai pan and noble house are even better than shogun
books,not_removed,i had a paperback copy when i was in the navy i got asked to lend it so many times i eventually split it into chunks so about of us could read it at the same time duct tape binding helped keep it from disintegrating completely
books,not_removed,read shogun when i was im today it was the first and probably the only book ive read where i felt completely immersed in the setting and country it was as if i was living there in medieval japan through the story that was how close i felt to it truly a superb read and a book to enjoy over and over
books,not_removed,i love clavell two fun facts about his books king rat was inspired by his time as a pow in the pacific during wwii joss whedons parents are big clavell fans and his name is an homage to the term joss used so heavily in the books
books,not_removed,its only treason if you fail the whole book is brilliant but that scene has always stayed with me
books,not_removed,thanks for posting this ive been wanting to read this for years im finally visiting japan this summer so youve inspired me to read it
books,not_removed,ill never finish shogun but that is my karma neh jk i finished it like times
books,not_removed,i actually have a tattoo inspired by this book because i loved it so much might be time for a reread edit link
books,not_removed,i enjoyed shogun as well i did not finish all the books in the series but imo skip gaijin in fact lets never mention it again
books,not_removed,i proudly claim to be able to speak a bit of japanese thanks to that book by which i mean i can say i dont understand do you understand i understand sorry thanks pilot please ive tested it out on japanese people and they claim to not understand a word of what i say but i know theyre just trying to trick me im pronouncing it perfectly
books,not_removed,good for you but please dont be mistaken to think this is even slightly historically accurate its fiction calling the book which is a great read solid historical fiction would be akin to saying the jungle book is a solid description of how animals live in the jungle
books,not_removed,i wont say the end but its spectacular by the way read king rat
books,not_removed,if you enjoyed this you should try reading about the real guy the book is based on there was a book about it called the guy himself was called httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwilliamadamssailor
books,not_removed,ive had this book on my shelf for years and have finally started reading it again im now on page chapter and cant put it down playing nioh really surged my interest also check out cloud of sparrows good and easy read that was definitely heavily influenced by shogun
books,not_removed,shoguns fan here not so much ago i asked at rtv iirc that there should be a remake of the shoguns mini serie although i can not think about someone who could play toranagas part like toshiro mifune did great book my favorite
books,not_removed,so glad someone else mentioned this book it wasnt just a good story i came away from it feeling like my thinking had changed also toranaga is one of the most interesting characters in fiction
books,not_removed,i cannot emphasize how highly i would recommend moving immediately to musashi by eiji yoshikawa described to me as japans gone with the wind it begins in the time period immediately following the historical events of shogun the two works enhance each other greatly
books,not_removed,now that youve read the books check out the miniseries while obviously not as in depth as the books it was very well done and holds up well one of the great things they did was not include subtitles so at times youre just as confused as blackthorn as to what the japanese are saying
books,not_removed,lovely book great author tai pan is my favourite from the series the last chapter is one of the most touching ive ever read ill second the recommendations for the baroque cycle by stephenson for great historical fiction i would also add i claudius by robert graves and the novels by gore vidal creation julian and his series on america
books,not_removed,is nobody gonna mention that shogun is albeit losely based on a true story httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwilliamadamssailor
books,not_removed,this and folletts pillars of the earth are tied for my best readlistened to each so many times
books,not_removed,try musashi by eiji yoshikawa afterwards
books,not_removed,personally i didnt enjoy it i can see why it is objectively good but it just didnt grab me personally i wrote a review when i did read it so i went and found it part of what i wrote was it is an interesting story full of political and military and religious machinations clash of cultures love and betrayal but it also has to spend tonnes of time teaching the reader about the events of the world and the cultures of the time there is japanese culture and bushido and how shinto and christianity playing into that there is catholic and protestant there is portuguese dutch and english trade and navy and there is other historical context that must be applied all of these element are explained and deftly applied to characters there are parallels built there is so much world building and background given that it felt very real it is an amazing and complex work in that way the characters are interesting and there is lots going on to keep the story moving any yet through that the whole thing just didnt work for me the story built and built adding elements and intrigue but then the payoff at the end didnt seem enough to justify the significant amount of time spent on the build up the world building the explanation of cultures and events of the times is extremely great but the story itself felt too long with not enough payoff i can see why this book gets praised a lot but i guess it just wasnt for me
books,not_removed,i know many people who love it but it never stood out for me
books,not_removed,i read shogun and it immediately became my favorite book and i went on a clavell frenzy and started in immediately on taipan hundreds of pages into taipan i was saying wow i guess clavell was a one book kinda guy this is nothing near as good as shogun then you read the last few pages of taipan and it all comes together and suddenly like a rapturous revelation it all makes sense and youre left in wonder saying my god its not just better than shogun its the most marvelous and spectacular feat to have done this in all literature of the past hundred years war and peace is the greatest novel ever written always but taipan has a pretty damn strong case for number two check it out
books,not_removed,in the there was a house near me in heildlberg melbourne australia that had a big shogun sign on the front gate it was known at the shogun house i often wondered if james clavell lived there hes australian right or maybe it was just a huge fan of the book that lived there
books,not_removed,absolutely one of my top books of all time
books,not_removed,loved shogun the mini series did what it could to bring the book to the screen i loved how you got the japanese translations in the beginning of the book then by the end they were gone you knew what they were saying
books,not_removed,ive been umming and arring about getting a copy youve convinced me to just grab one
books,not_removed,i reread shogun at least once year if i cant make the time physically read it ill listen to the unabridged audio book while commuting amazing mixture of history and fiction
books,not_removed,i havent read it but apparently it is based on a true story i saw the miniseries when it was on tv as a kid and later read the book the miniseries was very popular when it was on almost as popular as roots
books,not_removed,tai pan is the best of his big books imo king rat is and shogun is i love clavell i hate ayn rand her writing is shit but tai pan encapsulates her basic philosophy much better
books,not_removed,pages into shogun myself agree
books,not_removed,i love this book toranga is a masterfully constructed character and as the various parts of his plan fall together you begin to appreciate the scale and scope of what starts off a simple adventure book ive voiced this opinion here before and been told how wrong and stupid i am to like this book glad to see its getting some recognition
books,not_removed,google james clavells shogun i just found it at target on discs for hopefully you still have a dvd player
books,not_removed,this is so surreal i finished the book about minutes ago absolute masterpiece
books,not_removed,i found this book somewhere and it has been on my bookshelf for years and never been touched im making it my next read thanks to this post
books,not_removed,shogun and taipan were life changing a good reread when you feel things are down
books,not_removed,same its the most riveting book i ever read couldnt put it down
books,not_removed,i was really enjoyed it until i stumbled across one of my pet hates in a book a huge chunk of expositionary text taking up two pages about the dynasty if i remember i was quite young at the time though so maybe it was a bit too advanced for me and i should try again
books,not_removed,one of my favs too shogun is one of those immersive books that totally transports the reader to another time place
books,not_removed,it is a glorious read and james clavell is an incredible author wakarimasuka i read it about years
books,not_removed,i got arrested for something i honestly didnt do mistaken identity wrongplacewrongtime type of thing im not the jail type wasnt my scene i was uncomfortable in there i was in there for a week i got my hands on a copy and began to read it was all i had on the day it all got figured out and i was set to be released the next morning i started to read like a man possessed i got to the very end and the last pages had been very cleanly ripped out fuckers
books,not_removed,spoilers spoilers spoilers spoilers broall that fucking build up for a paragraph battle so and so died and so and so died i threw that fucking book out of a window i was so mad
books,not_removed,saw the tv series wit richard chamberlain it was amazing i learned how to say watashi no kuruma dont remember what it means though
books,not_removed,for anyone interested in novels with historical depth try the wake by paul kingsnorth set shortly after the invasion of england in he writes in a hybrid between old and modern english that quickly sets up just how distant a place the past is wonderful experience
books,not_removed,shogun is what spurred me to become a historical fiction writer i highly recommend reading eiji yoshikawas musashi as well less of an epic feel but a great story nonetheless
books,not_removed,solid historical fiction excuse you clavell makes a mess of history mixing characters from different time periods and locations to tell ridiculously superficial exotic stories about a world he never understood i do like his love affair with capitalism that started in king rat with the magical counterfeit watch that keeps on getting more expensive with each transaction allowing the traders to accumulate more money ad infinitum
books,not_removed,the first time i read this book it was on my first deployment to iraq it was wonderful without any tv and internet it really allowed myself to escape to a new world and experience a culture that i actually wanted to experience i did not want to experience the culture in iraq fyi since then i read it in afghanistan on my second deployment another time during a divorce a third time just being a drunk at home and finally i bought he miniseries that was overseen by james clavell and watched it with my daughter and new fianc√© this book has really changed my life so i think its great that other people are realizing that too
books,not_removed,the whole series is great king rat taipan sh≈çgun noble house whirlwind gaijin i usually dont enjoy popular novels or historical fiction but i loved all of these i actually have these on my kindle because i was planning on reading them again
books,not_removed,im currently playing nioh on the and i just finished the battle of sekigahara im definitely going to pick up shogun after this game
books,not_removed,i read it in the late along with tai pan and the noble house great set of books the movies for the first two books didnt do them justice as is usually the case
books,not_removed,it was for me too i went to my dad and told him this novel was amazing and that it was great to read a historical novel he replied remember this is a foreigners interpretation of a different culture that made me pause and think about how that could impact what i draw from the book cuz i was making some conclusions of the culture based on the novel
books,not_removed,it was an amazing book i was surprised and put off that my mum got it for me for christmas looked really boring but man was it amazing spoiler
books,not_removed,james clavell is a literary genius i read shogun twice in high school and now i shall pick up a copy and read it again thanks for the trip down memory lane
books,not_removed,youve had a short life so far
books,not_removed,interesting fact you might already know to get ready to write this book clavell had himself decapitated with a samurai sword
books,not_removed,yes im glad you discovered it shogun itself is my favorite book to reread i highly recommend two of his other books taipan and noble house
books,not_removed,i literally have this in my lap rn
books,not_removed,i bought this book at a yard sale a week ago totally hooked üòá
books,not_removed,as everyone else is saying those books are utterly superb just so phenomenal i loved them so much that it made me apply for the companies in noble house and ive just been given a job offer there so im hugely excited keep on reading they are just continually brilliant
books,not_removed,welcome to japanophilia
books,not_removed,if you like shogun then you should read taiko or musashi by eiji yoshikawa
books,not_removed,i feel like that whole book was a giant build up to nothing the ending was very disappointing
books,not_removed,i read it as a kid and loved it as well does anyone have an adult perspective on it how does it compare to micheners works
books,not_removed,i found a really beautiful binding of most of the asian saga at a used book store in toronto i bought what they had but it was missing whirlwind ive not been able to find it anywhere in case anyone wants to help me track it down though im in canada so it may not work out i read my dads copy of shogun when i was in junior high it was a huge time sink but i think it was worth it it the mini series is not amazingly well done httpimgurcomcvhuqor
books,not_removed,i just started reading this and to see a thread about it at the top of the subreddit the next again day out of nowhere is kind of blowing my mind strange coincidence anyway im about pages in and feel like i just started but its already fast becoming one of the best books ive ever read every character has their own developed thoughts and motivations and no one is what they seem its an incredible book so far
books,not_removed,as long as you dont read up on japanese history before reading the book im sure it works fine
books,not_removed,i started reading the book many years ago think i were around when i started back then they were hard for me to read and come trough when i later picked them up i couldnt lay them down and they are amazing and to all the other comments on this thread looks like i have a bunch of other books to find and go trough
books,not_removed,musashi is one of my favorite books though its been about since i read it shogun seems to be getting some pretty good reviews so ill have to check it out sounds like it could be similar
books,not_removed,get back to us with an update after youve finished it i cant wait to get your reaction
books,not_removed,great story learning a few japanese phrases along the way was a nice bonus too
books,not_removed,riiiight
books,not_removed,just started reading this a week or so ago about pages in and i completely agree as someone who normally reads nonfiction this book has the perfect mix of historic detail and sick plot line
books,not_removed,try wilbur smith
books,not_removed,i picked up shogun from a used bookstore in the early luckily they had all his books because i was hooked
books,not_removed,yup good book alright
books,not_removed,opinions are opinions but i really disagree with anyone saying king rat was anywhere close to shogun king rat was good but it compared in no way to shogun
books,not_removed,i wanted to get shogun from a local bookshop and i ordered it weeks later they call me saying the book is no longer being produced
books,not_removed,one of the books that got me started on historical fiction but i have to say there is much better look for research
books,not_removed,i love sharon kay penmans stuff all of it
books,not_removed,agreed
books,not_removed,loooved shogun didnt realise he wrote others my suggestion is alexander vol and by valerio massimo manfredi also in the vein of epic adventure stories papillon by henri charri√®re is wonderful
books,not_removed,read taipan and then noble house they live in the same character universe even with shogun taipan is the best
books,not_removed,i fell in love with this book years ago and i still pick it up from time to time such an amazing book
books,not_removed,its my favorite book i live in japan and i cant recommend it enough
books,not_removed,shogun is my comfort book anytime life becomes unbearable i can retreat to it and be at peace
books,not_removed,love that book i read it as a teenager and it instilled in me a lifelong interest in feudal japan the mini series was well done too
books,not_removed,ive read all his books but must say that shogun is the one i always go back to reread have done so about or more times a really great read
books,not_removed,similar thing happened to me i was bored and internet still wasnt what is today so i find this old dusty book called king on my dads shelf i read it times since then
books,not_removed,i loved the mini series a while later bc i was like but when i got around to reading the book i loved it more the series is pretty good and the book is great
books,not_removed,i went through a weeaboo phase for a bit in my childhood i bought way of the samurai and shogun one day just because they involved japan and samurai i read shogun shortly after and my mind was blown hands down one of my top five favorite books
books,not_removed,curious question how is the book compared to the movie
books,not_removed,i have this at my schools library i visit there often and theres only copy and apparently im the only one reading it i only get a few pages in because im a slow reader but its worth the time
books,not_removed,agreed fantastic book i also read a crumbling copy from my dads basement lol
books,not_removed,i got my hands on a copy the day it came out in paperback outside of the need to sleep and occasionally putting it down to do some necessary function at my job i didnt stop reading until i was done
books,not_removed,im a couple hundred pages into my second reading of it all of his books are great my personal favorite is tai pan but most people seem to prefer nobel house
books,not_removed,i know this is rbooks but the miniseries based on this was amazing a giant americanjapanese coproduction they built one of the villages from scratch and when they had done most of the filming that they wanted to do there only considering whether they want to come back or not a storm blew the entire thing away underscoring the tumultuous relation with nature that the japanese have for being on top of geofault lines which is also explored in the book
books,not_removed,do you need other books to understand this or this is stand alone
books,not_removed,oh wow i havent read that book since jr high cant wait to pick it up again now such a great read
books,not_removed,just had to comment because i was happy to see this posts his books are incredible and up there in the top of my list of favorites
books,not_removed,been listening to the audiobook aginsan
books,not_removed,i just ordered thanks for the recommendation
books,not_removed,the brethren fortunes of france is also excellent look into it
books,not_removed,if your library has hoopla you should be able to get the audiobooks which i highly recommend especially for those commutes to and from work
books,not_removed,read monsoon count montecristo endymion song of ice and fire and all the rest everything you can find by dumas and all the henry haggard quatermaine books forest of a thousand deamonds if youre feeling adventurous things fall apart also report back and i give you a lot more good ones
books,not_removed,my neighbors dad loaned me this book years ago because he swore by it and my silly ass has yet to read it i should probably do that huh
books,not_removed,try leon uris he wrote mostly century historical fiction his tone is sort of dated but the stories in exodus qb vii and armageddon are all gripping
books,not_removed,while great the book is either much too long or much too short not sure which
books,not_removed,i love this book i read it for a high school summer reading assignment where we could pick any book off a list to read almost everyone else read kite runner but i for some reason just couldnt get through it i found shogun at my grandparents house and after recalling it had been on the list too decided to read that instead it was the best choice i couldve made i couldnt put the book down
books,not_removed,read that book in grade and did a report on it every year until i graduated ha take that ms reading
books,not_removed,did you know they made a miniseries out of it around
books,not_removed,when it does end youll wish it was another pages clavells others are great as well especially king rat and tai pan my dad gave me tai pan when i was twelve or thirteen and i had read it and shogun in a week in hindsight i think he wanted me out of his hair over spring break
books,not_removed,by far the best book i have ever read it lead me to the entire saga that includes tai pan king rat and noble house i think james clavel is a genius and the fact he was a pow in japan makes hes writing so real i recommend this book its a masterpiece
books,not_removed,my dad has the hard copy and i remember seeing it on our bookcases ill grab it
books,not_removed,wow i have the same book on my shelf not feet from me fading covers and all i will have to read it now
books,not_removed,for anyone with audible ralph lister does a phenomenal job on the audio recording its a true performance not just a reading of words on a page
books,not_removed,i loved shogun too the taipan books are also very good but for me shogun was special but that is such an exciting time period for me too
books,not_removed,i cant get past the prologue i swear all the nautical terminology and the history lesson with the dutch and the scurvy im annoyed with it and cant pick it back up and i feel really guilty about that please tell me the writing gets better or picks up steam or at least stops being so scatterbrained
books,not_removed,karma ne
books,not_removed,me too i ‚ù§ that book so much i was living in japan when i read it
books,not_removed,if you liked shogun youre likely to like winnetou by karl may
books,not_removed,the movie with richard chamerlain is also great one of the better book adaptations that is out there
books,not_removed,the asian saga is fantastic a true epic of its generation my favorite is tai pan the sequel of shogun youre in for a treat with regards to the rest of the series
books,not_removed,i absolutely love james clavell taipan is my favorite followed closely by shogun the noble house and king rat i first read shogun when i was about ive reread the asian saga a countless number of times
books,not_removed,under heaven by guy gavriel kay is also an amazing feudal japanese novel
books,not_removed,i recently finished listening to the audiobook and really enjoyed it i cant wait to clear out my current backlog and move onto the next book in the series
books,not_removed,whatever you do avoid gaijin the rest of the books are good tai pan is a little simplistic but fun king rat is short but authentic noble house is borderline overwhelming gaijin is spectacularly bland
books,not_removed,wonderful books and i highly recommend reading the rest from wikipedia shogun set in feudal japan taipan set in hong kong gaijin set in japan king rat set in a japanese pow camp singapore noble house set in hong kong whirlwind set in iran i read all except for whirlwind i honestly dont remember if i knew of its existence until now
books,not_removed,i liked taipan the best in that series im jealous you get to read them for the first time
books,not_removed,how ironic also there is a copy of shogun in my dads old library he has been an avid reader his whole life and his favorite genre is historical fiction when asked which js his favorite book he says it is this one ihave never read it but i need to give it a try
books,not_removed,try the baroque cycle by neal stephenson next
books,not_removed,im about paged through right now its like nothing ive read before he has a great ability to tell a gripping story while also immersing you in the culture of the time the moment where blackthorne almost commits seppukku is chilling cant wait to finish
books,not_removed,i read shogun back in highschool and it really was incredible i think i had to check the book out about three times from the library because of how long it was haha fantastic book glad youre enjoying it
books,not_removed,still one of the best books ive read its funny to me how much the last samurai ripped off this story
books,not_removed,for anyone looking to pick up a great slightly more modern historical fiction and have already blasted through clavells works i would check out the conqueror series by conn iggulden it focuses on the life of ghengis khan as he unites the tribes and has similar themes of a ruthless cutthroat man of vision also i actually came to enjoy taipan the most out of the clavell series dont shoot me
books,not_removed,agreed shogun is one of my favorite novels it really does have it all like action romance thriller and even a bit of horror samurai boiling sailors alive love that book
books,not_removed,most of his books are great had trouble finishing whirlwind though but shogun tai pan and noble house are amazing
books,not_removed,i was just thinking about this book yesterday small world lol i read it when i was in middle school and loved it i really wanna reread it again now
books,not_removed,got new stuff to read now thanks
books,not_removed,my all time favorite author ive read them all multiple times fantastic
books,not_removed,great isnt it that basement scene at the start drew me in
books,not_removed,thanks for the recommendation looks great
books,not_removed,if you love historical fiction check sharon kay penman
books,not_removed,definitely ive read it so many times theres also a pretty ok tv series with richard chamberlain this is one of those books where i wish hbo redid it
books,not_removed,to read
books,not_removed,great book i read this when i was a teenager the country was just discovering clavell then and he could not write a flop back then shoot its been decades maybe a reread or at least an audio book the more you learn about actual japanese history of the time the cooler shogun gets
books,not_removed,youve motivated me to pick it back up sir i think i got maybe pages in about a year ago the last thing i remember is the filthy prison scene should i start over
books,not_removed,saw the miniseries when it was first broadcast
books,not_removed,i read the book last year and because of it i want to watch marty scorseses silence it is based in the edo period when the tokugawa on whom lord toranaga was based clan ruled
books,not_removed,ive read everything hes written great author
books,not_removed,if you loved the book its excellent you should check out the tv miniseries adaptation made in no expense was spared on creating a sprawling epic adaptation of the novel even today it really holds up as an excellent production and a worthy homage to the original text
books,not_removed,loved shogun the mini series did what it could to bring the book to the screen i loved how you got the japanese translations in the beginning of the book then by the end they were gone you knew what they were saying
books,not_removed,yes i remember having the same feeling i love clavelles work and am only sad there isnt more of it i havent found another comparable author you have to read king rat and tai pan now as well
books,not_removed,read it a couple of times also have the audio book for long trips
books,not_removed,hai anjinsan
books,not_removed,i read noble house i am from hong kong the author even if he lived in hong kong was tightly is the expat bubble and the book was written in such a condescending imperialistic manner that i cannot help but label the author as a textbook asshole also read whirlwind i do not know how accurate the portrayal of iranian society at the time was however the condescension was still there also unlike many people now he understood that under the shah iran was not similar to modernday uae ‚Äì rather to contemporary say pakistan or india
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,i read this about a year ago and i still remember every detail about it such a good book also the prince of nothing series is good too if you are into fantasy epics that deal with a badass main protagonist and some political intrigue and kickass fights
books,not_removed,i audio booked the shogun taipan gaijin and noble house john lee did awesome job narrating the books then i watched the shogun tv miniseries and now trying to get noble house dvd as well few clips of noble house clips on youtube and also some trailers for taipan the movie as well both looks fantastic
books,not_removed,does the asian saga that this book belongs to need to be read in publishing chronological order
books,not_removed,shogun taipan king rat and noble house are all tied together in some fashion remember the japanese character in noble house with the name anjin
books,not_removed,thats an old book on my dads shelf as well now i have to check it out
books,not_removed,i literally just pulled this book off my stepdads shelf one day i thought it was spectacular i also remember thinking that the last samurai tom cruise circa stole a number of the plot elements
books,not_removed,youre rightyou dont want it to end
books,not_removed,rnioh is leaking yokai need slaying william get back to it
books,not_removed,play nioh
books,not_removed,this is one of the few books ive read times tai pan and noble house are both great too if you liked shogun you should definitely read those
books,not_removed,they made it into a tv in the
books,not_removed,your one of them nioh players huh
books,not_removed,yeah it is great keep asking people to read it but everyone is scared of the size
books,not_removed,just found the audio book version for my cross country move cheers thanks for the recommendation
books,not_removed,i like shogun best king rating is up there though his other books he lets his dislike of the working class show too much
books,not_removed,in what order should i read these
books,not_removed,i read it in high school and i agree i loved it it changed my focus on japanese culture from an anime nerd to actually wanting to learn the culture im still a huge weeb though
books,not_removed,this book is a masterpiece and the end is spectacular
books,not_removed,ive read shogun twice i enjoyed it so much sometime in the there was a tv miniseries of the novel with richard chamberlan playing the lead the production was a bit cheesy by todays standards however it follows the book word for word the only time i have seen such accuracy in a booktofilm translation
books,not_removed,me too non of his other tomes were as coherent or contained they tended to ramble and sprawl but shogun was just about perfect put cryptonomicon by neal stephenson on your list then pick it up when you can set aside months pages will go by like
books,not_removed,thats one of my absolute favorites it was recommended by a friends grandfather who incidentally just passed its my favorite memory of him if you enjoy that kind of setting may i recommend cloud of sparrows i cant remember the author right now and it has a dash of mysticism in it one of the characters can catch glimpses of the future but the setting is beautifully detailed and the way they describe americans from the japanese perspective is funny and thoughtprovoking especially describing the wide hips of a female missionary
books,not_removed,yes yes it is
books,not_removed,yep its awesome read the whole book series
books,not_removed,it does feel weird to be that deep into a book look at what you have read already and say wow i could go for more of this
books,not_removed,cant upvote this enough
books,not_removed,ok this is the second time in the last couple days ive seen this book so highly recommended just ordered a paperback copy to be shipped hope its good
books,not_removed,i have my fathers old beat up paperback too its the gem of my library and also my favorite book of all time ive read it twice and loved the tv mini series as well
books,not_removed,yessssss absolutely yes i am a little over halfway into it right now and it has absolutely blown my mind all the way through i cannot put it down
books,not_removed,tai pan bruh but shogun had me hooked too
books,not_removed,my favorite book of all time the mini series is fantastic too toshiro mifune as toranaga was perfect casting
books,not_removed,i am also in the middle of this book im listening to the audio and my interest has recently been rekindled
books,not_removed,find all of his books and read them in order it will be the best eighteen inch thick book youve ever read
books,not_removed,yes i finished it recently as well as i was getting close to the end i felt sad i wouldnt get to be with the characters i watched the miniseries from just last week and it does the book justice
books,not_removed,try we die alone by david howarth riveting edge of your seat historical fiction thanks for shogun recommendation will pick it up
books,not_removed,loved shogun and it inspired me to read other clavell books my favorite is king rat
books,not_removed,tai pan was amazing too
books,not_removed,i found it in a box a teacher had in high school everyone else picked the small books and i picked that one up i got deep into it but then the school year ended and i never finished it that was years ago or so
books,not_removed,we need a new tv series about shogun or at least an hbo style series about the noble house saga it would be amazing
books,not_removed,i enjoyed shogun and king rat ive picked up a copy of whirlwind is it just as good should i read taipan gaijin and noble house first
books,not_removed,read it years ago good read
books,not_removed,one of my alltime favorite novels
books,not_removed,i absolutely love that book and have read it at least times the first was right before i went to japan for the time but its not entirely fiction chech httpswwwartelinocomarticlesdutchnagasakiasp out
books,not_removed,isnt that the one where in like the first pages the main character has an asian chick try to suck his dick
books,not_removed,what makes it interesting the plot or writing style i am looking for something with the latter
books,not_removed,i just read up on william adams on wikipedia a couple weeks ago and it mentioned he was the inspiration for a character in shogun seeing it mentioned again so suddenly makes it seem like some kinda sign i should read this book
books,not_removed,i loved shogun but the end seemed kind of rushed compared to the detail in the rest of the book
books,not_removed,op if you liked shogun you will also like wyvern by a a attanasio every bit as good as shogun without the sometimes a bit long winded political intrigue i think it is the second best historical novel i know sadly the best one is a german book that to my knowledge hasnt been translated into english so far die br√ºcke von alcantara by frank baer
books,not_removed,reading it at the moment as well pages in and its had a few awesome moments but the political stuff is dragging on a bit i guess it depends what youre into i usually read non fiction memoirs which only last about pages so maybe i just dont have the patience instilled in me ill definitely finish it though and am enjoying it overall reading it as a precursor to a trip to japan later in the year looking forward to checking the movie out once i finish the book always read the book first though right
books,not_removed,huh ive had a copy of shogun that me brother left on my shelf for years now guess its time to read it
books,not_removed,i adore this novel its in my top easily
books,not_removed,yes it is such a good book i read it in high school maybe its time for a reread
books,not_removed,im pages in right now
books,not_removed,when i was littlemy father was famous
books,not_removed,the way he builds and writes conflict in his books just makes me so engaged ive read shogun twice and king rat maybe times and have read all the others except whirlwind i want to tackle noble house again i first read it when i was maybe and i think now that im older i would appreciate the business dealings more than i did at the time
books,not_removed,absolutely one of my very favorite novels if you can believe it ive read that monstrous tome times cover to cover the rest of the asia saga is good too but in my opinion shogun and tai pan are a cut above the rest
books,not_removed,i remeber reading king rat back when i was james clavell taught me a lot about men our nature and the futility of certain aspects within our nature
books,not_removed,it is still one of my top reads of all time and i read it years ago so good so deep i love how blackthorne eventually and gradually does a full on how he sees the japanese culture compared to the english culture i read tai pan and king rat too and shogun was my favourite second goes to king rat it is also shorter which can be nice
books,not_removed,a coworker lent me this book about years ago i thought ugh i wont like this at all but i loved it and consider it one of my favorite books
books,not_removed,if youre looking for something similar in style storytelling and adventure check out rafael sabatini the captain blood series and scaramouche are his most famous works bellarion the fortunate is a good read too
books,not_removed,moh ching moh meng
books,not_removed,this is by far the book i wish i could erase from my memory and read again
books,not_removed,wow i was in need of a new book to read thanks for the heads up you have my love
books,not_removed,agreed
books,not_removed,good joss to find this book as a kid my mind was blown by the concubines pillow acts recently reread the book and found the end of the love story arc to be pure poetry
books,not_removed,im rereading this book now for the first time in years
books,not_removed,if you liked shogun you should try out the red orm saga the longships
books,not_removed,i remember starting shogun while waiting to board the plane thatd take me to osaka for a year really great method i suggest trying it
books,not_removed,my mother in law gave me a copy for a birthday like years ago great book it has been a while so i dont remember details but i remember each samurai introduced seemed like the most badass one only to be outbadassed by the next guy
books,not_removed,oh fuck you i just barely finished the ten hour tv miniseries im not about to get into the novels alright ill read shogun but thats it none after that actually picked it up at barns and nobles the other day however the print was miniscule no way was i getting through it
books,not_removed,if you are interested in the reallife story on which the novel was based you can read samurai william by giles milton it reads very well and is decently sourced
books,not_removed,wow what a coincidence i just got this a few days ago because of nioh
books,not_removed,uh oh rnioh is leaking
books,not_removed,i am so glad someone else has said it i loved this book when i first read it and multiple rereadings have only made it better i recommend this book to everyone i know and ive heard no complaints along the same vein author conn iguldens ghengis series was inspired much like his other series hawaii by james mitchener pillars of the earth by ken follet oh and dont forget the century series by ken follet all great peices if historical fiction my favorite genre if you speak french also i recommend la peste by albert camus just brilliant if somewhat obvious
books,not_removed,i just reread shogun for a second time and my god is it captivating
books,not_removed,read the whole asian saga theyre all excellent
books,not_removed,oh dear god yes i love this book and have reread it many times and will probably do so again it stoked my love for japanese culture and language
books,not_removed,no way i started reading this book on a family trip that was boring af when i was like or years oldi remember getting really into it but i lost it on this whale watching boat ride we went on i could never really remember what the book was called or who it was by but reading the synopsis after reading this post it is the same book so random but thank you so much ive always wanted to finish it
books,not_removed,the audio version kept me sane for six months of commuting
books,not_removed,i picked up shogun thinking it was a different book and became a fan right away great author
books,not_removed,its a slog and not what i wanted each to their own im glad youre happy
books,not_removed,lord toranaga rules
books,not_removed,i actually liked the mini series better than the book
books,not_removed,ohh i heard this was a good one and forgot about it ill be sure to check it out i liked monsoon by wilbur smith
books,not_removed,yes read also tai pan by clavell even better
books,not_removed,tomorrow is tomorrow today i will learn how to dive toranaga
books,not_removed,i came here to say this yeah shogun was good but king rat dang
books,not_removed,read aztec by james michener
books,not_removed,pillars of the earth has a lot of cool medieval architectural stuff but some of the rest of the history isnt as well researched i also found the writing pretty dreadful especially the dialogue
books,not_removed,and you leave out ol bernie cornwell tsk tsk
books,not_removed,colleen mccullough if interested un ancient rome
books,not_removed,also leon uris taught me so much about irelands history with his work trinity that i did a history degree when i went to college
books,not_removed,patrick obrian jane austen for men my alltime favorite author and i reread the novels of the aubreymaturin series every two years or so
books,not_removed,especially patrick obrian
books,not_removed,dont forget colleen mccullough her first man in rome series is the best historical fiction ive ever read exhaustively researched and well written she makes you feel like you know julius caesar cato gauis marius and so many other historical figures i have a hard time watching or reading any other fictional works set in the same time period if they dont align with her take on it i also second you on the above recommendations
books,not_removed,also the baroque cycle by neal stephenson
books,not_removed,conn iggulden
books,not_removed,poland by michener was always one of my favorites
books,not_removed,wait until you read king rat i havent yet read king rat but i really appreciated the use of japanese language in shogun to create a barrier for the reader to emulate the barrier for the character
books,not_removed,id throw in herman wouk as well the winds of war and war and remembrance are fantastic really got me into wwii history
books,not_removed,sharon kay penman
books,not_removed,hilary mantel too
books,not_removed,seeing as clavell is my favourite author far and away so do you have any other recommendations besides the ones you have given normally when i ask irl i get dross like wilbur smith
books,not_removed,taiko is also an amazing historical semifiction book on the rise of hideyoshi toyotomi
books,not_removed,just ordered pillars of the earth a week or so ago still waiting for it i guess the wait is worth it
books,not_removed,agree on several of these especially king rat i read it in my mid and all these years later it still stands out as one of the best stories ive ever read
books,not_removed,recommend conn iggulden as well his emperor series about rome and his khan series too
books,not_removed,the agony and the ecstasy is a heart wrencher
books,not_removed,man i hated pillars of the earth could hardly get through it
books,not_removed,never read anything by james clavell but ill the ken follet recommendation not at all books i expected to enjoy but i couldnt put them down
books,not_removed,king rat was amazing clavell really knows how to establish a character
books,not_removed,i second the recommendation for king rat my other two favourite books from him are whirlwind which is about the iranian revolution and taipan which takes place in hong kong fantastic books
books,not_removed,world without end by follet is great too in fact most of his books are great reads if you like world war fiction he knows how to tell a story
books,not_removed,coleen mcculloughs masters of rome series is truly epic
books,not_removed,pillars is one of my favorite books did you read world without end and did you know a thirdpart is to be released fall of
books,not_removed,i will second the plug for patrick obrian he takes a sometimes cheeseball genre and transforms it into high literature i discovered his nautical tales some years ago and find myself returning to them repeatedly every time to discover something new a play on words a joke a pun a historical or literary reference even minor plot twists that id previously missed i recommend reading his books with at least one of the handful of reference guides that have been published or it is guaranteed that you will miss out on a lot of his genius i recommend both patrick obrians navy the illustrated companion to jack aubreys world and a sea of words third edition a lexicon and companion to the complete seafaring tales of patrick obrian it may seem draconian that one should be obliged to use guidebooks in order to read his work but trust me it is so very worth it edit also forgot to say that on top of everything else obrian is also often hilarious
books,not_removed,ken follets century trilogy was entertaining real history from a fictional perspective fictional characters adjacent to real historical figures very good
books,not_removed,thanks gonna check those
books,not_removed,follet and clavell were my introduction to historical fictional and why i love it i have ruthford books as well that i need to get around to reading
books,not_removed,i had a similar experience as the op with space by james a michener damn near blew my year old mind trying to remember if ive ever read shogun now
books,not_removed,sarum was my favorite rutherford book
books,not_removed,the aubreymaturin series are amazing reads i finished my second voyage through them a couple of years ago and i can hear them calling again
books,not_removed,king rat is an amazing book
books,not_removed,id say conn iggulden and simon scarrow belong in that list too
books,not_removed,binged the last kingdom trilogy from cornwell years ago i still see shieldwalls in my dreams that man likes his shieldwalls
books,not_removed,i never felt bernard cornwell was in the same league but definitely patrick obrian and hilary mantel
books,not_removed,i totally forgot that i read london until now that was a nice book
books,not_removed,i read micheners space years ago as a kid and absolutely loved it found the tattered copy recently at my parents house and reread it even better the second time
books,not_removed,do all the books follow how many is there in the saga
books,not_removed,alaska
books,not_removed,just dont real whirlwind i loved shogun and liked noble housetaipan but i couldnt even finish whirlwind after forcing myself for days on end it was too damn slow monotonous and bland now i need to go read king rat
books,not_removed,thanks for the info on the other books have been meaning to read past shogun for years as well
books,not_removed,i liked king rat better myself mind you i was something like when i last read them so more than years has passed and i dont remember them very well there was also a tv miniseries of shogun that was pretty decent if i recall correctly
books,not_removed,eric larson has great historical nonfiction reads better than fiction
books,not_removed,so sorry but our lord toranagas plan may be hard to understand for a barbarian neh
books,not_removed,lol since posting im at i honestly have no idea what the last or so pages can bring
books,not_removed,yoshi toranaganohminowarasama ahhh i need to read it again
books,not_removed,become shogun duh
books,not_removed,toranaga is such a great character so brilliant
books,not_removed,i remember watching it as a kid and tried to find it online to watch once i finish the book any links everywhere i checked turned up empty
books,not_removed,alternatively you can watch the last samurai while drunk and stoned and its almost tolerable
books,not_removed,yes the mini series is a really good watch the acting is a bit dated but its still a really good watch
books,not_removed,if i recall correctly shogun was the first miniseries ever made it literally created the genre
books,not_removed,i have this series as a box set pretty well done for a tv adaptation
books,not_removed,evidently when it was airing restaurants reported their income going down noticeably since people were staying in to watch
books,not_removed,i wasnt allowed to watch it because it had the not suitable for younger viewers warning pissed my nine year old self right off
books,not_removed,took too long to scroll to find this post i recommend musashi to anyone that i think may have the patience for a book that size it is absolutely amazing from page one and had me fully immersed in that universe very quickly what a fantastic book
books,not_removed,completely criminal how far down this is musashi is fantastic vagabond the manga adaptation is just as good
books,not_removed,my favorite book ever
books,not_removed,musashi is infinitely a better book but shogun is easier to read and because of that he is more famous in the usa
books,not_removed,ahh i was looking into this book correct me if im wrong but musashi is a collection of the musashi series in one book way of the samuraibushido code ect not sure if its them all or if musashi is the final book in the series
books,not_removed,exactly i read it directly after shogun a perfect match carrying on in a way where shogun ended
books,not_removed,i wish i could find it cheaper amazon has it for a hefty price
books,not_removed,just wanted to jump in and say ive been reading clavell since i was bad grades being ground from everything for months and noble house is by far the most complex entertaining book ive ever read a masterpiece
books,not_removed,ive also read shogun from my dads old books and agree its probably the best book ive read likewise my dad said the same wait till you get to noble house its been years have not gotten to noble house yet
books,not_removed,agree read taipan first then noble house fwiw there are miniserieslong movie versions of both not bad but they cant capture the complex characterizations and plots of the novels i thought id also like gaijin but sadly was mistaken
books,not_removed,oh man the continuity is amazing this japanese girl in taipan i think says shes decended from an anjin aka blackthorne
books,not_removed,did you know that the nobel house is very loosely based the the stillexisting company jardine matheson httpsenwikipediaorgwikijardinematheson
books,not_removed,does he always slightly change the names of people and places like in shogun that always drove me nuts
books,not_removed,hahaha that makes me so happy to hear its convenient that its broken down into or books as well
books,not_removed,where in japan i have been a few times there is so much to see do and eat if your going to kyoto i can recommend the best kushi katsu place right in this market by kyoto tower but there is usually a line for minutes or so you have to wait because it only holds like people at once
books,not_removed,i read the historical novel taiko about toyotomi hideyoshi before i went to japan and i strongly recommend it its very long but i found it captivating its by the same author who did a five book series on musashi
books,not_removed,read gaijin when youre done
books,not_removed,similar story when i was in high school my favorite teacher recommended the book because it was his favorite so i was like ok and read it i think he was slightly surprised i read the whole thing but i think i inspired him to reread it after he finished his reread he brought it up somewhat bashfully and said that he had forgotten how much adult material was in the book and probably shouldnt have recommended it to one of his students üòÇ
books,not_removed,me too i remember when i was in school and simply picked the thickest book in the library and eventually i read all of them
books,not_removed,try wyvern by a a attanasio
books,not_removed,joss
books,not_removed,jesus christ did you get a fortune cookie after getting that tattoo
books,not_removed,good lord
books,not_removed,you mind posting a pic
books,not_removed,gaijin is a good book its just his worst book and a lot of work whirlwind is really good and rarely mentioned as well
books,not_removed,weird gaijin was my favorite
books,not_removed,gaijin was a good book like youre being cute but if youre a clavell fan then gaijin would make sense to read
books,not_removed,king rat has to be my favourite after sh≈çgun taipan was also very good the rest where only meh
books,not_removed,it killed off jc books for me i found it overly wandering and like it was trying too hard worst of that series funny though having just visited hong kong the books were on my mind a great deal still need to visit japan though
books,not_removed,yeah its not historical fiction in the vein of hilary mantel its basically a novel in a historical setting
books,not_removed,totally agree
books,not_removed,read it in my teens and thats the exact problem i had amazing build up to the most obvious and totally not going to do itdid it ending so much so that it lets the rest of the book down imo
books,not_removed,im listening to it right now during my short commutes just driving jogging cigar time and general down time im an old pro at long audiobooks but at and a half hours shogun is freaking epic in more ways than one
books,not_removed,it is loosely based on william adams i believe httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwilliamadamssailor
books,not_removed,i didnt see this when i read the book tai pan is a great novel and to anyone who is turned off by it being randy in any way dont worry about it whatever philosophy someone is interested in they can find it in almost any great novel
books,not_removed,i think he got it from when he was hanging around hong kong and when he was imprisoned by the japanese
books,not_removed,spoilers white saviour hes used as a pawn indefinitely by toranaga and ends up being disgusted by europeans and tries to fully assimilate into the superior japanese culture rbooks will never fail to upvote the snobbish opinion from the guy who pretends that he knows more than everyone else
books,not_removed,i found the characters to be sufficiently distinct tokugawa the patient chessmaster and noh dramatist yabu the conniving sychophant omi the loyal patriot buntaro and mariko the exemplars of samurai fortitude and loyalty and anjin was not exactly a white savior more like an english pawn in a japanese feudal intrigue im maybe overly defensive because this book changed my life at a young age when i read it it opened my eyes to a rich and fascinating world that is very different and yet very familiar to my own im sad that your experience of it was so different i agree that the peeing from the castle wall scene was memorable other scenes that stuck with me is that treason not if you win will you win hai anjin stamping on the cross anjins suicide attempt and everything involving buntaro because he is my favorite character through blackthornes eyes we learn the meaning of loyalty duty honor by the end of the book our own world has become foreign changed my life tldr imho the foreigner as narrarator is not necessarily a white savior ala dances with samurai very popular in japan btw he is someone relatable to ground the reader as we enter this new landscape
books,not_removed,i reread shogun after becoming fluent in japanese and the japanese dialogue is just painful now i can mostly ignore it and continue on with the story but there are a few totally egregious cases where it makes zero sense and totally breaks continuity ex maid points a pistol at a samurai and says ugoku na douzo i dont know about the chinese speech but for at least the japanese its more like a machine translation where he heard that douzo means please and doesnt know the nuances to make it work
books,not_removed,i had trouble keeping up with the characters because of the names sometimes i had to back up and reread or sometimes more chapters to comprehend wtf is going on well worth the effort so try again would be my opinion
books,not_removed,yeah but its not about the battle
books,not_removed,in what way i loved the book and i felt that the ending was very openended and let the reader imagine their own version of blackthornes fate especially with what toranage tells the narrator at the end
books,not_removed,totally different style from michener in my opinion michener is more of a nonfiction style in a historical fiction book he comes off more textbooky with history than clavell last book i read of micheners is a reread of polandwhich is great but its more a collected stories of history told as described clavell even with a shorter book like king rat feels more fiction than non even though he does his research quite thoroughly the things that keep clavell respectable to a child or an adult is that he did huge amounts of research and stays close to history when you find an interested in finding out who toranaga was it is easy to see what he based it on anyhow i still love both all of clavells are worth the reread
books,not_removed,someone who knows the language better may correct me but i believe the japanese in the book is a little archaic
books,not_removed,movie better condenses a lot of shit the farmers digging up the sword after the earthquake the weird subplot with samurai chicks husband and preserves the important plot elements clavell traditionally straddles the line between world building and story poorly you can tell hes fascinated by the quasihistorical worlds hes created but at times hes content to live there rather than strictly use them as a vehicle for tales of the human condition but where he gets it right it is sublime that was well presented in the miniseries
books,not_removed,whenever i recommend this book to friends i tell them to not let the beginning get to you just be patient and read through this part and i promise this is perhaps one of the best you will ever read
books,not_removed,how so
books,not_removed,can you read king rat without tai pan and noble house loved shogun too never had much interest in the others and i cant remember if they do or how much they connect radically different time periods no plus theyre a little intimidating in size ever since i picked up the game of thrones ebook without ever seeing the physical books im a little wary of letting a series dominate months of my reading
books,not_removed,i tried to read them in chronological order loved shogun liked taipan and totally lost interest in noble house is it worth going back for king rat
books,not_removed,tess be poxed
books,not_removed,save
books,not_removed,no way this person doesnt read king rat
books,not_removed,king rat was better written but shogun was much more enjoyable especiall when you read it as a young teenager pre internet days who doesn¬¥t know a lot about japan
books,not_removed,i had read it when i was much younger and thought it was great i just reread it a month or so ago and man is that writing dreadful it just isnt a good book completely mediocre
books,not_removed,this completely dont know why people want to suck ken follets dick so bad for this book the story was weak
books,not_removed,i hated all that architectural jargon i quit reading pillars because of it
books,not_removed,sorry about that just smack me next time fixed my post
books,not_removed,ive read all the books discussed here and must say my vote is with colleen mcculloughs rome series for background research character development and plot she was a true word smith clavell is perhaps my second favorite novelist and throw michner in there for good measure
books,not_removed,dont forget exodus armageddon and mila
books,not_removed,i read oharas choice when i was a young impressionable lass loved it now its alright but trinity still holds up as an amazing book
books,not_removed,ive read trinity times and still dont get it all great book
books,not_removed,for first man in rome i was living in the mediterranean while reading it and felt like i could close my eyes and hear the forum come alive around me
books,not_removed,absolutely this kind of takes a while to get going but so incredibly worth it stephenson is another of my favorite authors
books,not_removed,baroque cycle and cryptonomicon
books,not_removed,one hundred times this and cryptonomicon
books,not_removed,i tried reading his war of the roses then went on wikipedia to check something i found interesting and realised hed changed the history loads the one thing i can remember was the duke guy who was one of the main characters was framed in the book but in real life he actually was doing the thing he was accused of it ruined everything are all these authors like that
books,not_removed,i absolutely tore through the khan series a great read slowed down a bit for rome but still enjoyed
books,not_removed,his ancient rome series is an abomination
books,not_removed,wholeheartedly agree her books are excellent the sunne in splendour was incredible
books,not_removed,hillary mantel the fact that the first two novels in her cromwell series won the booker prize should be enough to convince you of her astonishing skills as a writer and are simply wonderful the novels of patrick obrian are perhaps unique in all historical fiction twenty novels in all that are renowned for their historical accuracy attention to detail and historically appropriate plots dialogue and characterisation amazing stuff httpsenwikipediaorgwikialfredduggan is an almost forgotten historical novelist from britain not only an archaeologist but also an author his novels are known for their historical accuracy and attention to detail not sure if you can find many of his books still in print though one of my favourites was his first a knight in armour that tells the story of an english knight on the first crusade wrote a great many excellent novels set in ancient times both greece and rome she was famous for tackling taboo subjects you should check them out i could go on
books,not_removed,hes one of my favorite authors too and id recommend instead books like the gulag archipelago and heart of darkness and the movie apocalypse now and musashi by eiji yoshikawa
books,not_removed,from a historical standpoint his emperor series is an abomination it barely qualifies as historical fiction
books,not_removed,you just blew my mind thats fantastic news huge fan of both of those novels i feel like i can just soak up being in that world theyre both books i linger over the details in
books,not_removed,he has no plan he just wishes to serve the emperor he has said it a thousand times
books,not_removed,ah so desu
books,not_removed,ayyeeeeee
books,not_removed,baka gaijin
books,not_removed,its got a great ending i do love that book
books,not_removed,how many pages is this book
books,not_removed,if you type the name into youtube this guy has put up the show in parts on his channel
books,not_removed,shogun was basically the game of thrones of its time it was a huge hit despite being more violent than any mainstream tv show ever think it was the first onscreen beheading and fairly inyourface sexual stuff ripe for a remake methinks
books,not_removed,i forget if that ran before rich man poor man they were both great from the late
books,not_removed,i wasnt sure about musashi until i got to the part with the gardener who hands him the cut flower through the gate the description in that scene is something i have spent years thinking back on and i think musashis observational prowess is something that can only be done justice through print such a fantastic book if youre interested in the mindset and thought process of what movies can only show as sword fight after sword fight
books,not_removed,it is the bollocks and the adaptation to film is also the bollocks
books,not_removed,its worth it though the book itself is beautiful
books,not_removed,its a book i like owning i have the hardcover
books,not_removed,its worth every penny
books,not_removed,its probably the most exciting book about business youll ever read in your life
books,not_removed,this so much op should rejoice that he has two more great books to read in a similar vein gaijin was a disappointment and somewhat of a slog compared to the pageturning others for me as well king rat is good but quite different so id read that last unless youre in the mood for different
books,not_removed,peter jackson nods approvingly seriously good read though i burned through it
books,not_removed,commenting for others benefit both books are written by the author of cloud atlas a much better book than film and more interesting structurally and after years of small crossover cameos and such all his books were officially made into a consistent joint universe in the bone clocks theres been one book since and im desperately waiting for another
books,not_removed,just finished the first part of thousand autumns enjoyable read so far with a great view of the closedoff culture of the time the early chapters of part two have me excited with possibilities for whats to come i read shogun a few years back and loved it throughout but was very frustrated with a lack of resolution i felt at the end could easily have gone for another pages
books,not_removed,i loved that book and your username too
books,not_removed,pffft best kushikatsu is found in osaka but thanks for your post made me remember and want to read this book again try dennis wheatleys the devil rides out read this around the same time and it too blew me away
books,not_removed,im going to tokyo hakuba and kyoto in april im so excited any tips appreciated
books,not_removed,you have made a huge mistake
books,not_removed,looks like a prawn crackers sort of joint
books,not_removed,i dont think they serve fortune cookies in prison
books,not_removed,well youre not supposed to hes not the protagonist just the guy holding the camera the book is really about the guy in the title the future shogun
books,not_removed,it is definitely a marathon
books,not_removed,that guy looks chinese though and he watched some j drama from the hes pretty much a professor
books,not_removed,hong konger here i read noble house and i can assure you that if you talk in hong kong the way hong kong people talk in noble house you will end up a youtube celebrity the next day
books,not_removed,sure dude just like avatar is not an orientalist narrative or the last samurai for that matter theyre just about cultural assimilation it doesnt have to follow the trope to the letter to be orientalist trash this is a book written by a white guy to fulfill white man sexual fantasies its trashy poorly written sexist racist and orientalist entertainment
books,not_removed,it should also be worth mentioning that king rat is almost a memoir as well he was captured at singapore at like or and spent the entire war in the changi prison camp that book draws entirely from his own experiences he was also was born and raised in asia and never left he wasnt just some englishman writing about something he didnt know
books,not_removed,i lived on a farm every summer when young and we had a tiny bookmobile as our only library one year i broke both my wrists and was laid up for six weeks shogun king rat taipan got my through an entire summer of forced idleness i was or and wanted nothing so much as to run away and be either a samurai or sailor in the orient huge books can be a blessing sometimes
books,not_removed,you have to read tai pan how else do you know the start of struan the scheming by dirk struan and tyler brock is amazing
books,not_removed,well king rat is much shorter than the others so thats a plus for you its the best of a good lot in my opinion only clavell book i reread every few years though that might have to do with the length somewhat but yeah its not to be missed
books,not_removed,yes you totally can read king rat without reading tai pan or noble house they are unrelated apart from a cameo appearance iirc one of the main prisoners in king rat makes an extremely brief appearance in noble house
books,not_removed,theyre all my favorite but noble house is most my favorite so many different threads going on at once
books,not_removed,king rat was his first novel and has no ties to the other books other than the main character making a one page appearance in noble house and king rat is a pretty powerful story made even more so by knowing that its based very heavily on the authors own experiences
books,not_removed,king rat was published first so yes
books,not_removed,i love shogun one of my favorite books of all time i study japanese and have lived in japan and this book is very close to my heart that being said tai pan is also incredible you thought blackthorn was a badass whistle i never got more than pages into gaijin though maybe i should give it another try
books,not_removed,yes king rat is the first book james clavell wrote and would be the first in the series by publication order
books,not_removed,i read and loved shogun had no interest in taipan but decided to read it anyway because i liked shogun why not i thought taipan blew me away one of my favourite books now and imho far better than shogun and shogun was good im currently midway through gaijin and loving it but not as much as shogun or taipan id really recommend you keep going with them
books,not_removed,king rat can be read on its own
books,not_removed,yeah king rat doesnt have anyone from the struan lineage iirc but has a character that has a cameo in noble house fav book in the series king rat is fantastic though
books,not_removed,you can totally read king rat as a one off all the books in the asian saga taken place decades and sometimes centuries apart from each other usually involving decendants of characters they can be enjoyed in any order although youre missing out because they are fantastic
books,not_removed,i read king rat and loved it but havent read taipan or noble house
books,not_removed,ive only read shogun and tai pan so i dont know but tai pan was fantastic no need to skip it
books,not_removed,actually you can each book is independent of the others in terms of its story however its really nice if you read it in its chronological order you understand the characters better and how they relate to each other
books,not_removed,all this talk and not a word about the problematic orientalism shot through these books the plots are all essentially powerful white man goes to asia is worshipped by the local women who he has lots and lots of sex with and shows the treacherous asians that you cant trust how to run a real business how do people not notice this stuff how do you read it without cringing
books,not_removed,king rat is shorter easier to read and less connected to the other books
books,not_removed,i was lucky enough to start with the first one loved all of them
books,not_removed,yes then see the movie
books,not_removed,im exactly you loved shogun really like taipan couldnt finish noble house king rat is just as good as shogun
books,not_removed,king rat is amazing
books,not_removed,is it worth going back for king rat yes yes it is nh is when clavell started believing his own press thought that he could never write a bad word ever again
books,not_removed,completely its much more focused and has superb story telling
books,not_removed,absolutely yes king rat is nothing like his other books its the shortest least waffly and has the best ending
books,not_removed,i was told to read it because of the architecture stuff and loved it years later everyone is raving about it for the story so i tried rereading it because i couldnt remember anything other than the architecture yeah read it for the architecture
books,not_removed,are you talking about pillars or shogun
books,not_removed,what would be a good title to start with
books,not_removed,not historical fiction but i just finished another stephenson book snowcrash just wow
books,not_removed,i thought about saying cryptonomicon as well but wasnt sure it was historical enough plus i couldnt be bothered at the time but yes these four books are my favourite books ever
books,not_removed,are all these authors like that unfortunately a lot of them are thats why its euphemistically called historical fiction some good exceptions are hillary mantel patrick obrian though he did admit to being flexible with timelines to support his characters being involved in some major events alan furst and to a degree bernard cornwell
books,not_removed,conn does at least put a section at the end of each book detailing most of the changes and the reasons why historical fiction has to strike a balance between accuracy and telling a good story
books,not_removed,history wise i agree but it was an ok read
books,not_removed,mary renault is fantastic i particularly love her arthurian retelling
books,not_removed,thanks can you list a few more
books,not_removed,i realised that after i went further and read caesar by christian meier and spqr by professor mary beard but it is fantastic fiction based loosely on facts those books caused me to do some further reading and so i rate them for that reason
books,not_removed,i look forward to sharing thoughts whenever its released did you read his century trilogy
books,not_removed,soba soba
books,not_removed,really i was so disappointed by the ending
books,not_removed,youre joking its one of the worst endings to a book ive ever read
books,not_removed,omg it fcking worked im starting part tonight cant keep me eyes open to read anymore anyway lol
books,not_removed,hey thanks i havent seen this since it was on tv in
books,not_removed,ripe for a remake methinks yes please id watch the shit out of that if it were done well
books,not_removed,should i read his other books before i read the bone clocks then
books,not_removed,shinsekai all the way
books,not_removed,just drink it all in embrace every second i went to tokyo takayama and kyoto about a year and a half ago and i miss it every day tokyo just may be the greatest city on earth
books,not_removed,oh dear god why would you put that on your body and why in that font
books,not_removed,never left he was born in australia joined the royal artillery in and spent time in malaya was captured when he was spent the war in a prison camp in singapore and moved to the united states in
books,not_removed,i discovered a paperback copy of shogun during a garage sale my family had i was it was the cover with the redclad samurai riding his arrowstuck horse to the ground both swords drawn deflecting arrows i was like mom whats this she was like oh theres sex in that considering that was all she needed to say to get me to read jaws and beast i was fucking sold started in that summer and it lasted me halfway into the eighth grade prime material for reading classs response assignments shogun has influenced me all my life since i was an english major but i basically couldve done an asian studies minor with all the classes i took on japanese literature both classical and modern hell my senior project was a noh play i wrote about the culture clash of portuguese bringing guns and catholicism to japan with two of my characters based on father martin alvito and his most loyal monk plus a pissed off takeda samurai ghost for good measure i even had my academic advisor who taught most of my japanrelated classes and is the foremost nonjapanese master of ikebana the samurai art of flower arrangement read shogun he read it on his flights to and from japan one summer if people here are worried about orientalism know that he at least said i didnt put it down while reading it meaning it wasnt bad enough to offend his prestigious sensibilities his opinion was its a romance novel but for year old me that book was a fucking time machine i too wished to follow balckthornes path now that youve read the book check out the shogun tv miniseries with sir richard chamberlain as blackthorne he plays the part beautifully i couldnt imagine a better man for the part
books,not_removed,just replying here to remind everyone that we dont need to go meta its a good post lets not ruin it
books,not_removed,tai pan is probably the slowest book in the series
books,not_removed,king rat was based on the authors own experiences but his historical novels of century asia are much more fun and much less brutal
books,not_removed,i still have such a clear image of him frying eggs i dont know why that stuck with me its been years and plenty of details are hazy i love both king rat and shogun but i think anjinsan takes the cake for me
books,not_removed,yeah i read shogun then king rat then tai pan and never got around to finishing noble house king rat was a great book
books,not_removed,is king rat connected to shogun ive never read any books of the series is it ok to start with king rat
books,not_removed,first off shogun is a fictionalized account of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwilliamadamssailor so its not like its some sort of trope you assume it to be second youre cherry picking gaijin has almost none of that unless you count the yoshiwara doing business and leveraging their power over the western traders also tess is a lovely strong female character last the asia of now was not the asia of then the entire golden triangle is one huge story about power inequity china was the weak man of asia according to the british however is that going to look good for asia is it all nonfiction no but its not the powertripping erotic adventure you assume it to be what you overlook is that all these books are about culture clash whirlwind is an excellent example of a culture within a culture clashing with the west and im sure youll like the end where the sybaritic west is tossed out at the end
books,not_removed,now i definitely want to read it
books,not_removed,more importantly this would never have occurred to me in a million years until you said it why is your first thought that the locals are worse off i read a book about meshing of cultures and one mans embrace of foreign ways a man who is used by tactical masterminds because of his ability to instruct on firearms training and his unique situation someone who is from a group of people who are actually shown in a pretty bad light and someone who although superior in some ways is pretty badly off in others your perspective is sad
books,not_removed,i think youre being too critical it was written before all that and for an audience that didnt care about pcness im asian not japanese and typically abhor novels set in asia for this reason and cant stand the show marco polo but were reading shogun aloud right now and im quite enjoying it they also talk about the westerners never showering and bleeding as a medical treatment so it doesnt seem to favor european customs that much also it kind of cracks me up when my husband horribly mangles the japanese
books,not_removed,if im recalling shogun correctly your analysis is childishsimplistic taking into account the narrator being an englishman from years ago both sides are still presented with positives and negatives hell the book is partially about the protagonist accepting his situation and embracing a foreign culture
books,not_removed,i dont think its as cringeworthy as you think i found an interesting reddit post about this topic with links to a series of essays written by western and japanese academics personally i havent reread the book since i was dont remember many of the details but i do know its bases on the historical account of william adams as i recall there is still room for discussion on orientalism in the book but its not quite as bad as say tom cruise as the last samurai
books,not_removed,i enjoyed the books but youre not wrong it can get a little over the top sometimes
books,not_removed,i saw it more as a comparison between the western love of action and daring vs the oriental love of intrigue and deception put against almost any other novel of its time it was remarkably even handed in its treatment of the oriental
books,not_removed,in that case ill have to give it a read thanks for the advice
books,not_removed,this is great news i couldnt get in to noble house but will certainly pick up a copy of king rat
books,not_removed,wow high praise ive only read shogun taipan and gaijin sounds like a major gap in my education
books,not_removed,haha im glad to find out all these years later that i wasnt the only one who thought nh was a bit rubbish ill give king rat a go though thanks
books,not_removed,my grandma loves ken follett so ive always just assumed that his writing was bad she keeps recommending his books and i keep saying ill read them at some point
books,not_removed,pillars
books,not_removed,the first one is called first man in rome
books,not_removed,theres a collection on amazon for kindle if you would like to start
books,not_removed,anathem for the win reamde not so much
books,not_removed,read seveneves next
books,not_removed,redneck katana
books,not_removed,i cant really get over caesar and brutus being the same age and childhood best friends and thats only the worst of it adrian goldsworthys biography of caesar is the best biography ive ever read
books,not_removed,wakarimasu ka
books,not_removed,i was too i felt it let the tension that was building throughout the novel fizzle out still despite that its my favourite book and i reread it as soon as i finished it
books,not_removed,the ending is a lot less disappointing if you have prior knowledge of the aftermath of the events and suddenly it all just clicks into place because you find out the real names of the people
books,not_removed,i was too but unlike other books and shows it didnt ruin it for me when it was so
books,not_removed,i just wanted it to be pages longer of the plan happening instead of being summarized
books,not_removed,ending not with a bang but with a fizzle like a burning ember sinking into water
books,not_removed,me too ive never been so disappointed after such glory
books,not_removed,why do you feel its one of the worst
books,not_removed,as many as you can be bothered to read yes black swan green his semiautobiographical book about his childhood and struggles with his stutter is oddly linked to the magical realismscifi stuff that comes later cloud atlas the thousand autumns of jacob dezoet and maybe ghostwritten are the main ones to read before the bone clocks
books,not_removed,to finally become „ÅäÁÆ∏‰∏äÊâã
books,not_removed,shush
books,not_removed,check out the shogun tv miniseries with sir richard chamberlain as blackthorne im old enough to have seen it live on tv
books,not_removed,very similar story here my grandmother gave me a copy when i was or and i devoured it i have no idea whether shed decided that i was ready for the sex and violence and maybe that my parents were keeping me too sheltered or if she hadnt read it herself and didnt know the weekend after finishing it i stumbled across a stash of old books at a dead professors estate sale and became the newest and proudest and probably only teenage owner of the sansom triology i devoured that too i later came back and finished off the rest of clavells books from there i launched into a broader reading of nonfiction history about east asia along with other chunks of the planet that caught my fancy i never formalized the hobby in college and ive never been exclusively interested in asian history food literature movies music women whatever but ive never given it up either i lived and worked in the region for a few years and i found that having spent years learning about the geography histories cuisine and cultures gave me a tremendous advantage when it came to building business relationships and making personal connections in fact its hard to imagine who id be today if not for those experiences and i owe all of them to james clavelland grandma
books,not_removed,so have you seen silence yet
books,not_removed,the tv series is fucking incredible the way they slowly fill in the subtitles as blackthorne learns japanese was a genius touch
books,not_removed,whats wrong with talking about personal experiences its a bit off topic that the guy broke both his wrists when he was oh ohhh
books,not_removed,well said and thank you
books,not_removed,i was waiting for the post to take a turn any second i was pleasantly surprised
books,not_removed,thank you was bracing myself
books,not_removed,the fact we were all thinking it means it went meta on its own edit fixed a wonky letter
books,not_removed,gaijin is the slowest
books,not_removed,not at all taipan is only to shogun gaijin and whirlwind move at george rr martin pace
books,not_removed,yes but its still my favorite
books,not_removed,they arent connected in any way other than having asia as a setting king rat is the story of allied pows and their relationship with themselves each other and the guards i highly recommend it
books,not_removed,william adams was metal as hell and yes he played a role in the history here not just some trope he was known as the navigator of miura and the train i ride in to work everyday has a stop called anjinzuka which roughly translates to the burial mound of the navigator his memorial is at the top of the mountain at that stop his story alone is awesome and worth looking at
books,not_removed,they probably havent even read it dude
books,not_removed,off topic if you want to post a link that has a in on reddit you have to escape it with a like this wikiwilliamadamssailor httpsenwikipediaorg goes where the is and if i leave it in it screws the example up i cant figure out how to stop reddit from autolinking anything that starts with https
books,not_removed,theres a lot to be said for the problematic nature of shogun though the book is wonderfully well written but its also obviously a product of its time it cant be ignored that theres a lot in there which is uncomfortable in hindsight theres literally a scene early on in the book where the japanese women washing him are so impressed with how big his white dick is they just have to have sex with him theres also been a lot of criticism of the s mariko relationship in texts talking about the book arguing that clavell essentially others the japanese so much yet gives him an oriental princess that understands him to such an extent shes willing to shame her entire family and son a supposed massive deal to her i personally dont give this view much credence as it kind of makes sense that a catholic with such a strong grasp of languages is likely to be more sympathetic all that being said though clavell does approach some aspects of the book progressively considering it was written in the seventies s the way he approaches homosexuality with blackthorne admitting he was tempted whilst at sea and perhaps thats why hes so upset by the accusation and the fact that japanese attitudes to homosexuality is given a lot of room to develop and actually comes across as enlightened its also undoubtable that whilst blackthorne is a bit of a white man protagonist in the book most of his enemies s aside from yabu and to a lesser extent omi are european catholics and their mutual hatred is well dissected by both the europeans and the japanese shogun is definitely worth the read and i think very progressive for its time but it needs to be read as a product of its time in my opinion and there are definitely head shaking moments that need to be taken with a pinch of salt
books,not_removed,please comport yourself with more decorum this is rbooks
books,not_removed,shogun was published in and saids academic work orientalism was published in so the critique actually seems pretty chronologically relevant however orientalism is typically only applied to western views of the near east
books,not_removed,you have to understand its the only lens they have because theyve known nothing else their entire lives they were raised in that culture its not an excuse for them just an observation on my part i pity them
books,not_removed,funny i loved noble house
books,not_removed,he wrote eye of the needle didnt he i loved that one
books,not_removed,his protagonists are anachronistic everyone has century values shallow intrigue doesnt even cut it as a page turner and is very light on the history its more like medieval fantasy without the fantasy havent read much tho picked pillars of the earth and dropped it pages in
books,not_removed,pillars of the earth and its sequel world without end are two of my favorite novels theyre follett at his zenith fall of giants is also a pretty good absorbing read everything else is pure shit
books,not_removed,ugh i liked em both the insight into virtual worlds and their economies and implications with money laundering were really eyeopening
books,not_removed,thanks ill check that out i agree it is a bit far from the truth but it is very well written only thing i dont like is that maybe some people wouldnt look further and assume it was accurate
books,not_removed,wakarimasen
books,not_removed,yeah i still love the book i just wish the ending resolved more maybe it needed another pages
books,not_removed,the author goes into such intricate detail about how smart toranaga is constantly hinting at his intricate brilliance and how he weaves amazing plots of deception and subterfuge he keeps cornering toranaga into a harder and harder place to escape near the end you cant imagine how he intends to get out of it and then the book ends basically with a oh yeah his super smart plan worked and he won end of story
books,not_removed,cool ive already read half of those
books,not_removed,watching it as a kid on tv is what got me reading his work in the first place
books,not_removed,same here have my upvote
books,not_removed,ha ha this however i was looking for it to rent about years back and accidentally rented a hour condensed version of it that was a pure mess so make sure youre getting the full miniseries version which is still condensed but chamberlain is great
books,not_removed,not yet my advisor emailed me a review of that movie a couple weeks ago ive been meaning to write him a letter for a while now
books,not_removed,its ok this guys mom clearly didnt love him or thered be more to the story
books,not_removed,and even that was meta metas all the way down
books,not_removed,gaijin is totally skippable and i highly suggest you do so
books,not_removed,gaijin is probably the slowest close second though is whirlwind which is really only tangentially related
books,not_removed,actually peter marlowe the protagonist from king rat appears in noble house at a party i believe dunross meets him and they have a quick chat marlowe is back in asia researching a book about the war or something pretty sure marlowe mentions being a pow in changhi
books,not_removed,theyre all tied into the noble house even blackthorne is a an ancestor of the japenese woman who helps ian dunross in noble house
books,not_removed,thanks ill give it a go
books,not_removed,and the rats lets not forget the rats
books,not_removed,and capitalism
books,not_removed,with those specifics that is fair i have not read it for a few years and my first reading was when i was much younger and did not see all of those themes rose colored vision strikes us all i am afrain
books,not_removed,yeah its not bad at all its just long and takes a good deal of determination to get through but it definitely pays off
books,not_removed,i liked fall of giants and winter of the world but never finished edge of eternity i read somewhere that follett is a little heavy on the fiction and light on the historical i still found them entertaining at least
books,not_removed,that makes more sense i enjoyed ken but dont think ive read outside the books mentioned
books,not_removed,yeah it wasnt a bad ending it was a bit abrupt but it was clean
books,not_removed,slade house comes after the bone clocks and goes back to the structural experimentation he played around with in cloud atlas and ghostwritten another oddball work but eventually links up to stuff from the bone clocks and pushes that greater narrative forwards id just been on a weird fiction short story kick before reading it so it suited my tastes at the time perfectly and i ended up enjoying it thoroughly
books,not_removed,her having to give me baths because both hands were in plaster casts up to the shoulders was embarrassing enough thank you very much besides if you dont know ways by the time you are you arent very creative
books,not_removed,its been a while since i read king rat and noble house but in addition to marlowe isnt there another kr character who makes an appearance in nh im too lazy to look it up but i seem to remember a british member of parliament who hates marlowe because of changi or am i misremembering that
books,not_removed,thats an interesting connection i havent read noble house just shogun taipan and king rat thanks for letting us know
books,not_removed,it almost seemed like the books galleys were getting too hefty for the publishers liking just wrap it up jimmy how are we supposed to do the binding on this beast i wouldnt have minded another pages
books,not_removed,thats right hes a labour mp called grey and hes the tai pans brother in law
books,not_removed,james clavell is peter marlowe he was shot down in and imprisoned in changi king rat is semiautobiographical
books,not_removed,i grew up in hong kong so possibly slightly biased but noble house is very good also largely based on true events and real people which is interesting including the collapse of the kotewall road apartment block
books,not_removed,theyre all technically interlinked an ancestor of john blackthorn turns up in noble house
books,not_removed,descendent right
books,not_removed,try rwhatsthatbook or rtipofmytongue
books,not_removed,i will thank you
books,not_removed,it is not about enjoyment for me it is more about reading the book in the way the author intended for me to read it without knowing the spoilers there is a special place in hell for people who spoil booksshowsmovies for others
books,not_removed,there are two main cases when a spoiler is important a mystery or a huge plot twist other than those i dont think anything is enough of a spoiler to actually make reading a book less enjoyable i dont read a book because i only need to know the important parts and how it ends i read a book to go on a journey emotional or physical along with the characters i can still go on that journey even if ive read the book before and in those cases where i know whodunit or about the plot twist i might end up reading the book with a different agenda like to see how the author seeded in the clues or how they left out just enough details ive read a lot of books after watching a movie version and it is always a totally different experience generally though when i read i become so immersed in the story it doesnt matter if somewhere in the back of my brain i already know the entire story as i read i live the story along with the characters thinking what they are thinking feeling what they are feeling experiencing it along with them i can even catch myself hoping somehow the spoiler wont happen this time a good book shouldnt be good only because it has one scene that will shock you or be totally uninteresting if you already know who the killer is a death can be just as traumatic if you know its coming anticipation can add a lot of spice so can dread and it can be wonderful to read a story and be absolutely sure your heroes are going to survive
books,not_removed,spoilers dont ruin the book for me per se but i still hate them the journey isnt quite as fun discovering the plot twists for the first time even if its something you can see coming i like to discover it myself i do re read many books and enjoy myself every time but none of the read throughs are as good as the unspoiled first time though i agree with the article there are some cases where knowing the ending doesnt effect the enjoyment everyone went into titanic knowing the boat was going to sink it it was a massive hit i thought the movie argo was very thrilling and tense despite knowing the ending because its based on a historical event
books,not_removed,i dont mind them somehow plot twists are not the reasons why i read the books to me its mainly characters but even with them its fine if i get told something the process of reading and getting into the story is what i enjoy most sometimes i am not enthusiastic at all about finishing books actually sometimes i even intentionally look up if certain things happen because i hate long buildups to something i find stupid like certain people becoming a couple in michael j sullivans riyria books
books,not_removed,it depends on the book but i hate them for the most part
books,not_removed,im mostly not a fan but dont judge if other people like them some of my favorite books and movies are the ones that i discovered on my own and read without any expectations beyond what i read on the cover
books,not_removed,spoilers make me mad i dont even read the back cover of books anymore because ive been burned too many times
books,not_removed,i dont care in the slightest about spoilers for anything but the most plot heavy loose character stories if it isnt devoted to the plot with no character development to speak of than spoilers only help me understand the book better
books,not_removed,i often find myself covering the bottom of the page wth my hand so that my eyes cant jump down and give myself a spoiler i love the suspense i love the buildup i love that moment that makes me gasp out loud with understanding please please dont tell me i need to take the whole ride myself i need to experience the whole journey before i find out what happens would a favorite characters valiant death or sad suicide have meant as much if i hadnt experienced every second of the buildup to that one moment
books,not_removed,even if you know that youre going to end up at the park your walk there can still be enjoyable even surprising the same to me goes for books you might have had the plot twistendingetc spoiled but you can still enjoy the writing the character development the plot arc and everything else that makes the book great perhaps it has to do with being more interested in the characters than the plots of books but ive found even with spoilers i will love a great book
books,not_removed,personally i have one on my current vehicle and i dont care for it not my choice though it doesnt really affect my enjoyment of books but then i never read while driving
books,not_removed,as has already been said it does depend on the book and also the person i read the green mile after having seen the movie many times and i still loved reading it i would say maybe it enhances enjoyment because knowing the ending you can see all the little hints leading up to events it can actually help your understanding of things that are going on and why they are
books,not_removed,wasnt there a thing a few years ago not sure what country it was in but on one of those who wants to be a millionaire game shows they advertised that someone will win the million on a particular night and it turned out to be the mostwatched episode for them it baffles me but i guess some people like to play it safe
books,not_removed,i hate them especially if its a character death or something sadupsetting most of the times something has been spoiled for me ive not bothered to continue readingwatching because i dont want the negative thing to happen i saw some spoilers about harry potter and the cursed child and they left such a bad taste that i still cant bring myself to try reading the book
books,not_removed,i dont like being spoiled takes the fun out of the buildup to the plot twist its still enjoyable but i like being able to start a book without even reading the back coversynopsis and just going in blind at the same time i like to reread books and when you already know the plot of a book or even just a few major plot points you pick up a lot of the nuance missed during the first read you can focus more on the writing character development setting symbolism foreshadowing how the author weaves everything together etc rather than just wanting to know what happens next if a book is ruined by one scene being spoiled its not really a good book to begin with there is much much more to writing a book than the plot
books,not_removed,i hate them guts i do not read last cover and i read preface after the book similarly i have not seen a movie trailer in years apart maybe at cinema but i go about onceyear
books,not_removed,bullcrap spoilers put me in a state of not wanting to continue even if its something so insignificant like x character loses a thumb all ill be doing is waiting for that character to lose their thumb and wonder how its going to happen all while i lose track of what im reading and have to reread lones because my mind is too busy while reading the book i hate spoiler and this article was no doubt written by someone who tried to justify them intentionally or unintentionally spoiling something for someone intentionally spoiling things is the biggest jerk move there is
books,not_removed,its funny i actually seek them out when it comes to movies but not in my reading thats a big nono maybe because i typically feel much more invested with the amount of time and thought that goes into my reading
books,not_removed,personally i cant help it when reading a book i usually do a quick google search and use the wikia for the series to find out what happens to the character that i currently like im currently reading the red rising trilogy and part way through book i searched a character who i liked only to discover that he becomes a traitor and an enemy later on so every time a new character that i like is introduced i find out if they are relevant to the story and fall in to the trap that all curious people do i begin asking questions and rather than continuing reading the novel i turn to google i then get a lot of spoilers from the likes of tumblr and reddit and just get more confused sometimes spoilers are good and warn me to stay away from a series other times its just a way to give into curiosity which should be a deadly sin imo but isnt rarely my curious self reads reviews of books later down the line while im currently on an early book and it happens to put me off the series im also reading the mistborn series and trying so hard to keep away from spoilers i do the same with tv shows and video games
books,not_removed,spoilers are awful evil things down with spoilers
books,not_removed,reading the book the way the author intended this is exactly it why would i care if a character died holding a door or if another committed suicide i have to have been on the full journey with that person i have to know something of their lives their histories and of the truth in their hearts to truly understand why that death or that scene is so important you have to go the long way and read every word or watch every minute yourself before you can truly understand everything that particular moment means there are characters i have wept for like they were family there are scenes that have made me cry out alound with shock and then apologize to anyone in the room this is why i read i read to experience things events and especially emotions that i would otherwise not experience in my daily life for me spoilers lessen the impact of a carefully crafted scene edit spelling
books,not_removed,addon request sporting events thank you
books,not_removed,enjoyment is definitely an issue for me but i also really like your author intention point a novel is a piece of art with an intentional beginning middle and end and intentional introduction of characters events ideas etc i only get one opportunity to experience that order of course so many books are meaningful when read as a whole instead of purely sequentially eg ulysses years of solitude but first impressions still count ill always take with me the way i felt the first time i read something and that feeling will influence rereadings too
books,not_removed,thats not exactly a great argument considering that many authors intend you to gain more the second time reading a novel than the first or even if they dont intend that its still true sure in a book thats basically an action movie than spoilers can be bad but in literature books about the human condition charactersplot spoilers can significantly help you interpret the authors meaningslessonsadvice shown through different characters actionsevents
books,not_removed,youre pretty much summing up all the reasons why im reading those are the things that i enjoy in books which kind of explains why i dont really care if a book is spoiled for me
books,not_removed,thanks for the thoughtful reply these are some great points as much as i hate spoilers it can be argued that a book that can be completely ruined by a spoiler isnt really a good book theres so much more to be gained from books than just the basic plot points
books,not_removed,yep and same with movie trailers
books,not_removed,same here movie trailers these days are just one minute summaries of the whole movie and if im reading a book based on someones recommendation i dont read the cover either there are so few true surprises in the world please let me fully enjoy the plot twists on my own
books,not_removed,i cover the bottom of the page too nothing worse than spoiling a plot twist for yourself a few seconds before you get to it it takes all the suspense out of the scene
books,not_removed,im definitely more into characterdriven stories too while spoilers dont completely ruin the book i think it takes a lot a way from the experience i like to go on a journey with the characters and experience things as they experience them knowing whats going to happen beforehand takes that away
books,not_removed,thats a good point about catching all the authors little hints its why i love to reread you notice so many more things when you know what to look for
books,not_removed,trust me you arent missing anything by not reading the book
books,not_removed,damn it i only made it to pearl harbor i guess theres no point in finishing my wwii book now
books,not_removed,i used to play wow with a pretty tight group one guildmate was a diehard basketball fan but he did his duty to our guild by showing up for our scheduled raid night and was taping some final tournament game guild leader was very clear ok yall soandso is taping the big game and hes excited to watch it after our raid dont talk about the game of course couple hours in omg you guys did you see that the cavs won the amount of rage mixed with disappointment was heavy
books,not_removed,unlike booksshowsmovies a sporting event spoiler requires knowledge of wait for it the future so if i met someone that could do that i would actually want to be their friend and with time perhaps their timetravelling companion obviously added okay weird til people record sports matches to me thats weird and i dont know anyone who does it sports results are news to me and i think recording the news is weird also if i miss it live newssports then i want to know the results and highlights and ill just catch it next time but to each their own obviously ive ruffled some timeshifters feathers sowwy
books,not_removed,this is in part why i dont like authors trying to update their books its like melting an old statue and making something new out of it let it stand even if it is a terrible product of its time
books,not_removed,intend you to gain more the second time reading a novel than the first but that still means there has to be a first an unspoiled first thats not exactly a great argument it is not an argument but my opinion and i think my opinion is awesome because it is mine
books,not_removed,i dont think it ruins the book itself because a story os either great or bad on its own however i feel it ruins my experience i like to see all these things fold out on their own even if i know the basic oh evil will parish and the good will win as the way it will end i want to see it happen flr myself if i wanted to just know the ending i would ask someone to tell me or search up a synopsis and save a lot of time i like books because they give greater character development and stronger back stories and theyre ones i want to learn aboit from the author
books,not_removed,yes they give away the whole plot if its a movie i want to see ill close my eyes and ears because i am a child
books,not_removed,thats true i guess with spoilers you almost have the upper hand compared to the characters i definitely like piecing it all together as i go sometimes with no idea where were headed
books,not_removed,thats basically the impression i got
books,not_removed,i have the game set to record because i cant watch live someone spoils the game before i can get to it same as await for itbookshowmovie
books,not_removed,not if you record the event because youre out somewhere and some jack wang checks his phone and starts talking about it around you knowing dang well that you are waiting to get home and watch it i have people do that to me many times
books,not_removed,i am just saying theyre certainly books out there not basic fiction books that almost intend for you to already know the ending and this is evidence that spoilers can help you have a better first time reading experience for some books not all for example steinbecks east of eden is an allegory for the bible genesis cain and abel where the ending is already heavily implied before you even read the first word this adds not detracts it allows you to see this tale as old as time laced throughout the story by way of metaphors the way steinbecks characters shamble through the plot line towards their inevitable conclusions is part of the allure of the book sure it would still be great if you did not know the story of cain and abel but knowing the end makes the journey all more relatable while also allowing for deeper analysis of what you read as you go this is true of many books once again not books that are purely plot driven and have little to no character development just because steinbecks is an allegory for a story from the bible doesnt mean thats the only reason knowing approximately the ending helps you read deeper into the book your first time
books,not_removed,okay you said sporting event so i assumed you were at the event my bad i understand that would be annoying
books,not_removed,for example steinbecks east of eden is an allegory for the bible but how do you know that without reading the book did it say that in the beginning then the author intended you to know did you read it in a review then the author did not intend you to know it so even if you are enjoying it more you are not reading it the way it was intended to be read
books,not_removed,its a good question maybe its in part due to pemulis being an unapologetic enabler when it comes to hals addictions dfw in an interview once referred to pemulis as a kind of antichrist
books,not_removed,here is the thing about infinite jest you need to read it twice if you havent done so at least reread the first chapter
books,not_removed,i still have some empathy for him though because he grew up in a harsh social environment and his father was a rapist i dont know whether michael actually knows that it just seems like he isnt necessarily evil but rather ignorant of the grave consequences some of his actions could have such as the electrocuted door handles his behaviour during the eschaton game or the advice he gave hal near the end
books,not_removed,yes but throughout the novel he was a good friend to hal and helped the kid who was crying and told him to trust in maths why do you think dfw refer to him as an anti christ
books,not_removed,i plan to read it again in a long while
books,not_removed,ignorant of the consequences or uncaring i saw him as one of those people who thinks they know better than other people usually authority figures and dont really need to listen to their rules so his reaction to the door handles is sort of like yeah yeah i hear you but thats not really important to me and youre a teacheradministrator so i dont really care what you say similar attitude towards drugs actually
books,not_removed,im with you there on first read i thought pemulis was more or less likeable so i was surprised to hear dfw refer to him negatively on reread i wound up seeing the negative aspects a bit more clearly
books,not_removed,yes and the one of the things that make it so harsh is that he was paranoid about being suspended the whole time i feel sad for him
books,not_removed,i second that i think pemulis is one of the characters in the book that make you love wallaces writing because theres a lot of depth in him although hes a minor figure if you think about the main incandenzagately plot that being said i just wouldnt go as far as labelling him as a unapologetic enabler of hals addiciont cause i believe theres a bigger meaning in the bob hopehal ritual its sort of a need to have meaning in a life that is otherwise so controlled so notindividual that hals escapades are an attempt to have something sacred not in an religiousinstitution level pemulis of course makes things a little easier but its just another fracturated character in a dystopia where everybody with imo the exception of maybe schitt and mario is just as fucked up still sad for pemulis fate think despite the bad things hes done hes more of a victim than a villain
books,not_removed,hard to say for sure but he does dirty tricks he blackmails he circumvents the law he tempts and he ennables so although i agree that he does have some redeeming qualities there are some rough edges too
books,not_removed,you need to read the first chapter after you finish as you know chronologically it is the last action in the book and there are some some plot points in the first chapter that you will only understand once youve read the book
books,not_removed,yeah i think youre right that describes him much better
books,not_removed,ill re read it and see if my view of pemulis changes
books,not_removed,interesting why did wallace refer to him as an anti christ though what are your thoughts
books,not_removed,and heres the messy thing about that in an interview wallace also referred to schtitt as one of the antichrists of the book
books,not_removed,gotta say i havent seen that anti christ comment do you have a link to that interview or text or you know where that comment appears but i was thinking what ive said above and what you and the other ones said here and i think i could really bennefit from a re reading of the whole book cause im more and more deep in wallaces sort of litteraryaesthetic commitment to get over postmodernistic irony and to build something that can be as challenging and inovating as it can be profoundly meaninful and human i believe that with that preconception the perception of the characters in the book might deeppen a little i always thought wallace was trying to say more with pemullis than the binome smart guy with an attitude bad inconsequent guy
books,not_removed,do you have the link to that interview
books,not_removed,i may have confused my pejoratives dfw referred to shtitt as a fascist ill try to track down the link if i can
books,not_removed,im a big fan of this site httpwwwdfwaudioprojectorg the quote im thinking of is around the minute mark of this interview with michael silverblatt dfw doesnt refer to shtitt by name but he talks about the guy running the academy
books,not_removed,i just finished arrowsmith which also blew my mind first how great it was and how current in fact minutes did a segment last night that could have been drawn right from the book
books,not_removed,when the patriot act was passed all i could think of is that it was way too close to something out of the book minute men
books,not_removed,i love it picked it up a few weeks ago and couldnt put it down when people were scrambling to buy last month i figured id try something i actually hadnt read before and had more prevalent to our current situation it cant happen here did not disappoint
books,not_removed,ive not read it but its creeping up my tbr list on the kindle i just want to say that i was deeply amused by this my girlfriend left me unsupervised in a bookshop which she knows not to do
books,not_removed,im currently reading it and this is the first book ive felt the need to mark
books,not_removed,funny i almost picked it up on saturday when i was purposefully avoiding my girlfriend in the aisles of a bookstore i knew as soon as she found me shed make me leave
books,not_removed,even more prescient when you note that here in the uk to trump means to pass wind and the president in ichh is called windrip
books,not_removed,currently reading it now and like everyone else find it really freaky indeed im interested to see how the story plays out
books,not_removed,added to my list thanks
books,not_removed,ive got it in my current to read stack check out the man in the high castle for more like it and pay attention to the undertones about american society at the time
books,not_removed,i recently picked this up but have not started it yet im looking forward to reading it soon
books,not_removed,its so devastatingly accurate and relevant so what is it relevant to what happened in the late or what is happening today and if you are talking about today what specifically are you taking about
books,not_removed,sinclair lewis is very underappreciated imo you should give main street and babbitt a try
books,not_removed,she cant make you leave there are more books to buy dammit
books,not_removed,haha good spot i guess president guffblast didnt get past the editors
books,not_removed,what really struck me was the sarason bannon character most other books that imagine totalitarianism envisage a singular monstrous leader napolean the pig et al but the shadowy puppeteer is a master stroke
books,not_removed,i havent seen any of man in the high castle but it cant happen here does a lot to dispel the myths of nobility surrounding world war two it seems far more realistic to me that america joined the war because they were attacked and britain joined due to violated treaties at no point was it a noble quest to end fascism that interpretation came with hindsight the sobering reality was that in the thirties after suffering through the depression many nations america included could easily have slipped into fascism themselves
books,not_removed,i saw something in eric burns that mentioned main street last week made a mental note to check it out will have to look up babbitt as well thanks
books,not_removed,very true handing your nation over to a dictator in a time of need is a story at least as old as the roman republic it was a time when many people were suffering and fascists and communists were making it seem like they could make their problems go away when in reality they just created new problems that were far worse
books,not_removed,alphabetical by author chronological within authors name except series books in a series must always go together
books,not_removed,honestly i dont follow a logical order i order the books with my favorite front and center and i work outward from there maybe im thinking on a smaller scale than you but thats how i do it i put the books i want people to ask me about at eye level and in the center from the entryway that way if someone approaches their eyes will go to my favorite books and maybe theyll ask me about them i just kind of know approximately where books are based on how much i liked them my kids used to get into them a lot and id find a huge pile of books on the floor so thats why i stopped trying to use any sort of order plus different books of different sizes made my shelves look weird
books,not_removed,more or less randomly though sort of based on acquisition date since ive been filling the shelves as i go since moving in i have books so its juuuust too many to easily keep sorted but juuuust few enough that i never have trouble finding something by scanning the shelves i do keep series together at least
books,not_removed,alphabetical order by author
books,not_removed,randomly series are kept together but apart from that its just whatever fits where
books,not_removed,im another one who puts very little effort into organizing my books i sometimes keep authors together but there is no order to the authors and if a shelf section fills up i am most likely to have an authors works in two different places but i know pretty well where everything is
books,not_removed,pretty randomly i keep series together and then by author but mostly i just add them to the end as i buy them
books,not_removed,i am realllly really unorganized ive got one section of my bookshelf reserved for unread books and the other section is reserved for read books on my bedside table i have a collection of or books that i havent begun reading yet but are to be read immediately after the book im currently working on one of these days ill probably arrange by alphabetical order i just want to be able to see all the books that i havent tackled yet in one place or two in my case
books,not_removed,i just organized my books last night in our expedit shelf from ikea i separated fiction and nonfiction and then organized alphabetically by authors last name i separated out cook books crafting books and my boyfriends homebrew books into their own cubicles
books,not_removed,nonfiction is by subject when i get my new bookcase ill be trying to order them using the loc system but im out of room at the moment fiction will be by author though right now theyre generally by size because my shelves are different heights i keep series together and in order
books,not_removed,i separate fiction from nonfiction and i have a few subcategories cookery tolkien nonprose literature within each category i use whatever seems most logical history is arranged according to the period it covers nonprose lit is arranged chronologically and most other stuff is arranged alphabetically by author
books,not_removed,there are random bits of logical or semilogical organization popping up sporadically in a random mess the has no real logic to it except for the grouping of oxford classics together mostly its just what looks nice or saves me space the first shelf has some logical groupings norton anthologies oxford companions complete works of x the graphic novels come out of nowhere however httpiimgurcomvknsntujpg are mostly penguin editions of books but that breaks down the further along you get the black widow press and new directions books are united by the fact that other than the b s johnson novels theyre all translated books of experimental french poetry joyce is next to an explication of joyce for obvious reasons the situationists are totally out place barthes is mentioned and quoted in the introduction to the modern library edition of swanns way but mostly hes there because he belongs at the beginning of httpiimgurcomyayrvcejpg this ones dedicated primarily to literary criticism and people relevant to literary or critical theory youll see derrida dismissing foucault for his reading of descartes causing a permanent rift between the two luckily foucault is nearby nietzsche who looks up and wonder if foucault is really the true inheritor of the genealogical method lurking below on the final shelf of the bookcase is a bunch of fiction the bottom row is somewhat alphabetical but other than that its a mess from me playing book tetris but thats not all we have this shelf in two pictures and the first part is mostly things related to leftwing politics although to his probable horror hayek is in there because i didnt know where else to put him then we have the poetry section thats alphabetical of mostly fiction with authors grouped together but not alphabetized and finally we have which is mostly out of sight and for a good reason it has assorted nonfiction philosophy plays and some other miscellany alright im done
books,not_removed,my system is fairly simple the majority of my books are arranged alphabetical by author and then by title but if it is a series then i arrange them in series order instead then i have my star wars and tolkieninheritance series separated onto another shelf partially because of space and partially because of their importance to me star wars is my favorite movie series and so i love those books and lotrthe hobbit are my favorite books by a wide margin the star wars books are arranged chronologically inuniverse while my tolkien and inheritance books are arranged in seriespublication order hobbit lotr beowulf eragon eldest brisingr if you dont have any favored series or weird cases like star wars books id suggest simple author title or author publication date and then just put the series all together while leaving everything else in order
books,not_removed,i sort by fiction or nonfiction first then author then publishing order
books,not_removed,height tbhshortest vertical not page length are in the middle shelves are organized thematically high fantasy on most of the middle shelves with another shelf for favorites one for textbookslarge books one for dvds theyrebook shaped also its just lotr and dune so theyre basically books anyway
books,not_removed,i keep mine in alphabetical by author order i keep series together used to keep things in published order but i moved the movers packed unpacked the books apparently movers are stupid so they are no longer in published order
books,not_removed,the only semblance of organization that my books have is that the foreign language titles are pretty much all on one shelf otherwise its every book for itself
books,not_removed,by theme then and grouped by author ie fantasy murder history math terry pratchett is one whole shelf piled deep
books,not_removed,i have a to read shelf with all of my unread books but the others are arranged pretty randomly
books,not_removed,i sort by category literature scifi fantasy other then by author and i keep series together cant have the dark tower all over the place
books,not_removed,my bookshelves kind of force me to arrange them by size because i couldnt get the shelves to fit on there in a way that had uniform spacing each bookshelf has shelves and ive got two shelves which i use for graphic novels two shelves for hardcovers two shelves for paperbacks and one shelf thats two small for anything to stand upright so i put some comics omnibuses stacked there horizontally i try to arrange them by series and author to the best of my ability though
books,not_removed,i put big seriesauthors together ya series such as sweet valley vc andrews true crimeann rice cozy mysteries i exclusively read only foodbakery themed cozies etc on my bottom shelves are the bigger more expensive books i own more coffee table books then i sort the rest of the nonfiction and fiction mostly by size but i reserve half a shelf for the books i plan on reading soon
books,not_removed,in my old shelving an ikea cubeish one i had a few cubes that had loose themes to them chicago books my feministoriented books i may try to do the color coding for my next apartment moving soon
books,not_removed,for me series definitely have to stay together which is why as much as i think its beautiful i can never organize my books by color i also keep books by the same author together as well if theyre stand alone books i alphabetize them i hope this helps xoxo
books,not_removed,for my physical books i have main sections scififantasy contemporary fiction historical fiction classics foreign languages non fiction and comicsgraphic novels the fiction is then sorted alphabetically by author then by series the non fiction is broken down into sections for example memoirs and biographies are separate from books on math and then alphabetically by author the comics are grouped by publisher and then charactergroup so all the marvel together and within that all the hawkeye comics together it works for me because it means i know pretty much exactly where every book is at any given time unless my sister or dad have been borrowing things and putting them back in the wrong place
books,not_removed,my books are grouped by genre but if the books are part of a collection i treat them like a separate genregroup for example the accompanying books to my lotr collection should be under my reference group but i still place them with the lotr books
books,not_removed,i usually put mine books in size order as odd as that might sound biggest on the bottom shelves smallest on the top this time around i just threw them anywhere
books,not_removed,i dont have any book shelves and my two drawers are filled with art misc so i stuf my books in shoeboxes under my bed
books,not_removed,i really like the idea of having an unread book shelf if i just put them in order i may forget about them
books,not_removed,it definitely helps plus it keeps me from buying more and more books when i see how massive my unread pile is it saves money d
books,not_removed,well theres dinosaur erotica so i dont see why this guy cant write a book
books,not_removed,theyll make money and get publicity while being able to deride opponents as advocates of censorship seems like a winwin for a publisher
books,not_removed,knowledge however sad is still power grabembythewallet
books,not_removed,the hysteria is silly the guy isnt the next hitler hes the guy reformed far left nutjobs get into for the two weeks it takes them to figure out that being a far right nutjob isnt any better
books,not_removed,there is a large type edition available through createspace amazons independent publishing platform i cant link it because of rules but if you search federalist papers large type it has the american flag as its cover it has the look inside option too so you can check it out it doesnt look like it even has an index though just the papers this is a really good edition in terms of complementary material but obviously if his eyesight is an issue it might not be an option
books,not_removed,there are no books that are banned in the united states a book being banned implies a legal censure and that would be a pretty transparent violation of the first amendment protections for free speech the laws that in the past were used to ban books generally on grounds of obscenity have by and large been thrown out in court there are books which are banned from various local or school libraries generally on claims of content unsuitable for children although its more often an attempt to suppress anything insufficiently deferential to religion or encouraging tolerance for gays a good place to start is the american library associations list of the most frequently challenged books in the us this isnt comprehensive but wikipedia has a good summary httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofmostcommonlychallengedbooksintheunitedstates
books,not_removed,probably lots however there really isnt a nationwide list as such its usually up to the individual libraries and communities to gin up enough outrage to ban a book this leads to such advertising as banned in peoria for one book i dont even remember except for that headline not living in peoria
books,not_removed,harry potter sheesh some parents need a life
books,not_removed,is it antichristian though
books,not_removed,my family was never very religious but i went to a catholic school i remember one weekend getting a brand new holographic charizard out of a pack and was pumped to bring it to school and show the boys that monday they ended up banning pokemon from our school for being magic or something sooo damn yeah people will do it
books,not_removed,some people have trouble distinguishing fictional witchcraft from real witchcraft the latter being a sign in the minds of these people of consorting with the devil
books,not_removed,s snape kills dumbledore and dumbledore is obviously god therefore jk rowling hates christians s
books,not_removed,good lord thats just sad
books,not_removed,hmm i never really thought of it that way sure its not pushing christian ideals or anything but doesnt seem to be pushing an antichristian agenda
books,not_removed,youve never read them have you
books,not_removed,your link didnt work
books,not_removed,oh weird it works on mobile for me its just a sarcastic hp statement
books,not_removed,i guess i should more clarify whether hp is actively pushing the antichristian agenda or is it a byproduct of the story and the christian groups run with it because it is popular with kids
books,not_removed,well i didnt downvote you but i certainly will now how on earth does it contain antichristian values is narnia antichristian to you
books,not_removed,the claim that harry potter contains antichristian values simply isnt true you may have just answered the question but you answered it incorrectly
books,not_removed,hey no need to be a dick about it im just correcting misinformation
books,not_removed,this subject has been very popular in the past please use reddit search andor check the rbookswikifaq
books,not_removed,one of the greatest things about being an adult is you can read whatever you want
books,not_removed,it depends what you want your reading to be for you like the books youre reading so if you read for enjoyment whats the problem but youve posted here sounding a little guilty why is that do you want reading to be for something else should it be a challenge to improve your mind or your knowledge or your understanding of more adult themes this is why a lot of people read as you know if youre ok with reading for enjoyment stay as you are maybe youll read a wider range as you get used to the habit again plenty of people truly enjoy books written for adults
books,not_removed,in these past few days i have had so much fun though this is kind of the key to it all youve really enjoyed yourself thats what it should be about people read for different reasons but at the heart of it is some form of enjoyment or satisfaction
books,not_removed,i wouldnt worry about it as others have said reading for enjoyment means reading what you want i dont read much ya these days but in college which wasnt that long ago for me i alternated between adult novels and ya novels i still read some but the divergent series kinda killed it for me for the moment i find ya though can be a bit more imaginative at times also if you like hp check out diana wynne jones and percy jackson percy jackson is by rick riordan
books,not_removed,this came up at the ya panel for the edinburgh festival reading is reading is cool from a pamphlet to a poem to an illustrated childrens book to a novel i love harry potter as much as moby dick and i will die on this mountain
books,not_removed,i say read them proudly im reminded of a quote of cs lewis critics who treat adult as a term of approval instead of as a merely descriptive term cannot be adult themselves to be concerned about being grown up to admire the grown up because it is grown up to blush at the suspicion of being childish these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence and in childhood and adolescence they are in moderation healthy symptoms young things ought to want to grow but to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development when i was ten i read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if i had been found doing so now that i am fifty i read them openly when i became a man i put away childish things including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up
books,not_removed,all really depends on what your objective is if it is reading for fun then i say read what you like i used to read a lot of young adult fiction from the star wars universe because i like star wars if however you want to push yourself a little bit outside your comfort zone and get better at reading more difficult texts then you probably should be exploring some more complex stories to get used to that and grow your perspective seriously though there are adults across the world that bought in to the harry potter craze and theres nothing wrong with that at all if you find that enjoyable then keep with it
books,not_removed,think of it this way if you climbed mountains as a hobby and enjoyed tackling some of the most difficult peaks in the world would you avoid simple hiking and camping because it isnt enough of a challenge sometimes its nice to enjoy what you love without having to push yourself
books,not_removed,i would note that reading level book quality and enjoyment of a book are separate read what you would like to read id say if you want to grow your reading skill and be challenged do so if you want to continue to read for pure enjoyment without a huge amount of stress thats good too theres no rule that says that reading has to be challenging but it can be fun to sit down with a difficult book every now and then just dont start with james joyce
books,not_removed,can you tell us or me for that matter what are all the books on your shelf the books you read in school
books,not_removed,read what you like i read way above my age when i was young i read whatever the hell i want now you may find that reading and enjoying youngerreader books now may inspire you to try reading more books of all ages or you may find you like those and dont feel compelled to move beyond them no worries your decision people dont get to tell you what you should like well they do but you are perfectly welcome to ignore them
books,not_removed,read whatever you want and have no shame in enjoying whatever it is
books,not_removed,nah i always had a pretty advanced reading level but some of the best books ive read recently are ya novels youre totally fine enjoying something even if it doesnt use linelong descriptions for mundane objects also because you know the story you were likely reading faster than you would with an unfamiliar book just enjoy yourself and read what you like
books,not_removed,this isnt something you need to worry about past about the age of once youve gained proficiency and are reading for pleasure you can read what you like
books,not_removed,i recently started reading the harry potter series in my for the first time its genius it conveys complex stories in a simple understandable and entertaining way dont get caught up in what you should be reading because you wont read anything ive read all types of books from authors from different time periods and difficulty levels and find the complexity of themes within the best young adult books can be just as complex as some of the most difficult to read books however my favorite books are from authors that understand that entertaining the reader is as important as the art of writing checkout bukowski hunter s thompson hemingway and kurt vonnegut if you are looking to enter more adult themes books that are entertaining as well
books,not_removed,i wouldnt worry too much about it you dont need to read heart of darkness or every time you pick up a book ive always read at an advanced level but i still read a lot of lighter books because i enjoy it and dont always want to tie my brain in knots during my free time
books,not_removed,honestly reading kids books is often times how i get back into reading when the rest of my reading is dense stuff for school or work its nice to read just to read my go to series are harry potter and the underland chronicles i get transported to a different world and time in my life and it honestly helps make life enjoyable again
books,not_removed,as far as reading goes i think theres really only one rule read everything ive been wanting to read the harry potter books for a long time im and im not ashamed in the slightest to be seen thumbing through it at the bookstore i know a few people who read a lot but all they read is science fiction or ya theres nothing wrong with those genres i enjoy them myself but if you only read one genre or topic to the exclusion of all others then you are really doing yourself a disservice im not saying youre doing this btw just saying in general so read whatever you want and enjoy
books,not_removed,young adult books are always more interesting than book that are at my reading level
books,not_removed,read whatever you enjoy reading there is absolutely completely nothing wrong with reading whatever you want despite what some snobs say
books,not_removed,ugh the worst assignment i remember getting in school was an grade english teacher who assigned us a book report to be done on a book juuuuust slightly above our current reading level to help us grow as readers he defined that as being a book with words a chapter we didnt understand without looking it up to prove we had found an appropriate book the book report was to include a list of the words their definitions and the sentence they were used in the novel for context as well as a sentence of our own to prove understanding i tried to follow the assignment but the only book i found with more than one word i didnt know in the first chapter was an adult scifi with madeup terminology i ended up choosing a book aimed at my age level and pretending not to know simple words like jackknife and fuck i had no computer at home and a book with many many chapters and long winding run on sentences so i ended up having to bind my hand written assignment with string because it was so thick a staple wouldnt go through when i handed it in very late the teacher made a sarcastic quip about me writing him a novel of my own i was pissed now i just read what i want without worrying about if my vocabulary will grow im currently midway through library books one a middle grade historical fiction novel and one a scifi comedy for adults neither has had cause for me to use the inbuilt dictionary on my ereader and im just fine with that if i were only allowed to read books that pushed my reading level as he defined it id have nothing but scientific journals to read
books,not_removed,so youre actually reading at your reading level ie young teen so yes as an adult you should be worried
books,not_removed,i just figured if i was missing out on these great stories when i was younger and that there was a general strive to have a high reading comprehension level in school then maybe im behind still or maybe there is something im missing out on now whether it be being able to read and comprehend fasterdeeper or if the sayharder books have some amazing stories i just am wondering if its actually worth it to go and push myself with reading i also have no idea how to gauge where im at as of reading level
books,not_removed,recreational reading is always a work in progress most avid readers started with ladybird storybooks hahaha that is one publisher of books like pinnochio rapunzel cinderella etc then they move on to goosebumps animorphs the famous five the secret seven etc then they move on to books by sidney sheldon john grisham robert ludlum depending on their preferences and before they know it hey are avid book lovers i see no wrong with reading books for younger readers your preferences will evolve with time so dont worry and anyway who would mind rereading matilda the animal farm huckleberry finn dom sawyer again and again
books,not_removed,i didnt say that i dont believe
books,not_removed,hey thanks man i have also been feeling some crazy feelings my girlfriend told me something like reading fiction helps with understanding others and empathy like what goes on in not just our own heads it was pretty interesting to think about and i believe she is right
books,not_removed,i have the lightning thief and when those books first came out get this ricky fuckin riordan came to my school and gave us lightning thief for free it was sick that book is in my little bookshelf right now i am not trying to burn out but i just want to like reread all these books i have so i stick with only books at a time its been a while since i read books
books,not_removed,ah the lewis quote again adult books arent good because theyre for adults theyre good because they expose you to a variety of complex ideas concepts and emotions the adult tag simply reflects the fact that its usually adults who can appreciate the deeper nuance of these books using the lewis quote implies people recommend adult books because of the adult tag and not because of their content or value thats uncharitable and untrue
books,not_removed,also by cs lewis no book is really worth reading at the age of ten which is not equally ‚Äì and often far more ‚Äì worth reading at the age of fifty and beyond
books,not_removed,when i became a man i put away childish things including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up while a great line i always feel like lewis is so irresponsible with his grand pronouncements critics will often use adult or serious choose from a dozen terms to mean complex much of the childrens stories hes referring to are quite simplistic many of the fairy tales are moral milk whereas adult literature are supposed to be the meat so under that view his statement seems a bit silly yes some people try to be annoyingly above it all but to place everything on an even level as if complexity and simplicity were equivalent is quite foolish in its own right
books,not_removed,i like reading these because theyre fun for me and i get a good kick out of the experience i dont really see a point in pushing to read something extremely difficult myself but i remember in school that there was a strive to push your own reading level maybe not my main goal with reading but i could see others seeing it that way maybe to push comprehension of any text in general
books,not_removed,some of these are obviously from when i was in around grade but sure the watsons go to birmingham anthem ayn rand the lightning thief riordan taming of the shrew the great gatsby guests of the sheikhorrible imo night elie wiesel things fall apartachebe touching spirit bearmikaelsen frankenstein shelley alas babylonpat frank animal farm orwell i couldnt find my copy of by orwell but it would be here bible obviously written by jesus s some random hardy boys bookwhat happened at midnight harry potter books a series of unfortunate events edit changed a name of one book for clarity
books,not_removed,thanks
books,not_removed,it isnt really the descriptions or the thesaurus like explanations of words that gets me with the lemony snicket books its like the small hint of clues that he drops throughout the story and how they come to help the children later in the story like i try to see every little thing as a clue
books,not_removed,hey thanks
books,not_removed,jr what is this also i know they arent marketed for me now but i was at the age where they came out and i missed the opportunity to get them as they came so they kind of are marketed for me haha
books,not_removed,agreed about ya vs adult in my experience a lot of ya has a strong social justicesocial exploration themes while a lot of acclaimed adult literature deals with middleaged middleclass people having affairs
books,not_removed,no it isnt genius you utter fool its trash
books,not_removed,neither or heart of darkness is a hard read though theyre taught to children ffs
books,not_removed,when i say kids books i didnt mean kid i actually meant young adult learned that was a genre im only and i havent ever gotten into reading and i would like to just not sure how to proceed
books,not_removed,i never remembered the wantum to read like i have now i remembered little tidbits of information from just these two series and i just love that feeling of remembering something from long ago also i want to find out how both of these end for the time being hpb is having a labor day sale and i am planning on stocking up
books,not_removed,that story sounds like you wanted to punch your teacher in her nose but thanks for your input i am in the same boat its why i made this thread
books,not_removed,no i think you are reading this incorrectly adult is a big range of ages i am i said adult because i didnt think it would matter i just picked up what would seem like the most fun to read at the time and it wasis
books,not_removed,your reading level will get higher the more you read if you stick with ya it will improve but if you practice on some books for adults it will improve all the faster dont be daunted if youve heard a book is good go for it
books,not_removed,i also have no idea how to gauge where im at as of reading level it doesnt matter if you are adulting all right then you are probably fine but the more you read the better your vocabulary the better your speed the better your comprehension the more challenging and interestinghopefully you will find the books you pickup and you will know where you are at every time you pick up a book you are reaffirming that you are a reader if it is a bit hard put it down and come back to it later no harm no foul
books,not_removed,dont worry about it haha unless you are reading like grade beginners reading books which youre not then there is lots of time to read whatever you want think of it as a phase im mostly a scififantasy reader but ive gone through thrillermystery phases ya phases coming of age stories as an adult historical phases etc shit once every couple years ill go back and read a harry potter book ive read them all at least a half dozen times ive read ordinary people probably just as many im a year old male i read the hunger games trilogy years ago and loved all three of them for completely different reasons think of the people that write those books theyre all grown adults are they weird for telling stories that teens connect with i dont think so and i dont think we should feel weird for reading them we were all teenagers once if you like what you are readingif youre having funif you have that cantputitdown going onwhats the issue you can always go back and read something more serious when you are done reading lemony snicket and hp or not whatever floats your boat really thats why reading is so awesome
books,not_removed,you might have reason to worry if you truly enjoyed picture books for babies but theres nothing wrong with books like harry potter much better to read something you enjoy than slogging through something you think you shoudl be reading to impress people on reddit or on the subway there are plenty of books suitable for both adults and adolescents just a random example
books,not_removed,fair enough i was just hoping to give you somewhere to go afterwards rather than burn you out
books,not_removed,i feel like part of what people are often asking when they ask this question is do i still get the cultural cachet of being intelligent that comes along with stereotypes of bookishness if i only read books for children i dont understand why people ask questions like this if they arent just seeking validation for their choicesself esteem why on earth would it be bad to read some books what would that even mean
books,not_removed,on the other hand developing adult complexity and appreciating all the nuances and layers of existence including the simple enjoyment of life and imagination you had as a child is something to be proud of why should i set aside something that gave me pleasure years ago just because i can also do many more other things now
books,not_removed,adults are doing those activities differently than children adult coloring books are highly intricate and many adults enjoy them because coloring has a calming meditative effect many action figures and other toys are collectibles serious cosplay demands a lot of difficult diy skills and is way fancier and more elaborate than most childrens halloween costumes adults reading primarily middle grade and ya though yeah i cant defend that one
books,not_removed,sure if thats what your goal is i personally like challenging myself with something a bit esoteric now and then like philosophy texts but it really just depends on what you want to read for but i mainly read those harder texts for enjoyment anyway because i want to learn something to each their own
books,not_removed,interesting most of these i have never read i read a few in high school or eighth grade but the majority i have not read howdid you end up reading a book by aye rand i had never even heard of her until i was in college
books,not_removed,i think its pretty hilarious actually how snickett explains the vast array of words hes using with situations in the story clever man that one
books,not_removed,which author do you consider genius edit did you use the double negative purposely to say it is genius
books,not_removed,the wantum the desire or urge
books,not_removed,i really liked him otherwise but i think that assignment really put me off reading adult fiction for a long time i went from loving grisham to avoiding anything above teen lit i dont know why i didnt just do it on the client or rainmaker both probably had more than a handfull of words i didnt know the first time through even the book i did choose had or
books,not_removed,so dont you just buy some dickens faulkner steinbeck or anyone else of that caliber and try to fill up with your shelf with them its worth trying at least no
books,not_removed,when i just picked up a book i got so into it i would read like a book a day this was a few days ago mind you but i just like wanted to finish it for the good read i did this for a few days straight and noticed i could read kind of fast but i have no comparison
books,not_removed,omg i forgot about the hunger games senior year of high school those were coming out and while i worked in the library i read like the first two but didnt finish those were kickin ass reads
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,no man like im taking what you said to heart like i want to know what the frick happens at the end of all of these series like in no way books at the same time is burning me out but it is what i feel like right now i picked up book and from that book store and my girlfriend was like yo those books werent hype so i put them down like whokay
books,not_removed,oh i have tried with that maybe a few years back i picked up a book of platos writing i think it had a bunch of different books from philosophers in it it was a page monster and i read maybe a few pages and put it right back down it just wasnt enjoyable at the time also taking a philosophy course i grew tired of the online sections that we were assigned to read very very quickly
books,not_removed,i hope you mean ayn i dont know i really dont remember what theyre about others in my grade read atlas shrugged by her and they said it was okay i feel like staying away from school books
books,not_removed,touching spirit bear was a pretty simple book about a rebellious boy and i remember it alot birmingham book is about the bombings in birmingham that one that happened in a church
books,not_removed,hahaha do you mean to tell me he used the story and booksi am on the to get some dictionary definitions out to the masses
books,not_removed,roald dahl is a very familiar name i just cant put my finger on it
books,not_removed,looking into what books you were talking about im positive i would find those not very interesting or stimulating
books,not_removed,no it isnt isnt a double negative although i should have included the comma after no really as for your question zola naturally given my username solzhenitsyn blake and b s johnson
books,not_removed,hey man it was late but thanks
books,not_removed,i dont see why not im up for it
books,not_removed,dickens great recommendation oliver twist david copperfield great expectations are all great places to start getting into literature as a genre
books,not_removed,oh man i just read some faulker so tough steinbeck is great though and very easy to pick up
books,not_removed,i didnt say cant its not an eitheror thing i enjoy ya and more complex books and reading is not the only measure of adulthood or even intelligence many people simply do not get enjoyment out of reading why not celebrate when someone rediscovers that love to me its a simple equation i used to enjoy childish things now i enjoy adult things and childish things why should i decrease the number of things that make me happy so someone i dont care about will approve of me
books,not_removed,hey thanks for telling me about touching spirit bear i appreciate it did you read any non fiction while in high school or just in general ive readmy fair share of non fiction
books,not_removed,well yeah like when he says something like infuriated in this case means wanting to slice the orphans throats or something
books,not_removed,dahl wrote charlie and the chocolate factory among plenty of other stories thats probably why its familiar
books,not_removed,my edit question was made to determine if you were attempting to be wittingly insulting or cryptically clever my question was answered thank you for the list of authors to look into i will check out their books at my library anyone who would claim jk rowlings works are trash must have read something mind blowing how would you define these authors genius what is it that makes them genius in your eyes
books,not_removed,reading classics is great and a lot of fun but so is reading ya dont let this guy bully you i to reading what you want to read id suggest reading both and other genres id suggest keeping trying new types of books until you find what types you truly love and after you discover that id suggest still reading outside our comfort zone every once i a while so yeah there are some great classic recommendations here i second steinbeck and faulkner of mice and men and as i lay dying are two of my favorite books but keep reading ya if thats what you enjoy
books,not_removed,go for it
books,not_removed,if i can do you know the significance of the portraits of count olaf in the first few pages of each book there is a portrait and every book has a differently dressed count olaf the second book seems like an outlier where he is dressed as a woman instead of the old man another example being the third book the portrait is count olaf dressed as captain sham
books,not_removed,zola was one of the pioneers of realism and the father of naturalism and in his rougonmacquart cycle he explored the effects of heredity and circumstance and upbringing on the variously distributed members of one family in so doing he encompassed a great deal of life of france including parisian whores miners shop owners murderers and so on the imagery is very powerful and the depiction of humanity very moving my personal favourite is germinal solzhenitsyn worked in the soviet union and his works range from the factual gulag archipelago to ambitious novels the first circle once again the treatment of the circumstances is quite stark but again the humanity of the characters is what sticks with me alongside the bleak realities of day to day life in the ussr id start with one day in the life of ivan denisovitch but my personal favourites are we never make mistakes and cancer ward bs johnson i primarily admire for his use of form typography and overall the sense of experimentation he wrote the book in a box the unfortunates in which each chapter is individually bound and read in arbitrary order its truly a remarkable achievement heartbreaking and innovative and autobiographical similarly albert angelo has a cut out in one page so the reader can skip ahead to the end while christie malrys own doubleentry contains pages of a bookkeeping ledger to illustrate the protagonists take on modern morality not hugely mental now but certainly new at the time he made some good films too but was a lousy poet in his novels he strove for truth or his own definition of it he boldly claimed that telling stories is telling lies and for me his genius is in how he thought about the novel as a medium blake i am simply not qualified to speak about he was a romantic visionary artist and poet he has been called the writer closest to beating shakespeare for best english writer of all time he deals with life and religion as you can imagine and wrote jerusalem which im sure is familiar to you as a hymn httpwwwbbccoukpoetryseasonpoemsjerusalemshtml i hope that this made some kind of sense ps i feel a bit bad for insulting you please accept my apologies
books,not_removed,i enjoyed reading your analysis thank you for the contextual guide to their works these authors seem amazing and i will add the books to my hold lists ive only heard of blake from a poetry class i took while in college but im completely ignorant of the others i find it useful to listen to the people calling me an idiot or a fool so that i might get insight into what makes me an idiot or a fool usually the other person is right in at least one way but if i never ask than i will never find out why you have taught me and i have learned and i thank you for that apology accepted
books,not_removed,thank you for your kind words and your grace i sincerely hope you enjoy my recommendations do let me know if i may be allowed one more lucky jim by kingsley amis has always been a favourite lighthearted read the description of jims hangover is worth finding the book for by itself
books,not_removed,focus and concentration i find when i spend too much time reading articles social media reddit etc and not fulllength books i struggle to dedicate more than a few minutes of time to any other task without wanting to click somewhere else read another article etc the more often i read books the easier i find it to spend a few hours at a time on a coding task my field without the impulse to check social media or my news feeds consequently i write much better code when im on a book reading kick even if the book im reading is the fluffiest fiction ever written
books,not_removed,do you spend a lot of time doing useless things like browsing reddit etc if you set a timer for whenever you go on this kind of website its a lot harder to lose track of time and suddenly youll find that you actually have more time than you think of course this only works if you spend too much time here
books,not_removed,ill write my response in list form reasons why reading can be useful when it comes to understanding a topic online articles can give you breadth but books will give you depth if you read books about say world war ii youre going to have a richer and deeper understanding of that historical event than if you just read the wiki page as vast as the internet is there is just some stuff thats not readily accessible online especially in regards to more obscure historical topics for awhile i was doing a project where i was researching artists some of whom were super obscure and a lot of times an internet search would come up empty but i could find bits of biographical info on them in a book there a number of studies that show that reading fiction increases empathy i am too lazy to look up and link to one of these studies now but you should be able to find an article or on that if you want to being a more empathetic person may not improve your career but will just make you less of an asshole which in my opinion is a productive use of your time one last thing theres literally thousands of books out there for you to read maybe instead of forcing yourself to read historical nonfiction ditch it for another genre or another book i think there are benefits to reading and even benefits to reading specific books but if youre not at a point in your life where a certain book speaks to you or inspires you to read it theres no shame in ditching for the time being and moving onto something that excites you more what do write articles about maybe read a book on that topic hell maybe find a book about how to read books its a topic that interested you enough to write this post after all good luck
books,not_removed,its worth the time if your a writer reading books can give you an insight to an authors craft if your mostly writing articles and op ed type shit i really only think it will help you understand other sides and better come from a non biased origin
books,not_removed,is your life worth enjoying im assuming of course that you enjoy reading if you dont enjoy it there are plenty of other fun things to do too no need to stress
books,not_removed,look into audiblecom i started listening when cleaning and it quickly spread to while i drive while im at the gym and even during more mindless videogames a lot of people look down on audio books but fuck em if it gets you through a book youd not get through otherwise its worth it
books,not_removed,so you do what you want to do
books,not_removed,im curious why you consider reading news articles a good use of your time but reading books about current events politics selfhelp your chosen fieldprofession etc is not valuable im really struggling to understand your perspective here you want to make yourself the most valuable you can be but you limit yourself to comparatively shallow articles the greatest human minds throughout history would have been almost without exception voracious readers of a variety of topics not just those which they considered their specialty they wouldnt have taken shortcuts books almost by definition broaden knowledge on virtually any topic imaginable and expand minds if you cant see the value in that im not sure what you want from this thread
books,not_removed,no you have to decide for yourself what is worth your time
books,not_removed,reading is traveling without having to go anywhere its cheap
books,not_removed,thats a really good point in all honesty a lack of focus and concentration might be the underlying issue im dealing with its difficult to focus on one thing when there are so many sources of information reading a book really is an exercise of patience as much as it is enjoyment
books,not_removed,i like to think that i keep myself from spending too much time here but setting a timer seems like an excellent idea and im going to try that maybe itll help me figure out that i really am spending too much time here thanks for the response
books,not_removed,i appreciate the response i think youre right books generally do have a more creative and complex nature to them which could help with writing quite a bit
books,not_removed,its difficult at first but once you get into a reading groove you will see a noticeable difference in your ability to concentrate i often know ive gone too long between books when i find myself playing on my phone while watching a movie or tv show and failing to fully appreciate either
books,not_removed,the only problem is actually getting off reddit when the timer goes off p
books,not_removed,try asking in the weekly recommendation thread or in rsuggestmeabook by han kang by mohsin hamid by adam johnson
books,not_removed,yeah i got this book from the denver public library years ago after having heard of harry stephen keeler on of all things the writers commentary on a dvd of futurama finished the whole thing thinking all the while what the hell is going on here
books,not_removed,did you see his ama
books,not_removed,big fan of his in general though i havent gotten a chance to read the hike yet
books,not_removed,im about halfway through it on audio and its pretty awesome certainly unpredictable hilarious i was a big fan of the postmortal when that was released and ive read his kindle single the rover which was pretty cool too so far im really enjoying the hike im just after the part where s he makes it up to the top of the mountain gets put in hole by the giant then he gets crab to help him escape but then get puts right back in to be continued on my drive home
books,not_removed,dammit where was i
books,not_removed,well the book follows life of david copperfield from his childhood to maturity first half of his childhood was happy he lived his loving mother and housekeeper his father died but when david was seven his mother married abusive and cruel man davids stepfather moves in with them along with his sister both davids stepfather and his sister are cruel people and both david and his mother suffer every day because of themafter the death of davids mother david was sent away to work in the factory but deciding that he cant take it anymore he runs away to live with his eccentric cousin in short david is kind person and believes in the best of everyone but he tends to run away from his problems he usually lets other people to solve his problems and because of his ability to see best in everyone he is often naive and people take advantage of that when he feels some emotion he is only capable to feel that and only that emotion kinda like fairies in peter pan xd he is loyal person both to his friends and love interests maybe you had similar family issues like david or you have some character traits of david whatever it is i would be flattered xd
books,not_removed,i think the bigger issue here is that you havent read david copperfield yet seriously go get it and treat yourself its my favorite dickens
books,not_removed,i think id be annoyed but i personally dislike how completely uninterested david is in controlling his own life its been a long time since i read it now but i liked it for some perverse reason that i still dont understand but i recall him being very content to just let life carry him along in its current even when he disliked a situation he didnt do anything to really change it
books,not_removed,it means you bite people
books,not_removed,david is a sensitive intelligent and kind young man who the often sexist dickens portrays as suffering primarily from want of a father his vulnerability and the trials and travails which result are thus depicted as the result of being reared emotionally and socially speaking by women
books,not_removed,makes sense
books,not_removed,thank you for your comprehensive answer
books,not_removed,i think they havent at my local bn for a reasonable price will do
books,not_removed,this is absolutely gorgeous i love rackhams illustrations youre very lucky to own this even if it is beat up
books,not_removed,very beautiful so so sad on both ends book and dementia
books,not_removed,i think they have some charm even if they look destroyed sad it happened but i wouldnt throw them out those illustrations are absolutely beautiful
books,not_removed,thank you i love them i would like to try and figure out how to display them without destroying them further
books,not_removed,you should vacuum seal them for preservation and likely not handle them until you can get an expert to see f they can be restored or you could maybe throw it in some garbage i mean theres other things you could do if you are feeling impulsive
books,not_removed,yeah i have been looking for a local restorer
books,not_removed,why are you so angry about the way a person treats their belongings i understand you may really enjoy and respect books but to be hostile about his actions is a bit much buddy
books,not_removed,the post has been approved enjoy and sorry thanks for bearing with me ive removed the rest of this comment tree so we can get back on topic but wanted to let you know what was happening thanks to both of you for bringing it to the mods attention edit stray word
books,not_removed,no problem at all thanks for making it all better
books,not_removed,i know it was done to the sweet valley high series a few years ago to bring it into the century but those were drivel to begin with so i dont think it ruined anyones childhood i say this with love as i read them voraciously as a preteen i recall gordon korman books being a few steps up from that soapy stuff so i am surprised all i can add is that if anyone touches my madeline lengle i will hunt them down and strand them on an iceberg with a shifty vespugian
books,not_removed,they did this with the hardy boys and nancy drew books taking out references and replacing them with references and contemporary slang but those were written by a publishing syndicate not a credited author
books,not_removed,what makes you believe scholastic made the edits instead of the author or that scholastic made the edits without the authors approval
books,not_removed,id like to add an opinion thats based on research i did in a college class on childrens literature theres a concept in childrens education called digital literacy its distinct from book literacy in that kids use not just written words but also context clues like colors and placement of objects to read content in digital formats for instance a three year old who cant read yet can still navigate an ipad game because her digital literacy says that the green triangle button on the left is play and the red square is stop this type of literacy is highly empowering for young readers as they feel they can read in a sense when kids enter school though research shows that kids lose their confidence in their literacy quite quickly they think reading is hard and struggle to learn the authors theorized that this was because the lessons only recognize written literacy and fail to incorporate digital literacy which kids have a grasp on coming into school in essence by ignoring what kids already know about digital reading schools make learning regular reading foreign and difficult so what does this have to do with childrens books in my research i found that a majority of childrens books published between and have a low tech presence teachers use chalkboards instead of whiteboards kids look up information in books rather than the internet and any computers look like theyre from the for a kid with digital literacy struggling to learn written literacy this lack of tech further cements the reading world as nondigital and is even more alientating my research concluded that more tech in childrens books and more tech in the class in general is a good way to boost literacy in our reading challenged society for those reasons i am glad that there is more tech in childrens books though i understand nostalgic pushback i dont want the very hungry caterpillar using a cellphone or anything but a little updated tech is okay in my book please ask if you have any questions about my research
books,not_removed,are the books actually being sanitized or is modern tech just being inserted into them i think thats a very important distinction one is questionable and the other is terrible we shouldnt be throwing out accusations of censorship until we know for sure its happening
books,not_removed,i will probably get hate from this but scholastic is a company that needs contracts with schools to stay in business this leaves scholastic with very few options in todays environment changing books so they can still sell to their target audience is something that they could easily have to do a scholastic could keep old content and not push or sell it as much and instead attempt to promote and sell new content which costs more more and they essentially make less money on old stock to the point where they could not be profitable b scholastic could take existing work and ips they own and rework them to save money and change it so it is acceptable to the largest audience possible so they can maximize profit from it its not a great a thing that this happens but this isnt censoring or necessarily bad sure you can call out trying to shelter the youth and thus is naturally bad and messed up on the other hand this could be an attempt to keep the media current and viable instead of being forgotten to the past as outdated material that holds very little value anymore due to being dated
books,not_removed,loved those bruno and boots books and also no coins please and i want to go home it would be hard to read now looks like the ytv movie go jump in the pool changes the flavour of ms scrimmages finishing school for young women to something more earthy and hippy
books,not_removed,i recently reread the fudge books by judy blume i dont know about retrofitting exactly but given that tales of a fourth grade nothing was written in and double fudge came out thirty years later its a real mindfuck to hear about peter hatcher reaching his dad by cellphone im not a big fan of retrofitting for technology but well you know floating timelines man nothing but trouble
books,not_removed,i have one from and an updated version from may if you wanted something specific checked let me know and ill take a look
books,not_removed,seriously wtf
books,not_removed,this is frustrating because kids should be able to put themselves into historys shoes and understand how people lived before certain technologies my daughter has brought this up shes and she says it makes her sad because going back in time with a book is better than a time machine and the person who wrote that book is or was a living breathing human with thoughts and emotions she refuses to read any modernized nancy drew books weve collected all the originals at yard sales and thrift shops anyway this sucks im sorry
books,not_removed,i found one of these updated books awhile back and the thing that bothers me most is the assumption that kids somehow wont be able to relate to the story unless it happens in their same era with totally familiar tech how are they going to learn anything about how things have been in the past if we just modernize it all
books,not_removed,and i can only assume that these are innocuous sentences inserted to replace something that is deemed to be politically incorrect why can this be your only assumption why couldnt it be for example modernization of slang or colloquialisms or something the author just didnt like in the original the author wrote that book when he was he may have just been dissatisfied with his work and with his lifetime of experience chose to write the book he would have wanted to write personally i think that the original state of a book is important to its historical significance but not to its consumption by a modern audience i also think that the bias that has lead you to leap to the conclusion of politically correct censorship instead of any number of more reasonable or common changes is probably affecting your judgement regarding this issue in other ways
books,not_removed,apparently its been done to are you there god its me margaret but i can understand that theyve changed the old belted pads to the modern sort
books,not_removed,this might be an unpopular opinion but that seems fine to me if you want nostalgia then the originals still exist theyre childrens books so if they want to stay relevant and keep modern children interested than they either need to release an entire new series with original stories or revamp the old ones i do think they should have said something about them being edited from the original though i certainly hope korman either wrote the changes himself or at least okayd them
books,not_removed,im just sick of my teacher telling me how korman was when he wrote it i get it im a failure
books,not_removed,i really dont mind in the slightest none of these are classic literature it would be like getting upset that the harry potter books we read in america had a few different word choices than those in the uk these books were never written with the idea of being studied for their prose they were written to be contemporary with kids i do agree a note might be nice but i would never feel bad about my favorite kids books changing
books,not_removed,violated though
books,not_removed,how bizarre ive heard of writers reworking their own stuff but not to this extent and not to sanitize the text stephen king for example reworked the gunslinger which iirc had begun life as a series of short stories at some point he made it into a more cohesive novel he also rewrote the stand iirc
books,not_removed,in the farenheit something anniversary edition that i read there is an essayletter by ray bradbury in the back that talks about his rage at the changes made to his book by publishers if you can find it you may find it interesting
books,not_removed,crap that was a series i only ever had the first one to the book depository
books,not_removed,enid blyton is a big one characters names are changed to more appropriate versions specifically in the faraway tree it was jo bessie and fanny renamed joe beth and frannie in later editions then more recently dick renamed rick in later editions i get it names change whats appropriate changes its a classic series though you can only change so much before it loses too much of its original content i still have fun yelling dick across a crowded room to get my grandfather richards attention though nothing will deny me that
books,not_removed,does scholastic own any companies that tutor over the internet if so youve got your answer
books,not_removed,they updated are you there god its me margaret and im glad even as a kid i was baffled by the description of what products young women use when they first menstruate because they didnt work at all the way the ones my mother showed me did where did the belt come in future generations wont have to be confused by the changed technology and can still enjoy the story
books,not_removed,i feel violated whenever people use violated as a short hand for feeling mildly irritated about something inconsequential
books,not_removed,ballantine did something similar to fahrenheit in the produced an expurgated version for high schools discontinued the original in then sold only the expurgated version until when bradbury found out about it and told them to stop
books,not_removed,language changes its why we need notes to read shakespeare it may not be a good adaptation but its for kids in todays worldnot adults on nostalgia trips its way more important that they relate to it not you
books,not_removed,does anyone know if the box set cant link because of the bot is the updated version or the original i hadnt heard about the updates until this thread and i guess id like to purchase the books the way they were originally before they become impossible to find
books,not_removed,not quite as bad but they took out all of the matters of consequence lines from the little prince the first time i read it in grade it had very dated language and i loved it i feel like the newer retranslations just dont have the same charm
books,not_removed,i still have my original versions of those books sitting in a box still they were great books
books,not_removed,edit my comment got posted to the wrong thread in this post but im leaving it up if i could counter a few of your points for arguments sake not every traumatic scene is part of the main plot and therefore is not mentioned in the blurb for example the rape scene in the opening of contending forces it seems youre talking about feminists as you mention an antimale sort of stance i personally dont see feminists rejecting classic literature over the authors gender or any sensitiveoffensive topics a lot of women in my english courses are feminist on a variety of levels all of them have appreciated classics as foundational literature and as a study of historical thinking i dont find that being feminist will hinder you interest in literature education and discussion additionally i feel that just because a book is a classic does not mean you have to like it the term simply means that the text was influential on its society or on more modern texts and means its a strong piece to include in your education as for parents reading to kids or preventing kids from reading personally i did not read any books featuring rape murder or trauma until late middle school with the more heinous of these topics not appearing until mid high school despite being in high levelap courses i think at this point most parents are comfortable with their kids reading more intensely of course there will be outliers but thats always the case in general i feel trigger warnings wont even prevent traumatized people from reading its an opportunity to mentally prepare of course a lot of this is anecdotal and you make a valid argument about the gradual modern damnation of classics i think its a tough topic but its very interesting
books,not_removed,as much as i love books and they shaped my childhood its not like every word ever written is sacred text to be preserved forever without change i find it kinda cool and interesting that these books are being updated to stay relevant to kids but i agree that there should be some indication that its a new edition
books,not_removed,i dont understand why they feel the need to do this is it because theyre worried that they wont be able to sell copies of the book due to todays kids not being able to relate to the story i dont buy that when i was young i read all kinds of books that were clearly written in a different time references to obsolete technology from the mid twentieth century were unavoidable in a lot of the fiction i read i actually liked that it gave me an opportunity to learn about how the world used to be and how it has changed it felt like reading my book was like stepping into a time machine so cool but just shoehorning in new passages to an established novel like this seems like an insult to our kids intelligence like theyre too dumb to appreciate a book without references to the internet and smartphones or something why stop here lets give all the pevensie children magical vr headsets and maybe matilda can tweet about how much she hates her family this decision seems like a lame attempt to stir up some book sales at best and a slippery slope at worst
books,not_removed,deal with it these are kids books and as such they should reflect the times and morals of the generation in which they are currently being read a kid is not going to look at dated morals racism sexism or other politically incorrect ideas and dismiss it as a dated curiosity
books,not_removed,chris heimerdinger did this to eddie fantastic the original came out in and was an amazing book one of my favorites i found an audiobook copy about a year ago and as i was listening i realized that they updated the book to include a lot of modern references an ipod the internet even totally ruined the book for me i cant say weather or not it would be fine reading the new version first but it just seemed like they were trying to add as many modern references as possible
books,not_removed,holy crap i had totally forgotten about this book i loved it add a kid
books,not_removed,is this the same as the beware the fish boarding school books it sounds wicked familiar but i read through the young adult section so fast as a kid its kind iof a blur
books,not_removed,gordon korman books were an absolute favourite to read growing up im all about keeping them traditional but am now interested to see if i could point out differences in how it is now vs how it was when we read it as kids i do feel like this has definitely happened to books we read as kids as well this also reminds me of some cartoons nowadays im not entirely sure if my memory is playing tricks on me but im pretty sure i was flipping through tv channels a couple years ago and franklin the turtle was partially mindblown fully creeped out
books,not_removed,im sure the animorphs lives would be much easier with a cell phone but they probably wouldnt know what a mall is
books,not_removed,not for nothing but scholastic americanized the first several harry potter books because they thought american grade schoolers would be confused by british terminology and other more subtle britishisms not sure if they reverted that decision in subsequent printings but they did stop doing it to new books partway through the release of the series
books,not_removed,i remember they planned to do this with the animorphs series but only made it through number or something its a common thing with this publisher their main demo being kids i think republishing old books revamped for the current gen is a smart way of making money and not spending that much to do it
books,not_removed,have you tried reading treasure island its full of old jargon that nobody uses anymore you will spend half your time consulting dictionarycom to try and understand what is happening
books,not_removed,i dont think books should ever be updated
books,not_removed,language changes its why we need notes to read shakespeare it may not be a good adaptation but its for kids in todays worldnot adults on nostalgia trips its way more important that they relate to it not you
books,not_removed,a little different i noticed noe that yhe chronicles of narnia series are now ordered chronological instead of the order they were written the magicians nephew is noe the first book this causes two problems cs lewis writing style changed noticeable so having the book before the first is weird second the series loses a lot of the mystery with the origin story being first
books,not_removed,this is a thing really that seems really disgusting to me
books,not_removed,why is scholastic beholden to you such that you feel a right towards their material
books,not_removed,the fact that you claim to feel violated makes me want to cheer for your sadness
books,not_removed,thats pretty dumb imo i first read them as a kid in the and i loved them no problem with the tech in fact if they have cell phones i feel like a lot of the stuff that happens just doesnt work like they would easily be able to coordinate with the girls across the road for example
books,not_removed,i saw a south park episode about this
books,not_removed,pc isnt coming to rape your memories dude a company modernised its product so they can keep making thats very much the opposite of a censorious sjw boogeyman army you seem to be worried about look up the ladder for blame dont look down for it thats ridiculous
books,not_removed,i also read the jennings novels by anthony buckeridge as a kid only to discover that they too had been updated since original publication in the orange covered editions i had used text updated in the to use decimal coinage and maybe other less noticeable changes i also discovered that there were about novels that werent reissued in the orange covers so have made an effort to get them the recent reprints ive found were confusing as some were updated decimalised text and some were not
books,not_removed,if they even think about touching penningtons seventeenth summer or land of green ginger then i might have to stab someones face
books,not_removed,gordon kormans booksüëå
books,not_removed,the idea of them making it more relatable for modern children i can live with them updating it inconsistently and with a recognizably different font thats just tacky
books,not_removed,this isnt that uncommon and its not that big a deal diane duane has done it to her own books
books,not_removed,they did it to tootles the taxi and ive been plotting my revenge ever since
books,not_removed,im not big on nostalgia the originals still exist for anyone to read and remixing and updating stuff is just how culture works
books,not_removed,what about the tom sawyer books that have helpfully removed all those troublesome mentions of slavery
books,not_removed,its a childrens book the idea behind it is to get kids to read i say do whatever it takes to make that happen books have to compete with much more technologically flashy types of media entertainment if updating a childrens book in any fashion get more kids to put down their smartphones and read then do whatever has to be done as for the ops childhood and nostalgia couple of things im sorry i really am im sorry you feel bad maybe you can find a reprint of the version you grew up with nostalgia is imo likely to be disappointing the world simply does not hold still trying to experience bits of the past are imnsho a waste of time since life is made up of time if you waste time you waste life
books,not_removed,last week i saw a film set sign that said bruno and boots maybe its in prep for releasing a movie
books,not_removed,i know most comments explain this as done to make it easier for kids to relate but did anyone else recall reading books from before your era and having trouble i ask because i just accepted that the premise was the past
books,not_removed,enid blytons faraway tree also changed they renamed dame slap to dame snap and made the children oddly fearful of being scolded
books,not_removed,i loved the bruno boots books sad to see that theyve been changed
books,not_removed,i know i recently heard judy blumes fudge audio books and noticed several changed parts with poor audio quality about wanting a laptop etc story set in approximately very jarring for a lifelong fan interestingly the books have quite a unique timeline each story is set after the previous for the characters but the world the live in has shifted years so between the ages of and the hero goes from having an elevator operator to superman on the big screen for the first time to harry potter
books,not_removed,people who dont understand why updates need to be made for technology should check out the kids react videos its great fun watching nine years olds who dont know how a landline works or how to turn on a desktop computer or what a cassette player even does
books,not_removed,irrelevant to your point but i just learned that korman wrote that book when he was twelve twelve published at thats insane
books,not_removed,this reminds me of a very old copy of a thomas the tank engine book on my grandad bookshelf belonging to an older relative when they were a kid theres a passage where a train passes under and blows smoke and soot at a group of kids throwing stones off a bridge asked away they ran as black as niggers even as a small child i did a double take its not a word that should be printed in a kids book publication date from the fifties or so kids books in the fifties had dialogue from a tarantino flick
books,not_removed,childhood books and i feel violated yea no your childhood is not being violated by edits to a childrens book grow the hell up
books,not_removed,wow i remember reading these books in middle school and loving them i wonder if i can get them bundled on kindle
books,not_removed,these are not something i read as a kid too recent however they have done this with some of books i remeber growing up in ways i am ok with paul bunyan books and dr dolittle they have both been edited because some of the content was horribly racist originally in the case of hugh lofting and dr dolittle his kids have basilcally said he would be horrified by the way some parts of his books would be seen today and he would be the first person to rewrite the changes if he was alive you dont recognize some of the fucked up crap in the culture youre in till you outgrow it
books,not_removed,yeah but have you ever hoovered shneef of the cover
books,not_removed,i feel its up to a publisher and whatever contract they signed with the author without trying to screw the author over the way happened to so many earlier comic book creators if they change things like this however a small note on the copyright page seems like it might be a good idea i believe i recall seeing a small note from another classic book saying something to the effect that yeah a lot of these words and ideas are racist but we believe in preserving the past to learn from it something like that i could be totally mistaken a small note at the beginning of the book as times change we try to make classicfavorite stories as accessible to newer generations as possible so that they can enjoy the stories too would be a nice nod to the older readers without being too obtrusive i can assure you that as a child i paid no attention to the first unnumbered pages of a book if there were no illustrations
books,not_removed,there were plenty of things that could be mentioned in a casual approving way in books for children even in the seventies that we have changed our minds about by now for example suppose those heinously edited passages said thunders the infallible voice of the author at the ears of the captive and impressionable audience without any preamble in the middle of a crackling good read that boys having romantic relationships with boys is obviously gross impossible and more a joke than anything else a comment quickly passed over not something to debate not even to be presented as something anyone could disagree about and sure school settings are still homophobic as heck but theres a difference between telling about it and the author casually marking it as good and true which is something that could have flown in the seventies these days its better omitted because were not bigoted jerks anymore and dont want to teach our kids to be such either well some on the school board want to but silence about the subject is the best they can hope for these days i think its kind of naive to suppose kids recognize these passages as old times or run to their parents for an explanation they just put that insight into their heads and if theyre lucky get set right by the principal after they put the old times stuff into their homework
books,not_removed,they tried this with the animorphs relaunch a couple of years ago i say tried because it failed and the fans they were targeting werent too happy about the changes stuff like sega cds and other references were changed to generic replacements like video game music etc one of the main characters is consistently called xena by her friends throughout the series but they took that out because they didnt think kids would get it in the new update the other characters called her storm from xmen are you fucking kidding me i get why they did it but the reprints lost a little soul with the changes there was no political correctness sanitized that i could see but like i said the relaunch failed animorphs dealt with ptsd genocide slavery and graphic toothclaw violence i wonder how scholastic would have dealt with that had they continued reprinting
books,not_removed,you guys are all crazy if theyd done this to catcher in the rye or count of monte cristo youd all be flipping your shit
books,not_removed,this is a moderated subreddit it is our intent and purpose to foster and encourage indepth discussion about all things related to books authors genres or publishing in a safe supportive environment clearly not as there are no indepth discussions going on and this submission is still here
books,not_removed,if you feel violated over this then you should seek professional help you should not have such an emotional attachment to a book
books,not_removed,tldr waaaah they changed the book in an attempt to appeal more to a generation im not a part of waaaaah
books,not_removed,i might be showing my age here but i remember ordering the offensive jokes book from scholastic as a kid
books,not_removed,i feel violated i am going to assume youve never actually been violated good lord i understand being attached to books but this kind of hyperbole is ridiculous
books,not_removed,left wingers will censor and change things in books and movies they deem politically incorrect if they cant they simply ban itus confederate flags or burn itbooks
books,not_removed,i liked how when they attempted to update the books they went too far and dated them more by peppering them with mentions of beyonce and timberlake
books,not_removed,i always loved how the longevity of the series and the emergence of spinoffs ruined tech continuity anyway i remember one of the first instances i ever heard about email long before i saw it was when the school newspaper got access to it and liz a high school senior logged on in a breathlessly described process spanning several paragraphs the access the sweet valley kids had to various kinds of technology though seemed to really contradict this
books,not_removed,it was also done of all things to the lord of the rings books in the german translation there was a perfect german translation already from the late or or whenever the german books came out which tolkien himself actually helped on he for example liked the german auenland lit meadow land way better than the rather nondescript the shire and all was good tolkien was a linguist first and he chose all his words and names carefully but then in the when the movies came out someone somewhere decided that what we needed was an updated translation for todays readers and it was a disgrace what made it worse that the original translation wasnt reprinted anymore once the new came out so prices hiked extremely which lead me to start reading english books btw heres some example of the hideous new translations compared to the original ones instead of calling frodo herr frodo mrsir frodo sam suddenly called frodo chef german for boss not a kitchen chef the prancing pony went from a gasthaus tavern and became a imbissbude snack bar or quick service dine those caravan trailers with all kinds or fast food are imbissbuden when the hobbits wonder if strider will come and find them in the new translation they wonder if he will come and get them from the lost and found office in general instead of lunch or heroes now had snacks imbiss theres a throwaway sentence where a fox sees the hobbits do something strange and thinks hobbits in the new german translation he suddenly says hobbits evil tidings now became bad news frodo and his company became frodo co and thats just to name a few of those insane updates to maybe one of the most carefully crafted books ever made which already had a justascarefully crafted perfect translation which the original author even helped working on
books,not_removed,roxane gay has a great essay about the new sweet valley high books ill have to find it again
books,not_removed,oh man i was obsessed with the svh books when i was a kid i wonder if they are lurking in my attic somewhere
books,not_removed,i didnt know they were continuing the original svh series i remember about years ago they came up with sweet valley senior year to replace svh and sweet valley junior high to replace sweet valley twins never read the senior year series but the junior high series was actually a really good update to the series because the problems were a lot more relatable than the manufactured drama of the twins series and there was little in the way of pop culture references so its not too dated even now
books,not_removed,but those were written by a publishing syndicate not a credited author instead of being written these books were summoned by a board meeting holding hands as they chanted to the demons and offered a goat as a vessel
books,not_removed,i think most of the popular childrens series are regularly updated to make them relevant for their current audiences they also updated those series to remove a lot of racial stereotyping and downright bigoted references i had handmedown copies published in the forties and fifties to read as a kid as an adult though i remember coming across an early edition from the twenties where an adult male black character was referred to as a buck and a boy the nword was also used it was a little shocking to me because i didnt remember the stories being that racist but that language was common when the book was originally written by the wed evolved past that type of overt racism women were just as stereotyped but again that was how society was back then its interesting to read as an adult who knows better and gives a peek into that times mindset but hardly appropriate for children who are still learning how the world works today
books,not_removed,yeah i remember reading about that but that was done almost years ago i wouldnt have thought that would fly these days
books,not_removed,they entirely rewote some i have a copy of an original and the new one of the same title and the stories are nothing alike
books,not_removed,actually most of core hardy boys books had a single author
books,not_removed,they did a nancy drew update with nancy as a college student in the i didnt like them her and neds relationship was far more serious in those and i liked her being unattached and flirty in the original yellow book series
books,not_removed,amelia bedelia was my girl what is the purpose of doing that
books,not_removed,theyre not rewritten its a separate series
books,not_removed,seriously wtf
books,not_removed,yeah but at least with amelia they are making it a separate thing briskts complaint sounds like theyre just taking an old story and changing it for no good reason reboots remakes are fine i think but dont take something and then totally twist it but pretend its the same fuck you publishers
books,not_removed,are you sure youre not thinking of the books written by parishs nephew about amelia bedelia as a child theres easily twice as many as the original series
books,not_removed,you lie i cannot accept it
books,not_removed,what no no no she was amazing exactly as she was
books,not_removed,this makes sense to me though the idea of making a character who does not understand idioms in a book for children is surely not an original one but if you try to come up with it now you would be slapped with a lawsuit so fast really the only way was to make a new book series pay for the licensing and call the character amelia bedelia do you mildly rich people even have maids anymore cleaning services possibly but a dedicated housekeeper
books,not_removed,this is the one that dusted the furniture and drew the drapes right
books,not_removed,mmm they do a lot of stories as younger versions for those i can read levelled books because theyre appealing to a young demographic and trying to interest them in reading
books,not_removed,why do you care
books,not_removed,you seem very proud of your research
books,not_removed,agreed but what are your thoughts on the updated tech edit regarding the censorship aspect im gonna do my best to get my hands on an original edition and try to spot the differences
books,not_removed,or is modern tech just being inserted into them just any alteration to the original text is a fucking blasphemy people buy books to read what the original author had written not a fanfic
books,not_removed,i think changing content they own for a more current audience is totally fine and acceptable what i dont understand is how it can be reprinted with the same title and same author do publishers really control the content of an authorartists creation so much so that they can change most of it and still publish it under the same title and the same author
books,not_removed,maybe profit shouldnt always come over integrity
books,not_removed,since when does literature become dated to the point that it is no longer relevant i like most educated people read some shakespeare in school if i could handle anglosaxon then im sure kids today can handle slang from
books,not_removed,if they are going to change something drastically then they should at least also change the title to show it as a different thing make it this cant be happening or some such shit no wait forget it no compromise damn it fuck the publishers fuck em
books,not_removed,i loved the timelines in it their world followed real time while they did not audio book you can heat which parts were rerecorded
books,not_removed,i think they redid the earlier ones mostly to update tech i remember there was one where peter or someone wanted a record player for his birthday and they replaced that with an ipod really i have no problem with thata nineyearold today might know what a record player is but a kid wanting one as a birthday gift would just be bizarre and if its bizarre enough a kid could be put off when i was kid i went to a really underfunded school and the books in our schools library were all years old i was really into reading so id read things no matter what id have read anything that was there regardless of content but when i was reading something in the year and the characters would do things like rush home from school in order to watch mr ed it would throw me for a loop a lot of the rest of my classmates never bothered because the books werent at all something they could relate to i also remember one from the where we were supposed to know that the bad girl character was a really bad girl because she had such big hair
books,not_removed,it doesnt look like they make any distinction between the editions on the cover aside from the copyright page is there any indication that it is an updated edition it seems to me that they should acknowledge the updates in some way
books,not_removed,i was a fan of the soup books by robert newton peck a story about trouble making pair of friends these books really made me learn how to read
books,not_removed,i wouldnt have read journey to the center of the earth when i was but i was definitely willing to read wishbones journey to the center of the earth i didnt want to decipher words that were used over years ago i just wanted to read a cool story
books,not_removed,thank goodness cause that was confusingi read that book like to get ready to become a woman and my expectations were not met i didnt get a belt i got these weird sticky things
books,not_removed,i remember being confused about the beltsdefinitely couldnt picture them preinternet but i was interested and excited to learn about how it had been it was a little history lesson about womanhood adapting them to contemporary products is a bummer
books,not_removed,i read the updated version when i was younger and im thankful for that it is interesting to hear how things were but i feel like this book was intended to help prepare girls for adolescence and talking about sanitary belts may have confused or put off modern girls
books,not_removed,he was actually feel worse
books,not_removed,indeed theres no basis for this kind of feeling the book is not part of you its just a book if you dont like the changes you track down an older edition and read that
books,not_removed,he did let rage go out of print due to it possibly influencing school shootings occurring back in the
books,not_removed,one of my favorites was added to by the author in an anniversary edition thats fine howeverupdating classics to modern tech slang is imho unnecessary kinda ridiculous what if we did that to austen or shakespeare the whole point is to learn maybe learning old sayings is a good thing or how society used to function same ideathey updated richard scary childrens booksglad i still have my originals
books,not_removed,yes scholastic is awful
books,not_removed,i remember reading an older edition of that as a kid in the and being completely baffled by the belt thing too
books,not_removed,thats ironic to say the least
books,not_removed,any chance you can help me discover the changed passages
books,not_removed,did op delete stuff from their post im seeing comments like this that seem to be responding to something more controversial than whats there now and people talking about trigger warnings
books,not_removed,did they change the time during which the story takes place or was it still set in the early i dont have much of a problem with updating the macdonald hall series since it was meant to be read as a book about kids who are the same age as the reader and meant to be set at about the same time since time has moved on if you want the series to be read in the same way it makes sense to modernize minor details in the story if a story is set in a particular time in the past however modernizing the details makes absolutely no sense whatsoever
books,not_removed,is it because theyre worried that they wont be able to sell copies of the book due to todays kids not being able to relate to the story i dont buy that grade teacher i do i also loved reading and would read about anything and everything but thats anecdotal and if i stacked that up against the over students ive had id make a few bets on kids not reading books they dont understand or books that are outdated in any ways out of wouldnt touch them a lot of the work we do as teachers especially reading teachers is to fight this disadvantage providing lessons and explaining vocab and obscure references so theyre not totally alien for example mythology youd think all kids would love mythology id say its more popular than most stuff maybe out of but if theyve seen percy jackson movies pretty much all of them will be psyched to read up about it if the kids can relate it sells if they cant they wont touch it
books,not_removed,why stop here lets give all the pevensie children magical vr headsets and maybe matilda can tweet about how much she hates her family this decision seems like a lame attempt to stir up some book sales at best and a slippery slope at worst whos the one making the slippery slope here personally id like to avoid passing judgement so harshly given so little context for all we know korman wanted to make these updates as other authors have done before for example see diane duanes young wizards series which she updated httpebooksdirectdianeduanecompagescomingsoonyoungwizardsnewmillenniumrevisededitions id like to give the author the benefit of the doubt theres nothing inherently wrong with books taking place in the past but if the author wants them to be set in the modern day in order to appeal to modernday readers many kids wont be expecting to step into a virtual time machine that takes them to a modern day without cellphones guis and the web besides i havent seen anybody suggest that such updates be applied to all childrens literatureafter all dont you think matilda spending her time whining on twitter would be rather antithetical to the book and an oculus rift would be as useful to the pevensies in narnia as an iphone would be to meg murry on camazotz
books,not_removed,yes
books,not_removed,the way theyve changed the appearance of dora the explorer my little pony care bears and sooo many other shows from my childhood is unsettling
books,not_removed,its one of my favorites id rather consult the dictionary and keep the original text intact that way i can get the flavor of the time
books,not_removed,i never had issues with treasure island but im also a social studies who specializes near that time period its important for kids to have to look up this stuff if books are all easy no new learning can take place you replace the sextant with a gps enough eventually people will forget about it and then a huge piece of our history is gone
books,not_removed,before anyone takes umbrage at that professor umbridges name from harry potter just clicked for me
books,not_removed,no offense but trigger warnings arent a new idea they get applied to tv and movie ratings all the time and you constantly see warnings for graphic content violence or sex across all forms of media i think its a bit disingenuous to consider content warnings a type of censorship presumably the reason people need these warnings is because they actually do live in the real world and unfortunately the real world can sometimes be real shitty
books,not_removed,a trigger warning as used in this context is literally just hey this work has x in it just letting you know because x is potentially objectionable huh i wonder if that exists already and is completely accepted as a way to showcase if a work has potentially objectionable material in it oh wait it does the mpaa and esrb already do this for movies and games while they also assign ratings and people quibble about those ive never heard a single complaint about them actually listing mild language mild sexual content etc as a part of the review system how well do you think it would be received if a movie with a graphic depiction of rape came out but no mention of sexual content was made in the mpaa blurb do you think your reaction of sign of the times get use to it god forbid anyone should be offended or have to face anything like reality would be the majority if so youre the one not living in reality these types of warnings are commonplace in all nonbook media the fact that books have never developed something similar to the mpaa or the esrb is frankly astounding
books,not_removed,trigger warnings really have nothing to do with getting offended or censorship in a sense theyre basically the opposite if you tell people why they might not want to read something then they have nothing to complain about if they ignore that its kind of like asking someone if they have any food allergies before serving them a homecooked meal letting someone know that theres peanut butter isnt a condemnation of using peanut butter in food im bit more concerned about the dilution of the word trigger warning to not specifically something that warns about ptsd triggers but thats something thats been happening for a while i really dont see a problem with books adopting a voluntary content rating system in the same way that movies and games have i do hope that any sort of voluntary rating system doesnt shuffle the perceived appropriate ages for content around gatsby and shakespeare are pretty well positioned with being taught at middle schools and high schools if there is a problem with age and content in books its probably more that kids dont have the life experience to really appreciate the classics yet i know that most of them didnt really hit me as a teenager the way they might have as an adult then again that may just be true for all media
books,not_removed,when a person with ptsd is trying to decide whether or not they want to read something knowing that it contains potentially triggering matter can be the difference between reading a work and engaging with it and spending a few hours having a panic attack because you werent mentally prepared for the content triggers arent about being offended they are about having flashbacks to things like people trying to blow you up on a roadside in afghanistan
books,not_removed,we already have trigger warnings for films video games tv and music httpwwwesrborg httpwwwclassificationgovaupageshomeaspx httpsenwikipediaorgwikiparentaladvisory httpwwwtvguidelinesorgratingshtm thing is a work with an r rating isnt censored children are just prevented from viewing it i dont see a problem with having someone mention somewhere in the fine print this book contains graphic depictions of sexual violence weve been doing this shit for a long time
books,not_removed,sadly its not just students many educators also want to shield students from anything close to reality
books,not_removed,as someone who actually does have triggers that can give me massive anxiety among other things i hate the idea of putting trigger warnings on books
books,not_removed,i get what youre saying but i think there should be at least some kind of publishers note at the beginning of a book indicating that there have been changes and the nature of those changes
books,not_removed,since but i think this is not a huge deal its not like there was some big mystery about the worlds creation that is spoiled they just never really bring it up lewis himself said there was no overarching plan that the publication order was not the order he even wrote them and that chronological order makes sense
books,not_removed,oh noe
books,not_removed,which episode
books,not_removed,good point but in my mind thats not much better
books,not_removed,jackie rodowsky would have gotten even more seriously injured because kristy was too busy snapchatting with mary anne although mary anne would have been admonishing her to focus on her job
books,not_removed,good i remember being so confused why all the phone numbers began with kl and i never knew someone with diabetes until i was an adult but i discovered that those books are massively massively misinformed on how treatment works even by or so
books,not_removed,the babysitters club novels have been adapted by raina telgemeier in the but with the popularity of her own graphic novel works they republished the babysitters club ones too and put them in color the characters do not use cell phones and meet at one girls house to use a corded phone for their club
books,not_removed,really
books,not_removed,if only huck and jim rode a seadoo down the mississippi i would have understood it
books,not_removed,i havent read animorphs since i got turned off by the ghostwriters around book but holy shit did i read them over and over when i was and i can tell you the storm reference was in the original
books,not_removed,there is a slight difference i dont agree with it but a childrens book and a classic lit piece are in different domains one is a book meant to grab a childs attention and teach them basic reading skills and bits of new information the other is an adult book written for a specific audience with a lot of subtext and literary device that has to be thoughtfully digested i dont agree with changing any book really but a childrens book makes the most sense
books,not_removed,as someone else put it in this thread these books were never written with the idea of being studied for their prose they were written to be contemporary with kids childrens lit serves a different function than adult lit
books,not_removed,well we received these books from some rando guess we should add them to the curriculum no
books,not_removed,who the hell on the left has been burning books you just pulled that out of your ass
books,not_removed,uhh yeah no
books,not_removed,i liked how when they attempted to update the books they went too far and dated them more by peppering them with mentions of beyonce and timberlake to be fair theyre both still pretty relevant as far as pop musicians gothough i imagine that wont be true in years or so
books,not_removed,if their business plan is to keep selling new editions to replace dated editions every pop culture reference helps them
books,not_removed,thats outrageous admittedly amusing but how frustrating
books,not_removed,yes kreges translation from is a disgrace im glad i have the earlier one too there has however been a new edition of the kreges translation in which at least changes chef back to herr frodo but i dont know about the other things you mentioned
books,not_removed,oh wow i did not know this i am german but read almost everything in english except for books that were orginally written in german these translations are horrible d like imbissbude oh my god
books,not_removed,i think that essay is why i knew about the updating actually
books,not_removed,with our powers combined we are franklin w dixon carolyn keene
books,not_removed,why
books,not_removed,one of my favorite book series the young wizards by diane duane recently did a new millennium edition updating the books from the and to have modern slang and references and i like them the author added a lot of interesting new details while new passages of character fluff to help with the breakneck pace of the early books the updates are tasteful and appropriate i have no problem with this kind of work why should i when they can preserve stories down generations ensure that they stay comprehensible and relevant to young audiences
books,not_removed,actually it did about years ago nancy drew the hardy boys and tom swift all have at least separate series room swift has or the first two are the same timeline
books,not_removed,the nancy drew and hardy boys books have been updated quite a few times again because they were written as works for hire by effectively anonymous authors at least its a family member maintaining the amelia bedelia series and not just a faceless cog at a publishing company as for other instances as long as they have authors approval or own the rights flat out the only recourse we have is to demand classic reprintings or hunt down outofprint editions
books,not_removed,the new versions are supposed to be prequels as to why prequels sounded like a good idea she was pretty clearly mentally disabled in the originals adaptation options included child or speaker of a foreign language obviously one of those would ruffle more feathers
books,not_removed,i remember reading one of those when i was about years old goddamn i hurt myself laughing so much at her incompetence
books,not_removed,theyre also pages long and youre supposed to buy both at once because kids would read each one after the other edit they meaning the latest mentioned on the article where shes a kid
books,not_removed,actually the son of the original author is the one who wrote the new books it wasnt licensed out to anyone
books,not_removed,yup
books,not_removed,i dont know why youre getting downvotes honestly people this has absolutely no effect on your childhood whatsoever your childhood is over and publishers decided to modernize something for the benefit of current children the sense of entitlement some people have over a change that doesnt even affect them jesus
books,not_removed,it was one of the first times that i felt i was contributing something original to my field rather than just regurgitating what others had already discovered thank you though
books,not_removed,like i said its questionable and along the lines of george lucas changing the star wars movies but ultimately the changes arent for people like you and me theyre for kids reading the books today who might be turned off by old tech i know i was occasionally turned off by it when i read books as a kid
books,not_removed,i read the books back in the mideighties and some of the reference were already slightly dated even shortly after publishing i get that the books are classics but it can be difficult for young readers to become engaged if they cant relate i had a similar issue with the danny dunn series as well they were written in the fifties and a lot of the technology and references were absolutely arcane for a kid in the eighties still loved them though
books,not_removed,agreed but what are your thoughts on the updated tech edit regarding the censorship aspect im gonna do my best to get my hands on an original edition and try to spot the differences i think its fuuuuuuuuuuuucking stupid why cant the books be appreciated as they are those books should be a representation of the time period if they want something modern then fucking publish something new fucking lazy cheap cunt publishers what next i know lets take a novel about slavery and add in cell phones and laptops and then they all have a discussion about slavery on twitter
books,not_removed,they can change most of it most changes are really quite minor and make no change to plot its usually about tech or an out of date popular reference
books,not_removed,many of these series were contracted and published with an agreement that the publisher would hold most if not all of the rights because of the guarantee of sales because of scholastics distribution methods they could essentially reduce or eliminate any competition
books,not_removed,a business is a business especially when its a corporation and literally thousands of people work there and need the job literature isnt philanthropic sadly most of it is purely for profit
books,not_removed,the publisher the company who determines if there is any money in making more copies of the book determine if something is dated by looking at the sales the end they can decide its not worth printing any more copies for the next or so years thats the reality the problem is not that kids cant relate or understand but that the parents and other caregivers want books that will benefit the children the most sorry if a book that has fewer references that are applicable to modern life or requires more explanations to understand the message isnt seen as equally beneficial
books,not_removed,how many people like shakespeare in school and how many would read it if they werent forced to you can handle outdated terminology but if it detracts from the story you are less likely to want to read it fyi a lot of the kids now read the translated versions of shakespeare on the sly
books,not_removed,i agree to a point but it seems weird to think that kids wouldnt get it you know no one suggests updating old yeller for example i remember when i was reading books like that if something seemed out of place id just mark it out in my head as something that people did in the olden times back when the world was in black and white i dont think kids need everything peppered with modern references just so they feel at home in the same way that as a british kid i managed to make sense of the american cultural references i didnt have personal experience with because to an eight year old girl in a small english town what the hell is a mr ed i think its kind of important for kids to learn to contextualise things they dont have immediate understanding of maybe not superyoung kids but by the time you get to fourth grade nothing yeah id say so on the other hand fudge feels like a special case for retrofitting specifically because blume went with a floating timeline it helps to make the whole series consistent in a way that seems weird to me now at twentyeight but would probably seem way less weird to a kid reading the series for the first time
books,not_removed,it doesnt look like it to me i wonder if its something youre supposed to know based on the covers or if they didnt feel the need to make it obvious since the changes are minor
books,not_removed,these books should never be tarnished like that
books,not_removed,i can understand that but as an adult have you read journey to the center of the earth in original format maybe at you hadnt grasped certain english words but as an adult i bet they dont seem so large
books,not_removed,true its not the point of such books i just mean that if we assume teenagers cant relate to a story simply because its set a couple decades in the past and doesnt feature cell phones and stuff were kind of underestimating them and trapping them into a very limited way they can relate to the world
books,not_removed,so wait this guy is triggered when its the guy who posted the thread who says he feels violated by a book
books,not_removed,i thought that belt was interesting too and remember a part where the character contemplates wearing it to sleep but worried if there was a fire in the night and need to flee it would be embarrassing
books,not_removed,oh for sure i read the original version when i was in high school im australian so high school is years and i just thought it was a bit antiquated because my mum had told me about the horrors of using the belted pads when she was a teen
books,not_removed,yes i thought wasnt right
books,not_removed,from the title i thought they were just being funny but they really meant it haha
books,not_removed,oh yeah id forgotten that one scary
books,not_removed,he did let rage go out of print to grab headlines and push his antigun bullshit fixed that for you he came out with that being pulled from print story way back when the police allowed the colombine killers to rampage for hours and children to bleed out the book remained in print on bookshelves for about a decade in fact long enough to get the updated isbn book number all he did was grandstand cause a faux shortage for a meh selling book and thus increase its sales making him off the blood of those hs kids down voting the truth just because youre a k fan doesnt change the facts
books,not_removed,to be fair older works like shakespeare and austen regularly get modernised tv stage and film adaptations which take the core plot and make it more accessible to modern readers see baz luhrmans romeo and juliet or clueless
books,not_removed,i dont know i saw a website comparing all the new versions of richard scary i think that was the right thing to do they had stuff like the dad laying around in bed while the mom cook breakfast and in the new versions everyone gets up and cooks together they arent meant to be a period piece they are meant to show children what contemporary life is like and describe the world around them you cant do that with outdated ideals in all young couples with children i know both parents cook
books,not_removed,shakespeare httpsenwikipediaorgwikishakespeareinperformanceinterregnumandrestorationperformances
books,not_removed,that sounds like a lot of work i think i will respectfully decline
books,not_removed,i think the reddit app posted my comment to the original post instead of to a comment thread in which we were discussing trigger warnings i was debating with a commenter because i was split over the topic
books,not_removed,id love to see a more modern adaptation of matilda if anything her mom would be the one addicted to twitter facebook and candy crush and gambling apps probably while she herself probably would turn to books and the library because she wasnt allowed her own computer they might even not have computers too much potential to do educational things on them just their own smartphone each
books,not_removed,i get that its about capturing childrens imaginations in order to sell copies of older books and that some authors may want this very much for their novels but as op is saying the concern here is that scholastic is retrofitting old content with shoehorned references to new technology every few chapters want to make relevant fiction for modern day kids fine but have a little respect for them theres plenty of great modern fiction for kids to read you dont have to go updating every novel in existence to make it fit the times im saying that at its heart it is a lazy attempt to boost sales of these older books and a bad precedent to set despite the authors wishes
books,not_removed,you stole the words right out of my mouth for some reason these two totally different series are always linked in my mind anyway so thats the first thing i thought of if i could love and understand the great brain series why cant they still connect with this one as it was edit and my mother wonders why i always wanted to go to boarding school
books,not_removed,i agree but the booksellers are trying to make every penny they can httpiimgurcomefecqvwjpg
books,not_removed,i have no problem with it booksellers do although it isnt fair of me to compare ti an atos book level to ops book at atos level
books,not_removed,speaking of harry potter im quite certain the edition will have hogwarts placed on mars
books,not_removed,explaining why you are a hp fan
books,not_removed,this clicked for me when taking an early american literature course after having been sexually assaulted in college right after the incident we began reading contending forces in the first few chapters a scene describes the violent attack and implied rape of a woman it was incredibly jarring to read and daunting to discuss and i ended up skipping those classes i am entirely against censorship but experience has at least brought me to understand trigger warnings maybe its unreasonable to expect all books to warn you of sensitive material but there is also an info page at the start of most books with keywordsgenrereference info where that kind of this could be easily noted its a concept im split on so if anyone has thoughts on it id love to hear them
books,not_removed,unfortunatelly there are occasions when it does turn into censorship anything and everything can be forced out of college curriculum due to potential triggering and there is no arguing against it due to the nature of the argument the one example that really stands out is when a student council argued that rape law should not be a class in a university that has a law program presumably everyone is an adult in higher education institutions it is a students choice to take a class or not a class named rape law doesnt need a trigger warning because it is self explanatory and it cant just not be taught because it is knowledge that lawyers need thats where the whole situation gets messed up it turns into an all or nothing type of a situation pretty quickly edit heres an article that talks about it extensively and mentions the example i noted
books,not_removed,and that can be accomplished by a bare minimum of due diligence i would be seriously shocked if it took a competent person more than two minutes to look up if this book is appropriate for themselves by searching wikipedia and sparknotes the focus should be on how people with serious mental conditions can adapt to the world not how we can adapt the world to people with serious mental conditions the former creates strong people and strong societies the latter creates an umbilical cord forcing dependency on others that on the moment of its severing leaves people unable to function and provide for themselves
books,not_removed,as someone with triggers who is split on the idea may i ask why youre strongly opposed my thought is that while it does seem ridiculous or like borderline censorship i think it would be easily coordinated into the books into page and wouldnt actually remove any of the original content i guess you could say it might spoil the plotremove the sense of surprise that makes some books very gripping
books,not_removed,why what does that matter if someones reading the book isnt whats in the book whats important not what used to be in the book which in reality is a different book now
books,not_removed,i dont disagree with that
books,not_removed,but to be fair the only people that would benefit is adults going back to read old childrens books from their childhood i dont know how big an audience that would be to justify a warning that the majority audience kids today would be confused by a forum or list online discussing or listing changes to older books now that i can understand the use of
books,not_removed,so youre saying you want the publisher to include a trigger warning
books,not_removed,its hard to explain the weird juxtaposition in the lion the witch and the wardrobe the witch controls things that are evil it s like a fairy tale by the magicians nephew and the horse and its boy the mythology is flushed out in more detail like tolken it makes jumping back and forth between the two styles when they are arranged chronological odd
books,not_removed,hat the publication order was not the order he even wrote them no he said he wasnt sure anyway in this case im with the scholars because there are parts of the books that dont make much sense if you read them in chronological order httpsenmwikipediaorgwikithechroniclesofnarnia
books,not_removed,i saw a copy in my kids school library but that was years ago and i cant find a link online however heres the nyt on twain and other authors and i must be misremembering because all i can find is reference to changing the n word to slave
books,not_removed,you are missing the point huck finn was never written as a contemporary novel given that jim is a slave and the novel was written after the civil war its meant to be historical and was historical even in its time the novels that are getting updated are not period pieces but theyve become them unintentionally i havent written in the book youve written the op about but i assume the entire point is that kids are supposed to be imagining that the story happens now which is a conceit that no longer works
books,not_removed,yeah storm was definitely in the original run but xena is what rachel is consistently referred to throughout the series theres even a part where one of the books ends with them watching the show
books,not_removed,haha that was perfect
books,not_removed,they could have just created a template document with just issue a new printing every five years or so get said popular musical personality to license their image on the cover instant collectors item
books,not_removed,im pretty sure people said the same thing ten years ago
books,not_removed,theres no way either beyonce or her legion of ridiculous fans will allow beyonce to not be relevant in years
books,not_removed,well yeah i suppose thats what i meant theyre not redated yet but they will be
books,not_removed,dont you dare validate what they do by calling them musicians
books,not_removed,i really doubt anybody who has an older edition is going to be replacing them with newer editions thats just not something people or libraries do for fiction novels most people dont even expect that they can
books,not_removed,he had the spaghetti hair for awhile
books,not_removed,people are more likely to call others out on bullshit in todays society at least in my opinion with the internet it is super easy to look up the original passage and question the publisher as to why it was changed in the it wasnt quite as easy and there was less concern for the rights of the consumer
books,not_removed,i hope the new star trek movies go with diane duanes version of the romulans rather than the next generation take she had a much cooler version of the vulcanromulan split
books,not_removed,they updated the so you wanna be a wizard books i really hope those get new readers it is a little known series that i think has a lot of good messages
books,not_removed,why should i when they can preserve stories down generations ensure that they stay comprehensible and relevant to young audiences that does raise the question of whats being preserved though id argue that the overall story and characters are more important than minutiae of the original text
books,not_removed,tom swift had by the the original had motorcycles and blimps the was awesome nuclear age nostalgia with rockets to the moon extruded foamcrete highways floating in the jungle etc easily the best series for the retro greatness the was terrible nobody talks about it and the was and a little snarky but decent they werent rewrites though more sequels they were usually about the children of the previous series
books,not_removed,thats like saying leslie nielson is mentally challenged in his roles in naked gun and other spoofs because he takes everything literally
books,not_removed,i thought she was an immigrant housemaid who was still learning english she took things that her boss said literally because she was still getting the hang of slang and turns of phrase and cliches in her new laungage this is what made her so approachable because as a young readers we were all doing the same thing
books,not_removed,she wasnt mentally disabled she was a fictional character a fictional character can have whatever personality you want without labeling it in real world terms
books,not_removed,f that noise i love the old books taught me lots of idioms
books,not_removed,im not sure turned off is the right word when you come across a book that as a child is supposed to be really relevant to your life right now then anything that takes you out of that experience will cause some cognitive dissonance if youre reading say george macdonald you know its an old book about things are away and ancient so talks of spinning wheels and governesses just make sense but if youre reading judy bloom and its this very immediate experience about growing up something like sanitary belts will be alienating this book isnt for you anymore its something your mom read its foreign you relate to the character less because its all aobut creating connections between your life and hers every time something happens in the book that oyu have absolutely zero context for youre pushed out of the page and back into your seat a lot of childrens popular books are updated to keep them accessible to the current generation reading them as a reader im more likely to see myself as harriet the spy if her daily life looks like mine and if i see myself in her i have a better experience i learn more and i read more
books,not_removed,prose matters gordon korman wrote writes funny books and theres more to humor than the plot
books,not_removed,so i guess the authors trust the publisher enough to uphold the integrity of their creations what if we take it to an extreme what if scholastic becomes a crazy politically driven neo nazi group and this cant be happening at macdonald hall becomes a hate filled racist story can they still slap gordon kormons name on it
books,not_removed,i get the whole sales metric thing but my point is that the content doesnt become irrelevant just because its old and trying to address their declining sales in such a manner seems to me like trying to fix a leaky boat by replacing the sails so kids arent reading and thus buying these books do people really believe that its because the content isnt current enough for them if anything i wanted to escape my current reality when i was a kid i was an avid reader but i mostly wanted to read about knights and sorcery or scary stories or fighter pilots in wwi i would say its much more likely that scholastics problems are indicative of the problems the entire print industry is facing in the wake of the digital revolution as a result i dont think they can solve their problems by rewriting and modernizing a few passages here and there its a stop gap measure that may placate their partners in the education industry for now and drive revenue but if there is a real demand for current material and they cant afford to publish new authors to fill that need then their business model is bound to fail
books,not_removed,my classmates and i liked shakespeare in school because our english teacher was a dirty old man who explained all the sexual innuendo to us he was an excellent teacher and he thoroughly prepared us for writing at a university level
books,not_removed,but you probably liked to read already right imagine if you were a reluctant reader you dont think reading is fun or interesting and then you pick up a book and everyones talking about things youve never heard of and none of their interests make sense to you eg lets watch mr ed and then as a treat well go the record store and buy an album i would argue that thats sure not going to make that book any more appealing to you do i think everything needs to be updated no absolutely not but i can see the reasoning behind it
books,not_removed,now that were discussing it i remember reading that the original hardy boys books were sanitized to remove references to troublemaking and opposition to authority as well as some racial stereotypes but that was done back in the if i recall correctly
books,not_removed,they wore something different than the belt for sleeping during periods
books,not_removed,this subreddit in a nutshell right there in your comment
books,not_removed,ops childhood hasnt been rewritten though thats like saying female ghostbusters ruined my childhood no it fucking didnt your childhood is the same as it was before books have many roles in our world and one of those is art the artist is free to do with their work as they see fit if metallica wants to do a black album unplugged that is their right as artists it wont stop me from listening to the original black album if op cares so deeply about the book they can track down an original copy if op is an adult and so brutally wounded by a childrens book being altered to be more relatable to children that comes across as selfish and kinda disturbing
books,not_removed,down voting the truth just because youre a k fan doesnt change the facts no youre being downvoted for posting total bullshit and conspiracy theories the shooting that caused king to decide to pull the book was two full years before columbine httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiheathhighschoolshooting and if his lack of a time machine wasnt convincing enough the faux shortage theory doesnt make any fucking sense given the book is still out of print and that king has been staunchly antigun for years
books,not_removed,yeah i knowand i prefer the original works what i meant was what if the original was replaced with updates
books,not_removed,yes but the original works are still first choice updates are optional when op checked out the book it appeared to be the original at least thats the impression i got
books,not_removed,its ok someone else helped me out see my third edit
books,not_removed,not necessarily dora no i wrote that after a night at the bar p i grew up with my little pony i still have my vhs of the originals movie around here somewhere the new stuff is cute and i do appreciate that its appealing to everyone but the original is very special to me
books,not_removed,i completely agree if films can have content warnings books should too i found it especially hard as an lgbt person in college having group critical discussions on the validity of same sex relationships and desire in authors and characters lives discussions which often devolved into morality issues and judgements in general books with casual violence against women that the professor didnt draw attention to but just accepted as a normal facet of this world oh so common in older science fiction were also hard to deal with in these cases its often not just reading the book thats difficult its discussing it later with a group without getting emotionally involved whatsoever and i think that distinction isnt made often enough especially when the professor channels attention away from an issue in the text that really stands out to you as central and they and your peers tear you down when you try to bring it up thats when the fiction starts to cross over into real world this is of course most relevant on literature courses where your reading list is more open as well in my case i didnt have to read those books if i wasnt planning on bringing them into my final assignments so doing so and discussing them was literally an undue cause of stress for me for a nongenderedpersonhood example being set the story of the last days of a terminally ill patient weeks after a relative lost their fight with cancer was very very tough and i ended up not finishing it and faking my way through the discussion
books,not_removed,i do not agree that adding content warnings to books or to expect a professor of a class to give trigger warnings is a slippery slope towards total censorship im not advocating that something should be removed from the curriculum bc of its potential to be distressing but i do agree that some people might seek that route however i dont think that is common and the example that you cite is unusual
books,not_removed,i would love to see you say this to the face of my old roommate who came home from iraq and needed trigger warnings for certain movies every little thing is not what triggers are triggers are things like rape and roadside bombs and torture typically when a person wants trigger warnings it is because they have seen real life shit that people like you and i can only imagine typically people asking for trigger warnings are simultaneously seeking counseling seeking mental health care should not be mutually exclusive with seeking an education yes mental health is the individuals responsibility which is why they are asking for information so they can handle their mental health responsibly
books,not_removed,if you loved doing something but had a mental disorder that in rare cases would make you severely uncomfortable would you appreciate someone telling you just dont do it i dont think thats the answer like others have said in this thread organizations like the mpaa already list possibly offensive material at the start of movies and nobody pays it any mind if a similar page were put in the front of books it would be even less obtrusive as most people skip the title page and whatnot anyway the notion that this behavior is coddling is silly as we already have it in place for movies and video games and it has no effect on the majority of people and that way people who are sensitive to such material have a heads up on what to expect this whole issue is not for people who get queasy at the sight of blood and demand to have every reference to blood removed from their sighthearing
books,not_removed,to what extent are you expecting these trigger warnings to interfere with the text of the novel itself when i first heard the idea floated i was expecting it to be along the lines of the viewer discretion is advised warnings you see are the beginning of certain tv shows but it seems like a lot of people are anticipating something else and if you are expecting it to be more like a blanket warning such as those used for television shows why are you against it i cant see how a simple singlesentence warning on the back cover or before the novel begins is either detracting from the text or overly coddling the readers so im curious as to the counter arguments
books,not_removed,so its not that you have an issue with content warnings you just want to make them harder to access because what you are suggesting is that the person search out their own content warning no one is asking the world to adapt to them they are asking for a heads up when a seemingly innocuous book contains content that could trigger serious emotional disturbance they dont want the books removed from the curriculum they dont want the books altered they want people to say this book contains graphic depictions of torture thats all
books,not_removed,i know many college instructors who have allowed the trigger warning claptrap to control their classes and reading lists
books,not_removed,i think i could honestly live with a this has rape warning but for the most part thats usually on the blurb idk my main annoyance is over the people who are calling for the triggers theyre the same people who dislike classic books not because theyre old fashioned but because they were written by a white male my main concern is that for someone who had amazing parents who let me read whatever i wanted to a trigger warning might make parents less okay with kids reading the books also the authorspublishers could end up getting a lot of flack if they put in a trigger warning for something like rape but then not for something like violence it kind of feels like a slippery slope because someone will never be pleased and just want more
books,not_removed,so they can go back and see the evolution of the story as the culture changed and maybe gain some insights into the cultures that came before them they can then form their own opinion on whether the changes were appropriate or not instead of having you dictate that to them
books,not_removed,chronological is how i read them perhaps thats why i got bored partway through silver chair and always loved magicians nephew and the horse and his boy more than the main booksz
books,not_removed,oh i thought he wrote magicians nephew last but thats just from my memory
books,not_removed,young adult madlibs huh
books,not_removed,like in pride and prejudice where the name of the town and the unit number of the militia force are blanked out
books,not_removed,write a novel like this get lauded as a genius meta writercritic
books,not_removed,touch√© i forgot how long theyve been around already
books,not_removed,who do you count as real music
books,not_removed,beyonce and jt are two of the actually talented pop musicians around nowadays
books,not_removed,i think its more that a contemporary edition might be more likely to appeal to young readers than one where the wakefield twins think robert redford is dreamy so the books are being sold to kids who might otherwise have never picked them up in the case of sweet valley i assume they went after the type of teenagers reading gossip girl and paranormal romances huge sales in both cases and worth trying to elbow in on especially since lots of their mothers probably looked back on sweet valley very fondly
books,not_removed,i always thought it was like pre cooked ramen
books,not_removed,people decried it back then and were just as ignored as ops objections will be ignored today
books,not_removed,im genuinely curious how this affects the rights of the consumer its just am attempt to modernize books for children that they might not otherwise be able to understand i for one wish they wouldnt because children should learn how to deal with such things but its hardly evil or a violation of consumer rights if anyones rights are violated its the original author
books,not_removed,i was reading one to my son recently and had the thought holy shit amelia bedilia is autistic
books,not_removed,i mean i never really thought of his roles that way but
books,not_removed,well that could be a sign of aspergers syndrome
books,not_removed,that being said as a mentally disabled adult i always found her really relatable as a kid and i still think of her extremely fondly i do think of her as mentally disabled and shes rad to me for that reason full disclaimer its been years since i read them but i have very fond memories
books,not_removed,a fictional character can have whatever personality you want without labeling it in real world terms no because people real world people at that are going to use real world terms when trying to relate to the character fine in this characters fictional world the fictional characters may not label her as mentally disabled but for the real world people reading about the character then they will apply real world terms
books,not_removed,i grew up reading a foot tall rendition of aesops fables as i sat in my dads lap before bed i read the chronicles of narnia when i was around or i learned most of my vocabulary and idioms by looking them up in a book after seeing them or asking questions most of it didnt make sense to me and it made me think that gave me an escape from the awful mess going on around me i dont understand why they have to change if you modernized or sanitized the chronicles of narnia it wouldnt be the same book itd paint a different world the values are from a different time period and thats wonderful edit holy shit this reply chain is awesome you guys rock
books,not_removed,as an elementary teacher if the kids cant relate to the setting or the character they arent touching it im sure its something publishers have kept in mind for a long time
books,not_removed,he signed the contract so yes they can
books,not_removed,because our english teacher was a dirty old man who explained all the sexual innuendo to us he was an excellent teacher and he thoroughly prepared us for writing at a university level do you not see the difference here no one is explaining and teaching kids books full of outdated technology and slang that makes an immeasurable difference in terms of being able to connect with the book
books,not_removed,oh sure i can see the reasoning too although im inclined to think it has more to do with cashing in than encouraging kids to read for the same of reading p i just think that it doesnt really give kids all that much credit i mean following that logic would you change geographical stuff for different markets too it sounds glib but its a genuine question i know i didnt get all of the american cultural references in a lot of the books i read as a kid and im sure that some of the finer details of british things like the harry potter series went over the heads of american readers at what point do we trust kids to be able to fill in the gaps for themselves if a book has things a reluctant reader might find difficult id personally suggest that they picked a different book rather than changing the book to suit the reader if that makes sense
books,not_removed,if i recall correctly the hardy boys have been updated a handful of times in order to allow the stories to feel more contemporary adding in newer technologies etc
books,not_removed,the original stories were rewritten from to update racism technology language and format from book everything else remains unrevised including a number of spin off series being born later than until recently i had only read the rewritten ones last year though i bought a copy of the original version of the hidden harbour mystery book a uk edition so the title has a bonus u i agreed that it was more racist more violent and less polished than the rewrites i also found it surprising that the difference between and was much greater than between and when i first read the books and even and
books,not_removed,oh yeah cause by the we had this race stuff all figured out
books,not_removed,this makes me really sad
books,not_removed,wow i dont understand how those two things can be mentioned in the same breath and considered to have the same importance not by you but by the publishers
books,not_removed,thats like saying female ghostbusters ruined my childhood yes this is exactly what i was thinking as well a new version of something does nothing at all to change the version that youre emotionally invested in you just need the maturity to realize that
books,not_removed,apply the same statements to other works and it falls flat on its ass as it should it may not feel important because its a childrens work but thats happenstance if a publisher changes the count of monte cristo such that dantes reads up about mathematics and italian on the internet people would have a right to be pissed off as gregor samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself browsing web md in his bed searching for turned into a gigantic insect your opinion is laughable
books,not_removed,and if his lack of a time machine wasnt convincing enough the faux shortage theory doesnt make any fucking sense given the book is still out of print so explain it remaining in print a decade after the columbine shooting more than years after k claimed to have had it pulled youre just an k groupie defending your hero
books,not_removed,im not saying that youre advocating it im saying that its a real thing thats already happening
books,not_removed,the reason i take issue with this particular type of content warning is that it is another layer of inefficient regulation that seems likely to open up authorspublishing groups to litigation when and it is a when someone has a panic attack reading a book that did have content warnings but not one for this particular trigger it could be argued that the publisherauthor was negligent i dont think that would be an issue for large publishing groups but small publishing groups and selfpublishing authors can easily be intimidated by a well written letter from a lawyer this isnt even mentioning that now every novel published will have to be reviewed likely by multiple people each with their own salary endgame this likely means less money for authors who already make a pittance if there is successful litigation on this we also have to define what material needs a content warning anyone who can mash a keyboard can selfpublish on amazon now was made on internet yet clearly could have also have been a published work should that have content ratings if so wouldnt this apply to just about any fanfic group should every gif on the internet that contains possibly triggering material be rated obviously some of those questions are facetious the point is at what point are people responsible for themselves i take the approach of worldproofing the children rather than childproofing the world when i first heard the idea floated i was expecting it to be along the lines of the viewer discretion is advised warnings you see are the beginning of certain tv shows to me this is the worstcase scenario those ratings are made by the tv parental guidelines monitoring board which modeled their ratings after movie ratings made by the mpaa i would expect that if something similar were to come to books it would be chalk full of the same censorship bullshit to promote family values eventually authors who write anything that can be found offensive will have an audience of their original size because it was rated for having a paragraph describing the nude female form
books,not_removed,to my extended response to another redditor basically i want people to be responsible for their own well being foisting the responsibility onto the publishers could make them liable for emotional damage publishers respond with more warnings more money into screening books fewer books with triggering material and we get a publishing industry with a regulatory body like the mpaa with its own set of goals
books,not_removed,edit my comment got posted to the wrong thread in this post but im leaving it up if i could counter a few of your points for arguments sake not every traumatic scene is part of the main plot and therefore is not mentioned in the blurb for example the rape scene in the opening of contending forces it seems youre talking about feminists as you mention an antimale sort of stance i personally dont see feminists rejecting classic literature over the authors gender or any sensitiveoffensive topics a lot of women in my english courses are feminist on a variety of levels all of them have appreciated classics as foundational literature and as a study of historical thinking i dont find that being feminist will hinder you interest in literature education and discussion additionally i feel that just because a book is a classic does not mean you have to like it the term simply means that the text was influential on its society or on more modern texts and means its a strong piece to include in your education as for parents reading to kids or preventing kids from reading personally i did not read any books featuring rape murder or trauma until late middle school with the more heinous of these topics not appearing until mid high school despite being in high levelap courses i think at this point most parents are comfortable with their kids reading more intensely of course there will be outliers but thats always the case in general i feel trigger warnings wont even prevent traumatized people from reading its an opportunity to mentally prepare of course a lot of this is anecdotal and you make a valid argument about the gradual modern damnation of classics i think its a tough topic but its very interesting
books,not_removed,instead of having you dictate that to them this makes no sense at all given that the original story is dictated to you in the same way should we also be given notes about the authors first draft so that we can see what changes were made to the original original story
books,not_removed,ive seen stranger things succeed
books,not_removed,people that actually sing their songs not lip sync
books,not_removed,but neither of them actually write or sing songs they lip sync to what others write
books,not_removed,it doesnt saying this somehow violates the rights of consumers is ludicrous because the consumer has no claim of ownership to the content
books,not_removed,you i dont want kids to read books because nostalgia
books,not_removed,publisher we want kids to buy and read our books because money instead of a high quality sequel to make the now adults with money buy
books,not_removed,can it
books,not_removed,yup this is totally it she just doesnt understand things on a nonliteral level
books,not_removed,definitely aspergers
books,not_removed,what did he look like well he had dark hair moustache thats an awfully big moustache leslie nielsen was my grandad from another grandma i miss him a lot
books,not_removed,or a kleptomaniac theyre always taking things literally too
books,not_removed,she just takes things literally because she comes from a family where thats the custom everything is relative you judge characters by the standards of the world theyre in
books,not_removed,thats like saying characters in fantasy books are mentally ill and delusional because they talk to dragons and do magic its basic suspension of disbelief in amelia bedelia world someone can act the way she does and its normal if silly
books,not_removed,modernizing the chronicles of narnia would be ridiculous susan never again visited narnia as she was much too into posting photos of food and bikini shots on instagram
books,not_removed,hard to believe that when i was in grade i started reading animorphs and now i go back and reread them nearly years later and am disturbed by how very fuckedup some of the stuff in them is
books,not_removed,at which point itd be all over the internet and the author could make it very clear that the changes were without his consent id actually be less worried about that hypothetical scenario now than i would have been in the past
books,not_removed,i see the difference my point is that i think this is an education problem and not a content problem there is value in learning about the or or bc but children need to be taught to pursue that value or they risk never discovering it
books,not_removed,its so disappointing i absolutely loved the hardy boys as a kid and i distinctly remember being enamored by the old technologythe shortwave radios the old runabout boat and jalopies it was a fantasy world in an era that i grew to love taking place in modern day would ruin it
books,not_removed,ive definitely read some of each hardy boy books growing up in the and early it was easy to tell which had modern technology as they were usually paperback and called something weird like the hardy boys and the cyber spy or something else techfriendly the original ones at least original to me were the hardcover blue bound books
books,not_removed,the hardy boys are a franchise written by a whole gang of people on a rigid formula id be surprised if they bothered to rewrite old ones when they arent against adding to the list
books,not_removed,the count of monte christo is a classic a classic is meant to be preserved the way it is as a slice of history of a certain period to be read by adults who can analyze the book within the time frame in which it was written a childrens book is not a classic childrens books are meant to introduce them to reading by appealing to them one way to do that is to make the story relevant to them by including modern technology im sorry if it offends you that a publisher changed a book not meant for you anymore to suit the group it was actually targeted at but honestly you have no right to be offended
books,not_removed,again the point of trigger warnings is not to avoid reading the content it is to know the content is present in order to mentally prepare people who have experienced things like being shelled dont generally have issues on the fourth of july because they expect to hear explosions but set off a firework when it is unexpected and you will get a completely different reaction no one is asking society to take care of them they are asking teachers who are assigning work to be up front about what that assignment entails these people arent walking into a bookstore reading shades of grey and screaming that they should never have been exposed to it they arent seeking out the content they are being told to read it it is common courtesy amongst the people i know that if you recommend a book or movie or video game or any other piece of media that has potentially troubling content you give a heads up i would never recommend a movie like syriana without noting that there is a totally unexpected torture scene halfway through
books,not_removed,its not societys responsibility but considering that trigger warnings have no detriment or cost to society its kind of a dick move to refuse to provide them
books,not_removed,well we do leverage them as tools of american political and strategic power abroad put another way though how does it hurt you to have a warning in the foreword that tells people hey this book has some nasty stuff fyi its not an imposition to you is it i mean do you get angry about movie ratings too
books,not_removed,i dont begrudge people who take an allergy pill before they spend a lot of time outside because it doesnt impact my life i also dont begrudge content warnings because i thankfully dont have any ptsd or other triggering issues its amazing how easy and happy my life is by not letting something that doesnt impact me in the slightest get under my skin
books,not_removed,can you give me an example of such litigation or lawsuits being successfully brought against any current ratings systems ive done a bit of digging and i cant find anything to suggest such an attempt ever actually came to fruition the first amendment almost invariably sides with the film makers tv producers and even video game developers in fact aside from some squirrelly enforcement by the fcc that only applies to obscenity which doesnt have first amendment protection anyway and broadcasting times and largely only apply to public broadcasts theres nothing even enforcing the rating systems that are currently in place the mpaa parental advisory labels and even esrb ratings are all completely voluntary movie theaters arent even required by law to prevent people under a certain age from seeing r rated films if none of these current rating systems have been successfully used in lawsuits not even the mpaas sytem which has been around in its current form since the what makes you believe applying similar voluntary warnings to books will lead to an outpouring of litigation and legislation
books,not_removed,slippery slope arguments arent very convincing yeah that could happen or it could not happen you give no reason to expect your worst case scenario to occur
books,not_removed,thats because its the best netflix show there is
books,not_removed,haha wut no dude i dont care what publishers do if anything my comment was explaining why theyre in their right to do whatever they want with their ip my other comments on this thread speak more to my position if youre interested im a teacher
books,not_removed,its risky it may not be popular and be a money sinkhole and its more expensive than just revamping preexisting ip iphone doesnt reinvent itself it just improves some things because its cheaper than recreating a brand new even if better phone design
books,not_removed,plus shes at least dimly aware of it as evidenced by the fact that whenever something is coming out badly like say a sponge cake she also makes a lemon merengue pie or something to make up for it shes autistic but shes not stupid
books,not_removed,you are right that you do need to take into account the fictional world that they live in but at the same time you can use real world terms to describe and relate to that characters for example if someone is afraid of spiders would you not still use the term arachnophobia to describe them even if everyone in that fictional world had that fear yes you would if in this fictional world the rest of the fictional world thinks the character is strange unusual etc and overall doesnt fit in with society then you can apply real world terms such as mentally disabled now with that said i havent read the series so i dont know about this specific series im just saying you can use real world terms when describing a fictional character edit thanks uibbot i used the wrong world and you correctly gave me the word i meant
books,not_removed,duckface did her in
books,not_removed,same i totally forgot about the book where one character is brutally and graphically tortured or the book where all the disabled kids are led to their death
books,not_removed,oh my god they did some fucked up shit seriously though ka applegate had some disturbing imagery at times still a kickass series though
books,not_removed,i read them starting around grade or so and i remember think all the hyperviolent animalonalien warfare was awesome it instilled a love of action scifi in me i distinctly remember one evening when my parents told me and my sister to go to our rooms so they could watch some rrated movie i read the latest animorphs where a kid got torn apart by ravenous ants in a firstperson perspective keep your movie mom i have scholastic books to give me nightmares the kid survives by morphing back to human but later theres a scene where he finds a severed ant head still clinging to his skin by the mandibles as hes taking a shower in retrospect all of the main characters suffer from massive ptsd
books,not_removed,good fiction is not cheap or easy where would you get the idea that they could just get new stories cheaper than editing the text of an existing one
books,not_removed,i feel lucky now i have the complete set of the blue hardcover books sitting on my bookshelf ill probably never read them again but they were my childhood
books,not_removed,yeah the old books werent updated they just released new books with more modern themes and technology
books,not_removed,again the point of trigger warnings is not to avoid reading the content it is to know the content is present in order to mentally prepare and does it even help my understanding was that an actual trigger can be something so innocuous as carpet color while a literary depiction of something does not necessarily have to do anything to you
books,not_removed,none of the current rating systems are intended to assist those with medical issues however there are similar voluntary standards in the video game industry is a summary of two suits about children with epilepsy is another in which nintendo settled it should be noted that even with warnings and following voluntary consumer guidelines there was enough of a case that nintendo decided to settle that is a case against an incredibly large multibillion dollar company as we have seen from patent trolls however you dont need to sue a big company to make big money all you have to do is threaten smaller companies and small startups you dont even need a day in court because if you ask for less a total less than legal defense wages business lost due to handling the suit it is in the economic interest of the companyindividual to spend less to pay you off and never risk going to court for what would be a net loss anyway this is the consequence of living in a litigation state „ÉÑ
books,not_removed,sure but my slope isnt an all or nothing either the worst case scenario is exactly that the worst case if books have trigger warnings someone has to put them there corporations love shifting responsibility so whatever department they have for creating these warnings will be big enough for the important people to blame other people more people means more salary more salaries means thinner profit margins bad for the entire industry it is the same thing that happens any time additional regulation is added to an industry more cost and time to produce the product sometimes this is warranted like the famous regulations of the meat industry caused by sinclairs the jungle vastly improving food quality and safety standards that said i do not think that it would be warranted in this case it would require regulation of an entire industry to benefit what is already a small population of people by saving them minutes of google searching
books,not_removed,its good but i prefer bojack
books,not_removed,dude you beat me i was about to comment this
books,not_removed,house of cards is the original netflix original and its still better
books,not_removed,some dude they paid to do it
books,not_removed,i know maybe i was just thinking of the success of samurai jack coming up soon if you know how to hype it you can get it done
books,not_removed,agoraphobia is a phobia where one perceives ones general surroundings as frighteningunsafe fear of spiders is arachnophobia the mistake doesnt detract much from your post since your meaning is clear but i thought you might want to know
books,not_removed,that is a reasonable argument perhaps if there was a condition that was obvious and specific that fit the fictional characters behavior i would be more comfortable with it but i think it is entirely inappropriate to apply a vague and often demeaning label like mentally disabled to a fictional character just because the author wrote them behave differently than expected
books,not_removed,including her cousin eustace who used to be such a self centered tumblr blogger
books,not_removed,the whole premise is pretty hardcore for kids honestly not the turning into animals but the fullon paranoia inducing body snatching alien conspiracy stuff where anyone might be one of them with a slug in their brain
books,not_removed,like i said they were original to me although op is probably correct about them being updated to lingo from lingo i would save them for my future children if i were you they are great kids books
books,not_removed,sure there are variations and some people have triggers that would be unpredictable for anyone else but the impossibility of warning against every possible trigger is no reason not to warn about the most common
books,not_removed,thats fine so do i but do the ratings actively offend you also i think ratings are useful for parents whose kids arent quite ready for certain material my nephew dislikes gore for instance so that can be useful when picking a movie
books,not_removed,what show is this
books,not_removed,til beyonces songs are sung by a dude
books,not_removed,i am not sure you know what lip syncing means
books,not_removed,well samurai isnt getting a remake youre right they could just add to the story though i dunno if samurai jack fits quite right since it wasnt that the story wrapped up and now theyre adding to it but more like the story wasnt allowed to finish aslo hyyyyyyyype
books,not_removed,thanks
books,not_removed,yeah pretty chilling
books,not_removed,sure you can warn im just it has usable effects with regards to mentally preparing yourself as opposed to simple avoidance which seems more often the point if preparing yourself is so simple as a notification why do cbt practitioners still get such big money
books,not_removed,stranger things its a netflix original very reminiscent of et and other old scifi thrillers id say its pretty similar to super
books,not_removed,theyre interpreting darthras comment as ive seen stranger things succeed i also was hoping for adult madlibs a netflix original series
books,not_removed,im sure theres bunch of books that dont have an exact end one that comes to my mind at this is the man in the high castle i mean yeah its way easier to just add in two new lines and edit a few words rather than writing an entire new book but hope dies last
books,not_removed,shes not a slut she just grew up and was influenced by non believers
books,not_removed,thats because the whole series is a christian alegory
books,not_removed,thats one experience and its certainly valid to compare my old roommate served in iraq his position was shelled regularly he watched war movies and it never bothered him but if a realistically war oriented scene came up unexpectedly it was very hard for him and could leave him in a panicked state for him it was the unpredictable nature of the trigger that was challenging
books,not_removed,but ultimately better than super imo
books,not_removed,the thing about dan browns books is that they all follow a pattern initially someone closerelated to an important character dies all prologues the lead character gets drawn into the mystery some chases some revelations other deaths heavy plot twist at the end revealing bad guy to be a close friend or an acquaintance
books,not_removed,inferno the next novel is a little better but i wish dan brown would write standalone novels again the robert langdon character has been milked to death by now theres another one coming next year though
books,not_removed,i liked digital fortress and angels and demons didnt like the others
books,not_removed,a dan brown book that was a let down you dont say
books,not_removed,the lost symbol was utter rubbish i swear brown wasnt even trying to hide the identity of the antagonist in this one angles and demons had me guessing for a little bit but the lost symbol i pretty much thought to myself its that guy right after he was introduced there was one thing i really did like about the lost symbol there was a moment in it where he was using the origin of the word sincerely for something cant recall its been a long time since i read it and i was annoyed because he had done the same thing years earlier in his novel digital fortress well once the little bit was done there was a line about how this nugget of trivia happened to be a plot twist of a terrible mystery novel he had read a few years ago i can always appreciate some good old fashioned self deprecating humor instantly made that awful passage much better anyway inferno is a better book but still typical dan brown you seem to share my opinions of the first three so far so theres a decent chance youll enjoy inferno
books,not_removed,id agree i purchased it two weeks ago and finished it while camping it was good but the ending left me a bit disappointed i was expecting some cool mystery but the ending just made it feel so empty s why bother with hunting the mc down through investigation if the secret was just nothing important why let the main villian die at the end after revealing the twists
books,not_removed,angels demons and the da vinci code were both pretty dumb books that said i enjoyed them they were entertaining and interesting and were quick worthwhile reads the lost symbol was just fucking nonsense though and went from being dumb to flagrantly stupid
books,not_removed,inferno is better
books,not_removed,yeah he is predictable and that makes him a boring author i think his most emphasis is on delivering a thrilling narrative of conspiracy theories or creating new ones
books,not_removed,the biggest twist of all
books,not_removed,it pissed me off so much that blank was the antagonist it was so obvious from the moment that his other identity was mentioned they should have just gotten it out of the way and not had a mystery
books,not_removed,i honestly never thought the end stakes were that high to begin with really the entire story fell flat for me at least the one single element i liked was how malack catfished langdon in the beginning that was creepy and effective and an interesting commentary if brown had chosen to make it one on todays digital communications culture
books,not_removed,couldnt agree more it became clear very early on in lost symbol that it was going to be a skim milk version of the same
books,not_removed,i dont know if i can bring myself to read another dan brownat least deception point had some decent buildup before it wiffed the ending with twists and humor lost symbol was brutal like getting food poisoning now i dont know if i can stomach more of his writing
books,not_removed,true
books,not_removed,i think spoiled milk would make for a better analogy
books,not_removed,lol i know what you mean and i didnt care much for the lost symbol either but i did like inferno a lot more its worth a shot if you liked other dan brown books i think
books,not_removed,how about some additional info instead of just linking to whatever that is you wrote it what the hell is it whats special about it why related to rbooks
books,not_removed,one of my favorite books of all time im very surprised to see it linked here probably not the easiest format to read but i highly recommend everyone give this a try although it was written a long time ago its incredible how relevant it is to modern day
books,not_removed,most libraries in the usa use the overdrive app to facilitate ebook borrowing and reading i use it a lot and it is free it allows me to download library ebooks and read it on my kindle app also free
books,not_removed,use overdrive andor kindleoverdrive ebooks can be downloaded through amazon as kindle books and you can specify which device to send them to make sure you know the device name and keep it on wifi for easy downloads
books,not_removed,look at your librarys website its very likely they support overdrive most overdrive books are available in kindle format you just check the book out and select download as a kindle book you then choose to have it sent to your ereader or your phone once you check the book out to a kindle account its available wherever you can read kindle books very easy
books,not_removed,i have used the app to browse for library books and download them to my ipad
books,not_removed,ive read it and also loved a prayer for owen meany by john irving i got a similar feeling from both
books,not_removed,im interested in what you mean by lost do you mean like something has ended and cant be revisited or that your perspective has been changed id say lonesome dove the regrets keep stacking and everything adds up at the end until it is too much most soul destroying western ever not in a brutal apocalyptic way or anything ive been meaning to read i know this much is true youve motivated me a bit more now
books,not_removed,i love that book
books,not_removed,one hundred years of solitude i think has the kind of ending youre looking for
books,not_removed,another great wally lamb novel that changed my life in high school tbh is shes come undone i still remember this book nearly ten years later
books,not_removed,just bought this yesterday at goodwill
books,not_removed,i almost gave up on this book and i am so glad i didnt i bought the hour i first believed also by wally lamb i almost gave up on it too but once again am glad i didnt you might like it
books,not_removed,wally lamb is my favorite author so naturally ive read everything hes ever written lol i actually remember having that holding my breath feeling while reading we are water but maybe because i read it more recently back in definitely not as hard as i know this much is true but still grabs you i would have to second one hundred years of solitude but you need to have your full attention on that one something i read recently that gave me the same feeling is more than human by theodore sturgeon which you could finish in a day or two but which had me hooked the whole time
books,not_removed,just added that to the download list thank you kindly
books,not_removed,if you liked a prayer for owen meany who doesnt right and if youve sedulously worked your way through irvings other stuff none of which had that same spark of magic that we found in apfom right then you should give the brothers k by david james duncan a crack its set in the same time period and stylistically feels very similar to irvings stuff but whereas imo cider house rules and world according to garp fall sort of flat still decent books ofc the brothers k climbs right up there to the precipitous heights reached by apfom and provides a smart funny compassionate novel that i am sure anyone who loved apfom will love too
books,not_removed,i read owen meany although i tell myself that i hated it over the last three years i havent been able to stop thinking about it it really is a good book so should i read this book by wally lamb i almost did once but reviewers said there was too much filler is there
books,not_removed,hi friend im pretty bad at explaining these kinds of feelings just a warning its like i was so engaged in the life inside the book that once it was done i felt lost for lack of a better term that now what feeling that emotional investment was spent so this little hole was left haha all from a book not uncommon but still sounds silly to put into words and thank you just added that to the list
books,not_removed,people were complaining on goodreads that it was too long and sagged in places but man i found it kept a great pace
books,not_removed,havent heard of that one thank you just added it to my list
books,not_removed,shes come undone is my favorite wally lamb book if i remember correctly i read it a long time ago it had a spark of humor that his other books seem to lack it wasnt quite as bleak as i know this much is true or the hour i first believed
books,not_removed,buckle in for a wild ride
books,not_removed,i checked my digi library and i have that one starting it now and already loaded the others mentioned love it thank you
books,not_removed,thanks so much i havent heard of more than human but that is now on the list
books,not_removed,its probably longer than it needs to be but its still a good book that id recommend or read something else theres no shortage of great books out there
books,not_removed,no thats a good explanation thanks
books,not_removed,it is kinda long yeah

books,not_removed,awesome thanks for posting this i just signed out a book on chakras
books,not_removed,title is a bit misleading only books available of which only one is fiction even if your preference is for nonfiction the selection is quite limited then again free is free
books,not_removed,shame they only have or so books and more than half of them are theology
books,not_removed,i dont think so it made it much easier to keep track of characters for me since i knew what they looked like on the show the deviations really begin in book and there are now parts of the show that are straight up fanfiction i really enjoy the show but the books are far superior though grrms writing can become tedious enjoy
books,not_removed,some of the big twist complete with twisting daggers are replicated on the show youll lose that impact i chunked the book across the room in the red wedding chapter but youve already experienced that cruel shock on one medium so i guess it wouldnt be much different than me reading the books first and then seeing the show
books,not_removed,i watched seasons and wasnt impressed but i wanted to know what happened i then read all of the books and had a new appreciation for the show i felt more attached to the characters and understood stuff a lot better
books,not_removed,books will always be better than movies or shows as far as got goes the show takes several liberties
books,not_removed,i found the first book pretty boring when i first read it because it follows the first season very closely and i had just rewatched it however from book the show and books go fairly separate ways and on rereading book i was in a better frame of mind to pick up on all the details and extra content in the book than show
books,not_removed,id say give it a go most of the main plot points will have been spoiled but the books have some characters that dont appear in the show there are plot deviations especially in the last book and itll generally give more insight and depth into the show characters when reading from their pov
books,not_removed,a little bit youll have some of the big moments and reveals spoiled already from the show but there are also a lot of great moments not included in the show also i think the build up to some of those moments is better in the book than in the show so you might find it more dramatic or satisfying
books,not_removed,im reading now for the third time so obviously i dont think spoilers ruin the experience reading will also make the show better for you you will understand the story much better pick up on countless subtleties and know the motivations and feelings of characters
books,not_removed,asoiaf isnt shakespeare but i think theyre better than the show most of the time being spoiled to some plot points will ruin some parts of the plot especially grrms wellknown aversion to hero invincibility but there is much more background and plot to the story than just the show being aware of the show allows you to remember characters better and being aware of the plot allows you to pick up on literary devices foreshadowing given your experience with harry potter i assure you that you might find the books just as great grrm does have plenty of purple prose and have his moments when the writing is stale and boring but theres no pressure at all for you to finish them
books,not_removed,it will not hinder you that much except when people die in the book who are still on the show and vice versa several characters were sort of combined for television and in later books some people are in totally different parts of the world good luck valor morghulis
books,not_removed,it was even crueler on the show if im not mistaken even more people die at the rw than in the books right
books,not_removed,i had the same experience tried to read book one after watching season and just found it to be basically shot for shot and quite boring

books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,whoops my bad new to this section
books,not_removed,harry turtledove pops into my mind when i hear the words alternate history
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,not really alternate history the last kingdom series is based on actual historical events with some fiction peppered in to make it less boring which is pretty much paraphrased from cornwell himself i highly suggest them
books,not_removed,ive asked for suggestions here before with no issue
books,not_removed,the moderation team does sometimes miss a post its true the rules are clear though and theyve been like that for many years
books,not_removed,i know right i tried to read moby dick and the dude wouldnt shut the fuck up about whales what the hell herman
books,not_removed,check out the appendix at the back it has a lot of helpful information for keeping track of thewimbles and jongos really once you get the hang of a few organizations the great houses landsraad bene geserit spacing guild fremen etc its pretty easy to keep it straight lots of words and terms are borrowed from arabic as well in case that can help with your comprehension its an incredibly deep and complex story so its unfortunate that youre becoming frustrated with the naming conventions before you really have an opportunity to dip into the story
books,not_removed,context cues dude you pick it up as you go along
books,not_removed,im in the middle of dune right now and it gets much betterless overwhelming i agree its pretty offputting at first all of the names races planets etc are crazy sounding but stick with it after you get familiar with everyone its much less confusing not sure about your copy but mine has glossary and some other useful appendices included at the end
books,not_removed,dude its not that difficult its a space opera about the rivaling houses atreides duke leto his concubine jessica and their son paul and harkonnen baron vladimir feydrautha and glossu rabban both houses owe allegiance to the padishah emperor shaddam iv who fight for the spice melange of the planet arrakis populated by fremen and there are also sandworms called shaihulud or shaitan by the fremen the spacing guilds navigators depend on the prescience melange provides to safely steer heighliners theres also the choam corporation that determines the financial leverage of houses and the bene gesserit who want to breed the kwisatz haderach now i dont wanna give the whole story away but theres something involving paul and the lookedfor muaddib i hope that helped
books,not_removed,maybe you should set it aside for a few years and then try again books dont always hook you on the first try
books,not_removed,what is shiz what is prophanity why dont you punctuate how am i supposed to understand you
books,not_removed,youre supposed to be a bit lost this book is like a psychedelic trip similar to alice in wonderland if you recognized everything it wouldnt be the future or alien having said that just stick with it eventually things will become simplified in the beginning just become familiar with the emperor ruling houses spacing guild mentats the bene gesserit and fremen once you grasp these major players everything else will fall into place and all the weird details add to the immense depth of the universe and how far mankind has gone into the future
books,not_removed,the scifi politics adds to the intrigue no
books,not_removed,as others have said all of that gets really easy as you progress and the political element is the very subject of the book the element that herbert handles expertly stick with it and if it still irritates you pages later move on to another book well still love you p
books,not_removed,the politics of dune are one of the key aspects of the book but they can be the hardest pieces to get through if thats not your cup of tea another commenter suggested hitting up the appendix and i would agree with that suggestion dune is an entirely different universe than the one we live in and the language used is meant to both be immersed in on a fantasyscifi level and remind you that this is not modern earth nothing ruins immersion and takes me out of a book like the use of modern slang and terminology it just falls flat and feels fake
books,not_removed,had the exact same experience with dune it was overwhelming and there were so many things making me say wtf that it was hard to actually appreciate the story or even get a clear picture of the characters in my head eg whats a yueh he has a what tattoo wait does he have the colored lips no thats the meh men mentat thu fir oh my god this is just ridiculous if youre not the sort to worry about spoilers in addition to the other suggestions here you could also go on a wikipedia binge click around and read a bit about the different organizations and characters etc and then jump back into the books theyre totally worth it except maybe chapterhouse
books,not_removed,i had the some problem i read three first pages and put the book down times ive never taken who long to read a book and i wont start another until i finish this one but once i actually powered through it its shaping up to be one of the best series ive read pages left
books,not_removed,give up youre clearly not worthy of dune one day maybe for now pick something lighter
books,not_removed,thats the genius of herbert the detail in all things the politics the geography philosophy its not for everyone it got old for me by the third book
books,not_removed,you just have to kinda power through it it falls in place as you go on
books,not_removed,i think your missing the biggest point of the book which is actually about ecological conservation ive read this book probably a dozen times and i dont really get where your coming from with political court intrigue maybe but not political
books,not_removed,i had the same issue when i first started reading it basically you just need to know who is with which house as the story progresses its not an issue now the brothers karamazov on the other hand
books,not_removed,if you think dune is bad on that front try reading john clutes appleseed which i thoroughly enjoyed
books,not_removed,i honestly couldnt read dune but i found it a lot easier to read listening to the audio book
books,not_removed,if you are thrown off by the politics in the first book you might want to stop now because it gets more intricate as the series moves on
books,not_removed,if you care to read the next thousand or so pages you may find the answers you seek
books,not_removed,its almost like different settings and cultures have gasp different vocabulary it would be ridiculous if it was a carbon copy of earth
books,not_removed,its worth sticking with to learn of the interconnectivity of things a lot of the ideas that are brought forth about ecology are probably more relevant now than ever
books,not_removed,its a pain in the ass to get into but once you do its worth it
books,not_removed,moby dick was horrible by the time i got done with it if i never hear about another whale it will be too soon the abridged versions are so much better
books,not_removed,to be fair mody dick is terrible because i say soand i mother fucking love dune
books,not_removed,username checks out
books,not_removed,ive heard dune is game of thrones in space is it true
books,not_removed,is it required i dont feel like flipping through pages all the time on a kindle
books,not_removed,reading is a dying art
books,not_removed,honestly dune is the easiest one of the series too
books,not_removed,op ded
books,not_removed,op here shits deep yo i will save this comment and probably refer to it often
books,not_removed,i had to that with the game of thrones books after i read dune i appreciated them much more
books,not_removed,i had to do that with the foundation by asimov i tried to read it when i was too young i gave it a few years and it sucked me right in
books,not_removed,one of the few books where i lined the movie more and that was due to the difficulty of the lingo
books,not_removed,or anything by irvine welsh
books,not_removed,actually i love aco wrote a paper on it once
books,not_removed,the real genius of the dune saga is that even if youre worried about spoilers you can pretty well skim through at least the opening paragraphs of each groups or persons wiki as any spoilers will be completely incomprehensible until they actually happen
books,not_removed,ah you missed the fourth book then its very nearly as good as the first buti guess mostly for people who really enjoy that kind of thing so you may well not have enjoyed it
books,not_removed,i stopped at the third book too one day i will go back and try again
books,not_removed,god emperor of dune is really where it should have ended and it actually got around to explaining a couple things
books,not_removed,hes pages in i had the same thought when i first read it the saving the world idea doesnt show up till the half of the book
books,not_removed,theres the disney version too its cool
books,not_removed,i prefer the readers digest version of just about everything
books,not_removed,pshh game of thrones wishes
books,not_removed,faceless men got are just face dancers im pretty sure olenna tyrell is a bene gesserit reverend mother and that she has trained margaery about the missionaria protectiva
books,not_removed,its better honestly its written better but it does delve into the politics like game of thrones
books,not_removed,minus all the sex and most of the violence and about of the characters
books,not_removed,kindle may give you definitions if you tap on words i know mine has some dictionary capacity at least
books,not_removed,if your version of dune and kindle has the xray feature you can highlight a name or term and it should give you some help
books,not_removed,as is apparently writing
books,not_removed,too much spice
books,not_removed,my friens and i used to have irvine welsh day where we would try our best to speak using his brand of scottish english we sucked at it ken
books,not_removed,good point
books,not_removed,god emperor is my favorite of the series clash of kings is my favorite of asoiaf i guess its the philosophy and politics in favor of war
books,not_removed,seriously i tried to read chapterhouse but gave up after the first chapter after reading what they were doing to duncan idaho and jessica
books,not_removed,i love you for this xdddd
books,not_removed,here have an upvote
books,not_removed,probably not dune words though
books,not_removed,op failed the gom jabbar
books,not_removed,i think i bullied through but it was so weird to me the best realised characters were paul and leto ii duncan idahos show up in every book and manage to never be interesting i think herbert had bills to pay and a publisher who was demanding dune books or something
books,not_removed,op was not human
books,not_removed,i didnt get as far as the book in the series i just found out recently that the series ended but i can certainly tell you that its the second to last book and every other book in the series depended on what came before it skulduggery pleasant are by no means difficult reads theyre actually very easy i flew through them in elementary school so its not like you will have to go out of your way to do so anyways so in short dont read that book yet ive been considering continuing the series but i know to do so since i remember near nothing about what happened that eve i would have to start over
books,not_removed,if you havent read the first seven youll struggle to understand some of why characters and plotlines matter or make sense its not standalone enough to be read in isolation but you could always read a summary of the first books on wikipedia or something to get up to sorta speed
books,not_removed,probably wont be as enjoyable if you dont know the context behind everything
books,not_removed,i got to the before i stopped its worth the stand alone read as with most series i read the first and then choose if i want to continue
books,not_removed,try the art of racing in the rain by garth stein this is a tale told from a very wellcaredfor dogs point of view i read it several years ago did not and had never owned a dog but it stayed with me few if any books do that
books,not_removed,the river is time eventually each individual will be lumped together into their time period so the things we do in eachs doesnt really matter so we merge together however there are a few people rocks with timelessness who will always be remembered like oh say alexander the great how much of what we know of alexander the great is true their own words written on the bottom and how much is just written on the rocks in the river of time
books,not_removed,terrible quote whoever wrote this piece of work doesnt deserve any attention
books,not_removed,oh wow thats awesome i thought it was something to do abt how little we can impact our life thanks a ton that seems spot on
books,not_removed,ahh you think the book is one of the most beautiful in my opinion i think this quote may not be good without context i suppose
books,not_removed,your comment has less to it than this quote so what does that say about your writing
books,not_removed,i agree i think it was supposed to be profound but it sounded too existential forced
books,not_removed,i have always been surprised that villette by charlotte bronte isnt as popular if not more so than jane eyre
books,not_removed,shantaram gregory david roberts
books,not_removed,mechanique a tale of the circus tresaulti by genevieve valentine is something i always find myself recommending or buying for my friends that love reading i believe its pretty easy to find online in paperback for under as well
books,not_removed,the spud series by john van de ruit its about a teenage boy called john milton no less who wins a scholarship to a prestigious boys private school in south africa the series is set in the early during the release of mandela and the subsequent end of apartheid there are books all of them extremely funny the film adaptations star john cleese and troye sivan and while worth a look they arent as good as the books imo
books,not_removed,my go to response when questions of favourite books comes up is alone in berlin by hans fallada each time i mention it i get a hand full of up votes an maybe a great book or the such but i really couldnt recomend it enough perhaps because it has only recently been translated into english or that the author isnt widely known outside of germany it get overlooked but it is almost a rareity in comparison to other books on the subject matter in that it was written by a author who lived through the nazi regieme based on true events it tells the story of a couple who take to spreading antinazi messages throughout wartime berlin and inevitably become the focus of the gestapo the subject matter and the way in which it is writtentranslated mean it is not the easiest book to read but certainly one of the most rewarding it ties your heart in a knot forcing you to continue reading knowing that with each turn of the page you are a page closer to the end of a story you simultaneously want to end quickly and not at all
books,not_removed,the master and margarita by mikhail bulgakov its an amazing book that seems to never quite get over the hump to fame little big by john crowley is similar harold bloom assigns assigned it at yale but i think it might otherwise have died and thats a real shame its one of the most beautifully written books youll ever read ubik by philip k dick everybody raved about inception and people love the kind of movie where youre trying to find out whats actually true pkd wrote the story they all try to tell decades ago
books,not_removed,shibumi by trevanian its amazing and beautiful and just as relevant today as it was when he wrote it
books,not_removed,speaking of hesse ive read almost all of them too and the glass bead game is tops for me to your queryim surprised charles pallisers london legal mystery the quincunx isnt better known
books,not_removed,the littlest cho cho who went to market and saved the world
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,a lot of classic contemporary japanese literature is lost to the western world its too bad because japan produced some excellent literature back in the enlightenment period
books,not_removed,dreamsnake by vonda n mcintyre won the hugo nebula and locus awards in and one of my alltime favourites had some groundbreaking things in there about sexuality genetics understanding other cultures polygamy child abuse and the role of medical practitioners in society now out of print
books,not_removed,the monsieur lecoq mysteries they are a precursor to sherlock holmes
books,not_removed,i have always loved the thief of always by clive barker my friends mom gave it to me years ago as a prize for trading in my halloween candy totally worth it the opening line is one of my favorites and i am terrible at remembering literary quotes the book is short and starts off the great gray beast february had swallowed harvey swick alive i dont want to give too much away because part of the joy was reading it without knowing anything about it if you need a quick read or enjoy fantasy set in our world i think this is good for that basically this kid harvey stumbles upon this house and its inhabitants are quite interesting mysterious and it goes from there
books,not_removed,marius the epicurean by walter pater but its only going to appeal to a very small niche those familiar with hellenistic philosophies aesthetics early christianity and ancient rome it requires a ridiculously high level of reading comprehension and wide knowledge of ancient literature to really get the most out of it not that i possess these things in any remarkable degree but what i did get out of it made for quite a special reading experience
books,not_removed,the dortmunder novels by donald e westlake they are hilarious original and not very well known
books,not_removed,heros die first entry inmatthews stovers dystopian scifi series the acts of caine go read that if you want a look at where vr will take our society
books,not_removed,im not sure if its known outside of canada the orenda by joseph boyden is fantastic
books,not_removed,i have yet to see someone mention jamrachs menagerie on reddit its a shame its wonderful so much more than the blurb suggests
books,not_removed,house of the scorpion
books,not_removed,the third policeman isnt mentioned enough for my liking
books,not_removed,good omens by terry pratchett and neil gaiman it seems oft overlooked when compared to their individual works but in my opinion it takes the best parts of both of them and wraps them up together
books,not_removed,the ashfall series was soooo good in my opinion my top are the inheritance cycle harry potter series ashfall series the immortals by paul stewart was a really good read too
books,not_removed,the broken empire trilogy by mark lawrence such a wild ride but not for the faint of heart if you take issue with a bandit prince doing what bandit princes do
books,not_removed,the way the crow flies by annmarie macdonald it has a murder mystery cold war and so much more its ridiculously well written and clever readers book i cant recommend it highly enough
books,not_removed,the girl you lost by kathryn croft its a good gripping psychological thriller
books,not_removed,the ground beneath her feet by salmun rushdie its my favorite of his but i rarely see it talked about i has a pretty massive scope charting the characters lives across continents and through time through an alternate history of rock and roll plus parallel dimensions earthquakes tequila tsunamis all of this with rushdie waxing at his high poetic best
books,not_removed,american gods by neil gaiman i havent heard a lot of people talking about it but its one of my personal favourites
books,not_removed,this and the private memoirs and confessions of a justified sinner by james hogg just right for halloween
books,not_removed,the first pages of that was some of the best stuff ive ever read the story was interesting but really it was the characters and setting that i love most ive never been to india but it made me feel like i had really experienced personally i hated the last couple hundred pages though also hated all the pseudointellectual ramblings mostly by karla really of his foreign friends were just ridiculous and by the end of the book the narrator is too i know it was his first novel but the writing just jumped around so much in terms of quality some lines were so awful im not sure how they made it through editing
books,not_removed,oh i own that buy ive never got around to reading it i know what im reaching for next
books,not_removed,read these as a young teen now really loved them especially since im south african
books,not_removed,couldnt agree more one of my favourite books
books,not_removed,the master and margarita by mikhail bulgakov its an amazing book that seems to never quite get over the hump to fame well it is quite popular in russia obviously to the point of overhype if you ask me
books,not_removed,as for master and margarita what translation would you suggest i found out with crime and punishment that translation can really make or break me and i dont want to get turned off of this one for the wrong reasons
books,not_removed,its a terrific book never had the guts to try the delight of the razor
books,not_removed,my dad gave that book to me and it have been sitting on my bookshelf for a while can you convince me to read it why is it good
books,not_removed,so this exciting you and i have exactly inverse opinions here ive also read most of hesse but glass bead game was my least favorite and i could barely make it through the quincunx
books,not_removed,the japanese enlightenment would be the period following the meiji restoration so like roughly this is by no means contemporary
books,not_removed,this is the only book ive read by either of them and i was really underwhelmed was there something i just didnt get by not being familiar with their larger bodies of work it struck me as trying way too hard to be funny
books,not_removed,books that arent universally known harry potter and inheritance i want to know in which world you live sir because its very different from mine
books,not_removed,this series in mentioned pretty often in lists of popular current fantasy
books,not_removed,love this book honestly not as much as i loved fall on your knees but knowing about the real case it was based on made it cut deep
books,not_removed,i think that its pretty wellknown the tv series based on it will be out next year
books,not_removed,glad someone else has finally heard of it
books,not_removed,ok so first off the bat its beautifully written filled with incredibly vivid imagery and although its definitely not a funny book there are parts that made me laugh out loud mostly lecagot even though it was written in the villain mother company is just as relevant today as it ever was possibly even more so theres a ton of really interesting history woven in and nicolai hel makes james bond look like the activities director on a cruise ship
books,not_removed,so near and yet so far funny steppenwolf and the magic theater was a revelation for me demian and beneath the wheel were slimmer lighter faves and i always thought narcissus and goldmund was overrated yet were both in the box as it were
books,not_removed,yes it is the first contemporary japanese novel is ukigumo by futabatei shimei written in its claim to fame is literally that its the first contemporary japanese novel
books,not_removed,nope i dont think so many people dont like it because of the heavy handed sarcasm that is a core component though as far as im concerned the sarcasm fully comes from both authors but the comedy definitely leans pratchett most discworld books are very well liked for exactly that sort of comedic writing
books,not_removed,i said the ashfall series i was just listing my top and used harry potterinheritance cycle to compare to ashfall because i know everybody knows how amazing they are so by me personally putting the ashfall series in close behind these amazing series it implies how good i think the series of ashfall is
books,not_removed,and probably suck üòî
books,not_removed,yes in fact i am dont get me wrong i liked it better than any other piece of bulgakovs writing and consider it a good book but here in russia you can expect to hear my favorite book is master and margarita from about a half of reading girls and women and quite often a person who claims that it is her favorite book cant name any second best book worth reading it may sound rather snobbish and maybe even a bit sexist but i suppose you know a couple of titles with similar quality often mentioned as my favorite book among the reading people of us of any gender
books,not_removed,sweet i think im going finally read that after im done with current book im reading
books,not_removed,whaaaat narcissus and goldmund is my favorite of his books i guess youre just my literary antimatter and i am yours
books,not_removed,i dont think you understand the definition of contemporary contemporary means living at the same time as as in present day authors who are actively writing at the very least nearly any definition of contemporary literature would mean post world war youre mentioning works from years ago by no definition is that contemporary youre also not crediting your own example correctly because as ive said you dont know what contemporary means the drifting cloud is often credited as the first modern japanese novel modern and contemporary are not the same thing his novel is credited as such because he was a modernist writer whose novel differed from the format of other japanese novels written during the tokugawa era
books,not_removed,well considering that the book sucks yeah an adaption of it will probably suck too
books,not_removed,and the topposters favorite too cant go so far as literary antimatter though maybe hesse antimatter which is something quite different were like beatles fankids arguing about the best albums theyre all good im not urging the superiority of the dave clark five
books,not_removed,i would start i have no idea which if any are the edition and all seem to have twopart titles eg europe since so i dont know which edition you need ignore amazon results they are problematic and info generally scant most of the dealers i linked are legit and you can contact them to ask questions scroll down for lower prices
books,not_removed,thank you that really helped my search
books,not_removed,the writing is very good it manages to be irreverent and profound at the right moments all while being written in spanglish the perspective is unique and manages to shine a light on some stories that are not explored that often we get stories about nerds about immigration about minorities but rarely all three at once the way the story blends the personal with the political from a purely personal perspective this was a big one because when i read the book i had never heard of trujillo or about his regime and that was a big shock to me as someone who thought he had a handle on century geopolitical history
books,not_removed,these types of questions annoy the fuck out of me i personally dont like this book so it is completely inconceivable to me that others could feel differently its really fucking arrogant everybody has certain books which are incredibly popular that they cant get into for one reason or another its not that big a deal
books,not_removed,i loved it im married to a puerto rican lady so i can relate to alot of stuff in it it was well written engaging and i finished it within a few days i have another book of his to read
books,not_removed,its interesting because i personally did not like it either i thought it was dry and i hated the footnote style luckily i didnt hold it against him too much because i read and loved drown by junot diaz
books,not_removed,the slang the use of different themes its just brilliant all around for me no other writer wrote that way and at the time it blew me away because he was speaking to me in a much different way than anyone else
books,not_removed,i found the book to be amazing because it made me both laugh and cry unlike any other book has
books,not_removed,i found the book to be amazing because it made me both laugh and cry unlike any other book has
books,not_removed,honestly i couldnt get into the book at all im guessing there are a lot of cultural things which i dont get because i dont live anywhere close to mexico
books,not_removed,thank you for your legitimate response
books,not_removed,its not that i dont like it i dont understand why its been given so much praise
books,not_removed,sure but its not only that the book has won awards many consider it to be the best novel of the century that praise cant merely be based off the author being anamolous the work should be excellent and i cant figure out why
books,not_removed,i wouldnt expect somebody who doesnt know the difference between the dominican republic and mexico to be able to get into this book either
books,not_removed,why is dune given so much praise i find that book boring af
books,not_removed,because opinions theres nothing more complicated to it than that
books,not_removed,i spit coffee out nose bravo
books,not_removed,see im trying to figure out why so many people hold the same opinion that of it being praiseworthy
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,unpopular opinion time anyone else find seinfeld painfully unfunny i dont get what is meant by saying its about nothing ive watched quite a few episodes and it just seems like the kind of standard observational comedy thats been around forever my issue with the program isnt so much that people find it funny that would be ridiculous since everybodys taste is subjective i just dont see how its attained such revolutionary status again im not going allout to slander seinfeld id just be interested to hear why people find it so appealing
books,not_removed,i think it is way different than the comedies being shown in tv in those times it really didnt follow the conventional comedy path that the others took the show revolved around four self centred jerks and their first world problems it was hilarious how they nit picked the very minute details of society and created the whole episode on that when you watch something like friends or everybody loves raymond you want to be their part of lives but in seinfeld there was no emotional connect to those characters we were just happy to laugh at those goofy characters and just pray we dont meet someone like them in our life i felt it was unorthodox and way ahead of its time
books,not_removed,if youre younger one of the reasons it may seem unoriginal is that so many sitcoms later copied it so shamelessly the same reason readers of brave new world are sometimes underwhelmed
books,not_removed,well look at the positive side at least it aint a deer tick
books,not_removed,are you looking for advice on how to get rid of them to warn other people about them and point them towards helpful resources please make a new self post that makes your point clearer
books,not_removed,rhomeworkhelp would be a more appropriate place for your question please read their rules before posting
books,not_removed,yes of course sorry
books,not_removed,good luck getting a feature added on goodreads but yeah i agree with you that having a dnf rating would balance out the statistics somewhat for now i just focus on books that got over stars and that seems to weed out the worst
books,not_removed,if a book is so bad i couldnt even be bothered to finish it to me that is exactly what a one star rating is for i reserve one star ratings for these books with the occasional exception for books i finished because they were very short i also have a custom abandoned shelf but the idea that i shouldnt rate a book if i didnt finish it makes no sense to me if a product was so awful you had to return it youd give it a one star rating so why not with a book you hated so much you didnt finish it
books,not_removed,i made an abandoned shelf just for those books and i never give them a star rating
books,not_removed,i agree but i have just made my own shelf and i dont rate the books
books,not_removed,you can add shelves in goodreads just add a dnf shelf
books,not_removed,theres been a number that i ended up deleting all together because i didnt finish them and felt awful about giving the author a really bad review üò¶
books,not_removed,you can make an exclusive shelf on goodreads for this purpose
books,not_removed,i went into a reading rut a while ago college is hectic and i have books shelved as currentlyreading because to be honest i abandoned them so yeah i think dnf would be a good option and it would also be a great indicator of how many people left a book halfway through
books,not_removed,i do think theres value in a dnf tag but there us also a large difference between enjoyed but couldnt finish before i had to return to library and got halfway through stopped because i couldnt bear it any more one is clearly worthy of star whereas the other is in incomplete grade
books,not_removed,it would be amazing i have started quite a few books that ultimately played out as total pieces of shit mid way through a book and i hurl it across my deck is a good indication to me that it sucks
books,not_removed,goodreads needs this but they also need to screen or block early reviews before even an arc copy is available
books,not_removed,i think it would be great to have that including a few standard reasons for not finishing not finishing a book doesnt always mean its bad maybe you though it was a then you started it and found it of quality and decided to start another one you think is instead of finishing the
books,not_removed,i have a didnt finish bookshelf but i agree it would be nice i will say that litsy does have a bail option for rating books to indicate books youve given up on another reason im loving litsy so much lately
books,not_removed,id like a dnf rating but id be more keen to see a star option the feature id most like to see though is one that weights your rating of a given book against your average rating over all books this would go a long way to correcting the effect on the aggregate of people who only use the top and bottom options or gush over shit upon everything more or less equally
books,not_removed,i made a shelf for my didnt finish books but id prefer if they had a separate star rating for it
books,not_removed,absolutely there arent may books that i dont finish but i think thats an important metric to capture
books,not_removed,i dont believe this is a bad idea but in my experience especially with fiction books they tend to get dull midway through and then pick up again people might put bad reviews because of this not the case with all books though
books,not_removed,most definitely i tend to give books pages before setting them aside lifes too short and have amassed an impressive little unfinished pile
books,not_removed,there plenty of books i really liked but didnt finish i think the star spectrum is a bit misleading and a reader tends to have a very complex connection with a book whether they liked it or not
books,not_removed,yes i do think the options should be more diverse didnt finish isnt the same as flung it away but i guess if there has to be one option that will do acknowledging a book was attempted but not completed is useful
books,not_removed,i would love it if they added that shelf
books,not_removed,i have a never finished list on goodreads
books,not_removed,i dont know if im on board with a person rating a book before finishing it but i definitely think a dnf meter would be interesting so in addition to the ive finished this book you could have im throwing in the towel and then have a metric saying n of people who have attempted it have finished the book
books,not_removed,yes i would love that there are so many books i just couldnt finish i think that would be good for people to know
books,not_removed,i think this is a fantastic idea i already have a bookshelf labeled couldnt finish because boring something like that its been cathartic to add books that didnt go anywhere were confusing or just dredged on forever it would also make great market research for publishers since they can see how many people purchase books but there is very little research outside of tightlipped amazon who can track the start and stop point in ebooks about how far people actually read into books there is some research but this would help to expand that and to study why a book works or not
books,not_removed,i have different categories for books i did not finish and books i did not like a book i didnt finish gets added to a dnf shelf so i can go back and try it again at a later date versus a book that was just not to my taste i go through phases where a slow burn book might just not be for me at the moment but could be enjoyable when my mood changes
books,not_removed,seems like a good idea if only to avoid skewing of the book rating by those who decided to just give one star and a didnt finish review
books,not_removed,i completely agree with you there has been books that i have started and they were just too terrible or just not interesting enough to finish i never know where to place the book because i didnt finish it so its not exactly read i dont want to read it again but i have attempted it i never thought of making my own shelf for doing that
books,not_removed,if i dont like a book to the point where i dont want to finish it it automatically gets a one star rating from me
books,not_removed,i get around this limitation by having a book list labeled abandoned i first remove the book from my shelves then specifically mark it as abandoned the book is considered read but without a date or rating and i have a handy list of things ive abandoned but am not ready to add to dated read counts and do not feel ready to rate yet
books,not_removed,i have a never going to finish shelf
books,not_removed,absolutely they should
books,not_removed,i have a dnf shelf thats mutually exlcusive to the other main shelves read to read currently reading and ive seen other people do the same that works for me ill also say i do rank a book if i finish enough of it and sometimes the reason i dont finish a book isnt because it isnt good
books,not_removed,thats what i use the rating if a book is so shitty that i cant even finish it then its a same way with movies generally speaking though considering the flood of books available theres no reason to ever dip down below rated books unless you really like the author or really like the series or what have you
books,not_removed,about the only reason i can think of for not finishing a book is that i wasnt enjoying it in that case id just rate it as a
books,not_removed,no way there have been a few books that ive began reading only to put down vowing to never finish because of different reasons then maybe years later pick it up and try again only to fall in love with it the girl with the dragon tattoo did that to me took me three attempts but some books have to click with you at a certain time in your life
books,not_removed,id be surprised if most reviewers who hated a book so much they didnt finish it didnt just rate it anyway but i do think a flag on the rating that lets you include exclude or solely view didnt finish flagged reviews would probably be helpful if it simply took the place of star ratings then anyone who didnt finish who chose to give a star rating would be viewed as unfairly influencing the overall rating balance still overall good idea and good luck
books,not_removed,no it should not have this feature like facebook dont have dislike feature how can you even rate the book until you are not finished
books,not_removed,why not just have an i quit button with everything in life suck it up
books,not_removed,i think that might be counterproductive a lot of people seem to rate the books less for arbitrary reasons and you might miss out on some good ones many of the classics for example are less than stars
books,not_removed,its a shame that the site is not better maintained its usefulness to me and i suspect a huge number of other people would be greatly increased if there was a way to filter out certain genres goodreads userbase is heavily weighted towards all young adult books especially paranormal romance it makes almost all popular lists in there useless to someone that has little interest in that particular genre
books,not_removed,just because i didnt finish a book it doesnt mean it was necessarily bad just not for me i understand why people liked perdido street station for instance but i found it way too difficult to get into its definitely not a star book it just wasnt for me
books,not_removed,i do exactly the same star so bad i couldnt finish it stars finished it but it sucked stars meh liked it would recommend it loved it so much id own it in my library andor reread it
books,not_removed,seems unfair and deceptive to others using your rating if you gave up after pages in a page book you read less than of the book the second half might be much better and deserve more than star this is different from finishing a page book and knowing it was terrible all together
books,not_removed,the idea that i shouldnt rate a book if i didnt finish it makes no sense to me if a product was so awful you had to return it youd give it a one star rating so why not with a book you hated so much you didnt finish it because i havent experienced it yet would you rate a book that you are enjoying but havent finished what if something happens near the end that completely ruins it or changes your opinion in some way this happens all the time books unlike products to be returned are a linear medium if i havent finished a book i dont have the proper linear context to decide for other people whether its good or not i may have enough information about it that i can make a decision for myself whether i should continue or not but my opinion wouldnt be informed enough to be of any value to others assuming that my less informed opinion is as valuable to the public as someones who is much more informed than mine feels like the ultimate in vanity to me rating something for others to seebase their decisions on is sharing an opinion everyone is entitled to their informed opinion if i have an uninformed opinion ie havent finished a book movie any linear experience i keep it to myself otherwise i would be contributing to the propagation of bullshit
books,not_removed,ive given up on books that i would consider good just not my thing im sure there are some pretty good romance novels out there within the context of romance novels but since i have no desire to read the genre i dont think it would be fair or accurate for me to automatically give them ratings just because im not into that genre i would however give a rating to a book that i consider objectively bad where no amount of context could justify how bad it is
books,not_removed,maybe you though it was a then you started it and found it of quality and decided to start another one you think is instead of finishing the
books,not_removed,a movie that disgusts you so you walk away in minutes do you deserve to rate that
books,not_removed,mine is called at least i tried
books,not_removed,i have an i give up shelf for books i cant finish but i still rate them sometimes theyre good in many respects but im just not into it for whatever reason
books,not_removed,i tried this but then i noticed they were giving me recommendations based on those books which sucks because i usually hated those books
books,not_removed,this is what i did
books,not_removed,i agree with this and thats where the narrative comes in when i use my never finished shelf i try to put a note as to why in the review section it could be i can see why some people like this book its just not the right time for me to poorly written and too many typos to really enjoy it so far but ive got five others going right now and its my sixth favorite or whatever just going by star ratings doesnt help me in general because the stars mean different things to different people the reviews give a much better indication of peoples experience
books,not_removed,if it simply took the place of star ratings then anyone who didnt finish who chose to give a star rating would be viewed as unfairly influencing the overall rating balance you could just as easily say that people who finished unfairly balance the ratings if a book is so bad you didnt even finish it it deserves a one star rating if enough people didnt finish to significantly change the rating the chances are its just not a good book
books,not_removed,i dont think that it should affect the overall rating but when looking at books seeing a separate statistic thats says a specific number or percent didnt finish would be helpful
books,not_removed,realistically why would anyone actually want to finish a book they think is star bad to me a star rating should be for books that are so awful that i couldnt bring myself to finish them
books,not_removed,in fairness a lot of classics are actually pretty awful by common modern sensibilities imo an out of five stars averaged across all ratings value like goodreads uses is really not a good way to evaluate matters that are strongly subjective like taste in books lots of books are really good for particular types of person and are dreadful when read by people outside that demographic i cant stand but i loved i can easily imagine a person whose tastes on the matter are reversed however and theres nothing wrong with that average our ratings and both books get stars which isnt a useful rating to either of us goodreads has the right idea with their profilebased recommendations id like to see them work on that some more
books,not_removed,i read classics for the sake of reading classics but if someone recommends a bookauthor i know nothing about then stars is the best way for me to judge whether or not i will like the book
books,not_removed,agreed i base my decision on reviews not just yep it was good or this book was shit but rather properly argued and thought out reviews if you read some from either end of the spectrum they can be skewed or if a negative reviewer had an issue with something i really quite like in a book ill consider it and vice versa
books,not_removed,my guess is that the back end of the site is lots and lots of spaghetti code so amazon does not want to risk adding new features for fear of breaking everything if i was amazon i would get a team of people to build something from scratch and eventually port people over to it this way you know it will be prepared for the future
books,not_removed,i use popular lists limited to my genre of choice so like hugo awards list or print sf most recommended list gr is the last place i go for recommendations too much hype from the fan base
books,not_removed,i do feel that goodreads encourages you to rate according to how much you liked a book rather than how good it was though and that is how i use it and assume others have used it when i look at a books rating
books,not_removed,i think this is how most people on goodreads rate the books they read but its not how goodreads put the ratings they say is amazing is really liked it is liked it is it was ok and is didnt like it that means most of the books i read are or very rarely can i say a book is amazing i feel guilty not giving out star reviews because most people seem to hand them out freely but i stick to the goodreads categories books i really dont like i either dont rate at all or i put in my custom exclusive shelf dnf if i dont finish them ps even if i happened to get the goodreads descriptions wrong my point stands i feel i see most gr users giving the stars their own names just as you do hpeet which is fine but it means anyone who does use the gr categories probably rate lower than other people even for things that are enjoyed equally as well if that makes sense i think that having half stars would help this a lot
books,not_removed,if it takes pages for a book to get good maybe it does deserve a one star rating
books,not_removed,i typically dont give up so soon to be fair about a quarter of the way through is usually enough to get a good idea of the authors style the main plot the characters and the major themes if theres nothing there to interest me at all then yes i feel ive given it enough chance for a low rating especially on a platform like goodreads which encourages you to rate according to what you liked not what you thought was good
books,not_removed,for myself a book has to be pretty damn awful for me to give up on it if the beginning is so bad i can find no redeeming features to make me want to read past halfway the book overall is not good i give otherwise good books with poor endings a low rating so i feel its fair for me to give books with poor beginnings low ratings too
books,not_removed,would you rate a book that you are enjoying but havent finished its not so much about how much of the book of read but rather if you have intentions to continue it or not if im enjoying a book my experience is not over yet im gonna keep reading it till the end but if its one im really not enjoying then im gonna stop reading it and call that the end of my experience with it with this logic in mind i think its totally fair to rate that way you dont need to eat a whole can of rotten food to know its rotten and that others shouldnt eat it
books,not_removed,i think it depends on what you think goodreads ratings are for gr presents itself primarily as a social and recommendations site and in that context i think rating by how much i liked it is appropriate the descriptions of the ratings even encourage this in another context i might rate higher or lower based on other qualities of the book there are equally books i rate highly even though the writing isnt great just because i had a lot of fun reading them
books,not_removed,yes
books,not_removed,ditto abandoned
books,not_removed,i have a separate shelf for that called not my style and i dont rate them because i think its unfair that i didnt rate the whole thing if i dont finish a book there is so much that i dont get such as the plot and character development and i just dont think its right and when i see a review on goodreads where someone gives a dnf book stars or something it doesnt make any sense to me how could you give a book that you didnt finish stars
books,not_removed,i just added a gaveupon shelf and it appears that you can select or deselect which shelves are included in recommendations by unchecking the box rec you might have been getting the recommendations because its automatically checked when you add a new shelf
books,not_removed,youll get recommendations for each of your shelves even if everything on the shelf has a low rating
books,not_removed,you can turn off the recommendation for any individual shelf
books,not_removed,youre looking for an argument find it elsewhere or read what i said more carefully
books,not_removed,great thanks
books,not_removed,i agree that they might be awful by modern sensibilities and a threestar minimum might be too low i simply meant to point out that a lot of books but since ive read a few classics ive noticed this trend have ratings of less than stars and op might miss out on some if they just read books that have personally my limit is stars
books,not_removed,no but its good for user ratings in the same way that imdb is
books,not_removed,im not really a fan of ratings anyway i use goodreads more to track what ive read than to rate books this year so far so on track for my goal
books,not_removed,youre also not obligated to rate every book you come across if you finish a book only so you can rate it then yes that is a waste of life but why not just stop reading and not rate it
books,not_removed,i guess if you think means engaging from start to finish plenty of books are a slow burn or are written to where the beginning doesnt pay off until much later in the story
books,not_removed,totally it would be awesome if there was a dnf rating that was external from the data used to create the average
books,not_removed,are included in recommendations by unchecking the box rec i never knew this thanks course i tend to be a bit taghappy on goodreads so im possibly defeating the purpose of this by only doing it to a few categories
books,not_removed,thats pretty much how i use it to track what i read and what i thought of it i dont really look at what anybody else is reading ive not read much over the last couple of months any standout books over the year ive heard a lot about jonathan strange and mr norrel any thoughts on it so far
books,not_removed,wow nice ive only done so far this year
books,not_removed,song of solomon by toni morrison is an amazing example of this for the first pages its pretty dull it gets a little more interesting but it doesnt get good until the last pages where theres not very many things to pick up the first time through it has an amazing reread value
books,not_removed,i couldnt get into it to be honest ive picked it up twice now and just couldnt get into it its nice to see a different style its sort of written like a piece of academia with notations and so on but i couldnt finish it so cant recommend it one way or the other has a lot of praise from everyone else though
books,not_removed,its seems to be one of those kinds of books people either really like it or just cant get there one to pick up secondhand or borrow from the library it seems
books,not_removed,i remember reading future shock as a young adult in the early much of what he envisioned was already coming true to me the most interesting aspect was his vision for enclaves of the past where people could go to experience what life was like in the past and enclaves of the future we definitely have the former in the form of many historical museums im not so sure we have the latter because it turns out we are really not good at predicting the future
books,not_removed,i really need to revisit this book like you i encountered it as a younger person i think that having seen the internets inception and growth over the years may bring new perspective to tofflers argument
books,not_removed,ahhhh im new here thanks
books,not_removed,i read on kindle so i just tap and hold the word and a definition pops up
books,not_removed,id always use the context
books,not_removed,i usually look it up as soon as i come across it but i dont normally write it down i used to google words but then i downloaded a dictionary app on my phone and it makes it a lot faster so i can get back to reading
books,not_removed,i guess the meaning from the context i might later look it up if i remember
books,not_removed,i keep an excel sheet on my phone columns are for the word type and definition then sometimes in a sentence or fragment when adding words ill look back and if im comfortable with older entries i delete them off last one i added was bonhomie
books,not_removed,i look em up
books,not_removed,either mark them to look up later or look them up at the time i encounter them
books,not_removed,i like rules so ive made one about this exact thing the first time i encounter a new word i define it with context the second time i see it if i am at all unclear as to what it means i look it up works well for me
books,not_removed,write them down look them up then promptly forget them rinse repeat
books,not_removed,i try to figure the meaning out using context but if i cannot then i write it down and look it up later on
books,not_removed,i rarely stop to look anything up mainly learning new words by context ever had that experience where you find yourself saying a word and as soon as it comes out of your mouth you are sure you have never said that word before in your life thats how i know it works i have looked things up when that happens to make sure that what i said or wrote means what i think it does
books,not_removed,i look at the context and if the meaning still isnt clear i look it up
books,not_removed,i just guess based on context most of the time if im reading an ebook and i really want to know what a word means i use the inbuilt dictionary
books,not_removed,i look it up then and there phones are great
books,not_removed,there used to be a time when i couldnt keep reading i just had to look up the words in a dictionary but i was then that kind of ocd has subsided now but maybe because i have merriam webster on my phone now
books,not_removed,sometimes i keep reading eventually if i read a word often enough the context makes the definition clear for me other times i look up the merriam webster definition on google
books,not_removed,my rule of thumb is to try figuring out the meaning of the wordphrase from the context since pausing my reading and looking it up breaks the immersion and then to look it up later on to confirm whether i was correct i have noticed that doing so helps me better retain the wordphrase and its meaning in my memory i tend to forget the ones that i straightaway put through a quick google search or my phones dictionary app in case im totally clueless despite considering the context and if understanding the wordphrase is necessary to get the bigger picture then pausing and looking up the meaning of the wordphrase is the last resort
books,not_removed,either use the context and keep it in mind to look up later or immediately look it up on my phone
books,not_removed,if i cant figure it out based on context then ill look it up if im reading an ebook then i usually look it up right away because i have the capability to highlight and get a definition
books,not_removed,context and write it down then i can search it later
books,not_removed,i misread words as worlds and i was excited to read the comments that being said i tend to use context and move on
books,not_removed,some of the time im confident of the meaning through context often though while this gives a good general meaning it doesnt help with why this particular word is better than a similar word thats when i look it up in a dictionary
books,not_removed,after losing my gen kindle i just bought a paperwhite and im loving this feature its also nice for getting information about a characterperson is if ive forgotten who they are
books,not_removed,this is such a lovely feature i dont use it too often unless im reading something by china mieville and then i use it twice per page
books,not_removed,had to do that a lot with asoiaf
books,not_removed,how do you memorize it
books,not_removed,google can be pretty quick too if you use voice search mic button and then say define word it usually reads out the meaning too if someone uses the ok google keyword on an android phone where it is activated then its even faster
books,not_removed,which app do you use
books,not_removed,came here to say this usually its pretty easy to suss out the meaning of a word through context if its particularly vexing ill turn to a quick internet search
books,not_removed,this is what i do as well even though im not native english
books,not_removed,im reading on paper white too and i love the inbuilt dictionary in which i can just tap the word that im unfamiliar with
books,not_removed,but that disappointment when its a book that doesnt support the feature though wait whos this again taps name obscure translation from foreign language pops up
books,not_removed,the app i use saves the words i look up so i can go back to them to see but every now and then ill go ahead and write the definitions in the margins i know marking books isnt for everybody so if anything you could always keep a small notebook of words and their definitions and that would probably help you memorize it
books,not_removed,merriamwebster
books,not_removed,thats when you hit search then this book and each occurrence of that characters name will pop up not as slick as xray but itll do in a pinch
books,not_removed,i do the same thing merriamwebster app saves the words so you can review them later
books,not_removed,i know how youre feeling i felt the same way when i finished the series a few years ago truth is it was the last story i read that had me absolutely riveted
books,not_removed,well shit i dont know if i should immediately read these books or avoid them forever
books,not_removed,i finished a series a few weeks ago and felt a similar feeling to fill the void without commitment to a new series to properly grieve i turned to books i had read before that i loved which led me on a path to read more books by that author and down the rabbit hole i went

books,not_removed,its different like other postmodern works but i really enjoyed it a postmodern classic in my view highly recommend it
books,not_removed,the tao of pooh is a good one edit doesnt necessarily fit what you are looking for its more of a personal philosophy
books,not_removed,please post recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or the weekly thread
books,not_removed,please use rsuggestmeabook for all future requests lord of the flies is indeed great cant recommend it enough see username something that made me think different mainly about myself and the way i set goals for myself and how i reach them was an astronauts guide to life on earth
books,not_removed,definitely i love the feel and smell of a real book and the convenience of ebooks if im in bed i use my kindle cuz i can have all the lights off ready to konk out when im through reading if im in the light of day and upright its real books some things cannot be tackled via ebook like infinite jest i tried it and it was a million times more confusing than it is naturally
books,not_removed,im completely indifferent as to whether i read a physical or an ebook equally happy with both
books,not_removed,this subject has been very popular in the past please use reddit search andor check the rbookswikifaq
books,not_removed,it probably dipped literally just because the harry potter series is over now
books,not_removed,ill admit growing up in a house that strictly limited tvgame time strongly helped to cause my love of reading
books,not_removed,only thats still a lot of children missing out
books,not_removed,school has forever destroyed my joy for reading books edit i have been meaning to get into dune but can never find enough time been reading the backstory about how someone wanted to terraform the desert planet and its culture ino a green paradise
books,not_removed,has the percentage of young liars increased by any chance
books,not_removed,thats quite the age range not veery statistically telling with the difference between ages in that range being so large is it mostly the year olds that are reading my gut instinct tells me that it probably is the younger kinds and the older one particularly the boys are playing more video games granted this is from personal experience just seems odd to me if im being honest
books,not_removed,read to your kids folks my parents read to me and now i read to my son its the best way imo
books,not_removed,the number would be higher if schools gave students something interesting to read i dont know a single person that came out of my english class having enjoyed wuthering heights there is no way that book didnt put some of my class mates off of books
books,not_removed,say and do are two completely different things there are a ton of seven year olds who will answer yes if an adult asks them if they like to read for fun whether they do or not
books,not_removed,that seems a bit high id like to know where theyre getting data from i graduated two years ago and im not even sure all my classmates can read let alone read for fun
books,not_removed,the study is from scholastic a company that sells books of course theyre going to report to parents that children like reading for fun
books,not_removed,im in my twenties and i have always loved reading i always encourage people friends family to read anything possible
books,not_removed,btw you go visit a survey website which pays you money to do survey ayyy free advertisement up vote this so more people can know
books,not_removed,i wonder how much the younger bracket reads for fun i feel like school and forced readings hurts young students desire to read
books,not_removed,i used to read for fun and the internet ruined it for me and gave me add i cant go five minutes now without having to watch a fucking video or look something up online i promise the add rise is linked to the internet
books,not_removed,there should be a website or app that lets you input movies video games hobbies or other books you enjoy and then it gives you recommended books to read and as you like and dislike the recommendations it will adjust to your user profile this would help firsttime readers find a suitable book that fits them and also help longtime readers like me find new books edit the app could also give you a snippet from the back cover or maybe the first few pages or something as your flipping through the selection
books,not_removed,i read quite a lot up until the summer going into my first year of high school and once i received my assignment of books of mandatory reading over summer i lost the love
books,not_removed,so in holy shit thats
books,not_removed,reading is just nice as hell
books,not_removed,the other clearly never came near pterry pratchett such a shame
books,not_removed,wonder how big this percentage is among fox audience
books,not_removed,this article was really light on details i mean how do they define read does reading the newspaper count do comics count does the fact that youre reading my comment on reddit count does reading playboy count actually this leads to perhaps a bigger thought question what is the end goal of reading anyways most of us here would encourage reading but why do we encourage it because we believe it promotes literacy skills because it promotes spatial and abstract thinking or just because it is a fun hobby in which case does it matter what kind of reading one is doing
books,not_removed,literally all i do is read i read reddit other forums adult novels and comic books like calvin and hobbes reading is the best
books,not_removed,i used to love reading as a child i still love it as an adult reading is essential to life
books,not_removed,so much of this depends on upbringing while its easy to say well technology is everywhere and you cant hide your kids from it you the parent control what is and isnt available in the house its not like the kidsll explode if they play the wicked cool game systems at their friends place but the majority of the time its your domicile and whats there is whats there you set the tone as it were
books,not_removed,yes out of is thanks for reiterating the point ill give them a pass because theyre book worms and not mathematicians
books,not_removed,honestly i find no fun in reading i just dont understand whats so great about it i much prefer other activities or running around outside then interpreting black figures on paper
books,not_removed,i k p please pp pl like l lots people l
books,not_removed,id love to i just cant really integrate it in my life right now yo and i play a moderate amount of video games pretty much all of my free time i dont have much free time
books,not_removed,reading books because school is making us is as boring as it gets usually but when it comes to reading for fun you get to choose what u want and like to read
books,not_removed,does technology help aid this stat with ebooks being available or are they just talking about hard copied books i probably still wouldnt have read but its interesting to think about kind of
books,not_removed,years out of high school i am trying to pick reading back up again now my attention span has definitely shortened though
books,not_removed,i wonder if they counted audiobooks as reading
books,not_removed,and when they hit collegethey become stupid
books,not_removed,honestly i would hope that reading didnt depend on books being good besides there are tons of other books that are great reads
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,i was having that as well and not having many friends living so far away from everyone really helped for me i was reading so much as a child and im really happy that i did
books,not_removed,my love of books came from long car trips to our family cottage we had a portable dvd player but the rule was we could only use it after dark so we read
books,not_removed,while that is true there is so much competition from gaming systems phones tablet tvs and other instant gratification machines that im almost surprised that it isnt lower
books,not_removed,i didnt really enjoy reading until i hit i was one of those gotta keep doing well in school types and never really felt like i had the time to sit down and read now im taking it easy and reading a lot more than i ever have its a shame my teachers always asked bs questions and assigned marks for reading in high school it made the whole experience of reading stressful where i had to read the next chapter even when i didnt feel like it at the time
books,not_removed,this number seems surprisingly high to me it always seems it was a small minority of kids who liked to read i was the only one in my social group who did at least
books,not_removed,i am so sorry to hear that you let the dogmatic pedantic boring people in our schools let you let go of your love of reading you can bring it back dont give them the control theres so much great stuff out there go pick up a book that you think youd love rather than one that someone told you you must read and that held no magic for you
books,not_removed,school took away my love of reading and from a very early age it turned out that michael crichton was able to bring it back i read almost everything he wrote and then moved onto orson scott card enders game and now im giving stephen king a try using a kindle helped so i could read before bed audiobooks helped so i didnt have to strain my eyes im slowly relearning that reading things other than programming guides and technical textbooks can be worthwhile
books,not_removed,by giving you unenjoyable books with language you dont usually used
books,not_removed,same being forced to read books and copy my teachers interpretation of it just got to me i find it hard to enjoy any book anymore
books,not_removed,best advice i can give you is try to read some short story or novel if you lost enjoyment in reading you could feel overhelmed by how much pages the book have also try some new genres to feel like you try something completely new
books,not_removed,in my experience only of my class read at all outside of school assignments maybe this study includes stuff like browsing the web and memes
books,not_removed,exactly what i was thinking expecting it to be a super high percentage with the younger ones then closer to zero as they get older
books,not_removed,lol i know just what you mean high school and college english classes have a lot to answer for i loved reading long before i got that far so school didnt beat me down but it says something about our approach to literature that even with a love of books and writing i loathed all the boring texts and over analyzing in my english classes dont let them get to you keep reading the stuff you enjoy on the side
books,not_removed,all of this i loved reading until i got to highschool being made to write word essays on what the author meant when he wrote one sentence sandy noticed the curtains were blue as she left the house knowing full well the teacher was full of shit and could make up whatever they wanted about anything and failing you anyway just because they didnt become a famous author and got stuck marking mid terms for the rest of their life
books,not_removed,rmadlads
books,not_removed,totally learning to read during car trips and under the covers at night with a flashlight were skills i treasured lol
books,not_removed,yes i think not even of my friends read for fun and im also spending much more time gaming browsing reddit or watching stiupid videos instead of reading but im trying reading more in current year
books,not_removed,we also tell compelling stories through games with an interaction component so not necessarily a bad thing to see book reading for fun steady as we pull tv viewers to books or interactive mediums
books,not_removed,thats about when reading ended for me i mean i still read but prior to college life was what happened when i occasionally looked up from my book
books,not_removed,could be i just happen to know a lot of kids that like reading maybe im biased
books,not_removed,any recommendations
books,not_removed,oh man i feel so bad for you there are so many books out there did you want to read a good story about interesting characters books do it the best what do you want to read about elves and dwarves going on adventures spaceships cruising the galaxy friends going on a road trip in the us a group of sisters dealing with their difficulties of their romantic life if you watch tv think about what kind of shows you like and that may help guide your search there is a story about everything the question is where do you want to go i suggest going into a book store or library and look at their best sellers its a start and hopefully youll learn what you like
books,not_removed,it probably asked a generic question like do you read for fun and let them interpret that
books,not_removed,seriously i feel like most of those book reports just overanalyzed and took the imagination and fun out of the books i think the author just liked the fucking color blue
books,not_removed,i do not personally know anyone that reads for fun when people ask me about my hobbies im always reluctant to admit that i read because i know its an instant conversationkiller they ask me what i like to read and im always thinking okay here we go now im going to list a bunch of shit that youve never heard of and youre going to nod with a blank look on your face and think im pretentious and then i do and they do and we stand there awkwardly until one of us says something about wanting more onion dip and breaks away i unfortunately dont have tv or netflix either so im a complete unrelatable bore at parties i guess i need to hang out with more children hey what do you read oh im on knausg√•rd book just finished delillos underworld ive got some murakami on reserve at the library you oh you know diary of a wimpy kid captain underpants seuss of course gotta love the classics
books,not_removed,ive had a year with almost reading at all outside of work now ive found that i really need time off screens since all my work is in front of the computer as well so im really going for reading now getting a kindle and reactivate my goodreads account im looking forward to the weather getting better now so that i can go out and read for a bit again i really love that
books,not_removed,i never meant to say that it was something bad things like phoenix wright for example are pretty close to books in their story telling i play quite a bit of games myself and there are a lot of compelling stories there as well as you said which is the reason why it kind of surprises me that it is as high as it is
books,not_removed,do you have a genre
books,not_removed,my personal favorite fantasy series memory sorrow and thorn by tad williams big books but after the first pages its a hell of a ride one of the only fantasy books to make me cry
books,not_removed,the blade itselfthe first law trilogy by joe abercrombie
books,not_removed,go to the library or a bookstore and start browsingreading until you find the right book also feel free to take breaks reading a book and read multiple books in parallel whatever suits your mood this way you will enjoy the process more good luck and have fun ps i couldnt put discworld books down by terry pratchett
books,not_removed,what do you love to do to listen to to watch go to a brick and mortar book store i especially like the independent ones and just wander pick up books that attractintrigue you thumb through their pages until you find something that you think might hold your interest and then sit and read if you find yourself more intrigued read the whole thing if you lose interest let it go when you think about what you love in life walking nature cooking sports gaming ask the person this is why i like independent book stores these people read everything and can make a recommendation for fiction and nonfiction have fun sorry it took so long to answer im not in the habit of reddit yet let me know what you find that you like
books,not_removed,smoke more weed good for the imagination and the soul
books,not_removed,i know what i like and such its just that all desire to read has basically been wiped out i now just consume that storytelling from other mediums
books,not_removed,year old seuss fans they run the high schools these days cant see down a hallway for all the oversized top hats
books,not_removed,i like any kind of fantasy edit also scifi fantasy
books,not_removed,not the original replier but you cannot beat the discworld books for fantasy i wonder whether you have to be versed in fantasy tropes to fall in love with the series or not so maybe pick one up and see how it grabs you before jumping in
books,not_removed,then id recommend the kingkiller chronicles by patrick rothfuss
books,not_removed,way of kings by brandon sanderson or any of his cosmere books and leviathan wakes by james sa correy sci fi but so good
books,not_removed,if you like cats try tailchasers song i cant help but suggest this book to everyone lighthearted adventure perhaps howls moving castle something a bit darker once upon a river or sherlock holmes hound of the baskervilles is a little slow but any of his others are amazing maybe if you start light and easy itll gear your mind back up into enjoying the process of reading itself
books,not_removed,mistborn by brandon sanderson i dont recommend rothfuss mainly because of how the second book was a total letdown and how hes not released the third book sanderson on the other hand is just a genius prolific too also neil gaiman seriously read all his books start with his short stories read nicholas was locks and progress to his kids books the graveyard book is an alternate take on the jungle book and buzzfeedyoull never guess where it takes placebuzzfeed also wheel of time a song of ice and fire the silmarillion and the unfinished tales of numenor and middleearth also give the sword of truth series a spin its fun oooh raymond e feist david eddings terry brooks read their books too
books,not_removed,galapagos by kurt vonnegut
books,not_removed,oh what is it about
books,not_removed,i love this series it has gotten me back into readingaudiobooks after a lull of a few years that and the robin hobb books just incredible writing
books,not_removed,definitely dont start with way of kings if youre trying to get into reading its a behemoth of a book and while its probably my favourite of all time starting with something more bitesized seems like a more reasonable tactic id recommend mistborn thats what got me into reading again
books,not_removed,im not op but the story is about a bored innkeeper sharing his life story full of music and magic to a historian in need of a good story i cant do the beautiful story justice with my halfassed synopsis but id highly recommend the series its what got me back into reading
books,not_removed,just read it its a great fantasy story just waiting for the last of the trilogy to be released now
books,not_removed,its considered a modern fantasy classic alongside got personally i think kingkiller chronicles is more interesting
books,not_removed,you also miss a lot if you havent read his other books id second mistborn great books
books,not_removed,if i get the chance ill check it out
books,not_removed,haha yeah itll be released soon right guys
books,not_removed,has rothfuss said itll be a trilogy that seems incredibly optimistic considering how much history and story hes hinted at in the first two books seems more likely
books,not_removed,right after winds
books,not_removed,the kind of writer rothfuss isi could give a fuck how long it takes its like the miyamoto quote about releasing bad games
books,not_removed,i thought its releasing after half life
books,not_removed,does reddit count
books,not_removed,i would be shocked if this wasnt because of the correlation between higher income and reading habits the wealthier live longer for a variety of reasons and simultaneously spend more time reading and are more likely to read in fact charles murrays coming apart notes the rich read substantially more and read to the exclusion of other activities
books,not_removed,so go read instead of posting yet more selfindulgent garbage on rbooks
books,not_removed,buti smoke while i read
books,not_removed,yay random correlating statistics heres some more
books,not_removed,another one of these readingmasterrace posts
books,not_removed,thats it im done with this sub all i ever see on my frontpage from it is clickbait nonsense and ebook smashing
books,not_removed,what are you dear readers going to do with your extra months on this earth well read obviously
books,not_removed,studies also show that people who interrupt someone who is reading for at least minutes are more likely to die immediately often by papercut
books,not_removed,what if i only read shitposts wont i contract cancer
books,not_removed,something that talks about the positive health effects of reading and lets reddit circlejerk how booksmart they are see you at the top boys
books,not_removed,read what though just read
books,not_removed,minutes each day for years is more than half of the extra months on this earth one supposedly gets to live longer for reading
books,not_removed,let the circlejerk continue
books,not_removed,of people that read will die books kill
books,not_removed,is there an rbookscirclejerk because this and all the other reading books makes ur dick longer posts belong there
books,not_removed,til there are two types of people those who read for at least minutes every day without fail and those who dont read ever
books,not_removed,if you are part of society that has time and money to spend on a hobby like reading and statistically tends to have a higher education and therefore more money on health care youll probably live longer i am shocked not by this piece of information but about how the circlejerk in here continues
books,not_removed,is this some sort of veiled satire im always shocked when this stuff gets superupvoted on rbooks dont get me wrong i love reading but this community seems like one great echo chamber about how books are good this feels like propaganda the study is complete bullshit people that can afford to take time to read or that are able to read or are educated enough to want to read can also afford medicine nutritious food etc turns out those people also like pats on the back on sites like reddit which is why these studies keep getting upvoted
books,not_removed,like many of these studies correlation does not mean causation aka the stats could just the same be interpreted as if you have a longer than average lifespan youre more likely to also be someone who happens to read at least minutes each day
books,not_removed,people who dont read live just as long but they dont enjoy it
books,not_removed,tim hit em buks guis üòÜ
books,not_removed,i dont see that they controlled for causality in the other direction that is people with a lot of free time to read tend to live longer due to lower stress you could control for this for example by looking at amount of leisure time if people play games music or other hobbies that arent reading does the same effect exist
books,not_removed,i listen to hours of audiobooks a day on my commute does that count even if it did it is probably negated by the hours of driving
books,not_removed,when did this sub become a gigantic circlejerk for proreading studies as if we even needed them to know that reading is a positive pastime
books,not_removed,yeah but i do most of it on a commuter bus where part of me dies every day so i think it kinda balances itself out
books,not_removed,im handing out free downvotes to anybody else posting this shit
books,not_removed,correlation doesnt equal causation
books,not_removed,hmmmmm yes yes i read this makes me feel good mmmm yes
books,not_removed,but i spend that minutes reading web md so the anxiety should even it out
books,not_removed,statistically speaking reading is safe thing to do safer than pretty much anything you can do therefore you can live longer by reading solely because you are then not doing something dangerous same would apply to people who stare at the wall minutes a day
books,not_removed,i read a shit ton just not out of books i really hate this subreddit
books,not_removed,i can get on board with that my wifes family read loads and theyre pretty impossible to kill
books,not_removed,ill make sure to read for minutes fuck a longer life tbh
books,not_removed,correlation causation
books,not_removed,this is a spurious correlation what a shit article journalists have no shame
books,not_removed,is this also true if you only read books about causality or correlation
books,not_removed,do audio books count here i agree with other people reading is privileged not in its access but in the construct of privilege your friends will be more accepting of reading to new ideas to even understanding what the hell your talking about ect
books,not_removed,this sub is so fucking sad people here read like book a year and then wont shut up about it
books,not_removed,dae books r gud
books,not_removed,does reading over and over does reddit count count
books,not_removed,the next post will be about how shit ebooks are these posts suck
books,not_removed,do reading shitposts on reddit count
books,not_removed,studies say if you masturbate times a week youll be rich studies say dogs that bark with a high frequency cause cancer studies say the stars have eyes and watch you have sex studies says out of teenagers will die of captain crunch related illness and the list goes on and on
books,not_removed,perhaps a look at the rather than guessing at the interpretations of a twiceremoved article would encourage others to read the actual data and context before getting all worked up highlights book reading provides a survival advantage among the elderly hr p books are more advantageous for survival than newspapersmagazines the survival advantage of reading books works through a cognitive mediator books are protective regardless of gender wealth education or health please note the final sentence of the abstract these findings suggest that the benefits of reading books include a longer life in which to read them it suggests that benefits exist it is not exclaiming conclusive evidence of a groundbreaking discovery just because a magazine article with a particular worldview waxes poetic and perhaps hyperbolic about study findings nothing inherently wrong with either its what magazines do shouldnt immediately discredit the researchand by extension the researchersthat seems to be adhering to the rigors of scientific protocol and scrutiny
books,not_removed,research shows that correlation is not necessarily causation people in more developed countries and those with more leisure time are usually middle or upper class middle or upper class enjoy better quality of life and healthcare
books,not_removed,thats because the people that didnt waste time reading had a much more exciting life outdoors
books,not_removed,does reddit count
books,not_removed,is that little girl reading ulysses i read that book in college and i had to read it a second time to gain something from it its amazing i think but come on a little girl reading ulysses
books,not_removed,does reddit count
books,not_removed,obviously every person on the planet reads for at least minutes a day though right out of a whole hr period dont most people do minutes of reading during all the different activities of their day reading signs menus memos texts articles books news paper seems impossible to me that the average person doesnt get over minutes of reading in throughout the day
books,not_removed,i assume the study showed they live longer and enjoyment was actually not measured in any way
books,not_removed,probably because they have time to read
books,not_removed,so between reading more extending my life and napping more shortening my life i figure i should net out at the average life span for sure
books,not_removed,well if you dont like reading this isnt a foolproof way to live longerbetter minutes x days is about hours a year and days spent reading in an year life sure youll live a couple years longer by spending years doing something you dont enjoy
books,not_removed,minutes a day reading law school is going to make me immortal or kill me i havent figured it out yet
books,not_removed,ambiguous title is ambiguous are people who read more likely to live longer or are people who live long more likely to enjoy that time if they read
books,not_removed,thats good i spend most of my timer reading stuff of reddit then then again the shit on here probably makes me more dumb
books,not_removed,correlation does not imply causation ok get it good
books,not_removed,one would think this has to do with intelligence
books,not_removed,now is that because they read or because that they sit in the house they are safe and less likely to get ran over by a car or something i always wonder about these weird studies
books,not_removed,huh looks younger
books,not_removed,that girl reading joyce be like wtf is this about
books,not_removed,so non readers dont enjoy their longer life
books,not_removed,are correlations like this strictly concerning book readers if i spend about an hour in reddit almost exclusively reading is that the same kind of benefit as reading a book
books,not_removed,what are we classifying as reading i didnt read the article firewall is blocking the site because i read a lot of customer complaints resumes employment contracts and so on and so forth like today ive gone through resumes the best one was a woman whos qualification was that she accepts money for employment and just a list of ways she will receive the money
books,not_removed,if thats true then im going to live forever because i read more than minutes
books,not_removed,immediately stops reading forever
books,not_removed,silly headline doesnt realize correlation doesnt equal causation this is probably likely due to the fact that people who have the time money and ability to read for minuets every day are more well off than people who cant
books,not_removed,ok so if i read and live a longer life ill be likely to enjoy it the nonreader who also lived longer is less likely to do so seems fair
books,not_removed,possibly the fact that while theyre reading they are relatively safe compared to lots of other alternative lifestyle pursuits
books,not_removed,thats because we read about other people doing stupid shit that gets themselves killed instead of doing it ourselves
books,not_removed,did anyone read the actual study
books,not_removed,i wonder if this is correlation or causation
books,not_removed,enjoy a longer life nobody said they would live longer
books,not_removed,correlation causation
books,not_removed,i am at work and the site is blocked but how do you even find the correlation of this when there are potentially a thousand factors which dictate our health
books,not_removed,it is not because you read it is because wealthy healthy people read more than poor unhealthy people these titles suck so much and make me want to eat bloggers
books,not_removed,anything you do the indicates that you have a relatively stable life such that you can eek out thirty minutes consistently will likely be correlated with a long life tea drinking coffee drinking horticulture its the stable life thats at issue not the activity
books,not_removed,title isnt clear do readers live longer or just enjoy long life more
books,not_removed,does reddit count
books,not_removed,does reddit count otherwise i dont really read due to my eyes i need a kindle
books,not_removed,i swear the title said mins before
books,not_removed,i assume that this is a bit like the whole people who drink a glass of wine a day live on average longer kind of thing can we stop posting meaningless garbage and click bait like this correlation causation
books,not_removed,why are people who read books considered smarter than those who dont they could be reading fiction
books,not_removed,until you cross the train tracks the nose in your book
books,not_removed,i love how a majority of this sub is not about books themselves but readers patting themselves on the back
books,not_removed,good deal time to stop reading
books,not_removed,are their lives longer by more than mins a day though
books,not_removed,i read a lot and i am unhappy as a stone
books,not_removed,havent had time yet to read the article but does it mention textbooks if so after all the technical references for varying programming languages will make me live life eternal
books,not_removed,correlation causation
books,not_removed,well no more reading for me i guess
books,not_removed,id better stop reading then
books,not_removed,one more reason not to pick up a book
books,not_removed,that book seems a bit out of that girls league thats the literary equivalent of reading quantum physics i think shes an alien
books,not_removed,well assuming that by reading minutes a day i manage to stay put and dont do dumb shit no wonder reading makes me live longer
books,not_removed,why would i want a longer life lol
books,not_removed,does this imply those who dont read will not enjoy their long lives
books,not_removed,study shows that people who breathe oxygen are more likely to lose less braincells than those who do not that same study found a fatality rate in the people who did not breathe oxygen
books,not_removed,aaah yess lets pat ourselves om the back and give ourself some more validation guize
books,not_removed,correlation does not imply causation httpsenmwikipediaorgwikicorrelationdoesnotimplycausation
books,not_removed,while those who dont read as much will instead suffer a longer life
books,not_removed,the same study shows that jerking off into a bucket twice weekly results in a more lustrous sheen to your bangs surprised that wasnt in the article be right back gotta go do something
books,not_removed,but the amount of time longer they live is less than the time they spent reading all of those books
books,not_removed,yeah but what kind of life would that be
books,not_removed,ill still live long if i dont read i just wont enjoy it
books,not_removed,i must be doing something read because i read and it just gets me neurotic smh
books,not_removed,more likely to enjoy a longer life the report said that nonreaders were just as likely to live longer but they didnt enjoy it one bit
books,not_removed,i thought this sub was about books not click bait articles about how people who read are better than people who enjoy other forms of entertainment these are becoming too common
books,not_removed,i may get a longer life but im sure damn well not gonna enjoy it
books,not_removed,unless they are reading camus or nietzsche
books,not_removed,great now i have to give up reading so i can die faster
books,not_removed,people who dont read at lest minutes a day live the same amount as people who do they just dont enjoy the longer life
books,not_removed,are we talking books here because books are the new snobbery seems reading words off a screen is bad for you these days but words on paper keep the doctor at bay and get you laid
books,not_removed,does this include reading reddit minutes each day
books,not_removed,they always show conventional paper books in these articles like my reading the internet listening to audio books and reading the grapes of wrath on my phone means nothing lol
books,not_removed,yeah cause while you nerds are reading im bustin jumps on my dirtbike have fun virgins live fast die young
books,not_removed,read anything or specifically books
books,not_removed,i probably read a total of a day online i should become years old
books,not_removed,and theyre smrter
books,not_removed,ie people are able to receive proper education will tend to live longer than those who cant
books,not_removed,but i hate reading
books,not_removed,does reading youporn comments count
books,not_removed,does reading strangers comments on reddit for hours a day count
books,not_removed,study shows people with more leisure time and the ability to disconnect from the stress and neverending toil of the day to day grind live better lives will shit i have a study that shows people who breathe live longer where is my grant money to follow up and publish
books,not_removed,and the lengthened lifespan goes to reading books for minutes everyday
books,not_removed,well surely reading reddit posts and comments count right
books,not_removed,does reading reddit count
books,not_removed,does reddit count
books,not_removed,thats quite specific they are more likely to enjoy a longer life
books,not_removed,this is one of those false studies
books,not_removed,well i dont think there is a correlation between the act of reading itself and living longer it might just be that readers like us tend to have a more relaxed lifestyle in general anyone i know who takes the time to read everyday is generally more laid back the correlation might be between stress and living longer with stress having an effect on how long you live that has plenty of studies to back it up either way were all doing the right thing
books,not_removed,correlation vs causation
books,not_removed,does reddit count
books,not_removed,i read way more than minutes a day but i never read books
books,not_removed,if you live in an environment where you have the time and energy to pursue daily reading pleasures probably plays a part
books,not_removed,the real question here does reddit count as reading
books,not_removed,reddit doesnt count
books,not_removed,this is plainly a matter of correlation without causation it amazes me that an article could even be written on this without the author stopping to consider that
books,not_removed,i didnt even read the article heh but i think one should not think that reading will cause your life to be longer rather that those who are going to live longer thanks to a complex of other factors read more
books,not_removed,does that include reading reddit
books,not_removed,great news now that we are all staring at reddit all day well live forever
books,not_removed,does it count for me when i read childrens books to my kids if thats the case im going to live forever
books,not_removed,but i liked reading
books,not_removed,if every single one of these books are good for you posts were true reading would make us all hyperintelligent nietzschean supermen
books,not_removed,so being on reddit basically makes me immortal
books,not_removed,circlejerk incoming
books,not_removed,thats great
books,not_removed,this doesnt really tell us anything actionable correlative studies have no practical value beyond providing some direction for further research and yet they always seem to be the end point as far as the media is concerned
books,not_removed,does reading articles online count
books,not_removed,theres no way that kids reading ulysses
books,not_removed,does reading reddit comments count
books,not_removed,mins x rest of your life a whole lot of safe time unless youre eating donuts while reading then diabetes
books,not_removed,awesome i read dank memes for hours every day im immortal
books,not_removed,does the title mean those who read live longer those who read enjoy their lives more edit joke edit really just not funny bye
books,not_removed,but your life expectancy is not increasing with minutes per day still losing time
books,not_removed,im skeptical
books,not_removed,but nonreaders have an extra minutes a day for life it may balance out
books,not_removed,i read comments on reddit does that count
books,not_removed,why because they wasted mins of their life reading a book and want to catch up the missing min life they missed out by reading a book what ends up in an never ending loop without an end and eternal suffering even after death
books,not_removed,does reading reddit count
books,not_removed,i read for hours every day for law classes wonder if that has the same effect
books,not_removed,does being on reddit count towards reading
books,not_removed,i read reddit for about hours a day so how about that
books,not_removed,does reading reddit comments and memes count
books,not_removed,yeah i read stuff off reddit a decent bit
books,not_removed,but does it take into account the minutes lost every day during the whole life
books,not_removed,spending min a day reading reddit post thanks for posting this
books,not_removed,breaking news journalists dont know the difference between correlation and causation

books,not_removed,is time of number of books of books also important im a slow reader i always have to reread paragraphs pages
books,not_removed,i wouldnt say im enjoying it bob
books,not_removed,uh cause and effect people who read every day probably also are better off socioeconomically and as we know socioeconomic status is pretty much the number determinant of longevity
books,not_removed,reddit the reason we will all enjoy longer lives
books,not_removed,that is because the time spent reading for enjoyment isnt deducted from your life
books,not_removed,thank god i read for minutes everydayon reddit

books,not_removed,what about skimming
books,not_removed,fuck yea who is a nerd now
books,not_removed,i like to think of these sorts of posts more as showing the value of reading rather than auto fellating ones ego but what do i know im going to get voted for having a different opinion anyways
books,not_removed,does reddit count
books,not_removed,reading what i read a lot of technical stuff at work and home how about instructions im usually an instruction reader
books,not_removed,but will it blend
books,not_removed,and theres a higher success rate for getting off drugs when people go to aa meetings through selfinitiative doesnt mean aa helps one iota and reading books is not going to extend your life but if youre reading books regularly youre also more likely to be invested in your overall health just like the person who takes initiative to get clean will more likely get clean
books,not_removed,what about listening to a podcast or watching a documentary
books,not_removed,the article doesnt specify what type of reading does this include reading work materials reading snippets of news and social media on ones phones or would this be specifically reading books
books,not_removed,does that include reddit
books,not_removed,i read reddit at least hours a day im going to be immortal
books,not_removed,does reddit count
books,not_removed,probably because people who live with no imminent threat of death have the time and freedom to read not the other way around
books,not_removed,yesssss my two hours a day will make me immortal pumps fist now wheres a good place to hide these horcruxes
books,not_removed,anyone who doesnt just suffers through their long life instead
books,not_removed,people who have enough free time and access to books to read minutes a day probably also have access to food clean water and medicine

books,not_removed,stop posting this smug shit youre giving readers a bad name
books,not_removed,read on reddit counts right
books,not_removed,those who have better focus and reading comprehension skills have a better functioning brain one of things that is key for a brain to function well is the overall health so people who are healthy live longer just like people who sport that live longer or people that have jobs that require college degrees
books,not_removed,i read at least hours a day here on reddit snicker
books,not_removed,awesome reddit is saving my life
books,not_removed,people who will spend at least min day reading are also likely to live healthy lifestyles
books,not_removed,i feel like this is correlation without causation
books,not_removed,but does the amount of life time gained exceed the time spent reading for years
books,not_removed,does that include reading reddit
books,not_removed,upvoted because of rory study said that posts will get upvoted more if it has a picture of rory gilmore
books,not_removed,does reading reddit count
books,not_removed,this sub is fucking atrocious
books,not_removed,no one reads ulysses not even the people who write their dissertation on it so why is it in the picture
books,not_removed,what if i just listen to audio books does that count or will i be dead at
books,not_removed,huh that worm bears a striking resemblance to a series of childhood nightmares maybe thats why hardly read as an adult
books,not_removed,thats because for minutes everyday they are sitting down safely reading instead of doing something that could get them killed
books,not_removed,does reading reddit count if so i may live to be
books,not_removed,do reading reddit comments count
books,not_removed,so those who dont read will hate a longer life

books,not_removed,ok guys stop patting on my back it hurts
books,not_removed,good thing i spend of my hour work day reading posts on reddit long life here we come
books,not_removed,does reddit count
books,not_removed,it turns out that the participants in the study who read more than three and a half hours a week were percent less likely to die than the nonreading participants does that mean that we now have a chance to be immortal damn reading does pay off
books,not_removed,i call bullshit those people were probably from different economic backgrounds with the readers being wealthier and having better access to good health please stop with these nonsensical studies
books,not_removed,oh come on ulysses
books,not_removed,what kind of reading does online articles newspaper magazines etc count
books,not_removed,does reddit count
books,not_removed,when you have a longer life reading gives you something to do making it more enjoyable if you have a longer life and dont do anything with it it tends to get boring i thought that was just common wisdom
books,not_removed,i want to die sooner but i want to read a lot
books,not_removed,good thing we have reddit
books,not_removed,classic case of correlation causation its likely that those who read minutes every day are less likely to participate in risky behaviors every day it probably isnt the actual act of reading for minutes a day that somehow helps you live longer
books,not_removed,who woulda thunk reading was good for your brain
books,not_removed,i cant take all the affirmation posts around here
books,not_removed,enjoy a longer life what if you read and have a short life
books,not_removed,did they correct for incomeclass
books,not_removed,so like if i dont ever read ill still have a long life i just wont enjoy it hrrmmm
books,not_removed,i definitely read reddit at least minutes a day check
books,not_removed,does reading reddit posts and comments count
books,not_removed,for people who dont like to read do this o namazon make a wishlist of books you think you migth enjoy books on video games sports bios etc and every once in a while buy one of those random books or go to library ive found i hated reading during school because of that dumb mandatory reading in the summer since graduating i feel like im years old again and want to read every pokemon book ever made
books,not_removed,guess i better stop reading then
books,not_removed,shit i only read minutes a day
books,not_removed,but what if youre reading on train tracks where the train comes every minutes and the train is running one minute ahead of schedule
books,not_removed,thats just because they have so much free time id be happier if i had free minutes to do anything
books,not_removed,everybody sing the meaningless correlation song could it perhaps be that reading can be characterised as an attribute of a certain group of people who through their combined living habits live longer is it more likely for for instance a university professor to read more on average than for a coalminer
books,not_removed,can someone give me a tldr please
books,not_removed,i read reddit for hours i guess im nearly immortal
books,not_removed,do rbooks people like to think they are a better class of human than most because they read

books,not_removed,this fucking shit again
books,not_removed,this is some hot bullshit exactly how would you prove this dont believe everything you read op
books,not_removed,this title is literally if you dont read youre going to die
books,not_removed,reading makes people more unique and knowledgeable which is good from an aggregate perspective but kinda sucks for the reader i spend a good part of my free time reading and i genuinely think it makes me a more unhappy person at im tired of being different im tired of not liking to talk about what other people talk about im tired of having complicated opinions that require minutes to be explained the only reading people should invest in is math textbooks lest be unenp
books,not_removed,i read because i dont enjoy life you dolt

books,not_removed,does reading on reddit count
books,not_removed,hours per week üòÄ
books,not_removed,using a group as small as people to quantify billion people boy thats some good research there
books,not_removed,and those who are wearing pants right now will die tomorrow
books,not_removed,does reading reddit count
books,not_removed,because they arent spending minutes eating junk food or drinking or drugs or whatever theres no causal relationship here that said im going to go read a bit why not
books,not_removed,in other news reasonably educated people do better in life than noneducated who woulda guessed it
books,not_removed,memorie studies show that new experiences help with personal time dilation this means that reading and being immersed in a book makes you feel like you have lived a longer more fulfilled life
books,not_removed,am person who reads for at least minutes every day hate life myself and everything in it prob gonna live well into my because family wont enjoy those years
books,not_removed,memorie studies show that new experiences help with personal time dilation this means that reading and being immersed in a book makes you feel like you have lived a longer more fulfilled life
books,not_removed,do you audio books count
books,not_removed,is no one going to mention this girl that looks like years old is reading james joyces ulysses
books,not_removed,does reddit count as reading
books,not_removed,i read on twitter for more than minutes a day
books,not_removed,people who often read are more intelligent more intelligent people generally take care of their health than non readers ergo readinghealthy
books,not_removed,i dont need a study to tell me that extroverts get stabbed more often than introverts
books,not_removed,thats why every months i read for hrs straight
books,not_removed,studies also show that people who listen to audiobooks live shorter less fulfilled lives
books,not_removed,not if theyre trying to read joyce
books,not_removed,ill live forever as much as i troll reddit and fall into rabbit holes
books,not_removed,i bet the people reading mins a day land fewer sweet back flip nose grind ollie spins on their dirt rocket than non readers just sayin
books,not_removed,does reading reddit count
books,not_removed,well of course people who read are in relatively safe places and people who dont read could be using that time for dangerous things such as driving sports and even being outside
books,not_removed,does reddit count as reading
books,not_removed,excuse me while i continue not read then
books,not_removed,im going to have to read out loud this study to my nonreader brother
books,not_removed,i believe the most important word in this title is enjoy on the other side of the spectrum nonreaders will hate a long dull life science shows haha
books,not_removed,im gonna start reading
books,not_removed,shitty studies
books,not_removed,one more stupid post like this and im unsubbing
books,not_removed,id be more inclined to think happy people enjoy reading opposed to reading makes you happy
books,not_removed,sure those of us who get to enjoy life more probably have the time to read minutes a day
books,not_removed,anybody ever heard of spuriousness third variables and shit
books,not_removed,i dont really read much life is alright for me
books,not_removed,does reddit count
books,not_removed,does reddit count
books,not_removed,people who read are a funny sort theyre posher likely eat better food earn more money have better access to healthcare now you could argue that reading more allows people to critique information better maybe they can put in better job applications because theyre more articulate therefore earn more money and have better access to healthcare so maybe just maybe there is correlation and causation but we cannot be sure of the direction of the correlation so its unlikely we can say that its the reading that causes living longer even if there is a correlation but and heres my favourite quote from the article it turns out that the participants in the study who read more than three and a half hours a week were percent less likely to die than the nonreading participants maybe i missed something here but last time i check were all likely to die right heres my second favourite quote well that applies here too a good quality life spent reading and learning can only do wonders for the soul and the body if youre going to want to have any ounce of credibility in the social psychological and health sciences then drop the use of the word soul
books,not_removed,i thought sitting for extended periods of time is bad for the body id like to see one research finding that compares sitting on your ass for both reading and tv
books,not_removed,good thing all i do at work is read reddit for hours a day
books,not_removed,as opposed to people who only read for minutes those people will live a longer life but they will not enjoy it
books,not_removed,because you cant read while youre skydiving or crocodile wrasslin
books,not_removed,ahh a classic case of correlation vs causation
books,not_removed,does that count reading on reddit
books,not_removed,i had a cousin who died of not reading dont ignore the symptoms people
books,not_removed,does the study also show that correlation is not causation another worthless study
books,not_removed,this is probably the most obvious case of selection bias ive ever seen does anyone actually believe reading lengthens your life
books,not_removed,im not sure what this says but its making me depressed
books,not_removed,so if i dont read imma not enjoy a long life
books,not_removed,correlation is not causation
books,not_removed,does reading on reddit count
books,not_removed,does reading on reddit count
books,not_removed,does reddit count this is a serious question
books,not_removed,enjoy a longer life or enjoy a longer life
books,not_removed,you could read that as nonreaders live longer lives as well but they dont enjoy it as much p ok ill see myself out
books,not_removed,okay does it count reading reddit
books,not_removed,the study probably means those who can afford to and do read for at least minutes each day are more likely to enjoy a longer life than poor uneducated scum if reddit doesnt count towards the minutes then i will be enjoying a short life than the real readers
books,not_removed,does reddit count as reading if it does i might out live lots of people
books,not_removed,study shows old people who are well enough to read minutes a day live longer than those too ill to read
books,not_removed,does reading reddit thread count
books,not_removed,but a duller one
books,not_removed,get to be introverted and isolated for longer haaa score
books,not_removed,percent less likely to die than the nonreading participants fuck yeah readingpossible immortality
books,not_removed,does reading on reddit count those comments and stories though
books,not_removed,is redditing counted as reading
books,not_removed,does it includes online reading
books,not_removed,does reading comments on reddit count
books,not_removed,the real question is does reddit count
books,not_removed,does this include reading reddit comments
books,not_removed,does reddit count
books,not_removed,does reading reddit count
books,not_removed,does reading reddit count
books,not_removed,i really hope reading the comments section of reddit counts
books,not_removed,i read reddit for minutes each day does that count
books,not_removed,does reading redditinternet articlesemail count i read voraciously during the spring and fall and not as much in the hotter and colder months because i use part of my lunch break to read in the car
books,not_removed,does reddit count
books,not_removed,lol this sub is trash
books,not_removed,also its probably a false correlation people who read minutes a day are people who have free time ie not working part time jobs and taking care of an elderly family member who is under insured etc in other words reasonably affluent and welleducated people someone who isnt living in poverty and yeah wealth is correlated very strongly with lifespan reading books doesnt make you live longer its just something that the category of people who live longer have the freedom of time to do
books,not_removed,i dont know but its right up there with articles about how printed books or ereaders are better or worse for you
books,not_removed,exactly who is this study fellow who is showing us all these useless factoids
books,not_removed,i doubt that reading is directly linked to health even if i had to guess id say people who read frequently are generally a bit smarter and smarter people care more about their body by not mindlessly consuming or doing stupid shit articles like that dont seem to understand the difference between correlation and causation
books,not_removed,this happens to a lot of hobby subs
books,not_removed,yeah i never really got these posts are they trying to convince people at rbooks to read its like posting an article titled playing sports make you lose weight on rsports
books,not_removed,does reddit count
books,not_removed,if yes can i live longer
books,not_removed,reddit is likely detrimental to your attention span
books,not_removed,i hope some of us can count
books,not_removed,the article says the controlled for income but i dont see that they controlled for available leisure time like whether the correlation exists for other leisure hobbies or general stress levels and available time even the rich can be very busy and workaholics but rich or poor could have relaxation time to read or do other things
books,not_removed,i take public transit to commute to work i get about hours of reading each day riding the bus because i cannot afford a car
books,not_removed,could also have something to do with using books as an outlet for stress reduction vs more damaging habits like drinking and smoking
books,not_removed,yup reading doesnt increase life span its the same with the correlation between how many books a child has access to and future success reading is simply a privileged activity it turns out that the participants in the study who read more than three and a half hours a week were percent less likely to die than the nonreading participants quality journalism
books,not_removed,furthermore independently of income higher education is also correlated with higher life expectancy one would suspect that theres another possibility for a confunding bias
books,not_removed,curiously isnt sitting a major factor in health decline supposedly which is my preferred reading position
books,not_removed,pretty much all of these reddit articles that say poeople who x live longer are about intelligence and the ability to do things for a delayed reward its just shitty articles with what seems like student research
books,not_removed,might it be due to higher intelligence which correlates with stronger reading habits and more often begets a higher income
books,not_removed,yeah that and i assume you have a lot of free time therefore arent stressed as fuck constantly
books,not_removed,depends a lot on what you read i imagine if you devoted most of your reading to nonfiction ie selfeducated yourself then youd certainly make more money in the long run
books,not_removed,not really sure there is a strong correlation plenty of wealthy people never open a book many were born into their wealth and those who worked for it probably havent done much reading since school on the other hand i have known plenty of lower income individuals who are voracious readers your average person occupies their free time doing anything other than reading i really dont believe that how much one reads increases or decreases proportionally to your income
books,not_removed,also a reading habit is likely to combat stress pretty well
books,not_removed,studies show that literates live longer than illiterates
books,not_removed,probably since i read smut most of the day and am dying like a bitch
books,not_removed,philosophy was exclusively an aristocratic endeavour it wouldnt surprise me either if this was the case
books,not_removed,please update your comment youre misinforming people for the reason as to why this article is bullshit
books,not_removed,separating other variables such as age gender education and income analysts were able to isolate reading as a factor that could increase ones lifespan its right there in the article its only a few paragraphs in at least take minutes to skim the article before posting speculation about whats wrong with it
books,not_removed,the live the same amount of time they just enjoy it more
books,not_removed,im thinking this statistic was influenced by third world countries with high illiteracy
books,not_removed,from the article that the people circlejerking about how much they like to read has not read separating other variables such as age gender education and income analysts were able to isolate reading as a factor that could increase ones lifespan
books,not_removed,rbooks would be barren if not for the selfindulgent garbage
books,not_removed,i choke while i read
books,not_removed,they cancel each other out in that case
books,not_removed,man one of the few times that i still occasionally miss smoking sitting outside on the steps to smoke and read on a warm summer night is pretty amazing
books,not_removed,im never eating cheese in bed again
books,not_removed,damn it people falling in pools stop causing nicholas cage films
books,not_removed,how do hundreds of people die from getting tangled in bedsheets every year where is this happening
books,not_removed,wow thank you for posting discovering this really made my day
books,not_removed,any data on green jelly beans and acne
books,not_removed,how do they even measure enjoyment statistical shenanigans if i ever saw them
books,not_removed,you mean this entire sub
books,not_removed,where is that book about disposing of dead bodies
books,not_removed,they read the warning labels
books,not_removed,seriosuly i spend like hours a day reading on reddit does that count or does it have to be some best selling novel
books,not_removed,theyre bored
books,not_removed,youre not wrong this sub is filled with pompous people this post actually mentioned me to unsubscribe from rbooks because i forgot from the previous dozen of threads which were basically the same
books,not_removed,who cares if its true or not i can still read it and feel superior to those nonreading plebs with their illiterate children and shorter lifespan
books,not_removed,i also had a similar thought after reading that title
books,not_removed,plus for creativity
books,not_removed,hey thats rory gilmore youre talking about
books,not_removed,shes
books,not_removed,shes an alien
books,not_removed,i ran an independent study on participants and found a link between the amount of time someone is reading reddit and the amount of time someone spends reading things on reddit
books,not_removed,of people in the world who are older than years of age are illiterate
books,not_removed,ive moved on to propane
books,not_removed,netflix users hate her
books,not_removed,that is exactly my peeve with the title here
books,not_removed,just gotta be careful not to break an arm jerking each other off
books,not_removed,i started reading recently and im kinda scared to admit it to anyone because of all the pretentious shit i see in this subreddit theres definitely a difference between enjoying reading and enjoying telling people that you read
books,not_removed,correlation is not causation could be that the type of people who read are already more likely to live longer for some other reason oh whats that this just in people who read tend to be totally better and more attractive than those who dont
books,not_removed,likely that other factors corelate with reading higher socioeconomic status more free time bigger genitals etc
books,not_removed,seriously every post here that makes it to the top of rall is studies show that bookreaders are better people
books,not_removed,yeah confusing correlation with causation reading itself does little if anything for your health despite this articles claims of reading doing wonders for your body and soul whatever that means maybe the author of the article should read more
books,not_removed,ger out of here with your corrolation is not equal causation mindset were on rbooks here we want to feel good about oureslves and look down on all these filthy nonreaders how is this not higher up
books,not_removed,id be immortal of this was the case
books,not_removed,no downvote yourself
books,not_removed,i like your conclusion but your reasoning seems
books,not_removed,i think reddit is detrimental to actually living life its easy to get caught up in the hivemind sarcastic circlejerk interwebnet community of basement dwellers but ok yes ill down vote myself and show myself out now
books,not_removed,i dont think it look a bird
books,not_removed,link to study so people can stop talking about the methodology of the study why is every highly voted comment on this thread about how the researchers just didnt take things like wealth in account cant you people please just click the links in the article and check that shit out before posting
books,not_removed,yes but it makes us sound smarter if we just say correlation doesnt equal causation on every article without reading it because trained researchers have never heard of this concept and have no way of controlling for other factors like income
books,not_removed,i think youre right its likely true for leisure time in general not just reading
books,not_removed,its also likely that people who are healthy mentally are more avid readers
books,not_removed,yes naturally the topvoted comment didnt read the article
books,not_removed,as well as less physically strenuous professions on average and with exceptions and more intangible things like knowledge and its pursuit not all of it is directly tied to money but money certainly doesnt hurt
books,not_removed,wealth privilege and education usually brings more knowledge about health different values different perspectives on the body a social environment that advocates more healthy choices less stress cleaner apartments just rent a maid more stability and much better diet among other things it is not that less wealthy people cant afford to work out or eat clean food but they are in positions where those healthy activites takes a lot more energy and will is not praised by their peers in the same way or they lack the knowledge and peer feedback to easily perform them with the same effortlessness as the wealthy wealthy people can also afford more private space and quiet time away from people and can afford a lot of luxury that decrease stress from everyday life bad diets stressful living worse jobs with higher amount of environmental toxins etc all feeds into a loop that enables a more destructive lifestyle and as a marker of identity those destructive behaviors are often reinforced by the group that find themselves in the same position a lot of the things that makes you healthy is often seen as vain and snobbish by a lot of poor people born into less privileged positions actual money is just a small part of the benefit of being surrounded by people of higher class education and privilege even being poor you can still reap the benefits of privilege as long as you are born into those values or are surrounded by people that reinforce those values in you
books,not_removed,and education
books,not_removed,article says they accounted for those and still reading came out as a factor in longevity maybe if you would you know read the article
books,not_removed,hey me too
books,not_removed,reading is simply a privileged activity i dont think thats the case at all public libraries are a thing i think it has much more to do with the culture some kids are encouraged to read some kids arent
books,not_removed,it depends on what you mean by privilege but reading is not a privileged activity reading is thought as a privileged activity or reading is less valued in poor neighborhood than in rich neighborhood however a lot of popular things cost more money than reading if you are really really poor or if you live in a remote area or in an area with poor public services or poor local based services it will be difficult for you to read but you can be poor and have a cheap access to reading if you are interested in doing it in france for example if you live in almost any city you can read thousands of books for free
books,not_removed,when im not picking books off the ground i am usually able to get an old or used book for or less at bookstores i ride public transit every day for work because i cannot afford a car reading is not a privileged activity
books,not_removed,agreed but i do think reading has educational benefits in itself particularly for young kids however as said this would be hard to study as kids who grow up with books also have all these other factors that help their education
books,not_removed,maybe maybe not what research has shown fairly consistently as i understand it is that exercising your brain through things like solving puzzles and reading can slow cognitive decline in the elderly and it seems to me like that certainly could edge up your life span
books,not_removed,from the article no one read separating other variables such as age gender education and income analysts were able to isolate reading as a factor that could increase ones lifespan
books,not_removed,its a strange mix of pseudism and lord of the rings
books,not_removed,id rather it be barren tbh
books,not_removed,i coke while i weed
books,not_removed,your comment makes we want to follow that link
books,not_removed,unless its mozzarella then its probably a wash
books,not_removed,young children and mentally disabled people probably
books,not_removed,were not sure all the research interns we sent to go ask readers how frequently they get interrupted while reading all ended up dead in mysterious circumstances
books,not_removed,minutes worth of warning labels
books,not_removed,only hitchhiker count of monte cristo and harry potter
books,not_removed,had to google her never watched gilmore girls
books,not_removed,ah of course thats explains why shes sixteen then thanks all mystery solved
books,not_removed,and those people wont be getting even minute of reading time in a day i would imagine out of the population that does have that ability its hard to believe that you wouldnt accumulate at least minutes of reading time just by going about your average day
books,not_removed,just gotta be careful not to break an arm jerking each other off you do me first and ill get you back later cool
books,not_removed,unless you break both arms
books,not_removed,quick everyone grab the dick on your right
books,not_removed,i wouldnt worry about it there are some people who like to show off that they read but i dont think theyre the majority if you mention a book you like its about the same as mentioning a movie you like if the person youre talking to doesnt seem to have any interest in the book or in reading just dont go on about it
books,not_removed,my least favourite part of the vegan diet is the part where they tell you about it
books,not_removed,but they isnt
books,not_removed,thank you its really not a hard conclusion people that read come from an academic background with way higher probability guess who has the money and education for healthy living and doesnt have to shitty hazardous jobs
books,not_removed,now everyone is going to take longer bathroom breaks so they can read more reddit and live longer lives
books,not_removed,maybe you are c
books,not_removed,apparently a subscription to rbooks is not a correlating factor to our willingness to read
books,not_removed,that study costs even with its accounting for gender wealth education or health it is still only showing a correlation it is a significant correlation almost years reading is a cause and effect of good things in people from the abstract it appears they are looking at retirees so amount of available leisure time should not be a factor
books,not_removed,money is an easy and lazy thing to sandwich into any problem
books,not_removed,the problem is that it is really difficult if not impossible in this sort of experiment to control for all of the different possible factors that could influence life expectancy for instance what if the people who read more are less likely to go out drinking and they are reading instead people who read more could work fewer hours and possibly less stressed without a study which has two randomised groups one of which they ask to read books and the other which they ask not to which might not be feasible on the lengths of time needed to determine life expectancy i would say this should be taken with a large pinch of salt
books,not_removed,im normally with you on this but in this instance it seems pretty clear theres a confounding variable they didnt control for there is no plausible mechanism for reading to lead to better health there are plenty of variables they didnt control for that could influence both reading habits and lifespan
books,not_removed,in the case of social science its true for nearly every piece its extremely hard if not impossible to control for every confounding factor
books,not_removed,thank you
books,not_removed,you forgot about the clich√© fact that nothing can be proven there is only evidence that supports a claim
books,not_removed,hehe i hate reading the same cliche automatic shit full stop i hate reddit hands down
books,not_removed,also stress is related to a lot of health problems so having money to enjoy yourself in your spare time is important too
books,not_removed,the thing is as odd and as unfair as it sounds wealth privilege and education just make you a more capable person doesnt mean that your personality will not be rotten but youll just generally be more successful at things you do
books,not_removed,seriously people bitch about the rising price of books but there arent a lot of activities with a lower barrier of entry i could live in a candlelit leanto under an overpass and still use a library
books,not_removed,maybe the person should have said that reading is an activity that is largely done by privileged people which is demonstrably true even if it is a little hard to understand given that libraries are as you say free one small detail though you actually cant get a library card at least where i live without a fixed address so someone living in a candlelit lean to under an overpass would not be able to take out books
books,not_removed,possibly i wouldnt doubt theres some causation there too
books,not_removed,i yoke while i mead
books,not_removed,ah shit
books,not_removed,a bit yeah but its almost lunch time
books,not_removed,its actually a lot of fun and the entire thing is on netflix id highly recommend it if you like witty humor and fastpaced character drama
books,not_removed,every single th
books,not_removed,then you get your mom to do it
books,not_removed,honestly a person has to be pretty unremarkable if they pride themselves on something many five year olds can do
books,not_removed,but i have also had great discussions on book referrals it just takes two book lovers to get a discussion like that going
books,not_removed,but they aint ftfy
books,not_removed,but it is possible and they did control for income which is what commented on revealing the fact that they were simply spouting a cliche without reading the article i agree that social science findings should be taken with a pinch of salt i dont think that people should just be sprinkling salt over every finding without actually determining if the study was already adequately salted its not thoughtful its lazy
books,not_removed,i would be shocked if this wasnt because of the correlation between higher income and reading habits this was what i was responding to the article has a large pull quote saying they did control for income im sure there may be other confounding variables and we should have a thoughtful discussion about that but we shouldnt be upvoting posts that are directly contradicted by the article itself of all places shouldnt a subreddit about reading care that people read the damn article
books,not_removed,i doubt anyone is saying that reading is going to replace thoughtful diet and exercise i think its just interesting that there is any correlation at all life expectancy is a good hook but im taking this more as reading is a common habit of healthy and successful people
books,not_removed,there is no plausible mechanism for reading to lead to better health well that was an interesting book about how to improve your dietary nutrition i think im going to read this one on how not to take unnecessary risks next
books,not_removed,exactly but they did control for income didnt they and the correlation doesnt equal causation cliche is often used to just dismiss an article when in reality correlation is a useful tool that can point us towards truth as long as we consider it thoughtfully spouting cliches without reading articles isnt thoughtful
books,not_removed,and the ability to have spare time no money means higher chance of multiple jobs and no free time
books,not_removed,thyme
books,not_removed,you forgot to read your post
books,not_removed,then you do an ama
books,not_removed,five year olds cant read war and peace i make sure to remind my son of that every day
books,not_removed,haha id like to see a little punk fiveyearold read war and peace
books,not_removed,i would just read it more charitably than you are currently sure they controlled for income but as far as i can tell they didnt control for leisure time etc and really that is what jgrey is getting at intuitively even if the specific case is wrong which is a perfectly fine reaction to a circle jerky post about how your hobby makes you better you go to essentially any hobby sub and youll see posts about hobby of choice makes you a superior human
books,not_removed,actually a significant population would buy the headline even the difference was with no controlled variables vs people who say correlation isnt causation
books,not_removed,of all places shouldnt a subreddit about reading care that people read the damn article lol this is just perfect
books,not_removed,the person you replied to didnt say that
books,not_removed,im stoked that i peed
books,not_removed,i prefer rosemary
books,not_removed,he ended up breaking his arms in a typing rage
books,not_removed,good thatll keep him humble and builds character great parenting
books,not_removed,sure but the antidote to people not reading articles is not cliches based on not reading articles
books,not_removed,correct but i was describing the comment i was talking about not the person i was responding to
books,not_removed,i stroked while i peed
books,not_removed,usually in transit to and from work since its a long commute or maybe while doing cardio at gym
books,not_removed,driving minute commute
books,not_removed,drive walk dishes trash also i speed them up or speed
books,not_removed,running cooking sewing knitting
books,not_removed,video games especially the civilisation series
books,not_removed,this really made a big difference
books,not_removed,a quote from the virginian off the top of my head romeo was no man i liked his friend mercutio if he had got juliet there would have been no foolishness and trouble im not that familiar with shakespeare but surely falstaff qualifies as a comic relief character who is smarter than most of the people around him
books,not_removed,speaking of shakespeare love polonius
books,not_removed,i would say all of shakespeares plays with fools qualifylear twelfth night as you like it etc maybe the fool in lear isnt exactly comic relief but hes pretty funny better a witty fool than a foolish wit
books,not_removed,just came to say mercutio is one of my favorite characters as well
books,not_removed,falstaff
books,not_removed,in the malazan book of the fallen series both kruppe and tehol beddict fit this description its possible though not certain that iskaral pust might fit too if you consider him witty
books,not_removed,cyrano de begerac maybe sortayeah yuphmmm
books,not_removed,this was a goto technique for p g wodehouse jeeves is a prime example
books,not_removed,mr collins from pride and prejudice comes to mind he is so ridiculous that he is funny
books,not_removed,im sorry if this is a poor example but boris from the goldfinch was hilarious to me while in no way being a bumbling idiot his presence in the novels coincides with the best parts of it the main character is more of an idiot then anybody else the novel
books,not_removed,in the book version of sahara by clive cussler al is both hilarious and can hold his own just as well as dirk pitt can
books,not_removed,more than often there is a clown or fool type and usually they are used to contrast the protagonist and look at situations differently another interesting character is the direct contrast with the protagonist iago and othello hamlet and horatio kent and king lear during the period where shakespeare wrote his best tragedies he did some amazing work with his characters
books,not_removed,enobarbus from antony and cleopatra similar to mercutio but absolutely perfect in his own way its a fantastic play in its own right too more satisfying for me than romeo and juliet
books,not_removed,i dont think ive ever encountered anyone who likes romeo more than mercutio
books,not_removed,i was talking to my husband about the topic of this post and he loves dogberry from much ado about nothing
books,not_removed,yeah the archetypal fool certainly isnt stupid its more about saying things other people are afraid to saysaying things other people couldnt get away with
books,not_removed,he is unsurpassable
books,not_removed,you can watch the david tennant and catherine tate version on digital theatre and its brilliant they are just so good together not many people know about digital theatre but its this amazing website that lets you see all sorts of sweet sweet productions youd normally miss out on because of being poor or not in london httpwwwdigitaltheatrecomproductiondetailsmuchadoaboutnothingtennanttateplay
books,not_removed,wilde
books,not_removed,not sure if i consider iskaral witty but you are spot on with kruppa and tehol and bugg
books,not_removed,im not familiar with the goldfinch but if its as you describe the example seems to apply
books,not_removed,boris is the first character i thought of here he reminds me of holden caulfield in that he became so real to me more human in complexity than character with a distinct voice
books,not_removed,came here to say kruppe
books,not_removed,i havent but oddly enough i was reading a book last night where she was mentioned in passing of course it wasnt a flattering mention she seems to have been all but forgotten now but she had a bit of a tacky reputation in her own time i wonder if her books are due a revival
books,not_removed,i dont really know much about her i just read the one book and really liked it i read it as a kid and it scared me and since then ive always remembered it i read it again a fee years ago and still thought it was pretty great but its probably not for everyone i feel that she is a little under appreciated though
books,not_removed,for people that havent yet alone in berlin is an absolute must read i look forward to delving deeper into his stuff

books,not_removed,i have no mouth is fantastic cant go wrong with that i havent read anything else but i want to at some point
books,not_removed,oh you have so much great reading ahead of you id second i have no mouth and i must scream as a good place to start my personal favorite is repent harlequin said the ticktock man but it might not be the best place to begin shatterday is also very good jeez theyre all good i started reading harlan when i was about which was years ago but i havent read him for a long time gonna have to pull something off the book shelf next week now enjoy
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread this includes queries on where to start or which one to read next
books,not_removed,thanks yeah im probably going to pick up i have no mouth i know a lot of these stories are available online but i think its best to order these directly from harlan and as he states pay the writer harlan is one of those people that i have tremendous respect and admiration for his opinions and career however i would probably never want to meet the man in real life
books,not_removed,i recommend snow crash its a hilarious thriller which describes a dystopian united states in which the internet suburbanization and franchisestores are catapulted to their logical extremes
books,not_removed,im a huge fan of ray bradbury my rec fahrenheit is short so knock that one out first then choose one of the other two id choose brave new world it has more impact and left me thinking more than did although it also is a great read
books,not_removed,read neuromancer yes i know its actually cyberpunk but cyberpunk and dystopian are really close its also amazing
books,not_removed,brave new world was amazing i loved fahrenheit was good but my least favourite of the three the first word that comes to mind when i think of each fahrenheit censorship brave new world technology dictatorship pick which sounds the most interesting to you i think is the most topical and while i love fahrenheit a lot brave new world really astounded me when i read it with how prescient it was
books,not_removed,dont want to give anything away but personally i find to be the most effective of the three because its also the most plausible the others raised interesting issues but they just didnt ring true to me in the same way that did the worlds they presented seemed moreexaggerated i guess like theyre what things would be like if we took certain things to their extreme conclusions but i couldnt see our civilization actually looking quite like that
books,not_removed,ive read a lot of this type of fiction i like them in exactly the order listed but they are all fantastic
books,not_removed,i really wanna read a clockwork orange sometime since i love the film it fits in with this genre
books,not_removed,dystopian novels are my favorite genre so saying i like all three isnt a huge surprise but brave new world is possibly my all time favorite book and fahrenheit are both good but brave new world is captivating the dysfunction of the utopia is more interesting and more inventive at least i think than the other two read them and tell me what you think
books,not_removed,those are very important books but not just scifi you should really read asimov philip k dick robert heinleins the moon is a harsh mistress is a good one
books,not_removed,i didnt find brave new world that enjoyable as i was reading it but it really had me thinking about it after i was done
books,not_removed,i wouldnt start with brave new world its an incredibly intelligently written book and probably has the most relevance to the current state of the world but it is not exciting is the most entertaining read as an actual story not to say its not intelligent and meaningful but also on the simplest most immediate level its the most exciting id say fahrenheit is somewhere between the two
books,not_removed,considering that those three are each very slim reads you could read all three within a week a weekend even after that theres a whole world of books
books,not_removed,we by yevgeny zamyatin influenced both brave new world and in my opinion its probably not the best one to start with but if youve already read the you listed and are interested in reading more dystopian sf you should check it out it is one of the greats and should be listed alongside them
books,not_removed,i need to reread this one
books,not_removed,to add to the whats next list do androids dream of electric sheep the road
books,not_removed,i think something can be both cyberpunk and dystopian especially where cyberpunk didnt really exist until neuromancer was written
books,not_removed,i read that a north korean refugee found it quitesimilar to his home country you have a point
books,not_removed,is probably the most intelligent of all of them orwell understood the nature of political power on a very fundamental level and he knew the power of words and their meanings or more specifically how their meanings could be abused beyond all recognition if people werent vigilant
books,not_removed,i love but the themes of fahrenheit are realworld issues seen today even if the setting isnt entirely believable
books,not_removed,ive thought of clockwork orange but its like torture porn from what ive gathered not exactly what im looking for a scifi novel also i may probably just watch the film adaptation of it if i ever want to experience the story
books,not_removed,big fan of anthony burgess weighing in i dont think a clockwork orange really fits into a dystopian sci fi classification or even really sci fi at all yeah theres similarities it exists alongside but i cant put my finger on it really i just think of it as another anthony burgess novel which was always much more tied to linguistics and psychology than your usual science fiction it doesnt have the same hallmarks if that makes sense
books,not_removed,im not sure if i could since currently im reading a long fantasy malazan and also one series of discworld so maybe ill end up inserting just one of the three then continue again with the books im reading before continuing with the other two
books,not_removed,actually cyberpunk is by definition dystopian
books,not_removed,its similar to every country if you look closely
books,not_removed,it is not that bad choke on the other hand if you enjoyed the movie stay away from the updated or the british edition
books,not_removed,the book is an extremely unique experience though because he essentially invented all the slang and gives you no reference you just jump right in and its amazing that it doesnt feel droll or take very long to pick it up
books,not_removed,fwiw i read the book but couldnt finish watching the movie i think its easier to gloss over the really bad stuff when youre reading and i think overall it was worth it
books,not_removed,a clockwork orange is pretty damn far from torture porn it is ridiculously harsh and features its fair share of both torture and porn but if somebodys told you its just an exercise in being shocking for no reason theyve completely missed the point its actually a brilliantly well thought out exploration of morality and personal responsibility you should definitely at least watch the film
books,not_removed,i suppose i was focusing too much on the dystopian aspect would you recommend me reading it if i enjoyed the film and what are some other mustreads by him
books,not_removed,except for the girls at the record store id seen the movie whats the big deal i mean i assumed alex was give or take a year and the girls seemed give or take but those ages are much different in the book
books,not_removed,it is ridiculously harsh and features its fair share of both torture and porn i have nothing against clockwork orange its regarded as a classic but no matter what moral and personal implicationcomplexities it exudes i am in no mood to read something that has lots of torture so i wont be reading it till my mood changes and really i already decided to just read brave new world and for now
books,not_removed,oh god its been so long i cant remember the ages or that scene youre mentioning the scene in the movie where i always stopped watching tried three times was when they break into the womans house and beat her with the giant phallic statue
books,not_removed,i respect that its just that you said torture porn which im pretty sure usually means something with no redeeming artistic qualities that gets by solely on shock value i just wanted to make sure you knew that thats not what a clockwork orange is i thought somebody might have convinced you otherwise
books,not_removed,alex meets two girls at a record store takes them home and they have a threesome film it appears to be young adults getting frisky in the book i believe the girls are stated to be
books,not_removed,ah forgive me for the lack of proper usage of term it wasnt what i was pointing out that it was purely for torture but rather it has heavy really inhumane elements inwhich i wouldnt be able to enjoy the book currently since im not in the mood to handle it that was pretty much it
books,not_removed,jeff vandermeers southern reach trilogy for one example similar to the putrid smell that he associates with foreboding certain thingsplaces smell like rotting honey which is interesting because honey doesnt spoil
books,not_removed,malcolm lowry in under the volcano i cant find my copy but heres the most relevant quotation i could find an alcoholics experience described from the inside out closing his eyes again standing there glass in hand he thought for a minute with a freezing detached almost amused calm of the dreadful night inevitably awaiting him whether he drank much more or not his room shaking with daemonic orchestras the snatches of fearful tumultuous sleep interrupted by voices which were really dogs barking or by his own name being continually repeated by imaginary parties arriving the vicious shouting the strumming the slamming the pounding the battling with insolent archfiends the avalanche breaking down the door the proddings from under the bed and always outside the cries the wailing the terrible music the darks spinets he returned to the bar
books,not_removed,i have yet to read any oh his work but my grandmother says james michener is phenomenal for multisensory descriptions my mom found all the describing tedious so if youre looking for a happy medium this probably wouldnt be it
books,not_removed,the library staff seem to have fallen into a common trap if theres a young adult character it must be ya fiction but in lolita the girl is presented entirely through the obscenely obsessive gaze of a childmolester so no not ya fiction at all
books,not_removed,hahahaha no the protagonist is not y and lolita is not a sometimes i wonder if all books are going to be swallowed by ya genre in the near future
books,not_removed,what no i mean there are teenagers mature enough to read it but that doesnt make it ya ya means its written for young adults
books,not_removed,probably stands for you arsehole chasing after a child like that
books,not_removed,yep finished it a couple of days ago after procrastinating for a few decades like you found it rather dull after awhile and started skimming definitely not ya though some yas might get a kick over giving their parents a heart attack by bringing it home
books,not_removed,my name is lolita i am years old the selection begins tomorrow and they will put us into groups for the cull beyond the walls of eden i met two other boys today in my class test and i hope they have the same blood type the i do otherwise i will have to fight them during reckoning president humbert will announce the teams tomorrow i hope he doesnt single me out lolita as ya fiction
books,not_removed,its extremely well regarded classic literature meant for adults not ya in any way shape or form i mean some young adults can read it but the book isnt young adult
books,not_removed,that strikes me as weird too
books,not_removed,i honestly thought lolita was a pretty decent book that being said i never would have gotten through the whole thing without the audio book
books,not_removed,some libraries classify all the popular classics as ya at my library charlotte bronte charles dickens shakespeare are all labeled ya although they at least here put the popular books and the young adult books in different sections even though they have the same sticker
books,not_removed,it depends on your country in europe it is ya i would have guessed it is banned in the us
books,not_removed,nice
books,not_removed,thats how i got through it
books,not_removed,its practically impossible to ban a book in the united states because of the first amendment
books,not_removed,its practically impossible to ban books nationally but many local libraries dont offer books like this because of public decision to ban them school libraries and public libraries in the biblebelt come to mind
books,not_removed,sorry i didnt mean it that way but i gad the impression that in the us is easier to kill peoplevthan to have sex it is tge opposite in europe so banning was meant figurative do u say so
books,not_removed,oh i understand what you mean now
books,not_removed,its much easier to kill someone anywhere not just in the us
books,not_removed,i think they meant sex and nudity is more acceptable in european artsmedia than violence whereas the opposite is true for america
books,not_removed,only free copies left get yours while you can d
books,not_removed,only free copies left o
books,not_removed,did you read the book do you remember how the whole thing started the banning of books wasnt something that the government imposed on the populace by force it was the people that rose up and demanded that the government ban all books
books,not_removed,people use media and images to learn whats around them rather than think freely on their own by not forming your own opinions we are giving up our rights to change society people rather watch the read best part is if im wrong im still right in some sort of way just giving it a shot
books,not_removed,the book burning wasnt the point you know what the point of the book was dont you
books,not_removed,i cant imagine a world where people would rather watch large screen tvs listen to whats in their earbuds than interact with others
books,not_removed,i have seen a lot of posts saying that most people miss the point of the book so what exactly is it
books,not_removed,people became the books the destruction of paper couldnt destroy the pursuit of the freedom of human ideas and stories we are the living books the point is it doesnt matter if books are burned because the ideas were supposed to have become a part of us all along paper could never be the sole medium for our histories and creations the burning of books is only frowned upon by the author as a metaphor for all forms of prohibition against collective memory and ideological progress so the book burning was a bad thing as a symbol of fear and complaisance in the human quest for knowledge and expansion but it was in some sense a good thing by waking people up to their need to recognize that the flame of creative genius must be nurtured and carried within us to light our way otherwise it is dead and buried in the coffin of a book that is hid away and taken for granted until they are finally taken away no one can take away what lies in your heart and mind ya idiot just kidding about that last part
books,not_removed,ahh i hadnt thought about it that way thank you really adds a lot to the book also you write wonderfully
books,not_removed,thank you and sorry if i came across as an ass at first i really meant it to sound playful but looking back it doesnt what would your answer to your question be
books,not_removed,no no dont worry a little levity is nice i always thought of the book as a commentary on the dangers that mass media poses to literature tv shows and movies which do not attempt to challenge the viewers but rather dull their brains in broader terms it is not just about mass media it is about any form of media which panders to the viewer and does not attempt to elevate himher whether this medium be tv movies radio or books hardly matters when this type of media starts pushing out knowledgeable literatureother media a wave of antiintellectualism can be born books represent knowledge in fahrenheit and to the public in the book knowledge means danger people are comforted by the fact that their neighbour is no more knowledgeable than them in some ways i can see the similarity between your answer and mine still it did make me look at it differently and i appreciate that
books,not_removed,lets see you forgot dante milton homer shakespeare chaucer cervantes wordsworth goethe holderlin sophocles flaubert proust dostoevsky joyce beckett kafka keats donne etc a more reasonable way to state your point would be to say that emerson great as he was is your favorite writer
books,not_removed,james patterson obv jk my nwords
books,not_removed,legitimately at least other authors have you ever read a book that wasnt written in english even then theres still tons of english language authors who were better my biggest issue with this so that he wasnt a novelist and he didnt write fiction thats to not semwn nonfiction but he was mostly a lecturer and wrote essays its hard to compare him with writers who are putting out many short stories or actual books because most of his works werent very long
books,not_removed,hrabal is by and large one of the greatest authors of the last century
books,not_removed,if i had to choose one as the best among them id pick emerson as im sure many of you would because of his style or the inherent reason
books,not_removed,not sure about sheer writing ability but in terms of timeless relevance ill always be a mark twain fan
books,not_removed,best should be applied to something quantitative like fastest tallest coldest etc qualitative descriptions lean more to the realm of favourite
books,not_removed,dostoevsky but not tolstoi
books,not_removed,this is an incomplete list the etc i would have included chekhov too
books,not_removed,its mostly memes and random pics i unfollowed him within minutes
books,not_removed,plus he uses super large fonts which drives me nuts
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,maybe start narrowing by finding out the years the publishing company was active from there you might also look for a listing of their published titles
books,not_removed,well ill tell you what i just found i found something from the carnarvon series from the same publisher on abebooks edit mods wont let me post a direct link and they seem to think its from the duh the publishing company was established in and liquidated in i also caught somewhere along my browsing that they were known for producing cheaper editions to distribute to the masses
books,not_removed,you might want to try rrarebooks or rbookcollecting for some more focused help
books,not_removed,ops photos are exactly in line with those dates cheaper reprint houses didnt date these things simply because they wanted to just keep printing them and it wouldnt look good to a buyer if their title page said and the book was still being banged out for sale in so they sidestepped the whole issue by not dating scholastic editions and kids books are like this quite a bit too they would often redesign the cloth binding though to try to keep up with changing tastes based on ops pics id say the books was printed from older plates maybe but the cloth and presentation label pasted in are pretty clearly
books,not_removed,ive always been a fan of her work in fact i have a print made not by arbus herself but by her assistant on a wall in my apartment but i never knew anything about her life and this article shocked my middle class sensibilities
books,not_removed,i really enjoyed the book except for the childrens sex scene maybe i am too much of a prude but it bothered me
books,not_removed,far and away my favorite king book one of his longer ones but nothing feels wasted everything is so clearly realizedi think that is what king use to do best draw out these places and people and imbue them with life and realness even in the face of unreal horror
books,not_removed,one of my mates read the wikipedia page or something for it years ago misread leper as leopard then somehow came to the conclusion that one of the characters received oral sex from a panther
books,not_removed,and when youre down hereyoull float too
books,not_removed,i havent read the book in years at least but the flying bloodsacking leech things that fly out of the old refrigerator are still the scariest sk invention
books,not_removed,remember loving the extended summer scenes a couple of the kids show up as teenagers in
books,not_removed,the entire book blew me away the history of the town and the children was so well written the violence and the psychological aspects of it gave me chills and honestly while the book is huge its seriously one of stephens best works of all tbh i cant look at clowns when i go to a circus or anything like that
books,not_removed,great book check out the stand if you ahve not reddit
books,not_removed,read it when i was first stephen king book id ever read first adult book id ever read went above and beyond my expectations made me want to be a writer my favorite book of all time i have four copies
books,not_removed,this is my favourite stephen king book im not surprised most people hate the ending it is kind of gross but it made complete sense to me imagine what the kids had just gone through they had just done battle with a godlike monster who instigates feeds and mimics peoples worst fears adults go insane just looking at that things real form i can completely accept the fact that the kids didnt go insane because kids are innocent and i can also accept the fact that it had to be sex to ensure that the kids all didnt grow up to become insane serial killers themselves love even an imitation of love in this case is really the only thing that helped keep the kids stable i know how corny that sounds but i believe in it philosophically speaking but i thought the scene where adult bill saving his wife by reenacting a traditional childhood memory was even better this was kings most ambitious book imo he really is saying a lot about the power of childhood imagination love fear and so on
books,not_removed,check out rstephenking too
books,not_removed,its been ages since i last read that book but its still my favorite of all time the fact that its so good makes me even more depressed that so many people only know of it via the horrible horrible made for tv rendition of it whose only saving grace was the performance tim curry brought to the table my favorite part of it is still the part where georgie meets his fate the detail that king put into describing that scene will always stick with me
books,not_removed,was the longest book ive ever read and its still my favorite but the movie is hilariously bad haha
books,not_removed,one particular scene from the book that has always stuck with me was the shooting scene just the thought of pennywise in farming attire with a gun is enough to make me sleep with the lights on tonight
books,not_removed,what were peoples reactions to the forgetting i am overwhelmed with a feeling of emptiness after finishing the novel knowing the characters their friendship their shared turmoil are fading from each others memories forever there must be a reason for it but it still hurts
books,not_removed,im actually reading it a the moment
books,not_removed,stephen king has always done stories based around children well
books,not_removed,i first read it in as a way to help me get over my fear of clowns didnt help and was my first stephen king book which introduced me to my now alltime favorite author the top item on my bucketlist is to read every novel hes ever written and im currently about a third of the way through im on my honeymoon right now in thailand and working on my third sk book in a week and a half and i couldnt be happier
books,not_removed,an amazing book definitely one of kings best if you havent read it yet i recommend the dark tower series also dont feel as if youre universe is shattered read some more king novels and you might find yourself back in derry a few times or with a pennywise sighting
books,not_removed,i could never get past the first half for some reason although i tried it twice
books,not_removed,the way he captures what its like to be a kid is what stuck out to me the most
books,not_removed,please you need to tell me if it gave you some kind of nightmares because pennywise appeared to my dreams a lot of times
books,not_removed,ive been half way through this book for about years it genuinely terrified me i am determined to finish it though
books,not_removed,i read it in college when it very first came out back in the my friends made fun of me because i absolutely refused to go into the gas stationconvenience store close to campus it was named pennywise i was afraid they all floated in there
books,not_removed,i read that book at least once a year and every time i finish it i miss the characters like theyre my dear friends who have moved away its perfect i know most people have a problem with the whole lost in a sewer have a gangbang thing but i dont feel its out of place and there are much squickier parts of the book to be bothered by patrick offering henry a blowjob anyone ew anyway i feel you have rarely cared so much about a bunch of characters i adore each and every one of the losers dont you
books,not_removed,absolutely the in depth history of the entire town really emphasized history repeating itself
books,not_removed,i liked it but frankly it was too long and ran out of steam eventually the first half was great and memorable though
books,not_removed,i read this around the age of and it scared the crap out of me i reread it a few years later and while still scary i got more of it the one thing that ive always held onto though is the fact that children will always see more than adults because they can still believe i hold onto this weird hope that i havent lost all my belief as an adult
books,not_removed,definitely not the sewer gangbang but im a fan of how he really painted the entire towns story rather than just the gang of kids
books,not_removed,its definitely my favourite king next to pet sematary and cujo that is and probably the shining and misery i read it when i was a pretty average nonreading fourteenyearold and i finished it in about a month loved every word on every page the derry interludes were a favourite component of mine ive been trying to get my girlfriend to finish it but shes a slow reader
books,not_removed,its a gang bang with children of course its bothersome i thought it was added purely for wtf value and i hated it
books,not_removed,i was maybe when i read it and that part seemed weird to me
books,not_removed,i think this is the general consensus im not bothered by much at all but that scene is truly disturbing due alone to the participants being children its really a shame considering the rest of the novel is some of kings best work
books,not_removed,literally one of the parts i am looking forward to hearing most the only thing that worries me is i think i plan on listening to it and i listen to audiobooks while at work so i will be a bit awkward for me thinking of it on audiobook that must have been a weird scene for the reader to read outloud
books,not_removed,i have to agree it just seemed so out of place given the context i have read comments by others passing it off as some sort of right of passage into adulthood or symbolic of the loss of their innocence or whatever i cant see it being justified other than to provide the wtf factor as others have mentioned
books,not_removed,i agree every scene of every chapterinterlude was necessary and moved the story to so many complex places his formatting choices are perfect for the novel and absolutely the seven children especially were so detailed and real
books,not_removed,this made me laugh way too hard thank you
books,not_removed,the entire patrick hockstetter sequence is rather off the charts disturbing he is one of the most disturbing characters king has ever made and s he went out in just as horrible a way as that horrible a character deserved
books,not_removed,i remember reading it at school and i felt as if i had lived that summer with the characters
books,not_removed,have you read boys life by robert mccammon seems under the radar these days but its a great companion book to it awesome book captures the summers well too
books,not_removed,i was finding a bit of a slog but once he took us to derry i was completely in it was like seeing old friends you hadnt seen in a long time
books,not_removed,no way i love when he overlaps characters i really loved how dick hallorann made an appearance even used his shining to save as many lives as he could from the fire the summer scenes were incredible i agree
books,not_removed,agree and now that ive been having nightmares about pennywise i dont think ill be able to look at clowns anymore either
books,not_removed,that is so awesome i almost wish id read it as a kid to have a different perspective of the story i read it on a kindle but now i want to buy a hard copy
books,not_removed,yes i tell people im reading it and they roll their eyes saying that movie was sooo terrible its so disappointing but tim curry always kicks ass he was the perfect pennywiserobert gray and poor georgiespectacular writing it broke my heart how bills parents treated him after
books,not_removed,im hoping the remake will be better
books,not_removed,oofwhat a frightening image
books,not_removed,it sucks but it still wraps up the story nicely they forgot at first years ago and they will forget again but maybe its for the best remembering must be scary
books,not_removed,yes i just bought gunslinger thanks for the recommendation ahh that would be great so cool how many of his stories all of them occur in the same universe
books,not_removed,i feel you i think the first half of the book is more the setup for the second half and i found the monster scenes and history of derry extremely interesting i loved the second half too but it did have a different feel to it i think the first half has more children scenes too which were one of the strongest aspects of the novel
books,not_removed,yes i most certainly did have pennywise nightmares almost through the entire time i read the book im hoping they stop now that i finished the booki keep seeing him smile and wave at me from across the road
books,not_removed,yes i miss them so much after finally finishing the book i love beverly and eddie especially im sure i will reread it soon enough and yeahhh i thought patricks whole story was a bit more messed up that the sewer scene as well
books,not_removed,i think i am going to read misery or cujo next i havent ready either its definitely a long one but im sure she will love it if she gets to the end
books,not_removed,i listened to the audiobook too and felt the same about getting to that part stephen weber actually does it very well its not terribly graphic and he manages somehow to make it sound almost tender although its still very weird it doesnt feel out of place to me the part about bev watching patrick and henry at the dump is much more squicky especially the voice weber gives patrick when i finally did listen to the gangbang scene i was on the bus and had to restrain myself from letting out terribly embarrassed peals of laughter
books,not_removed,noone passes if off as that its spelled out exactly that that is the reason they do it
books,not_removed,it is probably due for a reread its been long enough that im left with more an impression and feelings what has specifically stuck with me probably because i saw it criticized shortly after finishing was the very end with bill and audra on silver i remember my heart pounding think comeon just one more miracle just one more miracle he deserves this
books,not_removed,oh yeah patrick hockstetter is one of the scariest parts of the novel as is his demise king did an eerily good job depicting a sociopath child
books,not_removed,fantastic novel
books,not_removed,my favorite book read it at the age of changed my life and made me a lifelong voracious reader
books,not_removed,oh lordy please i can only imagine
books,not_removed,remake
books,not_removed,pretty much all of his books are in the same universe dont want to give away spoilersbut ill say theres a certain clown making an appearance in derry in the tommyknockers also if you read youll get to take a trip back to derry and maybe even see some of the losers club keep reading the dark tower though theres references to almost all of his books throughout the series oh also dreamcatcher has plenty of it references also aside from the dark toweri put the stand right up on the same level as it
books,not_removed,the funny thing its that pennywise doesnt leave you alone something will remind you about him
books,not_removed,i love beverly dearly too i relate to her so much ‚ù§Ô∏è and bill and ben i love them all they feel so real like actual friends it helps to read the stand next the characters are similar in that they will take a place in your heart that helped me when i had book hangover from it patrick is one of the scariest most irredeemable characters ive ever read hes awful but i kind of want a whole book about him because im a masochist xd then again henry is so awful too
books,not_removed,i must admit im interested in the scene for perverse reasons so hearing that its not very graphic is disappointing though honestly not surprising based on your comments on it i am still just as interested in hearing it though especially now in hearing how its read what is the content of this other part youre talking about i have only ever seen people mention the gangbang scene
books,not_removed,even though it is spelled out as you can see by the other comments here no one really accepts that justification and still find the scene to be out of place by not examining the scene further or being more critical of the scene and the authors motivations or intentions of including this scene then i would say yes people are passing it off
books,not_removed,yes that scene was so powerful i had the same reaction i was holding my breath the whole way
books,not_removed,yep it was supposed to have cary joji fukunaga until creative differences between him and the studio made him leave he wrote online an explanation of why he left
books,not_removed,wow awesome thanks i will definitely have to check all of these out
books,not_removed,this gives me the shivers
books,not_removed,well its not unperverse considering that it is a bunch of preteens having sex but its from beverlys point of view and she really loves all of the boys and i think its actually rather sweet and described quite innocently also she enjoys it so theres that the much squickier part in my opinion is much earlier on in the book spoiler warning just in case beverly goes to the dump in search of her friends and instead stumbled upon henry bowers and his friends all with their pants down setting alight to their farts she hides and observes this then two of the friends leave and henry is left with the epically sinister patrick hockstetter who starts touching henry and then offers to give him a blowjob its described in a far more vile way than the gangbang and its much more upsetting
books,not_removed,fukunaga wanted to make it which the studio refused at that budget reportedly theyre still using his script sans the stuff its being directed by andy muschietti and the cinematographer is chunghoon chung of oldboy and all the other changwook park films

books,not_removed,im not looking for a recommendation
books,not_removed,you are looking for examples of a book that meets your criteria as you set them with nothing in your post except for a passiveaggressive indication that you are unable to follow the rules of a sub how arent you asking for a recommendation also like i indicated raudiobooks is probably better capable of answering your question please read their rules before posting
books,not_removed,i wanted to discuss examples of an audiobook being the better experience on a sub that actually has an active community if i asked for examples where a remake of a movie was better than the original would you think im asking for a fucking recommendation on what to watch
books,not_removed,raudiobooks has an active community it is also a community that consists of people that listen to audiobooks which you appear to want to know about you broke several rules of this sub rule and rule which specifically states posts asking users to list their favoritethe best book of a genre style etc that dont include an answer and why in the body will be assumed to be recommendation requests and removed instead of following the instructions the bot gave you you chose to ignore the fact that your post doesnt meet our requirements you were invited to ask us if you were confused and decided to make a shitpost instead that still broke our rules im honestly wondering what you expected would happen when you made this post
books,not_removed,not looking for a recommendation
books,not_removed,you are welcome to prove that by making a post that follows the guidelines repeating yourself in the comments of this thread wont get you anywhere
books,not_removed,please stop repeating yourself
books,not_removed,call it what it is a novella that is enough to be included in a collection of short stories beyond that if your book resonates with a niche market you can self publish
books,not_removed,if you decide to go the amazon selfpublish route i would advise hiring someone to make a good cover image i frequently judge books by their covers when purchasing kindle books and a professionallooking cover can make a huge difference httplousybookcoverstumblrcom to see what i mean
books,not_removed,you shouldnt care about the length of the book the number of words have nothing to do with quality as others have already pointed out there are economical reason but you should ask yourself if you want to sacrifice your storys uniqueness for that i mean then you might as well just write another ya vampire novel or a fifty shades clone or whatever the market wants
books,not_removed,sounds like youre writing a novella go to it have fun novellas are harder to sell than novels and harder to sell than short stories but its a perfectly legitimate literary form
books,not_removed,i dont know about america but where im from theres a lot of smaller publishers that publish exclusively based on quality and not bankability so what id recommend is to find out what kind of a publisher would publish your book and then send it to them
books,not_removed,thanks for the replies more and more amazon seems like the viable option for publishing it would be such a waste for this unique book to get lost in the crowd but thats a different topic however my intention for this novella as you guys classified it is to be read possibly in one sitting by frequent readers i intentionally wrote in a way that will make the reader feel a different emotion while reading each section i dont want to slow down the rollercoaster i built
books,not_removed,thanks for the advice wow those covers are horrendous i am shopping for a cover artist and an editor i am situated right next to a major university so there has to be some talented students out there who would do a good job for a couple hundred bucks i already have an idea on what i want for the cover its a minimalist cover that will set the scene for my book the moment you see it i want you either hate my book or buy it immediately thats what i want
books,not_removed,thanks so much i think i will try to finish and publish in the next couple months cant wait to see the reviews
books,not_removed,talented students out there who would do a good job for a couple hundred bucks jesus you can get a fantastic cover made for under just use fiverr or any other freelancing site
books,not_removed,i went to look up amazons faq and see if they had any sort of reporting mechanism and found a lot of articles about selfpublished novels and plagiarism apparently youre not the only one whos noticed a problem im not sure how it works if the work plagiarized is a video game but if you want to report it it seems like your best bet is to contact the producer of the video game and let them know i got that idea from which says that its mostly the plagiarized authors who contact amazon and have the illicit books taken down
books,not_removed,after first finishing this book i disliked it it was far too long and rambling and the ending was nothing special but then later on in the most insignificant times and mundane parts of my day i would find myself thinking about cathy h and tommy and all the children its such a haunting book and only later when i had time to reflect on it did i understand the significance of the book the book is beautiful it feels like life and real life every time i recall an event in the book i feel as if it was a memory of my own i dont know what draws me back to this book i cant pinpoint it
books,not_removed,what struck me was how matter of factly their lives purpose are part of the narrative its just quietly true with no explosive scenes or real outrage amazing book
books,not_removed,you should definitely read the remains of the day madame has stuck with me the most from never let me go
books,not_removed,i know this is blasphemy but i liked the movie a whole lot more than i liked the book the actual story is really good but i thought the movie told it much more effectively
books,not_removed,i absolutely adore never let me go and i really urge you to read remains of the day as well although different in theme it carries much the same contemplativeness as never let me go
books,not_removed,the buried giant was a touching story narrative quest in old britain
books,not_removed,just read that this past month it truly was an absolutely beautiful haunting mesmerizing story my only criticism was that i wanted to see more of the dystopian world fleshed out but i also realize that would have taken away from the narrative
books,not_removed,i first watched the movie love carey mulligan and i cried and cried at the end then my sister picked up the book by chance at a library book sale and i read it while we were on vacation its definitely one of those stories where knowing the end doesnt lessen the impact at all i must have cried for a half hour had to keep putting the book down haunting to say the least i remember feeling so moved i had to tell my mom
books,not_removed,another voice recommending remains of the day although ive liked everything ive read from him i didnt tear through never let me go like i did remains of the day but it still felt like a good bookthough not always while reading it the sadness and the journey you go through with the characters is special
books,not_removed,i read this back in high school i was actually in a boarding school at the time haha except they were a bit more concerned when we would have sex in the unused classrooms
books,not_removed,the audiobook is ammmmazing perfect hauntingly calm accent
books,not_removed,i had the same reaction to this book its accompanied by one of the rare book to movie films that actually does the retelling justice
books,not_removed,this book tore the heart out of me
books,not_removed,the unconsoled is absolutely fantastic
books,not_removed,the remains of the day and a pale views of hills are both fantastic ive read them so many times remains of the day sometimes makes me tear up at the end because i feel so sad for him
books,not_removed,i felt the exact same way its one of the books thats really stuck with me even though i read it years ago now and have forgotten some of the specific details its so hauntingly beautiful ive recommended it left and right but i dont think anyone has taken me up on the recommendation so its nice to see a lot of like minded people here the movie was also pretty good one of the better book to movie adaptations ive seen
books,not_removed,or are there any other writers who invoke such a strong emotional response when discussing the loneliness of the human condition such an amazing book you can also give cormac mccarthy a try for this loneliness and bleakness of the soul youre looking for i highly recommend suttree child of god the road and his arguably masterpiece blood meridian any of these will floor you
books,not_removed,i read the buried giant and loved it so thank you very much for giving me an idea for the next book i want to read
books,not_removed,uuuggghhh i made the mistake of looking at gr reviews before i read this and they ruined the twist that was really disappointing regardless i just loved this book i immediately passed it on to my mom with instructions to put it on the top of her toread pile
books,not_removed,i sat next to a cute girl on a plane ride the other day who was reading this book such serendipity now i have to read this book its a sign
books,not_removed,the logic and science in this book were so terrible i wanted to stomp on it
books,not_removed,i felt similarly and initially rated the book three stars i think a day later i had move it to four and by the end of the week i realized it was five stars when reading the book i was caught up in the obvious things the school the environment and injustice but none of those threads ever receive a satisfying exploration or conclusion later i realized that none of it really mattered to the story being told the book was about something more important and universal im not sure if this is how many people interpret it but i felt that ishiguro deliberately misdirects by putting an immediate and obvious conflict on top of a much deeper story to show the reader how easy it can be to miss what really matters i find many reviews for this book both amusing and frustrating they miss the point of the book so thoroughly they cant even recognize the irony of it
books,not_removed,i read both and actually my perception was that the same theme is woven throughout both books the concept that there are beings living a halflife in sacrifice to the larger cause whether that is serving the upperclass of or donating body parts to the sick of society they do it without rebellion or selfpity because they dont see themselves as deserving a whole human life
books,not_removed,was it a dystopian world it felt more like an alternate reality to me its funny like you im normally super concerned with the details of the world that the story is taking place however i did not care at all with this one i actually just looked up the actual definition of dystopia and i guess it is ok learned something new
books,not_removed,i have read all of those you listed plus the border trilogy and not arguably blood meridian is a masterpiece and his magnum opus
books,not_removed,how so the people of britain decided that the cure for cancer and all other maladies was worth the industrialization of designer babies madam even explains it like that
books,not_removed,so im about two months late to this post but would you elaborate on what you think the point is im curious to hear your thoughts
books,not_removed,because its not what science would do first the ethics are indescribable second it would be much easier to grow the necessary organs when needed and how often do we cure cancer with organ replacement only in the case of leukemia and other blood and bone marrow cancers its a big enough financial stretch for people to store their newborns umbilical cords against the chance the child will need stem cells creating an entire clone never would happen horrible science horrible ethics all to underly a rather tawdry emotional buttonpush of a novel
books,not_removed,stephen king has been a godsend for me as of late when it comes to losing myself in a story
books,not_removed,limitless the dark fields
books,not_removed,scifidystopiahave you read the fifth sacred thing by starhawk i read it a long time ago and i still think about it often
books,not_removed,i am currently reading wool by hugh howey its not the type of book i am normally drawn to but it fits your scifi dystopia genre and i am thoroughly enjoying it

books,not_removed,ive seen this book on my last trip to bn and thought about picking it up but sadly it didnt fit into my budget at the time ill definitely be picking it up on my next trip glad youre enjoying it cheers d
books,not_removed,a prime example of how you dont need to be a good person to be a great writer i loved his stories from the first time i stumbled on them but i really recommend reading hp lovecraft against the world against life by michel houellebecq knowing more about the man really helps you appreciate the author and brings deeper meaning to the story behind the horrors
books,not_removed,yes i would say so while not being his best work in my opinion call ot cthulhu is a good starting point and a good prototype for his works in general another story for starters would be the colour out of space

books,not_removed,personal preference really great literature isnt resigned to one genre or time period
books,not_removed,theres nothing wrong with you its called each to their own did you ever wonder why there are so many stories theres one for everbody
books,not_removed,the first two are a sense of humour thing i loved both of them but we dont all share the same sense of humour i didnt enjoy dune either perhaps frank herbert did too good a job of painting the dune society and i found it strange and oppressive
books,not_removed,no not at all people have preferences i feel what you are saying i dont like the movie god father and all the parts you should see the way i get berated when i say that people are asshats when it comes to preferences they dont seem to understand the word preference they think it means that everyone should like what they like and nothing else as for your question now i like hitchhikers guide and dune the other two were total crap to me
books,not_removed,i can only speak to dune and enders game but i enjoyed both but i can see how someone wont like them i have a hard time reading lord of the rings or the hobbit ive tried multiple times and i just havent been able to do it
books,not_removed,most of those are heavily scifi are there scifi books you do like
books,not_removed,different strokes yo
books,not_removed,nope there is nothing wrong with you just because a lot of people like something doesnt make it wrong not to
books,not_removed,like others have said it likely comes down to differing tastes which is a perfectly valid reason for not liking something although i would say that it is better if someone can at least put their dislike into words rather than just a kneejerk dislike there are plenty of other books out there you can readenjoy that are just as popular or worthwhile however if deep down you are still interested in reading them or still feel like you shouldcouldwould like them maybe just take some time away from them read some other books in the same genre or by the same author and then come back to them later in a year or two or even longer maybe you might come to likeappreciate them later and maybe you wont and it is perfectly fine either way
books,not_removed,imho enders game should have stayed a short story gotcha hitchhikers you have to enjoy the type of humor
books,not_removed,every single person can point to novels which are widely considered to be great that they couldnt get into it happens
books,not_removed,even then i feel that catch does have its own particular rhythm and method of storytelling that maybe isnt for everybody i liked it a lot myself but i see where there were aspects that might bother some people
books,not_removed,how about robert anton wilson
books,not_removed,then you really should be saying i couldnt get intocouldnt even finish book is there something wrong with me not i did not enjoy did not enjoy implies you actually finished it and have a full opinion of the work its fine if its not for you and dont want to read it but dont make it sound like you fully experienced it and are reviewing it
books,not_removed,i didnt enjoy this movie what didnt you like about it the ending the cinematography the writing what well the first minutes were boring so i walked out and went home basically the same
books,not_removed,likely a subtle jab that only old fashioned people read books i now feel sad
books,not_removed,ill be lucky if i look half as good as these folks by the time im
books,not_removed,wrong sub what does this have to do with books
books,not_removed,because its an article about a book
books,not_removed,more suited to a photography sub really
books,not_removed,removed story already posted
books,not_removed,to be honest after the pathetic copout of an ending for the third book i gave up on the series felt like the author didnt even know what was going on and was poorly written regardless
books,not_removed,agreed this is the only book ive ever skipped a good portion of and just read the ending good riddance what a waste of my time
books,not_removed,theres a theory that they are in a simulation of some kind for phase so dont give up entirely yet
books,not_removed,couldnt have cared less about thomas either such a cliche and boring character and all the cliffhangers at the end of every bloody chapter why would i care about his fate when i know hes going to be perfectly fine the page after such a waste of my money wish i got a refund
books,not_removed,that just sounds even more confusing sorry to maze runner and to you op but i cant really get on the bandwagon i thought the first was ok the second was filler and the thirdi dont even know what happened i get the impression the author is squeezing the series for as much as its worth and its not something i entirely respect im not one to give up on books but this series did a lot of wrong and not a lot of right for me
books,not_removed,franz kafka
books,not_removed,cj sansom writes a series called shardlake about a hunchback who solves crimes in the era of henry the eighth which is really good alison weir is another one who writes about kings and queens and so is sharon penman but hers go way back to richard lionheart and his ancestors
books,not_removed,stephanie thornton she writes about badass women throughout history every single one of her books have been a solid for me she has written about empress theodora pharaoh hetshepsut the women of genghis khan and the women of alexander the great her writing makes me feel like the women are right there telling me their stories she does a glorious job of giving the right amount of historical information enough detail for the feel without completely throwing it in your face
books,not_removed,patrick obrian napoleonic wars from the point of view of two characters serving in the royal navy a ships captain and his best friend the ships surgeon and an admiralty spy theyre very good
books,not_removed,try asking in the weekly recommendation thread or in rsuggestmeabook
books,not_removed,ive really enjoyed some of marge piercys books particularly gone to soldiers it shows wwii through the eyes of several different characters male and female some jewish some not many of them have family connections to each other while some have only tenuous links which they themselves often dont even recognize
books,not_removed,pretty popular in the uk for sure and had decent success in america popular enough to get a mediocre movie anyway my teacher used to read them to us during break time when i was years old until someone complained that they were too scarydisturbing and had to stop great book series overall and other than harry potter and some terry pratchett is largely why i got into reading books in the first place have you tried his demonata series its just as good as the darren shan saga in my opinion
books,not_removed,im sure this wont be received as a popular opinion but i really disliked them i read a lot of them through middle school and into high school but i honestly always thought the series was pretty mediocre one thing ill say about it is that it did have some balls for a novel series aimed at younger readers it talked about some pretty violent imagery at times
books,not_removed,i loved him as a kid and still love him now i follow him on facebook and enjoy his posts as an adult
books,not_removed,i remember reading those at school i dont remember much just a circus and someone called desmond tiny
books,not_removed,everyone else was crazy about harry potter when i was in my early teens i was crazy about darren shan i still loved harry potter but i loved this series more pretty much no one knew about it though of my friends sadly we dont talk about the movie though mainly because of how it massacred eva and what even was monkey girl
books,not_removed,i read them in middle school i liked em then but cant remember enough about them to say whether adult me likes them
books,not_removed,huge darren shan fan as a teen i actually just tried rereading the darren shan series i was sick and read the first books in like hours and i dont think the cirque du freak series holds up as well for me as the demonata did i remember specifically getting lord loss when i was in the summer from my library i started it at like thinking id read a chapter or and go to bed i looked up after finishing it and it was almost and the sun was coming up that whole series just had me gripped from beginning to end i am now curious to re read the rest of the cirque series to see if it as a whole rather than just the first hold up better itd be fast reads now that im older but yeah was a gigantic fan totally revived my love of reading as a kidteen edit im from canada and he didnt do nearly as well here not a lot of my friends really knew about him or read him only one other person ive met did
books,not_removed,read when i was in middle school have the whole collections of them great book really though i cant really recall what is it about now to be honest p maybe i should reread them again perhaps
books,not_removed,oh god i remember those i somehow managed to get through like all but the last one in year before i gave up there were a couple of creepy scenes but mostly it just seemed to be weird slapstick humor and i never really managed to empathise with any of the characters ill give it props for some of the weird stuff that went down though like wasnt he best friends with his horribly mutilated like future self or something the whole time and the love story with hemlock lady who ends up being his teacher coz he never ages and then is really uncomfortable with him attempting to get to base with her does anyone remember how the last book went down i never finished it but i feel like that probably wouldnve been the pay off i think there mightve been time travel involved or something
books,not_removed,pretty popular in ireland when i was growing up dont think i ever finished the series gave up around blood beast
books,not_removed,everyones allowed an opinion cant hate for that i can definitely agree with the dark imagery and themes for a younger audience although i think thats what made it so good for me
books,not_removed,didnt like the original vampire series but the demon series was excellent for year old me good introduction to what was then to me genuinely scary reading
books,not_removed,i loved darren when i was a kid and i love him now had several friends who also liked him so i always had someone to talk to about darren i even read manga version
books,not_removed,i read them as a kid and recently got a new job in which i have a lot of free time read the entire darren shan series lots of it is on the internet
books,not_removed,couldnt agree more i always found them easy to read but still enough depth to have a good story to them i did try the demonata books but i think after the fourth one cant quite remember the name i kind of lost interest from what i remember though lord loss was a great book might go back and give them a shot again just for nostalgias sake apparently their is now a third series based as a prequel to the darren shan saga from what ive heard its pretty good and follows crepsley from his childhood
books,not_removed,same here never liked them they were incredibly popular though and like you say insanely gory for the age group
books,not_removed,i never realised he had a page might have to go check it out
books,not_removed,i remember thinking i was smart as hell when i realised that desmond tiny stood for destiny haha
books,not_removed,the crepsley series is actually quiet good it rounds of quiet a bit of lartens history and how he ended up as he did the darren shan books are a good read years down the line il still breeze through them for a laugh mr tiny and his lgms i agree about the demonata series i lost interest very quickly in those books so much repetition what was actually a good stand alone by shan if i remember correctly was the thin executioner
books,not_removed,spoilers haha yeah it blew my mind when they told me for some reason
books,not_removed,i got an advanced galley of this book and loved the reddit chapters they were perfect someone definitely did their research or is an avid redditor i only wish we had gotten to read more about the other contestants at the end im glad we got that one chapter though im not remembering any similarities between it and station eleven though maybe because they both take place right as the world is going to shit
books,not_removed,removed story already posted
books,not_removed,i actually thought this book was great i work in the industry so it was relatableish not to the extent of what john lefevre actually didwent through though i still enjoyed wolf of wall street more
books,not_removed,i was hoping this was a trick headline and hed written one book called dirty novels
books,not_removed,holy crap thats a new book every days
books,not_removed,yeah not that difficult lawrence block wrote some smut as well
books,not_removed,there are only so many ways to bone something tells me there was a lot of repetition which is actually the key to good sex repetition heh
books,not_removed,must have been really horny
books,not_removed,he became a pro at really really banging out some dirty novels just gave himself a formula and boom boom boom erotic novel
books,not_removed,its the quantity thats impressive books in years thats a book every days
books,not_removed,dont write the alphabet with your tongue write the same letter times build up an expectation and then fulfill it
books,not_removed,if this topic really interests you i strongly recommend you listen to chuck makes the point that its almost impossible to make such predictions now because the mark of greatness is defined by how well a work connects with future readers not by how well it connects with contemporary readers its a compelling argument and an interesting listen and free
books,not_removed,harry potter perhaps lotr is already quite old and still read
books,not_removed,will they be reading hamlet or macbeth in years as often as they do today
books,not_removed,thats a tough one to call im struggling to think of anything i actually think will endure most stuff that lasts for centuries tends to do so because it was the first to do something lotr basically gave us fantasy as we know it today shakespeare famous for his use of language and pretty much inventing the classy insult so taking some popular books of today twilight harry potter the martian shades of grey as examples sure they are wildly popular but none are really groundbreaking or the pinnacle of literature jk rowling herself admits writing herself into a corner and having to add pieces just to cover the potential plot holes twilight and shades are mass produced pieces of trash noone talks about them now never mind years im sure there are books that will endure years that have been published recently but i doubt it will be anything that is insanely popular now and im sure its nothing ive read recently
books,not_removed,battlefield earth yeah youre laughing now but you wont be laughing when the scientologists take over
books,not_removed,harold robbins jacqueline suzanne
books,not_removed,i wonder if or so years is enough time for the greatness of a work to be established years ago rudyard kipling still writing at that time was considered one of the greatest writers ever ranked above dickens and the other greats of the century who reads him now beyond a handful of academics and aficionados i wonder whether future generations will ignore the selfregarding fictions of europe and north america our novels are usually fixed in a time and a place in ways that shakespeare really isnt which might account for why so many productions of his plays bring the action forward to a or century setting which novels including modern novels set in the past move beyond the culture of their own time and place which will still speak to future generations
books,not_removed,in years no one will be reading anything we will have developed the ability to impute feelings and ideas directly into the minds of individuals the physical process of reading words and processing language will have likely fallen out before honestly im probably way off but i would say that my prediction is on the conservative side and the reality will be more dramatic years ago the things were doing now would be considered magic given the arch of technological progress its difficult to say where we will be years from now let alone the aspect of literature that have kept classics modern are things which speak to the fundamental nature of the human condition with the onset of transhumanism what it means to be human could change drastically if anything well be reading classics to get a feel for what it was like to be human but itll probably be preferable alot more fun for us to run ancestor sims instead why read shakespeare when you can live through a simulation as one of his major characters
books,not_removed,as often as shakespeare in a school setting maybe nothing tip for a very interesting discussion about macbeth which may help enhance appreciation for the play check out warning plot spoilers
books,not_removed,its impossible to predict and it might be that nothing from our era will be remembered as much in the future as he is now after all nothing from a century before shakespeare or a century after is quite so well remembered there is no guarantee of any era having such a champion shakespeares enduring fame might have something to do with the fact that the not years since he died coincide with the rise of english as a global language and such a language needs a poethero on a similarly swollen scale i can see the next centuries bringing a fracturing of culture in some ways rather than further homogenisation as technology means people can have their own customised interests which means the age of universally recognised superstars may be ending
books,not_removed,written kids stories werent really a thing years ago but since things are much different now i wouldnt be massively surprised if harry potter is a classic series of kids tales in the future sort if in the same way our kids now still read beatrix potters works but with more of a time gap some stories are just timeless in terms of adult books i think a few of the great american authors will continue to be popular but theyre mostly a little outside of the scale of dates that op provides could cormac mccarthy and philip roth still be up there
books,not_removed,infinite jest because no one actually reads shakespeare
books,not_removed,realistically without just naming my favorite books but ones i think will stand the test of years for the impact they made to the genre harry potter i want to say game of thrones but i dont think it willfor the same reasons i dont think lotr will be read and im not sure what else so many i love and i think are better than hp or got but none that will last years
books,not_removed,shakespeare for dummies
books,not_removed,dune seems like a fair candidate
books,not_removed,id argue heinlein has a decent chance of being on that list while the science part of his scifi will likely be horribly dated the underlying political themes i think will still be relevant if we slightly stretch the timeline we can include starship troopers thus rounding out what i think of as his political trilogy with starship troopers representing militarismfascism stranger in a strange land representing communismsocialism and the moon is a harsh mistress representing libertarianismanarchism in years its hard to imagine what technology or an average life will look like but i strongly suspect our political systems and debates will still touch on those themes
books,not_removed,chuck klosterman is full of compelling arguments on many many things if i had to pick one person to have a conversation with it might be him
books,not_removed,great addition
books,not_removed,and here i thought the book of mormon was unreadable
books,not_removed,thats honestly a great book if you just take it as a straight scifi but then again when i first read it i had never heard of scientology
books,not_removed,he may not have written great works that people still read today but he does do exceedingly good cakes
books,not_removed,you have no clue what youre talking about with kipling his literary career started long after dickens had died so thats a rather pointless comparison he wrote with extreme authority on british controlled india something dickens had nothing to do with they were authors generations apart writing on vastly different subject matter his novel kim is considered a masterpiece of english literature and is still widely read in university courses it also came out in in the twentieth century at least three decades after dickens had died one only needs to look to the endless adaption of the jungle book one of which came out this year in to see the lasting influence of his short stories his short stories were also instrumental in the naming and partially the creation of the boy scouts a massive organization that still exists internationally numerous classics that are still widely read today are set in very fixed places and times youre also ignoring the numerous historical plays shakespeare wrote which all focus on fixed time periods and specific people
books,not_removed,love your optimism but in years people are just as likely to only read the magic revealed in rolling a pair of bones
books,not_removed,roth is questionable hes a white jewish male writing largely about white jewish males living in the united states there were numerous twentieth century writers doing this exact same thing many of them with more concrete legacies already saul bellow or still largely unread masters issac singer who wrote in yiddish and won a nobel who will likely fade into obscurity though roth is in his its hard to say what his reputation will be even years from now he didnt invent any new literary styles or largely pioneer new ways to use prose and his subject matter is nothing new
books,not_removed,ironic because the title of the book literally comes from hamlet
books,not_removed,lotr easily made a much larger impact on the fantasy genre than harry potter did in the ya genre
books,not_removed,why do you think hp will survive but not lotr
books,not_removed,doubt it beloved as it is in some circles most people havent read it or dont even know what it is it hasnt penetrated the culture as much as its fanbase likes to think
books,not_removed,a cult favorite cult favorites generally do not last
books,not_removed,you know what i meant smart ass
books,not_removed,resistance is futile eh
books,not_removed,to be fair it was translated to the understanding of a year old with limited education honest suggestion try reading it in another language
books,not_removed,you seem to believe that i dont like kipling did i say that if you want to know what i think have a look at the i wrote when i read the man who would be king and other stories a year or two back i posed a rhetorical question who but academics and aficionados reads kipling now as it happens i count myself among the latter i was making a point not about any one authors greatness but about the fickleness of literary fashion edit heres an extract from that journal kipling was the most popular and most respected author of his time the dickens of his generation now unlike dickens he is practically disregarded he is little read and is almost never taught in schools and colleges these three stories all centring on young english boys might offer a clue as to why that is the second of them baa baa black sheep is the most dickensian the story of a wellloved little boy bullied by the adult entrusted by his mother to take over his care is almost identical to the early chapters of david copperfield minor details are different but the main ones are so similar it feels almost like plagiarism unless the reader is aware of the storys autobiographical basis kipling like dickens was writing about a childhood he knew i know a little about kipling
books,not_removed,what was your point in bringing up his ethnicity
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,i think she said harry potter because of the success it has had fast selling book in history the case could be made also that its more relatable follows three kids as they grow into young adults deals with easily defined themes has simple prose the lord of the rings books though are much denser and far more sprawling in terms of rangenumber of characters and has some themes that are specific and less immediate to an average human the downfall of the race of men foolishly grasping on to a very idealized image of the past fear of technology corrupting influence of power etc i think hobbit stands a better chance of being considered great hundreds of years from now than the main trilogy does
books,not_removed,because and its an unpopular and usually attacked opinion but lotr wasnt that great for what it was when it was it was awesome but it just doesnt stack up compared to the way fantasy and writing itself has evolved if you released lotr today and put it on shelves next to todays selection it would be utter shit i respect tolkein for what he created the same way i can admire the first ford cars but id never want to drive an original prototype over todays daily drivers
books,not_removed,its not really novels from shakespeares time that have survived into high school curriculum anyway its plays and poetry so realistically high school kids in are probably going to have a unit on oshea jackson or something
books,not_removed,depends which cult its a favorite with surely cult classic among english teachers is all it would take because some of the crap they had us read sure didnt fit any other definition of great literature and youll note i said it was a fair candidate not a good one
books,not_removed,he is little read and is almost never taught in schools and colleges this is hardly true kipling is sill taught in many college courses his writing isnt even remotely dickensenian he story of a wellloved little boy bullied by the adult entrusted by his mother to take over his care is almost identical to the early chapters of david copperfield minor details are different but the main ones are so similar it feels almost like plagiarism unless the reader is aware of the storys autobiographical basis kipling like dickens was writing about a childhood he knew this is hardly plagiarism its bildungsroman youre implying that dickens invented neglected childhoods which is absurd youre also comparing a short story to a pagelong novel
books,not_removed,what was the fastestselling book before harry potter does anyone care that it was the fastestselling book then shakespeare isnt remembered because people lined up to buy scripts its the material that matters i think media and information dumps have really overblown our sense of how much economic statistics and current cultural trends matter in the long run lotr is much more timeless than harry potter and shakespeare is more widely regarded than dickens despite the prose being completely obtuse by todays standards people dont read year old or year old books for a quick jaunt i would say thematic considerations are the best bet lotr jumps out in fantasy perhaps dune if the sequels werent so rough stranger in a strange land and pkds stuff will endure for at least years in the popular mix i believe thats just for science fiction
books,not_removed,you show a laughable lack of knowledge for someone whos defending a childrens books series lord of the rings basically invented and popularized todays high fantasy genre its still arguably the most lauded fantasy series ever written its legacy is still going strongly today if not more strongly than when it was released and that was years ago rowlings books dont even have twenty years of appreciation yet
books,not_removed,im not even a huge lotrtolkien fan but damn you even admit that it is an unpopular and usually attacked opinion so there must be some reason for that if it was utter shit then it plain and simple wouldnt be popular anymore people still buy the books to read them for the first time instead ofas well as todays selection
books,not_removed,its not really novels from shakespeares time that have survived into high school curriculum anyway its plays and poetry well i mean the novel as we recognise it wasnt much of a thing until the century so thats probably not surprising the form was still very much in its infancy in shakespeares day while drama and poetry dominated id definitely expect and century novels to be studied in century schools because theyre the dominant form of literature now
books,not_removed,cult classic among english teachers is all it would take because some of the crap they had us read sure didnt fit any other definition of great literature an example
books,not_removed,its both actually thats why theres a stereotype of jews having big noses
books,not_removed,no of course success doesnt matter directly but success can be indicative of the thing in question containing something of value it isnt alone a good measurement but for someone to sustain interest the interest of millions of readers across seven main books over the course of ten years is no mean feat not to mention the cultural interest in the hp world as a whole extending all the way to the current day with the new play and magical beasts movies hype in a thing can typically only sustain sales for a few years though more is obviously possible that case can and has been made that the epicenter of beatlemania lasted about five years all of this is purely speculative but the case can be made that hp tapped into some feeling or mythic narrative trajectory that many modern people find fundamentally motivating much the way the story of a jewish political insurgent with a message of salvation had been executed for his rebellion tapped into many of the anxieties people thereafter had other stories of the last fifty years resonate strongly with many eg the trial waiting for godot the myth of sisyphus the unbearable lightness of being etc for various reasons in the political social economical or existential realms other stories tap on to other ideals such as how ahab chasing his white whale tony stark becoming iron man and the mythos around michael jordan seem to have cached in on a desire for the pursuit of greatness that can only be achieved by the individual on his or her own terms or perhaps merely witnessing that pursuit is good enough to satiate but not many stories seem to catch on so widely across so many cultures and subcultures as harry potter has translated into languages who knows how many people have just read them listened to them or watched the films now one of the things frequently talked about in this thread has been how explicitly tied to a time and a place a text can be fiction seemingly especially so just in a more subtle way but written history has demonstrated ad nauseam how a peoplegroups valued works of popular culture are quick to become social currency and to be traded even if the significance and interpretation of said work differs drastically from one peoplegroup to another the bible is a perfect example of this and im not calling it fiction but most of it reads more like fiction than say a college text book in as far as it it has remained consistently relevant for years all through a myriad of forms that it has taken since canonization and far far longer if you count its bits and pieces that were circulated on parchment and papyrus and being circulated orally prior to that it will be very hard to forget about harry potter at any point in the next few hundreds of year also i would say its influence on other texts is not explicitly relevant to its survival as one of the greats unless a profound interests in the origins of a genre exists i say this because is not necessarily true that a text will be forgotten because it did not influence other texts developed around it
books,not_removed,yeah as much as i enjoy the harry potter series lotr is just on a whole other level
books,not_removed,it would be like attacking any idea on reddit that the majority of people circle jerk over its hard to even have a conversation about it because people are afraid of downvotes by saying something the hordes blindly object to or dont want to look at
books,not_removed,its been twenty years since freshman year of high school i dont bother keeping the titles of books i didnt learn anything of value from or enjoy handy for that kind of time span maybe that one teacher just went a bit off the rails maybe other teachers stick firmly to some magical list of perfect books but i doubt it based on some of the books in the ensuing years

books,not_removed,this book sounds fantastic i cant wait to check it out
books,not_removed,reading is a skill just like any else there really isnt a short cut to it just takes practice treat it like exercise make sure you read a little every day some for fun and some for school now to get through college study groups help a lot ask some of the better students if you could study with them sometime that way if you get confused they are there to help just try your best to help them whenever possible so that it isnt a one way relationship
books,not_removed,check out httpswwwredditcomrbookswikifaq it has sections on getting into readingreading more how to stay focused while reading and much more i didnt learn to read until second grade years old and have been a book lover ever since
books,not_removed,set aside time to read it doesnt need to be a lot maybe half an hour where all you do is read in a quite place or you could break up your reading so youre not reading in one big chunk something like ill read this passagechapterwhatever increment you chose and then ill watch a moviesome tv or listen to music for minutes if possible you could also try audio books also you could annotate your bookstake notes on what you are reading itll help you better absorb what you are reading ive found it helpful to underlinehighlight important info in textbook and then mark that page with a post it or something so i dont need to reread that whole book to learn the information again when you lose concentration this could work for you as well annotating or taking notes will also force you to maintain concentration
books,not_removed,if youre reading for school the best way to do it is to look at the table of contents look at the chapter headings subheadings and try to find out what the main ideas are write notes highlight the important parts and find supporting factsarguments once youve done this discuss the topic with fellow students see if you actually comprehend what youre reading can you explain the subject in simple terms would you be able to explain the topic to someone unfamiliar with the subject if you can do all this you should be on your way to becoming a better reader
books,not_removed,its just about practice start by reading something easy and interesting for maybe minutes a day eventually youll notice you either want to read for longer or that you dont feel like your concentration is wavering as much as before treat reading like going to the gym its a struggle at first but then gets much easier and so you put up the workload
books,not_removed,thank you but the link says i need permission s
books,not_removed,thanks for your advice i will try this method and read a little by time i did think about writing down what i read o what i understood from it

books,not_removed,seems logical after all the books are the gym of the brain thank you for your advice will implement it to my daily life routine
books,not_removed,thank you it is true that when i was a teen i used to have a terrible mindset for reading and that was one regret i do have but i will do as you suggest practice practice and practice and thank you almost all my life english has been my second language and its good to know that d

books,not_removed,its usually a printing issue if you take it into a bookstore and show them theyll usually let you get a replacement copy no questions asked since its defective

books,not_removed,not this book exactly but i have had printings like this before some sort of publishing mishap
books,not_removed,no worries i figured as much thanks for checking on yours
books,not_removed,i love hard boiled wonderland partly because its such beautiful writing but mostly because i keep rethinking what it means recently ive hit on the idea that the book is the story of life told from the perspective of the subconscious ill see if i can explain because i was a bit stoned when i hit on this theory i think its solid though half of the book is about a guy who uses his brain to encrypt data into a format that can only be decrypted by his same brain the other half of the book is about a guy stuck in a town trying to sort through old dreams i think that the encrypting process is a story about the way our five senses perceive reality and then encrypt it into the way we see the world were awake and we see things and the way we see them is entirely unique this is pulled into our brains and crafts our worldview the only way we can express these things to other people is to speak or write or do something that pulls them from our brain again decrypting the information i think the dreamreading story at the library is about what the subconscious experiences while were asleep we process things through dreams that dont make sense for no particular reason some of them correlate to our experiences we had during the day some of them dont but were stuck in the town our brain as we sleep our five senses are mostly put to rest during the night and all activity takes place within our brains within the confines of the town and forest so i see hard boiled wonderland as a tale about days and nights from the perspective of the subconscious and then when we die the worldview crafted by our brains is extinguished the end of the world a world created by our subjective experience id love to hear reactions to my theory
books,not_removed,ive read the windup bird chronicle kafka on the shore and hardboiled wonderland also read like pages of but gave up kinda got bored for me hardboiled wonderland is easily the best of the three novels of the three murakami novels ive read the first few pages in particular are brilliant because they seemed to me like a cute tangent that didnt have anything to do with the plot despite being wellwritten but in the end it was excellent foreshadowing
books,not_removed,ive read norwegian wood after dark hardboiled wonderland kafka on the shore the windup bird chronicle wild sheep chase and dance dance dance out of all of those hardboiled definitely stands out as something different less fantasy more scifi i thought the background of the novel was interesting a worker gets caught inbetween two sides of an information war the politics of this dystopia intrigued me but the reading experience seemed pretty poor to me i didnt find the main character compelling in fact he was quite lifeless and the plot dragged those two aspects made the novels form feel a bit gimmicky to me in other words the unique form was the best thing going for the book in my opinion i was particularly bored when the protagonist was in the underground maze after the lab had been raided i just didnt care that much the thing is up until i read hardboiled i hung on every word murakami wrote i find his style so compelling and norwegian wood the first book of his that i read impacted me in a way i hadnt felt in years the reading experience reminded me of how i felt first reading dostoyevsky and cormac mccarthy that feeling of a whole new world opening up at the end of the day though i liked the book it was worth reading it just wasnt as good as the rest of his works in my opinion as with all murakami books ive read the profound themes and astute observations of everyday life were there and in the alternative world the dreamlike qualities of the plot and prose were there too like wild sheep chase and dance dance dance though i felt the work wasnt nearly as mature as kafka on the shore or the windup bird chronicle though wild sheep and dance are much less mature than hardboiled only offering glimpses of murakamis styletobe all in all i was amazed to find some readers hold hardboiled up as his best work
books,not_removed,on one hand we have a guy always running away from someone or something and desperately wishing for a little rest and peace and on the other we have this man arriving in total peace tasked with a meaningless job and nothing to do but to live all the while his shadow is urging to running away its when he finally stops running partly because there is nothing left but to accept his fait and becomes calm and in a weird way happy when i truly started to love the book the book was recommended to me when i asked about a book where i could just dive into a beautifully written text no matter the genre or plot and i have to say it was exactly what i needed at that time and exactly what was promised i keep meaning to read other murakamis but havent gotten into it yet
books,not_removed,mindfuck of a book loved the two narratives moving forward in parallel beautiful writing and it was fun to try and figure out all the links between the stories and as always with murakami the style just had that loveliness to it which tbh i cant explain
books,not_removed,the third act reminded me of a black mirror episode
books,not_removed,sorry to comment on this so long after the initial posting but i came across this thread when searching reddit for opinions on the book and just wanted to let you know i found your thoughts very interesting ive read it or times now and always come back to this novel for some reason is it fair to assume that youre looking at the end of the novel as the death and the worldview is extinguished there this got me to reevaluate some of my thoughts as at first i was thinking back to my impressions on the end which always seem to shift from reading to reading and how i had assumed that he was essentially losing his mind in the end when the end of the world protagonist decides not to follow his shadow i always wonder if the shadow leaving but the body staying was somehow indicative of the possibility that his mind might be restored to normal function at some point all that is to say i initially didnt agree with the idea of it being total death but then had to reconsider from the point of view of the mind itself which is for lack of a better term dying in the end the idea that the dreamreader is the link between the subconscious and the sleeping dreaming mind is really interesting as well i think i had gotten halfway there with my interpretation of that process believing that in a way it was the conscious mind beating back against the tide and trying to reverse whatever process was at play resulting in its death by trying to trigger memories in the dreamreader to remind him who he is and inspire him to escape i also find it interesting that the supporting characters in the end of the world chapters describe parts of their world as having fallen into disuse andor disrepair over the years i wonder if we are meant to infer that this is the part of his mind that was cordoned off as a necessary part of his trainingpreparation for his profession or if following your line of thinking perhaps the subconscious being walled off and inaccessible during early childhood development is a possible interpretation of this or perhaps its a mixture of both the subconscious and the dreamreader being unique to each individual due to their own experiences serves as the equivalent of a keypair in encryption creating a random cypher through which all the information is passed at any rate im rambling now but i just wanted to respond since you had mentioned wanting to hear reactions but no one had posted any would also be interested in hearing your thoughts on my random thoughts that ive assembled here
books,not_removed,agreed i too have read those three murakami books only but hardboiled wonderland was easily the best it is like the best murakami has done with the template he has for his books a template i very much enjoy
books,not_removed,its interesting those are the three murakami books that ive read and id say kafka on the shore was my clear favourite that being said i really enjoyed the end of the world portion of hardboiled wonderland it was beautifully written and so intriguing
books,not_removed,in a real way i think that murakami was trying to say something about the salary man of japan or just the modern working world the protagonist goes through their life essentially as a cog the moment in the book where the protagonist realizes that his life up to that point has been dictated to him by others where the protagonist is beginning to remember his past or the false memories of his past he realizes that he could die today and nobody would give a damn then from that point on we learn that he is in fact going to die today and he has to accept that or make the first desicion for himself kill himself to safe himself from an enternity in purgatory essentially i think its intersting how the protagonist never even really considers suicide or doesnt do it aloud he simply accepts his fate and just finds how he can be happy for the last hours of his life its almost as if the protagonist even to the very end never had the capability of making a decision for himself even in the part of the book where junior and big guy break into his apartment he determines to accept that and go along with it even though he has an easy chance to escape it might be an unintenitional part of the novel but i think murakami wrote a novel about the life of a salary man in this book through the guise of a hardboiled cyberpunk noir
books,not_removed,i thought the steel kiss was terrible but i couldnt rank any of the others theyre all about the same quality to me as for the kathryn dance series i only liked the first book not the rest the most recent one solitude creek was terrible those were his last two published books i may be dumping deaver if he doesnt pull out of this slump
books,not_removed,i feel you on the dumping deaver the last two rhyme books are among the worst in my opinion as well clearly i want to be optimistic for the burial hour but i am hesitant to raise my expectations too high and the dance series never really took off for me i agree the first was likely the best and i liked xo well enough the double red herring with the killer got me somewhat in solitude creek the twist of dances son doing his own undercover work to bust a school bully made me want to puke everything is just a little too rosy yet melodramatic in dances world
books,not_removed,i only have the set but hopefully i can still weigh in with something worthwhile the three authors i can think of whose works may have been worth adding are cicero seneca and jung i see why they didnt add them as the set is quite packed to begin with and despite criticism to the contrary actually does a good job of representing the western canon in my opinion but those three are still worth checking out my set has a reading plan in the first volume that takes you on a tour of every author though not every work in years i stopped following the plan a while back due to time but i enjoyed it while i did it if your set doesnt have a plan in it i imagine you could google for one one change i would make is that the preset plan often only has you read certain passages from a lot of works while i found it advantageous to read a lot of them front to back where possible mortimer adlers own book how to read a book is pretty insightful about how to approach dense works like those in the canon its often criticized for being excessively dry and thorough which it is but i think its worth a read his recommendations have informed my own reading habits and lastly of course dont limit yourself to just the western canon deliberately expose yourself to other schools of thought and it will make your experience with the great books that much richer
books,not_removed,as a side note ill add that st johns college with campuses in annapolis and santa fe is a college whose bachelors degree consists in reading and discussing essentially these books adler was one of the inspirations
books,not_removed,thank you any recommendations also im looking to add and century great books as well while probably dropping some of the math and science from the collection my adult reading has mostly been contemporary fiction and modern history and i would really like to develop a true great books curriculum for myself
books,not_removed,parents had this collection though not sure if it was or volume one honestly dont try to read them all just to do it some of them are extremely dated and some just outright suck they might have been important at the time and thats cool but unless you are a literary history buff you will likely find a lot of them pretty dull or get through a few pages and think why am i reading this with all that said it does give you the chance to be exposed to a lot of different writing throughout the ages the more obscure authors or works were just not interesting to me or too heavy or just a chore to trudge through the translation of faust was the best ive found id start with all the titles and authors that are somewhat recognizable there a lot of really good ones in there but not all of them are good imo and i second jung as something else to read outside this collection start with man and his symbols its a great overview in easy to read format of his life work good luck and enjoy
books,not_removed,thank you

books,not_removed,he forgot to mention gremlins the witches movie and that his tales of the unexpected became a tv series
books,not_removed,and james and the giant peach it had miriam margulies and joanma lumley as aunt sponge and spiker
books,not_removed,the bfg was and remains since early childhood one of my most cherished books and im tremendously excited to see it come to life for anyone who hasnt seen it in which is pretty faithful to the book
books,not_removed,fantastic mr fox is definitely one of my favorites
books,not_removed,bless his antisemetic heart
books,not_removed,wow that website is annoying
books,not_removed,dahl books are trash anyway rr martin writes much better fantasy edit downvotes whats with all the dahl fanatics

books,not_removed,the witches is probably one of my most memorable roald dahl movies
books,not_removed,i loved the artstyle reminded me of tim burton üòä
books,not_removed,even though spielbergs name is attached i just have a vibe that bfg is gonna flop this weekend itll probably make money at the box office but it also cost about to make but its probably my favorite rd book for sure i dont know why i loved it so much over his other ones
books,not_removed,i loved that animation growing up and must have read the book a hundred times cant wait for this movie
books,not_removed,i love the book and animated movie i read it to my girls a couple years ago i am looking forward to the movie coming out this weekend
books,not_removed,im surprised that the article writer hadnt referenced this bfg movie too rather than just the spielberg one
books,not_removed,i cannot hear bfg without thinking big fucking gun and thats odd because i really never played the games where that was a thing
books,not_removed,i have internalized that the g stands for giant but not the f for friendly but nevertheless big fucking giant looks to be a lovely movie
books,not_removed,no dice the bfg was first published in years before the first doom game
books,not_removed,apples are trash anyway oranges are much better fantasy
books,not_removed,id say theyre for two completely different audiences
books,not_removed,at this time of day youd have a lot of english redditors online most of whom will have grown up on roald dahl plus thats like saying steig larsson writes a better mystery than enid blyton they have wildly different target audiences
books,not_removed,you act like youre surprised
books,not_removed,he also wrote the screenplay for a bond film cant recall the name but it was the one where sean connery returned after roger moore left the role
books,not_removed,its not that great the first act is good the ending is okay and the middle is dull it looks beautiful thought
books,not_removed,you havent played doom shame on you
books,not_removed,but that logic doesnt work if you have a swastika so it shouldnt work here either p

books,not_removed,just checked with google it was you only live twice
books,not_removed,shit my bad
books,not_removed,from blood meridian the bones of cholla that glowed there in their incandescent basketry pulsed like burning holothurians in the phosphorous dark of the seas deep and they were watching out there past mens knowing where stars are drowning and whales ferry their vast souls through the black and seamless sea he certainly has a way with words that mccarthy
books,not_removed,read the road for the first time about years ago now that im a father ive been rereading it came across a passage that hit me like a thunderbolt my job is to take care of you i was appointed to do that by god i will kill anyone who touches you do you understand yes he sat there cowled in the blanket after a while he looked up are we still the good guys he said yes were still the good guys and we always will be yes we always will be
books,not_removed,from all the pretty horses so thin and frail lost in his clothes looking over the country with those sunken eyes as if the world out there had been altered or made suspect by what hed seen of it elsewhere as if he might never see it right again or worse did see it right at last see it as it had always been would forever be
books,not_removed,what deity in the realms of dementia what rabid god decocted out of the smoking lobes of hydrophobia could have devised a keeping place for souls so poor as is this flesh this mawky wormbent tabernacle from suttree my favorite line from my favorite book
books,not_removed,the things that i loved were very frail very fragile i didnt know that i thought they were indestructible they werent
books,not_removed,theres so many good ones so ill leave the obvious ones for others to post a few of the more obscure ones i doubt will get posted he prayed almighty god if it aint too far out of the way of things in your eternal plan do you reckon we could have a little rain down here even in this world more things exist without our knowledge than with it and the order in creation which you see is that which you have put there like a string in a maze so that you shall not lose your way for existence has its own order and that no mans mind can compass that mind itself being but a fact among others what is to be deviates no jot from the book wherein its writ how could it the judge did visit who would come other a great shambling mutant silent and serene whatever his antecedents he was something wholly other than their sum nor was there system by which to divide him back into his origins for he would not go whoever would seek out his history through what unraveling of loins and ledgerbooks must stand at last darkened and dumb at the shore of a void without terminus or origin and whatever science he might bring to bear upon the dusty primal matter blowing down out of the millennia will discover no trace of any ultimate atavistic egg by which to reckon his commencing the desert upon which they were entrained was desert absolute and it was devoid of feature altogether and there was nothing to mark their progress upon it the earth fell away on every side equally in its arcature and by these limits were they circumscribed and of them were they locus i was afraid i was goin to die and then i was afraid i wasnt from blood meridian nineteen is old enough to know that if you have got somethin that means the world to you its all that more likely itll get took away i think the truth is always simple it has pretty much got to be it needs to be simple enough for a child to understand otherwise itd be too late by the time you figured it out it would be too late all the time you spend tryin to get back whats been took from you theres more goin out the door you never know what worse luck your bad luck has saved you from i didnt know you could steal your own life and i didnt know that it would bring you no more benefit than about anything else you might steal i think i done the best with it i knew how but it still wasnt mine it never has been you fix what you can fix and you let the rest go if there aint nothin to be done about it it aint even a problem from no country for old men the bit where chigurh has that conversation with that woman has a lot of good quotes about metaphysics youll know it if youve read it but its too spoilerish to post
books,not_removed,theres this incredible line in blood meridian near the start where a tent collapses inward with all its guyropes flailing mccarthy calls it a huge and wounded medusa just say that out loud also from the road if he is not the word of god then god never spoke
books,not_removed,from blood meridian hed long forsworn all weighing of consequence and allowing as he did that mens destinies are given yet he usurped to contain within him all he would ever be in the world and all that the world would be to him and be his charter written in the urstone itself he claimed agency and said so and hed drive the remorseless sun on to its final endarkenment as if hed ordered it all ages since before there were paths anywhere before there were men or suns to go upon them
books,not_removed,from all the pretty horses they heard somewhere in that tenantless night a bell that tolled and ceased where no bell was and they rode out on the round dais of the earth which alone was dark and no light to it and which carried their figures and bore them up into the swarming stars so that they rode not under but among them and they rode at once jaunty and circumspect like thieves newly loosed in that dark electric like young thieves in a glowing orchard loosely jacketed against the cold and ten thousand worlds for the choosing
books,not_removed,mccarthy has reputation for being pretty bleak but his writing still communicates this awestruck fascination of being alive heres a passage from suttree halfmoon incandescent in her black galactic keyway the heavens locked and wheeling a sole star to the north pale and constant the old wanderers beacon burning like a molten spike that tethered fast the small bear to the turning firmament he closed his eyes and opened them and looked again he was struck by the fidelity of this earth he inhabited and he bore it sudden love
books,not_removed,from blood meridian there is no such joy in the tavern as upon the road thereto a simple line but it comes back to me often usually when im walking to a tavern
books,not_removed,dont look away i want you to look at me he looked at chigurh he looked at the new day paling all about chigurh shot him through the forehead and then stood watching watching the capillaries break up in his eyes the light receding watching his own image degrade in that squandered world he shoved the pistol in his belt and looked back up the street once more then he picked up the bag and slung the uzi over his shoulder and crossed the street and went limping on toward the hotel parking lot where hed left his vehicle
books,not_removed,to watch these things issuing from the otherwise mute pastoral morning is a man at the barn door he is small unclean unshaven he moves in the dry chaff among the dust and slats of sunlight with a constrained truculence saxon and celtic bloods a child of god much like yourself perhaps
books,not_removed,he walked out in the gray light and stood and he saw for a brief moment the absolute truth of the world the cold relentless circling of the intestate earth darkness implacable the blind dogs of the sun in their running the crushing black vacuum of the universe and somewhere two hunted animals trembling like groundfoxes in their cover borrowed time and borrowed world and borrowed eyes with which to sorrow it the road
books,not_removed,mine is when i was a boy i first learned how much better water tastes when it has set a while in a cedar bucket warmishcool with a faint taste like the hot july wind in cedar trees smells it has to set at least six hours and be drunk from a gourd water should never be drunk from metal then again its a faulkner quote
books,not_removed,damn i saw your topic and new exactly which quote that i wanted to pull then i went and reread my other highlighted quotes from blood meridian and now i want to dump all of them the one i had in mind his origins are become remote as is his destiny and not again in all the worlds turning will there be terrains so wild and barbarous to try whether the stuff of creation may be shaped to mans will or whether his own heart is not another kind of clay the rest he lies in drink he quotes from poets whose names are now lost he lives in a room above a courtyard behind a tavern and he comes down at night like some fairybook beast to fight with the sailors up from the offside of those ponies there rose a fabled horde the jagged mountains were pure blue in the dawn and everywhere birds twittered and the sun when it rose caught the moon in the west so that they lay opposed to each other across the earth the sun whitehot and the moon a pale replica as if they were the ends of a common bore beyond whose terminals burned worlds past all reckoning they ate and moved on leaving the fire on the ground behind them and as they rode up into the mountains this fire seemed to become altered of its location now here now there drawing away or shifting unaccountably along the flank of their movement like some ignis fatuus belated upon the road behind them which all could see and of which none spoke for this will to deceive that is in things luminous may manifest itself likewise in retrospect and so by sleight of some fixed part of a journey already accomplished may also post men to fraudulent destinies theyd learnt war by warring the generations driven from the eastern shore across a continent from the ashes at gnadenhutten onto the prairies and across the outlet to the bloodlands of the west if much in the world were mystery the limits of that world were not for it was without measure or bound and there were contained within it creatures more horrible yet and men of other colors and beings which no man has looked upon and yet not alien none of it more than were their own hearts alien in them whatever wilderness contained there and whatever beasts the days to come they would ride up through a country where the rocks would cook the flesh from your hand and where other than rock nothing was they rode in a narrow enfilade along a trail strewn with the dry round turds of goats and they rode with their faces averted from the rock wall and the bakeoven air which it rebated the slant black shapes of the mounted men stenciled across the stone with a definition austere and implacable like shapes capable of violating their covenant with the flesh that authored them and continuing autonomous across the naked rock without reference to sun or man or god the judge smiled whether in my book or not every man is tabernacled in every other and he in exchange and so on in an endless complexity of being and witness to the uttermost edge of the world wolves cull themselves man what other creature could and is the race of man not more predacious yet the way of the world is to bloom and to flower and die but in the affairs of men there is no waning and the noon of his expression signals the onset of night his spirit is exhausted at the peak of its achievement his meridian is at once his darkening and the evening of his day the man who believes that the secrets of the world are forever hidden lives in mystery and fear superstition will drag him down the rain will erode the deeds of his life but that man who sets himself the task of singling out the thread of order from the tapestry will by the decision alone have taken charge of the world and it is only by such taking charge that he will effect a way to dictate the terms of his own fate the flames sawed in the wind and the embers paled and deepened and paled and deepened like the bloodbeat of some living thing eviscerate upon the ground before them and they watched the fire which does contain within it something of men themselves inasmuch as they are less without it and are divided from their origins and are exiles for each fire is all fires the first fire and the last ever to be it makes no difference what men think of war said the judge war endures as well ask men what they think of stone war was always here before man was war waited for him the ultimate trade awaiting its ultimate practitioner that is the way it was and will be that way and not some other way men are born for games nothing else every child knows that play is nobler than work he knows too that the worth or merit of a game is not inherent in the game itself but rather in the value of that which is put at hazard games of chance require a wager to have meaning at all games of sport involve the skill and strength of the opponents and the humiliation of defeat and the pride of victory are in themselves sufficient stake because they inhere in the worth of the principals and define them but trial of chance or trial of worth all games aspire to the condition of war for here that which is wagered swallows up game player all
books,not_removed,im super late to the party but one of my favourites although it is a bit long is this part from blood meridian the truth about the world he said is that anything is possible had you not seen it all from birth and thereby bled it of its strangeness it would appear to you for what it is a hat trick in a medicine show a fevered dream a trance bepopulate with chimeras having neither analogue nor precedent an itinerant carnival a migratory tentshow whose ultimate destination after many a pitch in many a mudded field is unspeakable and calamitous beyond reckoning the universe is no narrow thing and the order within it is not constrained by any latitude in its conception to repeat what exists in one part in any other part even in this world more things exist without our knowledge than with it and the order in creation which you see is that which you have put there like a string in a maze so that you shall not lose your way for existence has its own order and that no mans mind can compass that mind itself being but a fact among others
books,not_removed,ive always said that i cant imagine what reading that book and having children must be like i must admit as affected as i am by that novel i am obstructed a bit in my perspective by not being a father
books,not_removed,theres a section in there where he talks about having taught the boy how to kill himself if he ever gets captured by the raidersroamerswhatever they are its so gutwrenching to read
books,not_removed,you and i are in the same boat i reread it a couple of months ago when my son was about months old its a very different book than it was when i read it years ago passages like the one you quoted along with the part where hes taught the boy to take his own life are quite affecting even the scenes where the boy is innocently playing with his toys in the ash or the fact that he has a face drawn upon the bandanna covering his nose and mouth i read somewhere around here that the road isnt just about being a parent its about becoming one and passing on a changed world to your progeny the world that the man leaves the boy in is vastly different to the one that the man grew up in just as the world that we leave to our children is different than the one that we ourselves grew up in
books,not_removed,his lyricism and poetic sensibility truly is staggering
books,not_removed,yeah the quotes from poets whose names are now lost and then a few lines later all history present in that visage the child the father of the man an allusion and interpolation of wordsworth the mans a genius
books,not_removed,ill admit its not easy to get through being a single parent of a toddler with the world being what it is today ive been tempted to put it down a few times but i need to get through it again i just have to
books,not_removed,hell yeah even if you can criticize mccarthy a bit sometimes the dude totally spits fire
books,not_removed,very good
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,emily posts etiquette is over pages maybe that one
books,not_removed,could it have been emily posts etiquette there are several copies but the one you might be looking for is manners for a new world the edition
books,not_removed,which one do you reccomend neither of those books look like what im looking for ill stumble up it one day
books,not_removed,with the permission of the estate no not at all see wheel of time
books,not_removed,well basically fan fiction but you cant sell it
books,not_removed,rwriting could have a better idea might want to ask over there
books,not_removed,not a faux pas but certainly low brow people have written continuations of nero wolfe dune james bond tom clancys works etc and theyre all always inferior
books,not_removed,if you were given permission by the estate it wouldnt be anything weird however i think you would still need to list iain banks as an author with you listed as a coauthor and the estate would arguably get proceeds from any sales youd definitely need to be tactful in how you referenced iain with any writing think uveganpuncher with iain banks or by uveganpuncher set in the culture universe of iain banks
books,not_removed,if you are selling it is plagiarism and whoever owns the rights can sue if you are not selling it its just douchey to not at least ask for permission first
books,not_removed,thanks
books,not_removed,wheel of time was intended to be finished by another author this is more like flemming estate authorising new bond books
books,not_removed,thanks
books,not_removed,will do thanks
books,not_removed,yeah thats what i thought no one can ever properly reimagine someone elses universe low brow is a devastating insult cheers for helping me avoid it
books,not_removed,yeah that was my intent like tom clancy does
books,not_removed,he said with permission of the estate
books,not_removed,well no it wasnt intended to be its just that while working on the last book of the series the author was diagnosed with an illness and given years to live so he didnt actually know if hed survive to see the final book completed or not so he wrote a metric crap ton of notes to help guide the author who would finish the series for him
books,not_removed,the best solution i can think of is to send the good shit to me
books,not_removed,pahahaha get rid of books i need all of them even the ones ill never read especially the ones in another language that i cant read seriously though i have accrued a thousandish books and most of them just sit on a book shelf or in boxes i do get rid of a few from time to time mostly by giving them to friends and family but i like my collection
books,not_removed,i collect books like a drowning person collects air desperately and compulsively theres a limit though and my house is like a revolving door of books i get heaps and heaps of books as arcs or from secondhand books stores or just simply because i like the look of them typically when im trying to get rid of books i keep the following things in mind did i enjoy the book if id give it less than a star rating then its out exception if its part of a set do i have a double of this book if yes then its out exception if the other editions is special or part of a set am i likely to read this book again if no then set it free so someone else can read it exceptions if it was a gift signed a special edition or part of a set am i likely to ever read this book at all if no maybe also get rid of it its worth noting that im a very optimistic reader so i rarely if ever will get rid of a book because i havent read it yet i have to say i dont think ive ever regretted getting rid of books unless i lost them after lending them and never got them back but i have definitely regretted not buying books in the first instance
books,not_removed,rare day that ill be in the mood to do this if you have thousands of books you can be choosier ill go into a room and say i need to throw out ten books ill look for something with an obvious flaw or a book that is from an unknown author thats not a first edition yes i have way too many books
books,not_removed,i still have a lot of books but culled my collection a great deal when i last moved my process was uncomplicated i kept only my very favorites and those i knew id been dying to read for years it was relatively simple ive had no regret over it
books,not_removed,there is a great book which is enjoyable for making tidying up all spiritual called the life changing magic of tidying up there are actually some great snippets in there to do books you have to a be strong b take them all out and put them on the floor all of them c hold each one and work out if it brings you joy this is a phrase she keeps coming back to but it is true some books you pick up and they make you happy or make you smile or make you go back in time to a place etc etc if that is the case keep it if not its out i give all my books to charity shops who probably pulp a lot of them to be honest
books,not_removed,i hope to one day to be emotionally ready to get rid of books i do not anticipate that day being anytime soon but i would go through the ones youve read and get rid of the ones you wont ever reread the rest i would read the backs of and look up on goodreads and if they dont sound interesting or get really bad ratings stars or less toss them you can donate them or take them to used book stores and maybe get a little bit for them or do like emma watson and leave them lying around on a subway you could also give some to people you know that read then you can also borrow them or have a giant book yardsale that would be awesome
books,not_removed,i started selling mine just to have less so far ive made about on them making money helps ease the pain im down to maybe a hundred hard copies from about total sad to see them go but the extra cash was welcome
books,not_removed,im anticipating a massive book purge next time im at my parents house where my library currently lives i cant promise my plan will be successful but i think im going to start with the easiest ones at either end and move towards the middle ground so first ill take out all the books i absolutely dont want to keep and all the books i never want to get rid of then repeat the process with the remaining books to be sorted my hope is that it will be manageable because as the decisions get harder the job is also getting smaller
books,not_removed,there is a site called paperbackswap read the rules but you trade books so we would trade pb for hardcover compilations from book clubs not exactly purging but condensing you can also get rid of books you no longer want that way and get more
books,not_removed,im in the process now of moving myself and i am culling my collection most of my hundreds probably a thousand at least of books were gotten from book blogging so i have a crap ton of arcs and review copies of books that i never got around to reading ive gotten rid of books i know i wont read ever and that was about several hundred culled but i still have boxes of books i dont think my boyfriend is keen on having that many boxes move with me so i fear i have to get rid of more books that i do actually want to keep its hard
books,not_removed,i saved a any books that are special editionpicture bookssignedgifts b anything that is not available as an ebook c anything i reread on a regular basis d anything i bought recently and havent gotten to yet owned for more than a year without being read was out everything else out it helped that i was making a major move across the country and that i had recently embraced digital reading sometimes i miss my four bookshelves high and triple stacked on every shelf and if i ever own a big house i will definitely have a physical collection again but really i love reading on my kindle and i love the space i can now fill up with other piles of stuff
books,not_removed,wherehow did you sell them
books,not_removed,i took them to a used bookstore near where i live and sold them there i was shocked they gave me so much other used bookstores ive been to havent offered me the amount they did
books,not_removed,oh at first i thought you meant that the separate stories had been published together in a special edition and i was really confused as to why anyone would put any of those narratives together
books,not_removed,i wouldnt say that exactly the book was ok but it was really far from being scary in any sense the story behind the house was interesting but i remember the pace being way too slow without a decent payoff just my two cents
books,not_removed,so the main character gets sucked to the bottom of the pool and chews his way to safety
books,not_removed,haunted was a sick book i dont think anyone should read it its just gross and not scary in the slightest
books,not_removed,looks cool but a slightly misleading title you gave this as this book is from predating haunted by a bit
books,not_removed,read this story when i was younger and it really freaked me out the necrophilia and cannibalism part is just marvelous you know in a gross and sordid kind of way
books,not_removed,i might also suggest the movie
books,not_removed,i love reading mary shelleys original version of frankenstein when fall rolls around poe too time to start gathering books like a squirrel gathers acorns great post thank you
books,not_removed,as an aside it was written by the same guy who wrote i am legend the short story was a lot more interesting than the will smith film which completely changed the meaning of the phrase i am legend
books,not_removed,maybe not scary but definitely perfect for the weeks leading up to halloween
books,not_removed,tastes like peanut butter
books,not_removed,i lend people that book often and try to be around when i see them reach that point only book that made me feel slightly light headed
books,not_removed,random lesbianism and boobs youve sold me
books,not_removed,really i think its fantastic but im a huge sucker for any classic horror story especially when the leaves start to change
books,not_removed,can you give an example of the grossness without ruining any of the story
books,not_removed,well yes it was written before haunted and well after days thats the idea
books,not_removed,depends on what youre looking for and what you like anything i can judge from
books,not_removed,id recommend richard mathesons book i am legend much different than any of the movies and all the creatures are vampires but the psychological deterioration of the main character is really intriguing and then theres the dog dumb dog
books,not_removed,horns is my favorite book from hill so far though i havent read the fireman yet so youre in good shape with that book id also recommend ghost story and mr x both by peter straub as well as the house next door by anne rivers siddons
books,not_removed,you mean calamari has the texture of peanut butter in condom
books,not_removed,i had a reading group in college and chose guts as my chapter one week one guy actually ran to the bathroom just dry heaving thoughgood times
books,not_removed,it has a lot of grossout content a man chews through his own prolapsed colon another guy gets pieces of wax lodged in his urethra etc
books,not_removed,man chokes to death on another mans severed wiener woman eats her own butt man accidentally cuts off own wiener when he slits the throat of a woman giving him head its not a book about a haunted house and its not scary its more of a cringe story do not not read if you have a weak stomach
books,not_removed,just read it its fantastic
books,not_removed,i understand now i was expecting an anthology or something not that im very bothered
books,not_removed,its been a few years
books,not_removed,i wonder who is down voting us lol anyway i know chuck has said that people have passed out because of guts i doubted it until i read the book so disgustingand such a vivid picture i still feel a little woozy thinking about it he is such an awesome author to give people those feelings i dont know if you are a south park watcher but its like the tale of scrotie mcboogerballs so disgusting and yet no one can put it down how great for that to be the book in your reading group thats awesome
books,not_removed,on purpose just to be clear
books,not_removed,yep i knew i was skirting the edge of title gore
books,not_removed,mile by stephen king books of blood by clive barker and cabal also by barker
books,not_removed,they probably read it and are upset we reminded them of it it was actually a group that just did short stories so we would either bring one we liked or write one for the group i chose to read guts one week we didnt go through the whole book together
books,not_removed,worse things have happened
books,not_removed,haha ive really been getting into short stories lately ive never really been a fan until late might of been an awkward time if you were to read the whole book excellent choice for a short story though
books,not_removed,dl narrol writes historicfiction a steampunk paranormal taste of timetravel
books,not_removed,faulkners the sound and the fury hardest book ive read
books,not_removed,years of solitude its was one of the most difficult books to get through but once i was done i felt like id lived another years
books,not_removed,american psycho
books,not_removed,house of leaves its not even a novel its just mindfuckery condensed into a literary form
books,not_removed,this is going to seem really lame and cliche but gone girl i fell for it hook line and sinker and i was completely blindsided by the reveal i had never felt so manipulated and betrayed by a book before and i loved it i dont blame gillian flynn i blame myself
books,not_removed,flowers for algernon
books,not_removed,battle royale reading every single childs backstory struggle and death the tremendous amount of graphic violence and the thought processes of some of the more fucked up characters really messed with my mind for a while there were times i was so engrossed my heart literally sped up even had a couple nightmares yet i could not put that book down
books,not_removed,for some reason it was lord of the flies by william golding i clearly remember that as a kid i went to see a play and enjoyed it at the time a few years ago i stumbled across the book and didnt hesitate to start reading it i had to force myself to continue because i felt like it was too much for me
books,not_removed,hardboiled wonderland by haruki murakami it tells two stories both are weird the first is a weird mix between science fiction thriller and slice of life of a man always running away from different forces while trying to lift the mystery of a unicorn skull he was given while at the same time the other story is a grotesque fantasy of a man coming into a city without shadows and is forced to leave his own shadow before entering there he is tasked to be the reader of old dreams and hatches a plan to escape this town with his shadow the whole book plays with your expectations while pulling you deeper into the rabbithole a wonderful joyride of twists and turns realities and fantasies and an ending that gets so underplayed it completely fwooshed me but talking about more would crawl into spoilers
books,not_removed,sirens of titan by vonnegut sounds cliche but i just finished it couple weeks ago and i cant help but thing whats the point of all this
books,not_removed,deleted
books,not_removed,lolita by nabokov he looks so in love and at the same time you have to remind yourself he is a disgusting pervert that basically kidnaps and rapes his stepdaughter yet he describes her with such love
books,not_removed,this is the book i read and led me to think that machines will be able to dream in the future do androids dream of electric sheep
books,not_removed,finnegans wake i tried and tried to wade through it over and over again and i hated it every single time then i found the audiobook i cant explain it or even claim i understood it at all but something about the experience of it was simply hypnotic its the closest thing i can imagine to what it would feel like to really be caught inside someone elses dream
books,not_removed,the wasp factory by iain banks
books,not_removed,einsteins dreams was a mind fuck about time and a very enjoyable read
books,not_removed,invisible monsters by chuck palahnuik dragged me out of my cozy middle class upbringing and convinced me to get down in the seedy underbelly of counterculture
books,not_removed,infinite jest is a good shout its difficult obviously but its much more of a emotionalfuck than an intellectfuck also the teleportation accident by ned beauman is an underrated one its about a guy from germany in the who leaves to travel around europe chasing a girl hes in love with its very funny and has six endings because yeah
books,not_removed,i tried reading naked lunch when i was too young to be reading it i never have gone back to finish it its been about fifteen years
books,not_removed,house of leaves i dont like closing the doors in my house anymore
books,not_removed,i mainly read classics so my answet may seem rather uninteresting however when i realized that the lord of the rings series basically tells you the power of the rings from the very beginning i felt like a fool three rings for the elvenkings under the sky seven for the dwarflords in halls of stone nine for mortal men doomed to die one for the dark lord on his dark throne in the land of mordor where the shadows lie one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them in the land of mordor where the shadows lie it tells you the story right there what the rings did to everyone and where they are it gives me chills haha
books,not_removed,never let me go by kazuo ishiguro affected me to a degree that was transcendently bleak
books,not_removed,ishmael it gave me a new worldview
books,not_removed,all quiet on the western front nothing else really has come close for me fiction cant do it the gulag by applebaum didnt affect me anywhere close as much a mans search for meaning wasnt there eli weisel couldnt even do it that book changed me forever
books,not_removed,the unconsoled by kazuo ishiguro still one of my favourite ever novels reading it was like walking through someone elses dream gorgeous novel
books,not_removed,perfume patrick suskind the monk matthew lewis
books,not_removed,hesses steppenwolf particularly the magic theatre section towards the end and gravitys rainbow
books,not_removed,dr suess green eggs and ham
books,not_removed,im currently reading columbine and it is probably the most unnerving book ive ever read especially because its nonfiction i was pretty young when the tragedy took place so i wanted to know why these kids did what they did ive only gotten through about pages or so of it but wow is it an intense read
books,not_removed,the end of i am the messenger by zusak messed me up for like a week i dont know if other people had that reaction but i was just like for several days after its an amazing book
books,not_removed,behind closed doors by b a paris made me feel physically sick at times not because its gorey or anything but because of how real it gets and how scary the situation is haunted by chuck palahniuk almost made me throw up as well it gets so graphic lol but its what you can expect from him i guess haha
books,not_removed,notre dame de paris i was cheering for claude frollo which is kinda messed up others would consider him a disgusting creature in my view he wanted something genuine maybe something out of fates reach also metamorphorsis got me really depressed on a side note i couldnt get through days of sodom since it just didnt resonate with me edit cant believe i forgot this one no longer human by osamu dazai
books,not_removed,perfume the bookmakersthen the film it was my first exp√©rience with studiesscientific horror and fascinating madness how i felt and disgusted and in the need to understand how some human intelligence can conceive and act like that it was beyond all i could understand
books,not_removed,foucaults pendulum by umberto eco
books,not_removed,blood meridian by cormac mccarthy left me breathless it is a beautifully written novel each page filled with dark poetry but dark doesnt even begin to describe the casual horror and the sense of dread that pervades the whole damn book the road left me with a cold emptiness and this single dot of hopeful light at the centre blood meridian has no light but heat
books,not_removed,camus the stranger its one only philisophical books that i really like vonnegut aside i mean i think at least sirens of titan should be in philosophy maybe its a bit of a cop out to cite a seminal text on existentialism i came from a very religious southern baptist family and when i finished the stranger i really had to wrestle with how much sense an uncaring universe made it really goddamn messed with me it just clashed so hard with my religious upbringing but it made so much sense eventually i reconciled it as if life has no meaning we are free to create our own meaning but that took about a month to get there i still have no interest in philosophy but this book really made an impact
books,not_removed,h g wells the island of doctor moreau was pretty fucked up even though it was pretty short fucked up humans and physically deformed creatures
books,not_removed,i have a few and some have been mentioned never let me go by kazuo ishiguro a farewell to arms by ernest hemingway i literally did the same bipolarfueled rant as the main character played by bradley cooper in the film silver linings playbook short of breaking a window i was so fucking angry years of solitude that book broke me over and over again and i still concluded it was gods gift to humanity by kurt vonnegut coraline by neil gaiman the monk by matthew lewis is honestly one of the most fucked up books ever written lolita by vladimir nabokov his writing is somenof the most lyrical and beatiful ive ever read and he draws you in until you sort of sympathise and the you feel revulsion for having bewn drawn into his obsession even a little bit the theban plays by sophocles a clockwork orange by anthony burgess it takes a while to catch on to the language but the content is also crazy fucked and last but not least heart of darkness by joseph conrad a classic that can be translated to many wars and colonisation events and the horror of human need for power and to subjugate those they consider inferiors
books,not_removed,a number of them i guess the most potent mindmesser is dhalgren by samuel r delaney never could find my feet in that novel but never wanted to stop reading it very rare pair of experiences
books,not_removed,the three stigmata of palmer eldritch
books,not_removed,jude the obscure
books,not_removed,hatchet when the pilot dies read as an year old
books,not_removed,sophies choice by william styron
books,not_removed,it didnt exactly fuck me up but stranger in a strange land completely opened up my world view
books,not_removed,blindsight it is what lovecraft would have written if he had a hard science background i would probably go insane if the idea proposed by the book was shown to be correct also in a far less dark way ficciones by borges good stuff
books,not_removed,anything chomsky
books,not_removed,the jungle by upton sinclair i just havent been the same since i finished it it was life changing for me
books,not_removed,anything by phillip k dick has the potential to go in a very surreal direction
books,not_removed,i read atlas shrugged when i was i was a grass roots tea party republican three weeks after finishing the book i turned into a liberal
books,not_removed,so the illuminatus trilogy is a total mindfuck in and of itself however theres a passage where it quotes a chapter and a line from the puppet masters by robert heinlein i forget both the quote and the citation well i happened to have an older copy of the paperback version of that book i looked it up not there so i tried switching the chapter and line numbers the book makes you get paranoid about stuff like that thats where the quote comes from hows that for freaking someone out
books,not_removed,dead mountain by donnie eichar throughly freaked me out and it is all the better because it is a true story
books,not_removed,cant remember the name of the books as they are all stored away at my parents house but it was about people with super powers in a zombie apocalypse and they were the leaders of a civilization that was at war with a spanish gang after finishing that series for months all i could think about was my own continuation of the series and lots and lots of hope for an official book to the series
books,not_removed,maribou stork nightmares by irvine welsh its an interestingb read but it will fuck with your head ive read a lot of his other books but that one and filth stand out
books,not_removed,the things they carried read the short story in college i was halfway though thinking this is dumb its just one big long list of stuff then i finally started feeling the rhythm of the writing if that makes sense i somehow felt the weight of what the soldiers were carrying both physically and emotionally i went out and got the whole book from the library soon after
books,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiswastikanight by katharine burdekin its written in the and its a dystopic tale of what the world would be like if nazis took it over fully its disturbing and covers the power of propaganda and the ways that dehumanization of others steals our own humanity compares it to like its orwellian counterpart this book has the power to send chills down the spine so vividly realised is its vision of things that were to happen and things that might have happened indeed swastika night could almost be seen as a predictive rather than a speculative novel or perhaps a warning from historic reality and imaginative truth and as with nineteen eightyfour a warning worth heeding in a book worth reading
books,not_removed,gantenbein by max frisch inception within inception within inception and nothing is actually happening yet you cant let it be
books,not_removed,the invisibles by grant morrison
books,not_removed,the psychopath test by jon ronson about of the time i spent reading this i thought i was a psychopathsociopath i read this a few years ago when it came out and it made me look at people differently and start to see these traits in people that we dont generally associate them having really great
books,not_removed,swanns way by marcel proust i wasnt prepared for that i abandoned after pages two years later i started fresh and finally finished it
books,not_removed,i recently read senlin ascends by josiah bancroft it takes place in this giant tower where each level is different from the other and on the second levelcalled the parlorvisitors are required to take part in this melodrama play with no audience the whole sequence feels like a fever dream and theres this little twist that made my mouth drop th whole book is amazing but that sequence has to be one of the most unnerving things ive read in a long time the best way i can describe the book is take wizard of oz and combine it with both the bioshock games
books,not_removed,pretty much anything by robert anton wilson
books,not_removed,not exactly in the horror genre though when you think about it still very dark mine would be the singular and extraordinary tale of mirror and goliath by ishbelle bee insanely weird novel that frankly just fucked me up for a little while absolutely loved it though it was like nothing ive ever read before
books,not_removed,the colletor by john fowles the rationalizing that the main character does is just mindnumbing the horrific things he does just seem like logical conclusions from his point of view the workings of a psychotic mind just seems so real and i read it right after elizabeth smart was rescued just chilling
books,not_removed,fight club
books,not_removed,soumission by michel houellebecq
books,not_removed,ditto this i had to make flowcharts of character relationships while i read it
books,not_removed,i was confused then finished a reread came and then i felt hollow
books,not_removed,is it as good as people say it is
books,not_removed,garc√≠a m√°rquez says that faulkner is a big inspiration do you know how it is compared to years of solitude in difficulty with keeping up with whats going on
books,not_removed,people all said bennys part was the most difficult and i guess in terms of timeline it is but the timeline isnt even that important quintens chapter was my favorite and in my opinion the most difficult to actually glean any real insight out of i spent probably three times as long in that section than the rest of the novel
books,not_removed,i couldnt understand what the hell was going on with that one i felt like i had brain damage reading it
books,not_removed,i hear its amazing but the amount of characters and reoccurring names gets confusing fast
books,not_removed,its an absolutely beautiful masterpiece
books,not_removed,i tried it when i was didnt get past the first chapter tried it again years later last year and i could finally understand it a lot better with a little help every once in a while reading chapter by chapter discussions really helped me its a pretty unique book definitely very beautiful images
books,not_removed,i read it just a few months ago and i actually took notes on all the characters mostly how they died which is something i never do it was that complicated and i was definitely put off by some of the content in the first few chapters but by the end it was totally worth it
books,not_removed,i read that book and spent the next week looking at people and wondering what their intestines looked like
books,not_removed,i finished this a little while ago it took a long time because i kept walking away from it i think whats most shocking about it is not the gory detail but the fact that patrick bateman describes these disgusting acts in the same way that ge talks about everything else these rapes and murders are just a normal part of life for him
books,not_removed,reading and loving it right now just hit the point where the text gets fucked up
books,not_removed,i just picked it up looks like a time investment but its been recommended to meet before
books,not_removed,ya this one was pretty hard to pick up at times usually my only time to read is either late at night or in the dark early hours of the morning so i was either waking up to this book or falling asleep to it it messed with me i wouldnt call it a horror book i wouldnt call it a thriller but it messes with you in ways you dont expect
books,not_removed,dont be ashamed of stuff you like man whether its books or music or whatever like what you like and make no apologies i personally think g flynn is a great author her books are all twisted af
books,not_removed,i did too but i thought that was very neat and fun i was really pleased i had gotten so wrapped up in the story i wasnt thinking critically at all just along for the ride
books,not_removed,that book was great but so sad i have an autistic brother so while it def wasnt the same as the main character i wish it was simply that easy to make him better though it teaches the hard lesson of be careful of what you wish for
books,not_removed,what was too much about it
books,not_removed,my dad gave me that book when i was in grade i was reading it in class and one of my teachers took it and threw it away i left that school a few years later

books,not_removed,i read about a month ago and just finished the handmaids tale yesterday id highly recommend it its dystopian fiction but i found it more thought provoking and it left me more messed up i think its because i found the situation in handmaids tale more believable
books,not_removed,its my favorite book but seriously that changed my view of the government for a good long time
books,not_removed,i didnt have much sympathy for him aside from his obvious flaw he was a selfish dick his descriptions seemed more like obsession than love
books,not_removed,this is one of my favorite looks and i completely understand one feels almost sorry and bad over how unrequited his feelings are before remembering he more or less ruined her as much as she did him
books,not_removed,im in the middle of that right now i love it its convinced me to give scifi books another chance
books,not_removed,loved it i was constantly at conflict with who was and was not a robot im still not sure
books,not_removed,i have that book on stand by i want to comprehend i want to know what the fuck people people are talking about but it may just be something that has to be heard aloud and you just have to kind of go with it
books,not_removed,dont read use of weapons save yourself

books,not_removed,where the kid has to swim down into the wreckage of the plane and he finds the pilots body and the pilots skull falls off i think i read that book in junior high and ive never forgotten that part
books,not_removed,i cant read that book or see the movie as a mother of two kids the idea is literally unthinkable my brain just refuses to go there
books,not_removed,ayn rand changes people i read as in my second year of college out of a desire to challenge my leftwing opinions and it was the only book to inspire me for about a month then depress me for a year shes probably the reason i now read summaries of nietzsche instead of engaging with his work for long periods of time ill explain rand is by no means a sadist but her goals within pages are clear to eliminate any conception of the things that arent physically tangible empathy moral codes trusting relationships to paint empathetic intellectuals as miserable idiots who ponder the meaning of life too deeply and finally to offer you an easy comforting solution in capitalism just enjoy your takeaway coffee admire the ingenuity of billboards and work hard if the work is alienating thats your fault family should always be pushed aside as necessary happiness only comes from the fulfillment of ambition so long as taxes exist the rich are the truly oppressed charity is never real good deeds are never real social darwinism is a given et cetera i instantly saw this for what it was the real horror didnt come from accepting rands views because inspiration aside i didnt we learn a long time ago that something like mutual trust doesnt exist objectively but is an emergent property of two human minds that trust each other we know that empathy can impede effeciency or that family can hold you back the real horror was in seeing a complete and utter rejection of human kindness a simple desire to dominate the weak and knowing this is how privileged college kids think that the randloving friends i debated and partied with accepted sociopathic principles as axioms they can extend to their everyday lives that this was an american bestseller and it inspired a generation of cutthroat yuppies who still see kindness and intelligence as mutually exclusive atlas shrugged is meant to depict capitalism our own system in its most ideal form and the result is amoral thinlymasked nihilism what does that say
books,not_removed,by peter clines and it looks like there are officially books in the series so far
books,not_removed,filth is absolutely without doubt one of my favourite books the overlapping narrative voices work so beautifully and i actually think its quite a heartbreaking end for bruce as much as he is an awful piece of shit

books,not_removed,aw man another real human being who read the invisibles i cant believe it
books,not_removed,sparknotes helped me
books,not_removed,theres mud on your trousers now
books,not_removed,yes its a slog but worth it will really test your reading comprehension the first part especially i wont spoil it for you but you have to read it understanding its nonlinear and the perspective its told from is not from one who thinks the way you do youre in the head of one whos brain works very differently from yours
books,not_removed,m√°rquez is easier the biggest problem for many is the names in the buend√≠a family
books,not_removed,if you ever read it get one of the newer editions with the family tree diagram in it
books,not_removed,it definitely does but yes those charts are very very helpful i actually went online and read some breakdowns of certain sceneschapters when i got really mixed up and it made me appreciate it a lot more
books,not_removed,and struggling to figure out which parts if any of it was real or just him imagining it plus the killing of the dog description genuinely upset me
books,not_removed,push through it i just finished it weeks ago it can feel like a slog at times all the footnotes and extra material at the back of the book but its a very satisfying read i would recommend consuming of it as much as you can
books,not_removed,its that feeling you get when youre tricked by a really great twist i wanted to slow clap and just go you sneaky book
books,not_removed,the whole atmosphere was way way too depressing even when boys seemed to work out their own rules of living on the island their interactions were still animallike raw and cruel
books,not_removed,did it have to do with the book itself or the fact that you were reading it in class
books,not_removed,one of the most depressing book ive read i felt empty at the end murakami is really good
books,not_removed,same
books,not_removed,all his books are good to great some will leave you wondering why and others you will absolutely love in my experience sirens wasnt my favorite but enjoyed it none the less if you want a taste of his style which is unique there are plenty of short stories which are wonderful to start off with i listen to one of them on youtube about once a month theyre about min in length
books,not_removed,ive only read but i can honestly say they are each amazing in their own way the beauty of the books was just the first couple of chapters and asking yourself where the hell is this going its not until the end at least from what ive read where you can truly understand what he was conveying totally mind blown
books,not_removed,second handmaids tale ive also just finished oryx and crake margaret atwood has a very unsettling skill that constantly makes me think haha this is a great readbut what if i honestly cant describe the impact that a lot of her work has on me any better than that
books,not_removed,im the other way round i remember reading the first two episodes of ulysses and thinking man this shit is boring nothing like portrait then hitting proteus reading it reading it again then reading it four more times then standing up and saying god i fucking love this book the problem of course with that method is when you read into everything or at least everything you can catch in a book like that you wind up reading about pages over the span of four hours
books,not_removed,imagine a season of the twilight zone with each episode focused on alterations in time or physics instead of the classic twilight zone opening the frame story is einstein trying to come up with this theory of relativity
books,not_removed,its a series of short stories describing worlds where time and physics work differently so basically what are the implications of that for people how does it affect the way we live in questioning very basic aspects of our life that we take for granted it provokes us to reconsider the naturalness of our world
books,not_removed,you should buy it and then let me know what you think
books,not_removed,i feel this i was so sad when i realised the book was gonna end with gately because i really enjoyed the cadence of hals voice and was certain that the conclusion would rest with him i much preferred the tennis crew to the ennet house guys
books,not_removed,tbh the only people days of sodom truly resonates with is probably de sade and pasolini
books,not_removed,thank you for thisive always struggled with clearly articulating both what rand proposed and why i rejected it so vehemently this description pretty much covers it
books,not_removed,i agree with this abundantly for me the breakdown occurred when i unraveled the lie of the selfmade man we owe our persons to those who came before a single man no matter how great will only accomplish so much if abandoned in the rain forest for years if i have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants isaac newton
books,not_removed,fuck i missed so much
books,not_removed,i like the movie but some aspects of the book they just couldnt adapt the parasite stuff was one of my favorite parts of the book
books,not_removed,i didnt feel that there was any hate toward islam in his novel although it certainly paints islam in a controversial light
books,not_removed,i definitely had spark notes to help me after i finished each story i dont know how anyone can write that way it amazes me
books,not_removed,hush
books,not_removed,ya i stopped after pages ive read all of irvine welshs books because i know the scots accent but it seemed some of the characters in the sound and fury were taking a different language altogether i just could not follow what was happening
books,not_removed,the second part was way more challenging
books,not_removed,haha thankfully im mexican so that wasnt much of a problem most of all the repetition but i tried reading war and peace so i can see where theyre coming from
books,not_removed,because he started the post with this is going to sound lame and cliche and there is a tendency with some people in the lit world to denounce anything that is popular as being bad and those who enjoy it as being dumb
books,not_removed,yes and i never ever call anything except recently i was listening to the foundation novels and i called a major character revel before it happened i was so stoked
books,not_removed,im reading it myself right now i was actually going to comment this book so im glad someone else did i really enjoy how you see the clear progression of savagery overcome the boys starting with jack and spreading to the others its hard because as much as youd like to shake off goldings point of the true evil nature of boys we all know its true
books,not_removed,i was reading during our reading time she thought i got it from an grader and said i wasnt old enough to read it my dad got me a new one and told the teacher i was allowed to read it
books,not_removed,i know ive always heard people refer to her work as speculative fiction and it makes a ton of sense now that ive read something of hers is oryx and crake good im considering reading it after i knock some other books off my list
books,not_removed,wow i really like this description never looked at it through the lens of twilight zone but this works very well
books,not_removed,its also structured like a journal where each date is a world on which time acts differently what if time went in reverse or time moved differently based on proximity to a person or object each day gives the reader a different glimpse into how time works in that particular world its not for everyone but i found the book very enjoyable its a fairly short book and a very quick read
books,not_removed,will do edited to remove extreme excitement
books,not_removed,i enjoyed the film too but i agree with you the parasite didnt work for me and i feel they really downplayed the whole carol narrative to accommodate the bladesybruce relationship dont get me wrong the amsterdam scenes were often as hilarious as they were dark but overall meh i think there was a lot more that could have been done to do justice to the book
books,not_removed,you stopped at the wrong part the first narrator is mentally handicapped but his narration doesnt go much past pages the other narrators are easier to understand excepting quintin possibly for the opposite reason
books,not_removed,not just language but temporal structure too faulkner wrote sf at a time in the when he and others notably woolf were experimenting with nonlinear writing
books,not_removed,i really enjoyed oryx and crake and i think speculative fiction is spot on if youre interested in the consequences of genetic modification the hijinks of big pharma social conditioning etc oddly enough despite all that its a little lighter than handmaids tale i thought so anyway would definitely recommend it
books,not_removed,theyre still difficult to read after that
books,not_removed,its totally open for interpretation but it sounded like he said this is lame to kind of soften the blow of what people may think of him for mentioning the book possibly because of the reasons i stated i dont think its lame i enjoyed gone girl too
books,not_removed,sweet thanks ill add it to the long list of books i have to check out at some point
books,not_removed,second oc really made me think about the repurcussions of humans meddling with their surroundings highly recommend
books,not_removed,this subject has been very popular in the past please use reddit search andor check the rbookswikifaq
books,not_removed,neil gaiman and clive barker are both great goodreads is a good website to look for book recommendations based on authors you like
books,not_removed,so youll never run out of stephen king hes extremely prolific but also read joe hill who happens to be stephen kings son but is an excellent horrorthriller writer in his own right also look at hp lovecraft the father of all modern horror and then go to donnie ray pollack and cormac mccarthy who write stories about completely depraved people not supernatural but really fucking good cormac mccarthy is a master of depravity if you like vampires and other supernatural creatures anne rice is really good btw this is all fiction nonfiction would be stories that are true and not made up have fun
books,not_removed,many contend that its a thriller and not a horror but either way by john fowles is absolutely chilling king himself referenced and quoted it in misery i cant say anything more without spoiling it in some way by walter tevis was a pretty fascinating read kind of like fahrenheit only good by douglas adams simply fantastic by john lindqvist maybe you saw the movie but the book is out of this world and its definitely worth a read regardless its one of those books that expresses with perfect clarity the darkest and ugliest side of humanity those are really the best i can recommend from my memory
books,not_removed,if you like horror and stephen king why not read some of the people who inspired him shirley jackson is a great horror author who wrote the haunting of hill house and richard matheson should be another great choice try some classic horror novels like frankenstein which holds up surprisingly well even though it was written in the early century what i do sometimes when i cant figure out what to read next is google best books of and see what comes up head to the library and see if you can get it ive found some great reads that way
books,not_removed,have you tried many of kings nonhorror stories yet a decent amount of them will help you step across into new worlds a random sampling of my favorites from him dark tower series talisman black house insomnia the shining tommyknockers the talismanblack house books might lead you towards books that focus on worldhopping or alternate dimensions sm stirlings conquistador although his emberverse started pissing me off because it didnt ever resolve anything terry pratchett and stephen baxters the long earth series or maybe neil gaimans neverwhere insomnia might lead you towards a world with hidden depths like neil gaimans american gods and anansi boys or the aforementioned neverwhere kings penchant for youthful protagonists getting into creepy and semirealistic situations comes through in robert mccammons boys life after those you can sort of wander around and find other stories of weird events and strange things alan dean fosters into the out of is a good one if i could see more of my bookshelf from where i was sitting i might be able to point to more locations but that should be enough to start a conversation at least
books,not_removed,an easy hop from stephen king for me was philip k dick a scanner darkly do androids dream of electric sheep and the three stigmata of palmer eldritch are awesome scifi books from him if you like those maybe try branching out to william gibson nueromancer and count zero are splendidly written immersive cyber punk novels
books,not_removed,my favorite author to recommend to horror fans is shirley jackson her novel we have always lived in this castle is a personal favorite id also encourage you to read the collector by john fowles as for sci fi octavia butlers dawn and arthur c clarkes childhoods end are the stories that sparked my interest in the genre
books,not_removed,h p lovecraft was an outstanding horror writer but dont restrict yourself to one genre go to the library and take out books youve heard about you never know when youll make a great discovery
books,not_removed,try his son joe hill hes got some decent stuff out there similar genre but with a different style
books,not_removed,for scifi id say hitchhikers guide to the galaxy such a fun read
books,not_removed,not horror or scifi per se but since youre trying to branch out let me suggest you something from their neighbor genre fantasy terry pratchetts discworld series quite a huge library that will sadly see no further growth and very different from most other fantasy series and for horror i would suggest the works of china meiville like perdido street station though you could say these are more weird fiction than horror
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,lots of great suggestions here the collector has peeked my interest i did a quick search on the book and discovered the book itself is credited for inspiring several serial killers if that isnt intriguing then i dont know what is
books,not_removed,it was never meant to be taken at face value but to be banned thats a little over the top
books,not_removed,check out from a couple of weeks ago
books,not_removed,well that looks like an unbiased source
books,not_removed,removed has already been posted several times including since the news first came up
books,not_removed,i think it was meant to be taken seriously and its an interesting book but it needs to be taken with a rather large grain of salt but thats no reason to ban it ive read lots and lots of books worse confessions of an economic hitman was really bad but maybe its my fault for not knowing it was a conspiracy theory book
books,not_removed,but i dont like reading it could very well be possible that you dont like reading its not that youve havent found something you enjoy or youre not reading properly etc your brain might just be set up to absorb stories differently have you tried audio books
books,not_removed,start with something really easy that wont require a whole lot of thinking but you can enjoy for example a lot of people liked fifty shades because it was mindless entertainment for them there are tons of good mystery crime and romance series out there that will allow you to get attached to the characters and want to continue reading without being too technical you dont have to read war and peace in your first few months start slow and easy and have patience with yourself
books,not_removed,im going to give you three recommendations of novels that i really enjoy i think these have a simple style thats pretty easy to follow and good pacing i reread these often you may like them you may not the first two are short the third is extremely long but i think its the best pageturner of all time good luck mother night by kurt vonnegut a wild sheep chase by haruki murakami and the count of monte cristo by alexandre dumas
books,not_removed,good lord id never suggest cormac mccarthy to anyone who doesnt know what theyre getting into start with something fun not funny but fun or at least something that wont make you want to kill yourself you want a great book set in the old west try lonesome dove by larry mcmurtry its huge but its wonderful and full of characters that zing and action and heart and pain theres also an amazing miniseries adaptation to watch afterwards or little big man by thomas berger which is absurd but also full of heart and fun and tragedy and it was made into a great movie with dustin hoffman again to watch afterwards if you want deadwood by pete dexter with the same setting as the hbo show those i just listed are all incredibly wellwritten and critically acclaimed so im not suggesting you start with some fun pulp trash or anything you do need to find the right types of books at least until youve got the habit for reading it might take a bit of trial and error to find what that is if theres another type of story that interests you let us know youll get the best suggestions if we have an idea of what you like mystery adventure science fiction etc and if you think youd be pulled in by character or plot or theme or setting
books,not_removed,this isnt math where one or a few answers damn statistics could be solved with just changing a few variables try sitting or read when you are full of food ect to make you enjoy it forcing yourself may not be the best way for you to assimilate to reading culture to me reading is an art of its own having the discipline to sit and read and stay concentrated on a single topic is nirvana do you drink tea try to find some positive correlations with reading i think you are trying to hard to reap the reward immedtietly its not going to happen forcefully like captivating a girl its best if it is nonchalant and romantic and spontaneous its like reading you read some and you lose some try to stick to a schedule for days months science shows this forms a habit i have been reading professionally for several years now and i speak from experience if this fails then you have to seek guidance once more
books,not_removed,try short stories especially ones in collections where you get a lot of different styles and voices you can also find stories in magazines like the new yorker i first read george saunders there and now i read everything of his also try pulp writers in genres like crime and science fiction just because theyre quick and easy reads doesnt mean theyre written poorly finally you might try long form magazine articles thats how i first got back into reading after years of not doing so check out the best american magazine writing collections that are put out every year they also publish them for short stories essays etc
books,not_removed,i love to write what do you enjoy writing try a book or short story or article thats on a similar topic
books,not_removed,this subject has been very popular in the past please use reddit search andor check the rbookswikifaq
books,not_removed,i second the idea of trying audio books you can probably access a free data base of audio books through your public library i like to listen to audio books at the normal speed an option in the listening app it keeps my brain more engaged but it might be counter productive if you get distracted because youll miss more of whats happening maybe novels just arent your thing have you tried a book of short stories i love the original sherlock holmes mysteries you could also try a nonfiction popular science book id suggest something by malcolm gladwell he uses a lot of interesting real world examples to make his points
books,not_removed,tried reading slaughterhouse five once didnt turn out that well havent heard of a wild sheep ill look into it also ive tried the count before way too long language was basically incoherent for me sorry
books,not_removed,slaughterhouse five is written in a relatively simple style but the story itself is convoluted as hell with timetraveling and meta commentary and aliens mother night is way more straightforward and i actually prefer it a wild sheep chase is not a classic like the other two its just a a quirky story thats a lot of fun if youd like to cut your teeth on some nonfiction you could try anthony bourdains kitchen confidential its so unbelievable at times that it feels like fiction take care
books,not_removed,no its not a spoiler that bit becomes evident very quickly
books,not_removed,there is so much going on this book it would be tough to spoil even if i spelled out the ending for you its so fucking bizarre that without having read it first it wouldnt necessarily make sense i always thought pennywise the clown as a manifestation of fear itself is really just a bogeyman living in a world that is inherently violent and scary the fears that all the children experience clowns mummies monsters and such pale in comparison to the real and actual horrors that occur among regular people i loved this book one of kings best and a stellar example of what it means to merge the tragedy of human suffering with the fantastical lifeexperience of children
books,not_removed,the book is still on my book case waiting to be read
books,not_removed,im currently reading it such a long book the longest ive ever read in fact im on page and i still got more to go fortunately its really entertaining and i cant put it down my favourite kings work so far ive already read carrie and pet sematary
books,not_removed,nah man thats just the very basics of it you got a real good experience to come keep on reading
books,not_removed,no thats like saying star wars is about battles in space the clown is the headline but its about loads of other stuff isolation friends being different small town corruption etc etc
books,not_removed,my favorite book enjoy
books,not_removed,the worst fears bit is irrelevant since it becomes obvious super quickly
books,not_removed,nah youre good keep reading and enjoy
books,not_removed,try salems lot next
books,not_removed,now now
books,not_removed,the dark tower series is so damm good a great lineup of i believe or books that will keep you ecstatic about being buried in text
books,not_removed,what now now what
books,not_removed,it is of my favorite reads as wellso scary one of the few books that actually gave me shivers ending wasa trip to say the least still dont know how i feel about it all
books,not_removed,please dont spoil it
books,not_removed,moby dick was about a whale nothing has been spoiled
books,not_removed,just pick your own books you never get anything worth your time in these boxes
books,not_removed,i like the ones that are just books like book of the month or bookdrop the prices are comparable to amazon and it may encourage you to read something you normally wouldnt the bookish goodies pretty much go straight to the thrift store
books,not_removed,no library of america
books,not_removed,i lay in bed for an entire week and read the whole thing it brought me out of a depression i was struck by the fluidity of story everything was so connected and fleshed out it felt real which i think is what vonnegut was getting at it is so much like life that if you pay attention and put yourself inside it and the characters you have to learn something to me it sounds like you read it with too much expectation like you were constantly searching for some answers that dont exist i always like to say that the meaning of life is to reconcile with the fact that there is no meaning and i think the brothers karamazov is quite the example of that love murder family business religion whatever
books,not_removed,knowing a bit of the historical context and dostoevskys life helps you grasp the book and its main themes much easier the fatherson and the societyindividual relationships are at the heart of the story their redemption is the goal of the book at the time a new doctrine of nihilism was emerging from the ruins of incomplete social reforms and the shortfalls of new individualistic philosophies the author gives a symbol of a falling family to warn the society of this creeping new pestilence which subverts good morals and basic human decency and brings to light the narrowminded selfserving and destructive egoism he paints a gloomy and dark picture of the human condition and illuminates all the impulses and instincts which people keep locked but no amount of pretended civility and virtue can tame technically the plot is well thoughtout and structurally very cohesive he is considered a master both stylistically and as a psychologist
books,not_removed,heres the deal its just a book its gonna mean something different to anybody who reads it i cant tell you what the meaning of it is however maybe it will help you to hear what the brothers karamazov means to me i dont know about where you live but century america can seem pretty devoid of any real quest for meaning the brothers karamazov presents a different world a world in which people give a darn about things the brothers karamazov presented a unique way of looking at the world with its multitude of sensitive thoughtful philosophical characters and a constant stream of analysis of essentially everything on earth from various moral perspectives the brothers karamazov said life doesnt have to be just life everything is worth picking apart and then trying to rearrange into a meaningful image with philosophical significance i dont think there really was any conclusive moment when you were handed the meaning of life you know all the characters were on a different journey and came to different conclusions and its unclear which of those were correct as someone else said i dont think fyodor himself was sure what he wanted to say he seemed like a very confused and conflicted person who wanted to reach the final answer but never did but if i had to credit any book with bringing me closer to being able to find the meaning of life on my own it would be the brothers karamazov hope this didnt just sound silly
books,not_removed,i think any of dostoevskys works and frankly most of the older classics dont have any single point its an expression of life in all its ugliness beauty nonsense and logic i dont think dostoevsky himself knew what he wanted to say or at least he didnt have one goal throughout the novel he wandered as do readers but one great thing about this is that it makes the book very much rereadable the brothers karamazov remains one of my favorite novels because of how well every character is humanized as you said and the grand inquisitor section is truly beautiful its no wonder they print and sell that as its own book
books,not_removed,i read it as a philosophicalmoral dilemma you have dimitri emotional passionate fully immersed in life and all its pleasures but in the end it leads ultimatly to his downfall the you have iwan smart literate but his genius lets him question the order of the world he lives in god etc he becomes cynical cold melanchonic and depressed and finally aljoscha who is calm friendly moral a devout christian etc the whole book is basically a battle between their philosophies but its not simply black and white but everything is grey it questions what it means to be good can we be good without god i think the scene between aljoscha and iwan in the caf√© is the true climax of the story should we follow our passions or restrict ourselfs for the greater good should we follow a lie if its a noble lie should we aspire to a new order or be content with what we have etc etc good god i gotta read this book again if only it wasnt so massive
books,not_removed,i imagine reading pages per day would make any novel less affecting i mean by the time youre halfway through it youve likely already forgotten most everything but the barebones of the story i think by the time youve finished a book reading it that slowly youre not going to be able to catch all of the little connections and details that make works that this one powerful
books,not_removed,i only finished it when listened to it as an audio book when i tried to read it as print i found it slowed in the middle to the point where i lost interest and put it aside when i did try it again years later the character of the father fyodor pavlovich karamazov struck me immediately he reminded me of this wack job who i met and found insufferable but fascinating from a distance theres a reason why more than one person i know took him to court criminal or civil its good to keep a buffer when dealing with crazy people that connection the way the fictional character from another century another world had a real world modern parallel kept me going to finish it congrats at finishing it at all fwiw i still dont know what to make of it but that doesnt seem to matter maybe dostoyevsky didnt know either crazy russian fuck that he was mario puzo through the character of osano in fools die lamented at the way the century fiction writers had their audience by the balls do to the lack of options no radio movies tv etc and could take their own time keep that in mind too
books,not_removed,you think tbk was an example that there is no meaning to life the book painted a picture that life was suffering but that you should live your life in ways to try to go about and reduce suffering for yourself and others that is why alyosha is the hero of the book in dostoevskys eyes
books,not_removed,interesting answer i completely get what you mean by the fluidity of it all i remember the prosecutor making a statement during his speech at the end of the trial referring to dmitris story of the amulet he said something like he was like an author with a great vision he was able to write a book that reflected it but when critics looked at the details he simply told them not to squabble over such trifles i read that and thought about how there were no trifles with bk every little detail was done just right i think part of why it took me so long was just that the first half felt like nothing was happening for a lot of it once fyodor was murdered i finished the second half of the book in about two weeks anyway i appreciate your point of view
books,not_removed,it didnt its a very interesting and i think accurate analysis of the book thanks
books,not_removed,right so to clerify two things first i wasnt reading two pages a day it was more like reading pages a day for a week then putting it down for a couple months then picking it back up again second im not saying that i didnt enjoy the story i actually enjoyed it quite a lot im more just uncertain what to make of the general purpose of the story why did dostoevsky feel the need to tell the story of fyodor pavolovics murder and why did he need to do so in such excruciating detail
books,not_removed,i clearly said that there was a meaning to life the meaning of life is to reconcile with the fact that there is no meaning its intentionally paradoxical to point out the confusing chaotic nature of existence i would say that alyoshas care for others is his reconciliation in the face of pointless suffering he chooses to bring light in the void of meaning he creates some
books,not_removed,theres a lot of exposition in the first half but writing a great book is like building a great building you need to reinforce the walls before you can keep adding stories if he hadnt spent so much time detailing each character i think it would be your run of the mill detective story instead everyone is as you said fleshed out you can feel bad for smerdykov because his father was a pos but you also hold him accountable for trying to get his revenge by destroying of his brothers in his quest for revenge similarly you feel bad for ivan because maybe he couldve stopped everything before it went to hell if he had just cared a little more about his brothers but how was he to guess such evil was underfoot
books,not_removed,i dont see how that makes logical sense whenever you ask what is the meaning of life one should ask is there something you should be aiming at as tbk suggests each character including alyosha has their contradictions and suffering if pain or pointless suffering as you put it i dont think its pointless makes you doubt the meaning of life then the cessation of pain and suffering should be the proper rebuttal thats why i suggested why life was suffering furthermore if there is one thing you should be aiming at in life reduce suffering i think this was the more prominent message of the book rather than just accept that life is meaningless
books,not_removed,i may be way off as i only seen the episode once few years ago but after the prison incident where the governor went off by himself didnt he notice the name brian theriot could be wrong on the last name written on a wall and so he used that as his name when introducing himself to people to not let anyone know his real name again i could be wrong just trying to shed some light
books,not_removed,so far in the book theres two brothers named brian and phillip thanks for the reminder though l forgot about that part
books,not_removed,it will make sense at the end last line of the book if i remember correctly
books,not_removed,around by poc by women
books,not_removed,no idea im more concerned with whether or not a book sounds like a good read than i am with the sex or the ethnicity of the author i dont even check the authors bio unless ive finished the book and am interested in finding more from them so it could be or it could be looking at the authors whose works ive devoured this year its somewhere in there its a meaningless statistic thankfully as anyone can write a good book regardless of sex or upbringing
books,not_removed,i still read mainly white authors but i have been trying to spread out the viewpoints im taking in a bit and have been intentionally picking up more books by nonwhitenonamericanorbritish authors of books were by authors who are not white and of the books on my toread pile on my coffee table are by nonwhite authors is translated from korean
books,not_removed,given that i am black and literary fiction and classics are my jam the majority of my reads were written by white folks i have completed books so far this year by nonwhite authors originally not in english by women the fact that i mostly read literary fiction and classics has something to do with the lack of diversity in my reading when it comes to race ive found that when people of color are published their books tend not to be about what i want to read which depresses me because i want to support them specifically i feel like i really should read more black authors but most of the literary fiction published by black authors tends to be about immigration race civil rightsslavery or the struggle and i am just burnt out on all those things its essentially the only damn narrative were allowed to have in the media and im just over that being our only stories because we have so much more to tell books about african immigrants trying to make it in america just dont do it for me and i get annoyedbored americanah did this to me and books about the slave tradecolonialismrace drain the fuck out of me and not in a good way homegoing did this to me but these are the sorts of stories publishing wants to publish when it comes to black literary fiction sometimes there can be a spin on these themes like with helen helen oyeyemis boy snow bird that i can really really get enjoy but i found that this doesnt happen often in general most of my reading has been pretty britishamericancentric and its difficult to break that im apparently pretty damn good at reading books by women though which excites me i didnt actually plan to have such a female heavy year and of the books in my to read pile at home the majority of those are women as well
books,not_removed,i was wondering the same thing earlier this year so i took a tally and came up with about women and foreign or minority authors only one lgbt book this year meant to do more but got caught up in other business of course theres always some judgment involved and the question about how much it matters one of the authors im reading now dan clark is a us citizen born in japan to a japanese mother but i didnt know that when i started the book and his heritage isnt a big part of the story if i were to give him a label tv star athlete and addict would come well before asian american
books,not_removed,because im not white i did read some authors of color as well but never my color ive definitely read some translations this year though i dont know how i feel about them i always feel like im missing something by reading a translation but english is the only language i can read i can speak others
books,not_removed,what am i an accountant
books,not_removed,not sure about the percentage but ive been working through marquez borges and bolano in spanish my wife is from argentina so ive been studying spanish since we got married words seem to stick with me when i read them in their context rather than on note cards
books,not_removed,i read the books that i find interesting im a sucker for a good story but it just so happens that of books ive read this year are by white men it doesnt mean anything those are just the books im interested in
books,not_removed,like i applaud you for wanting to reach out and experience new and different perspectives not sure why that is tough though
books,not_removed,ive read books so far this year and am currently working on a brief history of seven killings by the black jamaican author marlon james authors who are not white things fall apart by chinua achebe the autograph man by zadie smith two years eight months and twentyeight nights by salman rushdie authors who are not white in translation the vegetarian by han kang white authors in translation candide or optimism by voltaire the hundred year old man who climbed out of the window and disappeared by jonas jonasson the latecomer by dimitri verhulst the reader on the by jeanpaul didierlaurent foucaults pendulum by umberto eco look whos back by timur vermes honourable mentions for lloyd jones author of mister pip from new zealand and two or three of the illustrators who worked on graphic novels i read so im just over on white english speaking authors pretty similar to you i gave all of the above at least three stars on goodreads so they may be worth you looking into if there are any you havent read
books,not_removed,unless i like the works of the author enough to follow their blog andor look them up on wikipedia all i have to go by regarding their ethnicity is their name which really isnt much as a result i really dont have any particular idea about this that said since im indian around of what i read is written by someone of a different ethnicity
books,not_removed,i never really consider this an issue its interesting to see how people discuss it and see authors mentioned that are offering other perspectives but i cant say id ever even consider this a driving force towards reading a certain text
books,not_removed,not many this year unfortunately i do love reading diversely though and have books on my shelf or on my wishlist that would fit the bill
books,not_removed,out of books read so far by women authors by nonwhite authors by nonenglish speaking authors there is some overlap in these categories eta not going to list all the books by women but here are the other ones nonwhite englishspeaking kindred by butler octavia e the kizuna coast by massey sujata the school for good and evil books and by chainani soman the fall of rome by southgate martha rich and pretty by alam rumaan nonenglish speaking the dinner by koch herman german from bruges with love by aspe pieter flemish solitary the crash captivity and comeback of an ace fighter pilot by romm giora hebrew snowpiercer terminus by bocquet olivier french windpinball two novels by murakami haruki japanese native dispatches from an israelipalestinian life by kashua sayed hebrew and so is the bus jerusalem stories by birstein yossel hebrew war and turpentine by hertmans stefan flemish the end of days by erpenbeck jenny german rhinoceros and other plays by ionesco eug√®ne french the invoice by karlsson jonas swedish styx by dhooge bavo flemish the subsidiary by celed√≥n mat√≠as spanish
books,not_removed,for me its because im polish and i havent read any polish books this year i dont really care about where an author is from though
books,not_removed,looking strictly at authors its books total it drops to around since i got into a couple of series i started being intentional a few years ago about choosing who i read after noticing that of what i read was whitemaleamericanbritish i certainly didnt think that group was just better at writing its been great for me so far
books,not_removed,ive read quite a few nonwhite authors recently and in some cases i really dont know its easier to list the books written in other languages the man with the compound eyes by wu mingyi author is taiwanese man tiger by eka kurniawan author is indonesian a planet for rent by yoss cuban hardboiled wonderland and the end of the world by haruki murakami japanese albina and the dogmen by alejandro jodorowski chilean under the frangipani by mia couto mozambican the threebody problem and the dark forest by liu cixin chinese escape from baghdad by saad z hossain bangladeshi but oops written in english yeah mostly sf and fantasy or magical realism which usually means fantasy not written in english this is from the past year
books,not_removed,about women nonwhite and originally published in a language other than english slightly skewed by my reread of asoiaf running into this year so it was also george rr martin edit math mistake
books,not_removed,good question it made me curious about my stats for the year im at nonwhite either nonwhite or not originally in english women i have definitely been making an effort this year to add some diversity to my reading but youre right it is hard lets see if i can do better next year
books,not_removed,well im swedish and i read books in english by authors who have books published in english their ethnicity or other group belonging has no importance to me it can be a transgender gay chinese dwarf for all i care i care about what they write
books,not_removed,that i know of i dont feel like going through all the books i read to see if the author is white or not
books,not_removed,looking at my list for this year it looks like the only books i read by someone who wasnt a white american or british person were sapiens a brief history of humankind by yuval noah harari and a wild sheep chase by haruki murakami thats out of books which includes all the graphic novels ive read this year as well
books,not_removed,i only read about from translations this year but a few years ago i read about translations for that year it must have been of what i read
books,not_removed,i made a bit of an effort to read some books that were originally in another language but i had a lot of books i wanted to read this year so after a few i kind of forgot out of the books ive read this year the following were translated the lifechanging magic of tidying up by marie kondo a nonfiction book about throwing away most of your stuff the vegetarian by han kang a short horror novel paprika by yasutaka tsutsui a surreal scifi novel about lucid dreaming theres a really great anime film based off it
books,not_removed,authors from a different country but authors from countries that speak a different language than me aka not english different race by men i dont really pay much attention to where the authors are from when im looking for books so its kind of interesting to see how it turned out i also read a lot of scififantasy so it doesnt always effect the setting of the book or anything im thinking about trying to do the read around the world thing so i read more books by authors from different places and learn more about the different places in the process
books,not_removed,ive read books so far this year of them by women and by poc only were translated from their original language
books,not_removed,say hello to rnoveltranslations its mostly web serials rather than books but it pretty makes up most to all of my reading
books,not_removed,if manga counts more than if not probably something low i read underground railroad by colson whitehead i really hope that isnt the only black author i read this year i would feel super white because underground railroad is the book all white people say they read this year to sound cultured edit i just recalled i read the recentlyconcluded chinese scifi trilogy the three body problem over the summer it was cool seeing the cultural differences especially when they talk about chinas birth restriction laws and act like the rest of the world is stupid for not having them too
books,not_removed,i started keeping a spreadsheet a few years ago for this when i started in i was worse off than where you are authors of colour nonamerican female suboptimal to say the least ive read books in so far currently im at female authors of colour nonamerican im finishing up three books simultaneously right now that are by nonwhite nonamerican authors and two of them are by female authors so that will bring the numbers up a bit more my goal is to be mf americannon whitepoc for once you start paying attention it gets easier as you go the first part is hard but as you discover new areas and genres that you like its a lot more satisfying the hardest thing for me is still reading nonamericancentric just as a factor of where i live for i think my challenge to myself will be to cut out white american male authors or at least not include them in my reading goal for the year its just so easy to fall into them and i want to break the habit
books,not_removed,since i started counting my books in midmay and ignoring books which were rereads
books,not_removed,no idea i dont pay attention to an authors color creed nationality or sex and i think doing so or buying a book because oh some japanese bisexual wrote this or oh some american white guy wrote this is pretty silly and feels like just something you can say at dinner parties to sound super liberal etc i dunno my favorite author at the moment is a different sex to me if that means anything
books,not_removed,ive been making a big effort to read books by authors who either arent white or were originally published in a language other than english but why whats your motive your goal
books,not_removed,wtf theyre even trying to make rbooks more diverse now
books,not_removed,nice work
books,not_removed,absolutely anyone can write a good book the issue is how many of those good books make it to the mainstream
books,not_removed,yeah that is a fantastic result for women i reread a bunch of roald dahls this year so my previously about women dropped down to about an even split i can understand entirely how that must be really draining for you as well it does seem like a lot of the books i read by poc tend to be immigration stories discrimination stories or slavery stories as well i really enjoy chinese literature but a lot of that is very much tied into the cultural revolution as well i think there absolutely needs to be more space for poc authors to just right standard fiction i have read some pretty good examples this year i really liked the vegetarian by han kang korean book winner of the international man booker prize i just finished the fifth season by n k jemisin which was a fantasyscifi breath of fresh air i also really liked the australian historical romance barbed wire and cherry blossoms by aboriginal author anita heiss but yeah i agree totally that there is a gap
books,not_removed,this is exactly my problem with books by poc that i alluded to in my comments above ive already lived it i really dont want to read more about it in a way reading american classics that my teachers at school said all of your parents read mine didnt is getting out of my worldview i dont understand the white experience it baffles me completely so reading mainstream books might piss me off half of the time because of the inclusion of token poc but i need to know
books,not_removed,yeah thats an interesting pointand maybe society at large isnt quite at the point where ethnic identity is irrelevant
books,not_removed,yeah i wonder about what might get missed when you read a translation i feel like you have to really put a lot of faith in the translator and just hope they get it right do you think its a lack of published authors in your colour or just circumstance that you didnt read any
books,not_removed,thats a really good idea years ago i tried to read harry potter in indonesian but the vocab was so hectic i abandoned it
books,not_removed,you might find other peoples books are also interesting if you give them a go
books,not_removed,because historically white people and white men especially have been far more likely to be published and to have the marketing investment put into them to get popular especially in countries like the us and uk admittedly this seems to be becoming less and less the case but thats only going to have a significant accidental impact on your reading if you read exclusively new fiction
books,not_removed,i think its just tough because obviously in the past ive read mostly books by white authors just by default maybe that means that im biased in my choices or maybe it means that white writers dominate the publishing industry is pretty impressive would be very interested to see what was on your list
books,not_removed,thanks so much for sharing ive read some but some look really good
books,not_removed,on the flipside there is some fantastic indian literature out there a lot of indian authors have gotten recognition via the man booker prize
books,not_removed,wow heaps ive never heard of straight to goodreads
books,not_removed,im not sure ive ever read a polish book
books,not_removed,yeah thats an amazing result theres some really great stuff out there just takes a bit more effort to fine
books,not_removed,i really really want to read murakami and cixin i also really want to read man tiger but in bahasa indonesia im fluent so itd be a great opportunity to read the original text some great recommendations in there
books,not_removed,thats still a great result
books,not_removed,there are some absolutely fantastic graphic novels written by diverse authors
books,not_removed,ive seen the film paprika and it is out of control how did the book hold up also how good was the vegetarian
books,not_removed,id definitely say that ive seen different groups of people write scififantasy differently btw the worlds they create the way they characterize their heroes tend to be vastly different theres some discussions in rfantasy about this
books,not_removed,yeah by men is quite high but fantasyscifi is often dominated by men so maybe thats why
books,not_removed,good result on women
books,not_removed,exactly
books,not_removed,excellent thank you
books,not_removed,i think manga counts youre getting someone elses perspective
books,not_removed,ooh an entire year without white american male authors sounds like itll be mindbending
books,not_removed,ah i didnt exclude rereads i think my result would be a bit better if i did i did a roald dahl reading challenge this year
books,not_removed,id be interested to see what youre actual results were though how random is your reading really
books,not_removed,not op but a few reasons come to mind for me cultural education is a big one id love to travel the world but on my budget books will have to do i also think youd get a very different image of say ghana from a native ghanaian than youd get from an american academic ones not necessarily better than the other but theyd almost certainly be different because each author brings his values and assumptions to the table a writers background can affect their writing in more subtle ways too when men write a detective story its generally centered on the detective a tough guy who doesnt shy away from direct confrontation recent femalewritten noir focuses more on the victim the relationship she had with the killer and often a long period of psychological abuse before the physical violence escalated nordic noir is more of a procedural where a detective probably facing or just coming off of some personal crisis plods through the daytoday work to piece together someones secret past each group and each person takes the genre in a different direction based on their experiences and values probably the most important reason is just to try new things if you dont push your boundaries theyll push on you branching out doesnt have to be about nationality or ethnicity one could also diversify by genre time period political stance or probably a lot of other factors
books,not_removed,for me reading is as much about novelty and originality as it is about quality i love experiencing new things and im very interested in reading different perspectives learning about different cultures and experiences and building up my own empathy and understanding of the world i also like supporting new authors who might not have a lot of recognition yet despite their work being high quality
books,not_removed,they
books,not_removed,i have the vegetarian on my list i grew up in and live in predominately white areas attended predominately white schools im so used to being othered by the people around me that reading immigration stories or those focused heavily on raceracism just makes me wearier im too tired being othered to read about characters being othered i really liked the wongs vs the world because while the dad and step mother were immigrants and the kids were secondgeneration asians the book really focused on how this family handled the change in their fortunes due to the financial crisis i could really get into that and thats more the sort of stuff i wish would be published when it came to pocs i want books where their cultureraceethnicity is part of them but doesnt completely inform the framing of the narrative or is the only narrative
books,not_removed,see my life as pretty pretty whitewashed in that ive lived in predominantly white neighborhoods for most of my life every school i attended starting at age was predominantly white im now so i feel like i have a fair understanding of the white experience in america because its mostly what i know and have seen i just get so drained by books that focus on race and racism because ive experienced it and im so used to being the other i just dont want to read it at this point im weary of it
books,not_removed,i read by haruki murakami this year which is originally in japanese i loved the language and could tell it still retained a japanese touch to it but if i found it so pretty in english i can only imagine how much better it would be in japanese id definitely have to go out of my way to read an author of my color and the only books i know that are by people of my color are about what its like to be a poc in with the choice exception of this random paranormal romance author which uh no thank you id probably take on the challenge of trying to read more women authors before trying to read more poc id inevitably either be reading translated works or choosing from the most famous books by poc in western countries which somehow always get political i appreciate the paranormal romance author whos of my color even though thats not my genre i dont want to read another im a poc heres how my lifes been memoir because ive already lived it we can write normal books too
books,not_removed,btw regarding your disappointment in your lack of diversity i think the question really depends on what genres you read do you have a speciality or do you read a little bit of everything
books,not_removed,yeah no doubt i would i just never want to put the effort into finding a good one
books,not_removed,yes indeed but the question also included different language group
books,not_removed,that included the different language group part of the question so french german and other nonenglish white literatures or did i misunderstand ops question but yes after high school and college i did turn mostly to foreign literature and in english mostly to minority literature
books,not_removed,certainly true those are the books that make up the however i read mostly epic fantasy these days for fiction and in that genre i find the books by indian authors not up to scratch
books,not_removed,there are some great polish authors i think the most popular one outside poland is andrzej sapkowski who wrote the witcher series
books,not_removed,yes though the effort is mostly with me actually finding the books isnt a problem its just knowing about them thankful its fairly easy to see a bunch of lists of best books by x author and start building from there there is still a lot of disparity in the publishing industry but thats a different subject
books,not_removed,ive only read the one murakami book and i definitely want to read more i havent read the last book of the threebody problem trilogy yet but the first two are excellent dont expect beautiful prose style or deep characterization you wont find them this is oldschool big idea science fiction written from a very different cultural perspective than western sf great stuff i really enjoyed man tiger its a small story focused on two families in a small town but very powerful id like to read his beauty is a wound which is supposed to be much more epic in scope but knowing so little about indonesian culture and history i think id be missing a lot im guessing you wouldnt have that problem
books,not_removed,im sure there are but im relatively new and have been focusing mostly on dc stuff the three main gn authors ive read this year are neil gaiman geoff johns and grant morrison
books,not_removed,the book gives a lot more detailbackground to help understand whats going onthe book got muddy in places the author did a fantastic job of merging dreams and reality and conveying dreamlogic and how you dont question it there are instances of sexismhomophobiafatphobia in the book but i have no idea if its a reflection of the culture or from it being written in the it wasnt bad enough to make me stop reading it though still a really cool book that did a great job with an interesting concept the vegetarian was good although it went off in a direction i didnt think it was going to gowhich i guess is a good thing its very short but it still took me a while to read since there were so many cultural differences i felt i had to get through i really liked it though i havent read a lot of horror from other cultures im going to make an effort to read more
books,not_removed,i love reading diverse fantasy i get so bored with tolkein rehashes
books,not_removed,thats good to know maybe i just havent read enough diverse fantasy ill have to look into it more
books,not_removed,i also have been reading a lot of classics too and though there are a lot written by women i think men kind of dominate that genre too or at least i come across more written by men
books,not_removed,im really excited for it toughest thing is going to be horror i love the genre but it feels like its almost all white dudes
books,not_removed,i am totally going to try this
books,not_removed,came here just to say i have read a few murakami this year and they are amazing the translations read well and maintain a japanese feel but my girlfriend and i read kafka on the shore me in english hers in japanese and we definitely had different ideas about some characters and their plots
books,not_removed,i loved the language and could tell it still retained a japanese touch to it but if i found it so pretty in english i can only imagine how much better it would be in japanese not much better murakami is known for writing in a style that mimics english and is often criticized for it in fact murakami himself admits that when writing he often writes the sentences in english first then translates them into japanese httptheartificecomharukimurakamiworks
books,not_removed,i read a little bit of everything i run a book review blog and i try to read broadly across genres
books,not_removed,therein i think lies the problem books by white men are the norm and theres the presumption that it takes effort to find books by people who arent white men
books,not_removed,ah ok that makes sense still it is very impressive
books,not_removed,yeah thats very interesting ive read rushdies midnights children which is kind of magic realism i guess but i couldnt point to any epic indian fantasy writers maybe a niche you could capitalise on
books,not_removed,ah of course ive played the witcher on pc but ive never read the books ill have to add them to my list for next year
books,not_removed,i would highly highly recommend daytripper
books,not_removed,ill have to check it out and yeah its so interesting how even just looking at the past couple of decades you can see how much weve progressed ive been watching gilmore girls for the first time dont shame me and even though it was only filmed years ago its aged a lot i loved the vegetarian and thats really interesting that you found it to be a horror story i found it to be more of a psychologicalexistential story i think it was probably one of the best books ive read this yera
books,not_removed,yeah i agree i think there are some really big name women the brontes austen elliot but there are way way more by men
books,not_removed,shirley jackson
books,not_removed,interesting to note the story itself definitely doesnt feel very japanese which surprised me considering how popular murakami is in japan im definitely planning to search out more japanese literature in the future hopefully the translations remain true
books,not_removed,i dont think it takes effort to find books written by non white men and women it takes effort to find one that i want to read very different and not really a problem considering its my personal taste
books,not_removed,we have always lived in the castle and the haunting of hill house are two of my favourite books
books,not_removed,no other japanese authors read like murakami thats why hes so popular i mean most people would probably like the ring battle royale and coin locker babies for example but the style of writing just isnt the same and forget classic japanese authors theyre as difficult as classic english authors
books,not_removed,i reread the lottery every halloween thought you have would have read some of hers but it was the first name that came to mind there

books,not_removed,i love his books i never knew he was so handsome
books,not_removed,being a writer is a lonely job you have to be alone in order to write and im sure it gets lonely i think the best situation would be for a writer to have a parttime job or a volunteer position that regularly puts them in contact with other people outside their family on the regular

books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,stephenson is one of my favorite authors i recommend all of his stuff the baroque cycle is easily my favorite anathema is also quite good the diamond age snow crash and cryptonomicon are some of his most popular
books,not_removed,yea he is a quite well known and well regarded author snow crash is pretty much mandatory reading for modern sci fi which even at that it was written more than years ago ive got diamond age on a shelf but havent read it yet however i have read others of his work which are all a serious but rewarding comittment
books,not_removed,i love stephensons work although he can get quite wordy that seems to put a lot of people off i had to restart quicksilver three times to finally get through the first half that did nothing but setup the other two books in the baroque cycle a tip diamond age is a sequel to snow crash they are essentially two standalone novels but one character from sc does show up in da
books,not_removed,glad to hear you are enjoying it in my opinion the first half of the diamond age is among stephensons best work but i am a sucker for a story welltold from a childs perspective eg tom sawyer huck finn whistling season the second half imho doesnt live up i could never love snow crash even though it is revered by stephenson fans the tone of the writing doesnt connect with me way too gimmicky and to make matters worse it advertises the gimmicks in advance of delivering them i think stephenson really hit his stride with cryptonomicon thats always my strongest recommendation for readers interested in stephenson
books,not_removed,love stephenson however you said this is your first book by him and you still havent finished it so i feel its fair to warn you stephenson is kinda known for not having the best endings its almost like he decides to stop writing as soon as things are mostly resolved no epilogue no coda no and now this is how things are now just stops some have said he writes just enough to end it but many including me have been left wanting more of a wrap up
books,not_removed,there is a speech about hypocrisy in there somewhere that should be required reading
books,not_removed,ive read everything the author has written snow crash will always have a place in my heart but cryptonomiconthe baroque cycle were probably the best with seveneves being close behind and if you like china reamde also took place in it edit and its partially set in presentday china
books,not_removed,it seems like last year every odd post was regarding neal stephensons seveneves i enjoyed the first but theres a bit of a turn at that point which sort of lost me i wont spoil it in case you get to read it
books,not_removed,stephenson is fairly well known but diamond age is not one of his better known works the famous ones are either snow crash or the later anathema stuff
books,not_removed,ive read snow crash cryptonomicon and diamond age enjoyed all of them even though crypto was quite a slab to get through i should probably read some of his other books as well but i havent found them at my favorite used book store yet with some similar themes i think you also might enjoy charles stross as well accelerando particularly stands out to me as being in some ways similar
books,not_removed,big reader here one of my all time favs glad you liked it
books,not_removed,this is my alltime favorite book and every time i finish reading it i have to resist the urge to go back to page and start over if i had to pick a favorite author i think neal stephenson would be it stephenson has a style of writing that if it isnt unique is at least rare im going to be talking about this style which is a hallmark of most of his books and is especially evident in diamond age but i wouldnt consider this to be spoiling anything read on if you want what i like most about stephensons style is how grows stories usually in fiction the story is initiated by some huge outside event the protagonists parents are killed or he is chosen to compete in the games a murder happens and needs solving a war starts a spaceship crashes or a ring that has sat in trunk for decades suddenly needs destroying after we get to know the characters is when some external force injects energy into the story to get things going theres nothing wrong with that model but i find it much more interesting the way stephenson does it he introduces us to a few characters they may have small challenges they are trying to overcome but it seems like these are the regular challenges of everyday life failures or successes in these small challenges slowly start bending the paths of these characters together as they come together differences or similarities in what they are trying to achieve creates conflict the point is there is something intrinsic to the characters that drives events to build in the story arc rather than an external event as i think about it i guess its the difference between character and story driven storytelling and i like being to see the path a regular person takes from ordinary existence to achieving great things they lift themselves up and thats inspiring im not going to go so far as to say this method is better but its better for me i like it a lot more stephensons books exhibit this characteristic to greater or lesser ahemreamde extent another thing i wont get into is how he tries to educate his readers about some principal like cryptography electronic engineering economy pollution social progress authority or what have you i think this can come across as preachy and that makes a lot of people disengage along with his wordiness works for me though
books,not_removed,i so love the baroque cycle i dont often find anyone who calls that the best
books,not_removed,i read somewhere that da seems to follow a david copperfield dickens trend which if you want to talk about wordy but after a chapter or two i got used to his invented jargon and otherwise find it to be good vocabulary although admittedly i would never dream to write like that myself still i can see it is not for the weak of heart thanks for the tips
books,not_removed,the baroque cycle is probably my favourite piece of litterature after reading the first book i was frustrated and angry with the ending and wanted to quit the trilogy but i forced my self to read the second one and boy did it pick up it is a really great read
books,not_removed,for what its worth i really enjoyed snow crash and the diamond age but never really connected fully with cryptonomicon
books,not_removed,or the epilogue is of the book seveneves
books,not_removed,it occurs twice actually once when lord finklemcgraw and major napier are addressing hackworth early on in the book that we occasionally violate our own stated moral code major napier said working it through does not imply that we are insincere in espousing that code and again with constable moore when he meets nell the difference between stupid and intelligent people‚Äîand this is true whether or not they are welleducated‚Äîis that intelligent people can handle subtlety they are not baffled by ambiguous or even contradictory situations‚Äîin fact they expect them and are apt to become suspicious when things seem overly straightforward
books,not_removed,i was irritated with seveneves it felt like two books that had the back half of the second book cut off then the two were stuck together so much potential that was left untapped
books,not_removed,a bit of a turn thats putting it one way lol
books,not_removed,diamond age is definitely one of his better known works it won the hugo its more well known than anathem
books,not_removed,oh yes cyperpunk was huge in the early nineties and it was basically william gibson and stephenson that where the front figures
books,not_removed,i remember accelerando as a mindfuck when i read it
books,not_removed,i guess people are hanging on to their copies
books,not_removed,heh this is one of his shortest
books,not_removed,that trilogy was so dense i had trouble enjoying it
books,not_removed,of the baroque cycle the less said the better
books,not_removed,i love how varied his work is if you like futurology you probably like the diamond age if you like cyber punk you probably like snow crash if you like math and history you probably like cryptonomicon if you like world of warcraft you probably like reamde if you just like good scifi written by a good author he can introduce you to all of those topics
books,not_removed,it still ended at an awkward spot i felt very little sense of closure
books,not_removed,he should have released a mmo after seveneves
books,not_removed,the city of mirrors by justin cronin was the same i like both books but i want a solid ending
books,not_removed,that book made me so mad awesome premise and beginning just squandered
books,not_removed,theres noway he could have fully explored the world he created the first part was virtually all in space and ignored things on the ground where interesting things should have been happening and the second part could have been three of four times as long but id still be wanting more
books,not_removed,i definitely see anathem mentioned more but then again the first one i came across was quicksilver
books,not_removed,really thats never been my impression also hugo may say something about a books popularity with worldcon voters and hence the sf scene but not much else
books,not_removed,i can understand that i absolutely love really long books so it was heavenly in that regard for me listening to it works very well as its read by one of the best audio book readers imo and you can take more delight in the language
books,not_removed,it should have been a separate book i want to know how the races evolved
books,not_removed,or rpg core book
books,not_removed,that would be pretty fantastic
books,not_removed,i really loved the first but the last just felt stunted and too abrupt even though it was clear that was what we would be getting
books,not_removed,anathem is newer the diamond age was a very big deal when it was more current
books,not_removed,same here i wanted to know so much more about that period
books,not_removed,agreed seveneves and china mievilles bas lag series are two worlds i need rpg books created for so much imagination and wonder radiating from those pages
books,not_removed,i would crime in order to get a good source book for bas lag i would crime so hard
books,not_removed,any one of mievilles writings could be rpg oneshots really ugh i wish he wasnt so socialist and loved money more i would gladly give him mine
books,not_removed,rail sea and kraken come to mind either one of those would be amazing too especially rail sea actually hell i might give it a reread and write up an outline for the setting myself maybe he just needs to be convinced of the socialist values of roleplaying something about putting the means for narrative production in the hands of the people
books,not_removed,haha yes i imagine hes thought about writing something he played dnd as a child and wrote a small amount of pathfinder stuff a while ago but selling his ip as corebooksadventures brilliant idea plus nerds would gobble them up at a book rather than readers who buy his novels at seems like an easy decision from our point of view but you can tell from his writing that he gets bored easily and jumps from idea to idea or world to world quickly maybe an rpg would be too much of an investment in an idea he no longer has passion for at least we have his novels for inspiration on our own i included a version of the tattoo in my last campaign my players still have no idea what hes all about one year in and he just recently escaped his person moohahhahaha

books,not_removed,slaughterhouse five
books,not_removed,breakfast of champions is my personal favorite but its hard to miss with vonnegut
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,the other commenters nailed it slaughterhouse five rules the movie was alright sirens of titan is great too if you like short stories welcome to the monkey house is a good read along with his other books on a side note his son mark vonnegut wrote a book about struggling with his personal psychological issues called the eden express i really enjoyed it
books,not_removed,cats cradle is my favorite by a long shot slaughterhouse five would be the second i really didnt like breakfast of champions at all ymmv
books,not_removed,id go slaughterhouse five then sirens of titan then cats cradle and then go from there breakfast of champions probably isnt that good to start with and i found it more enjoyable reading it after becoming more familiar with vonnegut
books,not_removed,so my dad recommended cats cradle to me when i was young read it and loved it also if you want to read some brash writing of that era charles bukowskis post office is a great read
books,not_removed,mother night is outstanding and pretty accessible
books,not_removed,ive read slaughter house five cats cradle galapagos and sirens of titan they are all great books and provide a great sample of his work
books,not_removed,everything but save breakfast of champions for last or at least after reading everything that was written before it my favorites are sirens of titan and cats cradle slapstick and slaughterhouse five are my honorable mentions
books,not_removed,thank you all so much i really appreciate it and i cant wait to get started
books,not_removed,i second slaughterhouse five then cats cradle imo
books,not_removed,really precise but vivid descriptions when an author just goes on and on about one setting i get bored and lose interest easily and so i find it really satisfying when the descriptions are great but also not over used and straight to the point
books,not_removed,i wish i knew what exactly are the features that make me go holy sht that was awesome but sometimes it is hard to pinpoint the characters are very important to me they need to be compelling i dont need to like them ive read some great books with main characters that i didnt like as a person but they need to be interesting and compelling what exactly makes them compelling i find hard to pinpoint as for the book itself being original helps but the story doesnt need to be completely original to be good enough for me to be willing to talk about it however the story needs to be done well it needs to make sense and it needs to not drop off in the middle the prose is also important but i probably put that as the lowest of my requirements not saying it isnt important but for me characters and story are more important
books,not_removed,it should make logic if the books that i read are not as realistic as possible and the characters sound so fake then its not for me
books,not_removed,the author has to make me care what a reader might care about varies from novel to novel it might be plot it might be character it might be the society the author is exploring but one or more of those has to be a factor in the best novels they are all made to seem urgently important along with vivid descriptions plausible behaviour snappy dialogue and the rest
books,not_removed,disclaimer i am being completely serious here i really like slow books with lots of description and dialogue i love tolkiens writing as well as war and peace they just have so much rich detail it really draws me in and makes me more interested ive always loved slow plodding books for it to be one of my favorites i also want to connect to the protagonists its not enough that they just be good but i want a connection to them a sense of sameness or a moral example im far more malleable in terms of books i enjoy or just read but i need that connection for my favorites
books,not_removed,i like a good style i have some favourites palahniuk being one of them the raw gritty feel to his books really draws me in and dont get me started on mark z danielewski i am not sure where style ends and art begins the author doesnt even have to be good with descriptions his books could take place in the most boring location but if he can turn that into something you have never seen before then it will be extraordinary i think of authors like artists anyone can draw but a true artist can make a drawing that is original in style
books,not_removed,it varies with different books some things that really hook me in are world building i thought world war z is a terrific example of this and writing if the author has some beautiful writing it makes up for lackluster characters and a meh world then other times the plot itself might be quite interesting
books,not_removed,i do that too and then im worried that i might have missed some vital information haha dont get me started about of mice and men that description sent me to sleep
books,not_removed,victor hugo and dumas do that a lot too i just finished war and peace and i was surprised that tolstoy never did that the most description he ever did was during a ball and even then it was a pretty short paragraph
books,not_removed,i mean if some character does something that makes no sense whatsoever considering whats happening in the story then i find such a book not worth reading
books,not_removed,i enjoyed the book but i felt like the entire story was told by a wallflower i think that this was done purposely to add to the overall feel of directionless prose i think this book could be compared to a very long car ride dull but otherwise pleasant
books,not_removed,i didnt hate it when i read it in high school but it was also kind of cool to read it in high school so maybe thats why i also lent my copy to my brother when he went on tour with his band and he said he loved it pretty sure hes only read three complete books in his life maybe his surroundings and life experiences came into play
books,not_removed,i quite liked it when i was the idea of just leaving town and meandering around the country with your friends while drinking fucking and generally living a hedonistic lifestyle is very appealing to a lot of young men i think its this feeling of freedom attracts most people and not the writing craft or characters its not really about anything but it doesnt matter because it just exudes a sense of adventure and the yearning to be free it also helps if you already buy into the mythos of the beats and read their other writings that being said i dont think that i would get much from it now as an adult what at seemed like the perfect bohemian wayfarer lifestyle now at seems self indulgent and dangerous though i would still highly recommend it along with other quintessentially male books like walden or the sun also rises to any young man today
books,not_removed,on the road could never hold my attention i thoroughly enjoyed big sur however
books,not_removed,i love the book no its not the best writing and yes the protagonists are juvenile cyclical and chaotic thats exactly what theyre meant to be sal is young and his friends are young old bull lee my reddit namesake is old even though he was in this when it came out though i suspect the nickname is more an allusion to burroughs having an older lifestyle they dont know what to do with their lives they just want to not do what their parents did so yeah they do the same stupid shit over and over of course they are chaotic thats what they wanted to be and like most young adults or more likely most people they couldnt really get how they were affecting others kerouacs works come across as much brighter than many of the other authors that deal with that lifestyle and time period i use to think that it was just from how he saw that time of his life but if you compare works like on the road and the dharma bums to ones like desolation angels i think its pretty clear he knew the lifestyle was juvenile and cyclical and chaotic granted the clarity may have come later but i think its present in at least some form in his earlier works and the hippos were boiled in their tanks has an extremely cynical view and came even earlier i think kerouac wanted to capture how living the experiences felt though he wasnt thinking about his actions he was just doing them the streamofconsciousness helps show that but so does the tone i think you are extremely premature to write kerouac and on the road off as more dumb than saintly because beyond both its an attempt to be honest im not sure what you wanted to get out of the book its not an especially deep book nor does it have a ton of spectacular writing though there are a few passages here and there that are in my opinion truly beautiful your criticisms are to me what the point of the book and even all of beat generation literature is about if you dont like that sort of stuff if you want protagonists who arent those things id warn you off from reading more kerouac burroughs might find a place for you as ive always found his writing a little more cynical about it a bit more aware of the degeneracy of their lives though as i said above i think kerouac was too but chose to show it in a different way and if you think on the road was a mess dont go in for kerouacs poetry
books,not_removed,i read it and its one of my favorites it does seem to me that this is one of these books that you have to read at the right time lost souls looking for themselves are the proper audience for this book some passages of it are immensely poetic such as that drive from louisiana to san francisco it is also a portrait of an america few remember but which really did exist it is full of wonderfully clever observations about manners and the cycles in modern american history also full of literary references that shaped the early days of the counterculture and others that betray kerouacs french canadian background it exudes so much life it is vibrant and yearnful everything in it twitch to live and go kerouac wrote in two weeks flat but he spent years on that blessed road to pickle his senses in the zeitgeist of his time the novel itself was hugely influential and it bent the direction of american literature at the time this is not a novel you come to for answers there is a moment in the story where sal and dean find themselves stranded god knows where a policeman comes to them and asks are you guys going somewhere or just going if you can understand that question its depth then the meaning and purpose of the novel its importance will become clearer
books,not_removed,man i loved that book but i was a big fan of the era when i read it love allen ginsberg too the aesthetic of the group i was in a real snobbish phase of my life i would sit in my kitchen no ac of course miles on the cd player smoking cigarettes drinking coffee in my underwear my girlfriend naked and asleep on the couch under a thin sheetand still i was jealous of the life in that book the only thing i was missing was the aimless driving loved when they were in mexico and theyre driving through the jungle or something and its going super slow and hes just laying down on top of the car watching the starsthat happened yes anyway definitive of an era evocative writing interesting style
books,not_removed,no its so formless just typing
books,not_removed,it was a coming of age story and very entertaining to read they even made a quantum leap episode based on it
books,not_removed,i sure liked it in high school i thought a lot of his stream of consciousness descriptions of the settings were great i liked dharma bums too
books,not_removed,its a beatnik story the lack of a god or redemptive morals is part of the main idea i think its a search for enlightenment through the travels of a young group as a teenager i can empathize with that wanderlust and desire to live and experience i know you may not be a kerouac fan but his poetry is pretty good too imo
books,not_removed,when i am assigned a book to read for school i read it always start to finish even if i dont like it lookin at you cold mountain this is the one exception i hated this book so much for just the reasons you mentioned it just seems like a lot of basically simple ideas wrapped in a dense protective shell of impenetrable verbiage for no reason at all well no reason other than enough amphetamines to put down a horse theyre not even you know good ideas i already knew i wasnt going to find it argh at the bottom of a pill bottle loved your review by the way exactly how i felt about it
books,not_removed,appreciate your response im actually not finished with kerouac just yet ill be working on his poems shortly i remember hearing a poem about eggs and bacon the alone could warrant a full redemption of kerouac in my mind do you know what that was also his list for aspiring writers is breathtaking for me maybe road was too long of an indulgence in an instinctual experiment for my taste at any rate i appreciate your comment
books,not_removed,because a books only good if you like the characters
books,not_removed,very interesting thanks for sharing
books,not_removed,wow i do believe i have met my match well done are you on goodreads
books,not_removed,no because a books only good if its good
books,not_removed,thanks ive lurked on goodreads for a while but never posted anything i always like to see what other people think about my favorite books or leastfavorite books
books,not_removed,you should try your hand at reviews id be interested in reading them friend me
books,not_removed,just to be clear i meant to use the word novels in the title not sure what happened but novs sounds extra douchey and it was a total accident
books,not_removed,i thought dark places was really good
books,not_removed,sharp objects was really good i liked it more than gone girl dare i say
books,not_removed,both of her older books are amazing and i believe shes got a newish post gg at least book out too
books,not_removed,yes it is worth it if i may indulge in some judginess it sounds like you have not experienced enough things that take time to happen have you ever eaten turkey at thanksgiving well you cant cook it in five minutes when youve finished that book i recommend to you the far pavilions i have no idea how i found that page novel but it is a fantastic story set more than a century ago in england india and afghanistan for my money its even better than gone with the wind a difference is that gone with the wind had something to do with the revival of the kkk while nobody celebrates the marksmanship of afghan troops
books,not_removed,i read this several years ago and i really enjoyed it i find a lot of classix books hard to read but not gwtw i would suggest sticking to it a bit longer
books,not_removed,at least get to the party and meeting rhett butler
books,not_removed,please post recommendation requests including should i read and should i continue reading in rsuggestmeabook or the weekly thread
books,not_removed,i have enjoyed long books in the past that is not a problem my fav book is actually don quixote which is longer than gone with the wind the point is that this book is not as gripping from the get go as i would have liked anyhow ive decided to read at least till ‚ÑÖ mark and then decide if i care to read it further or not thanks for your endorsement though
books,not_removed,will do this thanks
books,not_removed,it would be good to read something thats not gripping take that stat and make it books that from the getgo you dont think will be gripping you might find them interesting and helpful to your life theres a great book called guns germs and steel thats nonfiction and that helps explain why certain countries and areas have the richness or poverty that they have its not at all gripping but it certainly is interesting and can help a person understand the world around them i mean whats more gripping than having a clue about things important to the way the world has developed that nobody ever thought to teach you
books,not_removed,not to be pedantic but don quixote is not longer than gwtw
books,not_removed,that is correct and precisely why before delving into it i thought i should ask for more opinions thanks to so many good things people shared about that book i did not stop reading it im close to finishing it now and it has been a rewarding read and guns germs steel is on my to read list too will read it sometime this year
books,not_removed,oh i just checked thats right dq is pages and gwtw is not much difference i actually have the edith grossman translation for dq that has many notes so it appeared if anything thicker to me
books,not_removed,do us a favor put up a new thread about guns germs and steel after youve read it theres a lot of information in there that could help people be less ignorant for instance could cause them to blame the advanced societies of the world less for the lack of advancement of others why dont we have a lot of cargo has a pretty clear answer that is not the fault of anyone at all
books,not_removed,thats surprising ive never seen an edition of dq over pages or so but that makes sense that it would be from an abundance of notes how did you enjoy the grossman translation still deciding what translation to go with
books,not_removed,it is amazing it starts with a detailed preface by harold bloom he compares don quixote with hamlet and tries to comment on the overall theme of the book very well written grossman is like the ideal translator she has left extensive notes on any wordplay involved in original spanish she makes clear how difficult some sentences are to translate as some of the proverbs are now obsolete then also comments how cervantes personal conditions might have influenced a particular passage all this without being too didactic just information given clearly
books,not_removed,i read to them my father was illiterate could not read and only write his name my mother could only read and write spanish the test indicated i am highly visual once i learned to read at school i would bring home books to read to my parents the first book i remember was go west young man go west
books,not_removed,my mom read to me every night even after i was a strong enough reader to read chapter books by myself until i was or and reading voraciously anyway i am skeptical of those learning styles i dont think the research to back them up is very strong but i do think that was very valuable in terms of making me a stronger reader and someone who saw reading as fun and worthwhile
books,not_removed,mines more of a readwrite a visual learner which explains my love of reading books and manga really my father read to me almost every night before bed and encouraged me to read the book myself with him on the nights he didnt read to me
books,not_removed,yes regularly
books,not_removed,my mom until i could read on my own always saw her reading her book of the month books and she took me to the bookmobile at the grocery store once a month when it was there she always played scrabble with her friends and she got me a subscription to jack jill magazine and a kids botm club she let me read whatever i wanted resulting in me reading the thorn birds when i was that head lice scene i still read to my son its how we wind down at the end of the day and now he wants to read a stephen king book for ar passing the torch to the next generationthanks mommy i love you
books,not_removed,nope parents never bought books for me or read to me just something i picked up the love for by chance
books,not_removed,no then again being raised by wolves would have been a noticeable improvement for me
books,not_removed,they bought me books but didnt read to me
books,not_removed,my mom used to read to me when i was little we used to go to the library pretty often as well
books,not_removed,apparently im a multimodal learner yes my relatives read to me mostly my parents but were all big readers its a good way to spend time together especially when kids are young sharing good stories is only part of the fun
books,not_removed,the test says im multimodal but strongest on readwrite that feels about right as i think the best way to teach something depends more on the subject than the student but no i dont recall my parents ever reading to me and we had few to no books around the house
books,not_removed,apparently but i dont remember i have been reading to my month old regularly though i cant wait until she starts understanding and we can talk about it
books,not_removed,my grandma read to me a lot that is why i read at a much higher level than i am supposed to i miss her badly
books,not_removed,no never but i learned to read at a pretty young age at least years before all my peers in school so i could read to myself she did get me books from the library all the time though
books,not_removed,my mom read to me all the time mostly dr seuss books before i could read she read to me so often that i was reading before i entered kindergarten i imagine all the episodes of sesame street had something to do with that as well
books,not_removed,both of my parents were readers but didnt read to me much my oldest sister read to me until i could read on my own which was actually quite young or years old
books,not_removed,my mom read to me and my siblings closer to me in age and i read to the baby i have twin brother and a sister who basically makes us months apart while the baby is fifteen years younger than us she also took us to the library a lot too
books,not_removed,i couldnt imagine not having my parents read to me what kind of a childhood doesnt have a bedtime story
books,not_removed,my father read to me all through my childhood but i didnt pick up a novel and really get my teeth into reading for pleasure until i was or so
books,not_removed,i remember my dad reading to me more than my mom i remember trying to get my dad to read lord of the rings to me so i could experience the story without struggling with reading it as i was too young to actually read it i got bored and we never finished i have since read it as an adult and enjoyed it i tried to read the harry potter series to my dad because i knew he wouldnt read them on his own and i wanted him to experience them he fell asleep most of the time i think i read the first to him
books,not_removed,once in a while yes more so my mom than my dad my dad introduced me to superheroes and comics thats how i really learned how to read and of course developed a life long love for dc comics
books,not_removed,my parents made me read to them every night to help my reading
books,not_removed,my dad read to my sister and i every night when we were little and he had the patience of a saint my sis and i were obsessed with a richard scarry book where you had to find goldbug on each page kind of like a wheres waldowally because we had read it a million times we knew exactly where he was on each page but we dicked around for ages pretending we couldnt find him
books,not_removed,the first books i read myself were those books that my father already had read me
books,not_removed,my parents read to the five of us every night they conceivable could until the last of us me was old enough to read by myself from the day my oldest sister was born they read to us my parents are very well educated but chose to have less lucrative careers ive always done better in school and in life than many of my wealthier classmates and neighbors largely because my parents recognized that knowledge cant be bought i think one of the greatest injustices in the world is that poor children with poor parents start at a disadvantage because their parents cant always read to them due to money and time and educational constraints the test says im a kinesthetic learner
books,not_removed,i dont recall ever being read to but the bookorders from school were one of the only things i could ever ask for and my mom was happy to let me purchase several books
books,not_removed,personal loan eligibility
books,not_removed,ah i guess this is where the new dan brown book will draw its material from im not sure what this book will do thats not been studied or published already

books,not_removed,proper english modern english slang would date the story or be out of place for a story in the future making up a language for the future is a cool concept but difficult to read especially if whole conversations are written in the future language
books,not_removed,in the future people only speak in memes
books,not_removed,for me anything except a bizarreweird slangfilled language i dont get excited having to slow down to piece together what characters are saying unless it has a direct influence on the way the story is told like if there was a twist involved to how the language evolved when i read stories featuring dialogue like this or even just one character who speaks in rhyme or crazyspeak i usually skim through those sections just my personal preference
books,not_removed,exactly i think this modern english slangs will be something obsolete in the future i think proper english will somehow survive because it is the language preferred in most of international education systems making up a language for the future is a cool concept but difficult to read especially if whole conversations are written in the future language do you agree that the writers are among the ones who come up with new vocabularies and words to inspire the future generations in their daily life talk
books,not_removed,i agree i never enjoyed slang either if you dont mind answering this what type of dialogue do you think would be more suitable to use between a male character and a female character exp lovers in a science fiction story happening in the fardistant future
books,not_removed,i think proper english is a guaranteed nofail because it is so generally used that doesnt mean the dialogue has to be in one definitive way though whether the characters are from a high status or low status background will help with specifics i took a look at the first far future book that came to mind the stars my destination and its filled with casual english dialogue but because the characters are so welldefined it works anything unobtrusive
books,not_removed,yes the proper english will survive for the next decades to come but i still wonder to this very day what caused old english to become obsolete and something from the medieval european ages do you think that scientific and technological breakthroughs influenced either directly or indirectly the english language throughout the ages
books,not_removed,i read a fair bit of bill brysons the mother tongue where he tracks all of that it gets a bit repetitive and dry at times so i never finished but a lot of those major changes have to do with the various groups celts anglosaxons normans scots etc that made up england throughout that time so our english evolved as a combination of a variety of different tongues the breakthroughs did impact language in the sense that they directly influenced who was around during each period
books,not_removed,i agree speaking of english what type of english that is very close to proper english in grammar and spelling i doubt british english im not a native english speaker but i am very fluent
books,not_removed,it could be i think the only difference between american and british english is that each is used in its respective countrycountries either can be considered standard english they just differ with certain spellings and definitions you just need to choose one and stay consistent throughout your work unless the intermingling of americanbritish english is representative of how the language has evolved in the future im no expert so hopefully im at least close to correct here what is your story about
books,not_removed,what is your story about mix of soft and hard sci fiadventuresurvivalactionthrill i tend to get lost in ideas i think a lot i am a slow writer i need a lot of time to think of the most compelling scenarios possible lucy will be my pen name and id probably consider new york or london as my first publishing destination now morocco
books,not_removed,id recommend that you read the third part the prisoner of heaven and return to these questions if they are still pending after that generally there is one big and obvious answer that more or less covers all the details if you will
books,not_removed,i surely will today i started reading hope i will get the answer thanks i quieted a bit
books,not_removed,a lot of people had trouble with the angels game but i couldnt help reading it quickly and going straight on to prisoner of heaven which will help you no end
books,not_removed,please post lists of books in rbooklists
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread you should also check out our
books,not_removed,no youre not missing anything the plot can seem pretty muddy through the first three books and the fourth book tends to drag but by the time youre at books and youll start to see the full picture loved this series
books,not_removed,its not unrelated it picks up exactly where the gunslinger leaves off here to help if you have any questions as well im sure the rthedarktower community would be happy to help as well
books,not_removed,save this post and read it when youre finished with the series youll see why later
books,not_removed,what do you not understand specifically
books,not_removed,its written in a very different style from the first one but what dont you understand exactly the point of view jumps a little between the characters and there are some flashback scenes to their pasts but other than that it should be pretty straightforward you dont need to read between the lines but yes things do come full circle
books,not_removed,rthedarktower is here for you visit and enjoy sai
books,not_removed,i dont usually use audiobooks so i cant say for sure its a factor but ive had issues with following along to audio books if its a complex story im not sure if its because dialogue is hard to follow along when its all in the narrators voice or because i understand things better by looking at it not hearing it overall dark tower is a great series the second book is certainly different from the first you havent missed anything there hope you continue and enjoy ill also echo the comments of others that rthedarktower is a great board if you have story related questions
books,not_removed,the other side of the coin is that most people would say the first books are the best ones and then it goes downhill from there
books,not_removed,ive wanted to read this series but considering your response is the book equivalent of if you stick through it starts to get really good around the middle of season two im becoming concerned
books,not_removed,yeah i got a chuckle out of that
books,not_removed,yeah everyone saying itll make sense is ridiculous ive faced similar problems with some books that i read unconsciously see the words keep going and think im understanding but im actually not processing shit so i have to go back pages and pages if umistertowlie could explain further whats he having problems with it would be a lot easier to help
books,not_removed,think of it like a popular tv series tons of people will say the sopranos was overall an excellent show by the last season is was dramatically different than the first season there were story lines and entire seasons in between some thought were crap but its worth it anyway dt is similar you look at the whole of it instead of the sum of its parts its also a complicated style of writing to sum up to anyone so most people will say youve gotta read it and see hope you check it out and enjoy
books,not_removed,pynchons not that difficult his range and the scale of his work can be a bit bewildering at first but the prose itself isnt as much of a struggle as people would have you believe inherent vice is definitely lighter than gravitys rainbow though in every sense of the word
books,not_removed,people think hes hard because he sometimes gets worddrunk and usually has about a thousand characters
books,not_removed,inherent vice is easily the most accessible pynchon book if you are having problems with thatgr is going to be light years more difficult
books,not_removed,pynchon likes to go on little detours in his writing hell diverge from the main narrative to tell you something random that happened to some minor character and then three pages later snap back to the real story with no real explanation or fanfare all these subnarratives nested in the main one can make keeping up with what is actually going on pretty difficult and every now and then one of these little digressions actually turns out to be really really important later on
books,not_removed,how would you rank his books in terms of accessibility i loved inherent vice and have no real interest in reading gravitys rainbow what are the rest of em like
books,not_removed,i havent read gravitys rainbow but the first i read was crying of lot which i thought was excellent and accessible
books,not_removed,inherent vice is at the top for accessibility gravitys rainbow is at the bottom and the rest of the books pretty much fit in between
books,not_removed,cool thanks whats the deal with gravitys rainbow my understanding is that its long with a lot of characters and very abstract ideas and it becomes almost impossible to understand and very science heavy is that a fair reflection of the book
books,not_removed,not really first you have to know that pynchon often dragged in scientific concepts and european historical settings that he actually had no idea about almost all of the century european settings in gr was pulled directly out of old travel guides he actually had little understanding of some of the pavlov theories and the theories on entropy that inform the atmosphere of gr most of the stuff was just dragged in from books he read all that stuff was just used as atmosphere people mistakenly think they need to understand all of these things to understand pynchon when in fact pynchon didnt actually understand it for him it just created a thick atmosphere an insight to pynchon is his introduction to slow learner
books,not_removed,id be really interested to have a look at the sources of your information i finished gr about two months ago and im beginning to think ill benefit from a second read in the nearfuture pynchon definitely impresses himself upon readers me as an intellectual juggernaut id love to read a breakdown of his research efforts

books,not_removed,im not sure what you mean a writing prompt using the word ampersand as far as the styles concerned what are you saying i need a little help here
books,not_removed,check out rwritingprompts or similar subreddits but be sure to check their rules before posting
books,not_removed,the thought was to use it in a more elaborate term use such as describing the process of removing the and and replacing it with ampersand while editing a recipe on the computer
books,not_removed,it seems so simple when you put it like that
books,not_removed,i have read well over books i own a few thousand and i love them all my husband who is not a fan of reading for fun just doesnt understand why i have a hard time parting with one or why i read them over again however he is the first one to point out a used book store to me great husband
books,not_removed,i have as read on goodreads but i know its not comprehensivethere are many childhood and college reads i know im forgetting and im constantly finding other ones ive forgotten that ive read makes me wish i started keeping track of what i read sooner
books,not_removed,as a younger kid i have definitely read over work and heavier schooling has slowed me down now but im sure its still a hefty number
books,not_removed,probably given that ive been reading for fun for oh at least thirty years never contemplated it really
books,not_removed,i have read well over a
books,not_removed,definitely over no idea how many in total as a kid my mom would take me to the library every week and every week id come home with a literal stack of books i didnt have my own computer or tv until i was around so id spend most evenings reading when i was i actually won a prize from the library for the most library loans in a year although some of those were dvds cds and so on in my midtolate teens i didnt read much but its picked up in the last ten years for the last few years ive averaged books more if you count comic booksgraphic novels my librarything account has just over books catalogued but around of those havent been read yet and a few hundred more are things like the tintin series which i wouldnt count as full books
books,not_removed,on goodreads and a spreadsheet i have books recorded but that only goes back to and ive been reading for a lot longer im sure that ive read at least books it really doesnt sound like that many but i suppose it is when you compare it to people who literally read one book a year or less it also doesnt sound like a lot when you compare it to how many movies some people in rmovies said theyve seen like or more on the other hand movies tend to be a lot shorter than books in terms of how much time they take to consume
books,not_removed,i dont keep track but it would be in the many thousands the last time i moved i sold donated aboit books and still moved a couple of hundred i couldnt part with that doesnt include the thousands of library and other books i have read
books,not_removed,i have over listed on my goodreads shelves but i just entered those starting years ago i know there are a lot more that i havent gotten around to entering or have forgotten over the years ive been an avid reader for over years now so at a conservative books a year that would be around
books,not_removed,i was going to say ive read books so far not counting childrens books average since i was then i realized ive reread a lot of books some multiple times so id probably say ive read around books or so
books,not_removed,im sure i have but im only able to remember the titles of fewer than of them but im certain there are more than books ive read in childhood or even early adulthood that i havent counted
books,not_removed,during school i average booksweek leisure reading in addition to required reading for classes so id say that yes ive read well over books throughout my life strangely my reading slows to about bookweek during breaks id think itd be the other way around
books,not_removed,i know that i have read a couple thousand since starting preschool i spend all of my free time reading and love almost all genres exempt for horror and romance edit going to college next year loved the nancy drew series am a really good speed reader
books,not_removed,i have over compiled in a list in the past years but i know i read plenty before that so im going to put my hand up and say i have
books,not_removed,absolutely even though i am only in my early twenties i grew up in a home without video games or a tv so my only source of entertainment was the library
books,not_removed,i couldnt even begin to guess
books,not_removed,i have
books,not_removed,not over a thousand but over a hundred i only started reading about two years ago im sure ill hit the mark someday
books,not_removed,probably well over but i dont have an exact number i didnt start keeping track until
books,not_removed,several thousand several per week
books,not_removed,for a long long time i read books a week say from about through my it didnt occur to me to question how much time got eaten up by reading since not reading all the time was unthinkable it was like breathing then i had my son and kept working a lot plus other caregiving fell to me so something had to give i read very little for years now the son is a teenager and im back to sucking down books obsessively there still seems to be time for other passions i suspect because i never warmed to tv damned internet is a time sink though
books,not_removed,i only started tracking what i read about five years ago but ive readheard about since then sometimes ill go back and read an old review and im all wtf did i read that but by and large i remember them
books,not_removed,when i was younger i probably managed upwards of pages a week i have a lot less time and more hobbies but id feel comfortable in having read that many by the time i was
books,not_removed,as a kid going into his junior year in college i can say with confidence that ive read over my highest estimate would be around im kind of sad im going back to school because i dont read for fun during the semester only during summer and winter break too much school work to justify reading for fun
books,not_removed,i feel like ive read around in the last years i feel like a failure now
books,not_removed,i own at least a few thousand have a beautiful at least to my eyes librarygameroom at my house but have read only around as per my goodreads which i update diligently
books,not_removed,ive had a book in my hand since i was well over by now p
books,not_removed,i passed read books mark on goodreads few months ago thats probably around of book ive read on all of my life
books,not_removed,i was reading on my own from maybe age lets so just over years of reading about books a year maybe
books,not_removed,i think im over and getting close to but i am in my and as a teen was never without a book
books,not_removed,i dont know im at on goodreads and that has a lot of what i remember as a kid the only way i get to unique books is if i really cant remember what i read as a kidteen
books,not_removed,no but im well over one hundred im
books,not_removed,what an interesting and thoughtprovoking discussion s rshitpost rcirclejerk
books,not_removed,about books per year and ive been doing that for the last years with repeat reads it still should be far over books
books,not_removed,im pretty sure that ive read over books but i dont really have an idea how many my reading went up to a couple per week when i cut the cable years ago
books,not_removed,ive never read a single book in my life
books,not_removed,there is no way a standard person can read that many books beyond the level of chapter books and retain anything substantial about pretty much any of them
books,not_removed,oh ive read tens of thousands i used to average around not so much these days as now i read a lot of nonfiction mostly
books,not_removed,do you write at all
books,not_removed,just doesnt understand why i have a hard time parting with one tell him you think the house needs more armor against stray bullets and its handy for entertainment during the inevitable fbi sige of the compound and see what happens might be fun
books,not_removed,i read like a year üò≠
books,not_removed,how the hell do you read that much
books,not_removed,you read books a week holy moly
books,not_removed,me too
books,not_removed,actually it might be better suited to rbookscirclejerk
books,not_removed,just what allowing for even exaggeration unless you are reading goosebumps or the fucking nancy drew series you are not doing a month
books,not_removed,i wrote when i was younger but i stopped i dont know why every once in a while i think about starting again but self doubt is getting in my way
books,not_removed,hes heard a lot of excuses why the books have to stay from light hearted jokes to exasperated you go before the books go comments he takes them all in stride the only exceptions were when we moved we have moved twice together and i was heavily pregnant both times he jokes about the books falling off the moving truck if we move again and i joke about conveniently getting pregnant again lol
books,not_removed,good pace if youre immortal
books,not_removed,at some point it just becomes addiction tbh
books,not_removed,well if you read around a page per minute thats maybe hours for a page book back when i had more free time i could do that in a day easily nowadays i have less free time but i still manage more than an hour a day and more on weekends so a week is probably about right
books,not_removed,im having a real hard time seeing how someone can average books a day and actually internalize any of it
books,not_removed,i think that if youre a fast reader its technically possible if literally all you do is read i did the deweys hour readathon a few months ago and managed books in that timeframe one was a novella and a few were pages none were long books but it was an allday event food ordered in getting up early and staying up late no time devoted to any other hobbies or activities it was really fun but kind of mentally exhausting i cant imagine having the stamina to do that every day or the time
books,not_removed,not now i used to i would go to the library and get stacks of several dozen at a time when i got old enough to get a job i would buy and read every scifidd book i could get my hands on spending my whole paycheck i read the entire run of hardy boys tom swift yes nancy drew and even the bobbsey twins series before the age of ten by my teens i was probably down to a month now im more like not counting books i reread for reference mostly history econ non fiction stuff like i said ive read books in the shower til the break of dawn before school instead of doing homework while driving while at work working during sex that was stopped real quick ten thousand can be done
books,not_removed,dont ever let doubt be the reason the door never opens no matter how well the writing it is there will always be at least one person who loves it in this world besides you but you have to make the story first before they can love it
books,not_removed,i personally believe that extensive reading is a strong contributor to being a good writer if youve got novels under your belt i think its almost healthy to give something back id encourage you to start writing again even if just a blog or for yourself
books,not_removed,yeah but who has the time to do that
books,not_removed,i just cant imagine reading at anything approaching that pace and actually having any of that stick with me long term
books,not_removed,how old are you
books,not_removed,thank you i appreciate your words and it definitely gives me something to think about
books,not_removed,thank you too more inspiring words to think about
books,not_removed,idk it just happens riding a bus waiting for a bus waiting in line eating dinner before bed every weekend if you want to read you just find time i found many of my friends treat reading like a chore i just reach for a book instinctively whenever i have to pass the time
books,not_removed,this question always puzzles me given any time no matter how short reading is my first choice its like someone asking how you find the time to eat
books,not_removed,i am decades of reading is part of it i rarely watch tv or movies i dont play video games i have a family friends a life a job i swim i hike i travel i play guitar i am interested in politics and science and music and history and technology and philosophy and psychology books are part of a full life
books,not_removed,either im exceptionally tired or the words in this sentence arent in quite the right order
books,not_removed,if youre speedreading to try and get through books yeah its not going to stick with you at all but if you naturally read quite quickly itll be like any other reading experience in my experience my memories of the readathon books are as clear as any other i read in that time period
books,not_removed,i see i wake up go to work come home watch kids gym read bed there is like a one hour window there where i can read thats it sadly i have to drive to work and then work extra hours to pay for my car i wish we had public transportation one stone there
books,not_removed,yeah but finding the time to eat a cheeseburger and finding the time to eat fifty cheeseburgers is quite different thats the thing i dont understand how do people have so much time to read so many books
books,not_removed,i agreed entirely i just cant fathom enjoying that many books glad youre doing all that though my parents are a little older and too lazy to do any of that
books,not_removed,i used to have to drive to work i moved to another city that has public transportation so i could read during the commute working extra hours to pay for a car this is why used honda civics exist so one doesnt have to worry so much about paying off their car and has more time for reading i also managed to get a night shift job where i dont do anything and can read so in total thats about hours each day for reading as has been said if you want to read more you will find a way gotta have priorities
books,not_removed,haha see i read at the gym too i actually cant stand cardio without a book it gets so boring and when you do reps or lifting or whatever men do at the gym you can always use an audiobook
books,not_removed,but how long does it take you to eat one cheeseburger you eat three meals a day i read approximately a book a week also youre more likely to read books you want to read i read for both information and fun but i set books aside for days weeks even months if its not compelling me at that moment i generally have at least five books going at once
books,not_removed,i actually couldnt pay for a car i wasnt able to save that much but i like where you went with that i have considered getting a second job thats low maintenance so i could read
books,not_removed,thats the truth haha but audio books dont pump me up during a work out lol
books,not_removed,sometimes i can finish a book in a week sometimes it takes a while depends if i like it and how long it is i basically have the same thing going on but i have a very difficult time finding books that i like
books,not_removed,isnt it interesting how few people out there share a persons reading tastes exactly so many people i have so much in common with but we prefer vastly different books even if we overlap on a few are you on goodreads i get a lot of my recommendations there but theres no perfect algorithm i find
books,not_removed,yeah i do use goodreads a lot but i should use it more thank you for reminding me
books,not_removed,if you offered the librarians of alexander access to our internet in exchange for the burnt ashes of the librarys books do you think the ancients would agree to the swap you bet your life they would they would torch it all in a heartbeat
books,not_removed,i feel you i just want to learn what they recorded for the future and it always bums me out that well honestly never know we can only guess
books,not_removed,we have a lot of literature left from antiquity more than any one person could probably read in a lifetimeand quite a lot of it free online get started you dont need a time machine to learn greek and latin i do find it bit weird how much people fetishize the library of alexandria when so few of them even bother to learn the languages most of the material was written in if youd ever had to read galen or philodemus you might be happy that theres less of it around its amazing that what we have has survived why not focus on being a good custodian of that material
books,not_removed,i was about to say this
books,not_removed,this is my problem with it we can only speculate
books,not_removed,youre right it is important to understand analyze what we do have left any links for those works would be greatly appreciated i will say i think the fascination at least for me is that problem of the unknown we always want to know things that we didnt before
books,not_removed,my feeling on this is summed up by a quote from tom stoppard one of my favorite living authors in his play arcadia a student talking to her tutor thomasina the enemy who burned the great library of alexandria without so much as a fine for all that is overdue oh septimus can you bear it all the lost plays of the athenians two hundred at least by aeschylus sophocles euripides thousands of poems aristotles own libraryhow can we sleep for grief septimus by counting our stock seven plays from aeschylus seven from sophocles nineteen from euripides my lady you should no more grieve for the rest than for a buckle lost from your first shoe or for your lesson book which will be lost when you are old we shed as we pick up like travellers who must carry everything in their arms and what we let fall will be picked up by those behind the procession is very long and life is very short we die on the march but there is nothing outside the march so nothing can be lost to it the missing plays of sophocles will turn up piece by piece or be written again in another language ancient cures for diseases will reveal themselves once more mathematical discoveries glimpsed and lost to view will have their time again you do not suppose my lady that if all of archimedes had been hiding in the great library of alexandria we would be at a loss for a corkscrew as for getting started check out the httpwwwperseustuftseduhopper which has a lot of original texts as well as out of copyright so admittedly not always very uptodate translations

books,not_removed,schizophrenia is a serious mental illness its not synonymous with being unable to make up your mind or whatever it is your post is about
books,not_removed,where do you live ive never heard schizophrenic used in the place of ambivalent is it a regional thing
books,not_removed,color me confused alltime favorite story but you dislike the author as an author huh alltime favorite author fantastic writing but his books are mostly selfcontained so dont touch them huh favorite fantasy series but i dont like the author as an author again huh i think im at least as smart as the average bear but i have no idea what point is being made this book is great stellar so i should read it no dont bother the authors not very good at being an author
books,not_removed,yes the n word is also an expression it also is an objectionable term im not saying schizophrenic is the same as the n word but it has often been used as a pejorative the way you used it can be considered somewhat insensitive the more pressing issue though is that it just isnt the most precise word for you to use in this context and in fact confuses what it is youre even trying to say
books,not_removed,i looked it up but everything seems to be about the medical condition maybe because thats what it is
books,not_removed,lets hear your definition
books,not_removed,ahh so its just colloquial i thought it seemed strange for schizophrenic to have a nonmedical primary definition thanks for clearing it up op
books,not_removed,ok that makes more sense at least i think i understand it more now i do hate discovering a great book and then having the author say there will be threefourwhatever so you should have the last one about ten years from now this has actually led me to stay away from certain authors until i know theyre finished its like heres a trilogy and then heres the next one but it takes place before the previous one and the next set will be after the first drives me nuts because i prefer chronological order regardless of publication order plus it makes me wish more authors would get back into a one book one story approach i miss knowing i can get a great story in one book not that i dont have some favorites that span three or more books
books,not_removed,schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks feels and behaves schizophrenia is a serious disorder which affects how a person thinks feels and acts schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to understand what is real schizophrenia is a serious mental illness that interferes with a persons ability to think clearly manage emotions make decisions and relate to others etc
books,not_removed,ah i read this novel for a freshman psychology course i remember being troubled by thegroup think like mob mentality but also being creeped how that can be used as an excuse to strip perpetrators of their agency maybe even guilt did you watch the movie op
books,not_removed,theres the conundrumwhy is it ordinarily only the state the official representation of the people that is authorized to undertake preemptive violence that is trusted to make the right decision or at least a decision right or wrong for the right reasons at least most of the time safety in numbersfor injustice the setting of oxbow tweaks all aspects of this conundrum out in the west isolated geographically and against a backdrop of readymade justice are not the men in the judgmental mob the functional ethical equivalent of the state but why is time of the essence for them except for reckless revenge
books,not_removed,i have not i will have to check it out
books,not_removed,when i mention preemptive violence i was more thinking about davies would he have been justified in shooting tetley to avoid the lynching ultimately no one was punished officially for the mob but i feel like davies would have for the action to stop it
books,not_removed,i think youre right i didnt say that clearly
books,not_removed,a very very brief synopsis of your synopsis everyone dies

books,not_removed,and some extra fat
books,not_removed,oh boy poorly written memoiressays by a painfully notfunny comedian whose entire schtick revolves around her making im too fat and ugly and old to be attractive to guys jokes
books,not_removed,chucky p is a standup dude i wrote him a letter once to ask what his favorite books were read em all and they were great and he sent me a box of stuff including a stuffed animal handmade necklace with animal bone signed copy of survivor bar of paper street soap company soap and some other goodies
books,not_removed,til that chuck palahniuk is a super nice guy
books,not_removed,i realize no author or celebrity is obligated to do these sorts of things for their fans so when i hear that one does something sincerely cool like this it always makes me feel the world is a little kinder than before i heard the story thanks for sharing offtopic my obligatory similar story would be receiving a note from lauren mayberry of chvrches
books,not_removed,i remember in high school my friend sent him a letter telling him what a big fan he was he ended up sending him a box containing a bunch of random goodies and some candy but when he opened it glitter exploded all over him and his room i remember he thought that part was really cool
books,not_removed,what an awesome story i had the chance to listen to him speak at a writing conference several years ago its quite literally one of the most amazing speeches ive ever heard i am still upset that i had to leave at the end of his talk and run and i couldnt get him to sign a book for me as a fan youll love this but anyone that wants a good yarn should really listen to this talk hes an incredible storyteller on and off the page i still cry when i rewatch it even years later
books,not_removed,i saw chuck at a live event here in slc he did something so special and amazing for me there my mother used to buy me a book every christmas i never knew what book it would be but she would write something in it and sign it now christmas in was going to be her last non hodgkin lymphoma for the first time ever she asked me what book i wanted i told her fight club there is a reason for this you see i had had a few pretty rough years i had lost everything the economy collapsed and i lost my job and gave up my marriage in the span of days i ended up sleeping on a friends enclosed font porch i was pretty materialistic and now all had was what i could fit in my car i spent a year drowning in pills and booze passively trying to kill myself then i read fight club now i didnt idolize tyler or any of that stuff but one thing stuck with me its only after weve lost everything that were free to do anything i had lost everything and now was free to do anything i could do anything i wanted i could go anywhere i wanted i could try and rebuild my life or i could kill myself it was a pure moment and it profoundly changed me i chose to rebuild fight club saved me now my mother gave me this book and wrote what would be her last message to me i could read my mothers words and see the book and will remember what i took from it and remember that i will be ok a couple years later and i took this book to the storytime event and found out he wasnt doing any signing that night i must have seemed pretty down to the people i asked about it because they asked if something was wrong and i explained about my mother and this book and then went and found a seat well forward an hour and someone came up to me and asked for my book they were going to see if he would sign it they brought it back to me after the show and he wrote the most amazing message in it on the page opposite my mothers last coherent words to me i didnt know his mother died of cancer until he told the story that night
books,not_removed,maybe ive been living under a rock but til fight club graphic novel
books,not_removed,what a fantastic guy not even kidding this has convinced me to pick up one of his novels ive always kind of meant to pick one up my to read list is huge so things can be forgotten in the intention but i admire the hell out of authors who are wonderful people it adds do much more to their writings in my opinion wish i had one of his books right now im so jazzed by this story
books,not_removed,he sent me a similar package the centerpiece of mine was a copy of diary translated into italian and signed with the dedication hows your italian i dont speak a word so between that and the glitter going all over my carpet he got me pretty good
books,not_removed,absolutely positively the most thoughtful thing ive ever seen a celebrityesque person do for a fan fuck i dont do stuff like that for my closest family that is remarkable im glad you got to meet him and receive such a great gift from your daughter and someone you admire so much thats something that hardly anyone gets in their lifetime you must be an extra special person
books,not_removed,chuck gave me a secret mission too i havent decided what to write him yet though
books,not_removed,the exact same thing happened to me a few years ago chuck sent me a package out of the blue it was filled with a few goofy knick knacks as well as a personal signed letter and a handcrafted necklace kind of similar to your bookmark the timing in my life was perfect chuck is my favorite author i couldnt believe how lucky i was he gained even more of my respect that day its so cool to hear of other stories like this thank you so much for sharing
books,not_removed,til chuck p has insane biceps
books,not_removed,he also did not send me this because i am a decentlooking female chuck palahniuk is an openly gay man so i dunno why anyone suggested this the man sent you a box full of glitter likenot that straight men cant like glitter but still
books,not_removed,every time i see a picture of him im always surprised that hes such a clean cut wellgroomed happy guy i always picture him as a scruffy dour dont give a fuck kinda guy makes me like him even more that such a nice dude could come up with such disturbing stories ex guts scarred me for life i couldnt even finish it that shit was beyond fucked up
books,not_removed,chuck is such a cool guy he gave my comic book store a tone of free stuff for us to promo fight club but a lot of it was specifically for our employees collection personalized to us love that dude ps answering a call from him is super intimidating
books,not_removed,this is the meetingacreatorwhoisyourheroandhavinghimunexpectedlysendyousoap story i have ever heard
books,not_removed,hes a super nice guy i manage a book store and have met him twice hes super down to earth and friendly with his fans some authors are complete dicks but both times he was great
books,not_removed,haha i remember when i almost got suspended in high school for reading guts my teacher took it from me read it and i spent a long time talking my way out of that one either way this made me really shappy tears have been shed
books,not_removed,well im fuckin jelly

books,not_removed,mr palahniuk regifted me a fisting dildo following a reading of guts i attended with my mother in he had been giving away trinkets all evening so my mom exclaimed he gave you an arm how fun me mom i think the fist of adonis is a sex toy mom oh well um cp maam im so sorry it was just a joke i didnt mean anything by it youre not under age are you why would you tell your mom m no no shes not underage its fine and youre right its funny so long as she doesnt use it m mahm gross ew no im not going to use it cp red faced chuckling m i didnt say you would lighten up honey m thank you mr palahniuk m thank you honey sorry my daughters such a prude i still have it hidden in some storage space box barely held in its packaging by deteriorating plastic i should have had him sign it but was too embarrassed to think to
books,not_removed,you totally have his target demographic wrong
books,not_removed,it came to my attention that someone went through and downvoted a ton of comments i upvoted you the thing about this whole post was that a really cool guy who a lot of people happen to admire did something great for a fan and her kid my kid was so thrilled that he actually answered if you dont like my post thats cool i thought it was pretty neat that he did this and i thought some of his other fans would like to see dont just downvote to be mean isnt the world filed with enough nastiness
books,not_removed,chuck palahniuk gave me a hedgehog stuffed animal
books,not_removed,that motherfucker always sends glitter i still find some almost ten years since i got a care package from him i should take a picture of the necklace he made me
books,not_removed,met him during his tour of haunted at a dallas borders store he got in line to get his own coffee right behind me right then i knew he was a good dude we exchanged small talk and even that was engaging i mentioned we had the same birthday and he said he could be my father no clue what it means but fuck it stuck with me i wanna say it was a nod to rant which i never finished but who knows
books,not_removed,for real tho thanks for being a nurse you put up with so much and are so undervalued
books,not_removed,chuck palahniuk called me a pervet once greatest day of my life
books,not_removed,chuck is a wonderful weirdo i feel privileged to be knocking around on this planet at the same time he is much less in the same part of the same country ive seen him speak and my affection only grows his writing is honest savage and beautiful
books,not_removed,chuck palahniuk is the best author out there when it comes to communicating with fans i wrote him a letter for my high school sophomore english class and he sent me an entire box of goodies with a few autographs and a bracelet that said to me name emitted from chucky p i never expected a reply and it ended up being one of the best surprises i have ever received
books,not_removed,this kind of activity between humans so distant so disparate lives not even fucking remotely connectedreaching out and making an effort epic and so bloody encouraging
books,not_removed,why isnt he wearing shoes
books,not_removed,jelly af favorite author hands down
books,not_removed,i remember going to a chuck palahniuk signing back in when he was on his rant tour and the only way you could get your picture taken with him was if you wore a wedding dress it was incredibly memorable to see so many people in wedding dresses but then i realized it was at a chuck palahniuk book signing i got a squeaky hamburger toy and all of his books signed by him the man is top class
books,not_removed,i got a very similar surprise from him this past christmas i was involved in an apartment fire last year and lost everything i owned including my collection of all of palahniuks books most of them in hardcover my mom got ahold of his agent somehow and asked if she could send him a copy of a book to be signed chuck instead decided to send a package similar to yours it also had copies of a couple of his easton press leather bound hard cover reissues of a couple of his books completely unexpected and there is a part of me that is a little embarrassed as its not something i would have ever asked for ironically i now dont have a bookshelf on which to place those books
books,not_removed,your daughters letter made me cry good cry theres so much damn love in this post happy for you op thats a really rad surprise
books,not_removed,i absolutely love this
books,not_removed,this is beautiful
books,not_removed,ive no idea why i read a cat named after a cow disease my mind was desperately trying to figure out the name
books,not_removed,that guy used to be an airplane mechanic im happy for him
books,not_removed,i love that chuck isnt wearing shoes in the picture
books,not_removed,i also wrote chuck a letter years ago he responded with a short letter and a gift box full of oddities i think he was into beading at the time and made me a beaded necklace a jesus doll thing and a signed uk edition of survivor hes an awesome guy ive been to a few book signings
books,not_removed,this is the most amazing thing ive ever seen a famous person do for a fan wow this made me really happy for you op
books,not_removed,i never knew chuck was buff as fuck
books,not_removed,he said once that when doing research for some of his first books he would give the person seated next to him on plane rides a vicodin then listen while they blurted out their dark secrets so whenever i go to his readings i always ask him for a vicodin hes never had one but has retorted by asking me for one instead
books,not_removed,when chuck did his ama a while back i asked him a question and he called me a pussy it was one of the greatest honors of my life
books,not_removed,teaching women that good book learnin priceless
books,not_removed,fuck yes chuck rules
books,not_removed,that is really very sweet
books,not_removed,wow absolute love for this story thank you so much for sharing and i hope that bookmark brings you lots of luck
books,not_removed,awesome chuck seems like such a swell person
books,not_removed,he sends boxes of things he has laying around as a goof he enjoys it on his website he sells signed copies of books how that works is the bookstore near his home sells the books and every so often hell come in and sign the books people ordered and every once in awhile send these boxes as well
books,not_removed,duuuuuude my friend named his dog moo
books,not_removed,im glad to see chuck is still being awesome to his fans he sent me some very awesome stuff in including a handmade rock necklace
books,not_removed,i wonder what mark z danielewski would send
books,not_removed,what a lovely thing for anybody to do for a near stranger but how extraordinary for someone who i assume has probably a busy schedule and many people seeking his attention to take the time to do something so heartfelt this is very touching
books,not_removed,a bit late to the party but wanted to share my experience with chuck i recently met him for the first time ever on the fight club tour and was completely blown away by what a genuine and incredibly nice person he is being a fan of his since survivor came out i have been lucky enough to order books that came personalized and autographed from him from st helens bookshop while they were still operational and it was always such a pleasure to see how much attention and love he put into these they always came with witty phrases and often with little toys and temporary tattoos etc i am just blown away by how much work it took to do all that for his fans im sure many others have had similar experiences too just wanted to share mine chuck youre fucking awesome
books,not_removed,thank you for sharing op this is awesome your daughter painted a pretty awesome picture of you i always imagined chuck was pretty cool now i know for sure i need to point out youve raised a really great kid there but im sure you know that one health care worker to another thanks for what you do and best of luck with the candy store
books,not_removed,what a class act and extraordinary guy wow
books,not_removed,my buddy contacted him quite a few years ago while in high school chuck got back to him and corisponded with him off and on for a year or so chuck also sent him a few little gifts necklace and a few other things i dont remember over the years ive heard similar stories seems like a great guy
books,not_removed,just noticed that chucks barefooted
books,not_removed,i wrote him in high school during a month he said hed write back i sent it the last day and sure enough i got a personal letter from him a power tiger which was a tiger beanie baby signed cd copy of survivor i had asked for invisible monsters but they ran out cds they were short real stories from him i believe and a bunch of glitter and little trinkets what an awesome dude he really gave me the time of day gave me some great advice trivial at the time i was only still remember it to this day
books,not_removed,theres a fight club
books,not_removed,he did something very similar for a friend of mine box of amazing stuff personalized letter and the whole nine yards i dont think he got flowers though instead i think he got some cool rocks chuck had found on a hike in arizona im not trying to say your experience isnt unique what im trying to say is that chuck palahniuk is a fucking awesome guy who loves his fans
books,not_removed,really liked this and im not that into chuck p time to reread kinda dusty in here
books,not_removed,he sounds like such an amazing guy i love that hes barefoot for some reason
books,not_removed,this is awesome i have a pirated critics vhs copy of fight club due to an og online group friend back before the movie release and a home made tshirt from the same guy with the fight club soap on the back and the phrase i havent been fucked like that since grade school on the front these are prized possessions in my life tha perfectly encapsulate the book i would take these for him to sign and can only wish for an interaction like you got holy cow is that awesome
books,not_removed,i realize this isnt going to be a popular opinion and probably no one will see it but i had a completely different experience im a published author and i was a volunteer at a writing conference with chuck now i was happy to help out i was a volunteer after all but chuck treated me like his personal slave he ordered me and other volunteers to do things way beyond the scope of our volunteer duties and at dinner even though i was sitting right next to him and trying to make polite small chat he had this attitude like he was above us all and would barely acknowledge me i know its tempting to write those things off as him being busy or stressed or tired etc and thats exactly what i would do if it had occurred just a few times but this happened so consistently and went to such an extreme level that i cant excuse it i was appalled at his behavior i dont care how tired you are were all tired and you have no right to treat a human being that way maybe hes great with fans but at least at this particular writing conference he was horrible to fellow authors the other volunteers had similar experiences to mine very disappointing
books,not_removed,this was our secretthe first rule of this was our secret is to keep it a secret
books,not_removed,this is the best thing ive seen on reddit in a while how wonderful warms my heart
books,not_removed,definitely jealous im an author myself and pahlaniuk is definitely one of the top influences of my writing style
books,not_removed,this is awful youve got me ugly crying all this emotion and crap i need a minute
books,not_removed,wait wait wait theres a fight club how in the world did i not know this whats next you gonna tell me the survivor movie is finally gonna get made
books,not_removed,reminds me when pat conroy called my dad a few days after meeting him conroy was a great man
books,not_removed,how cool when i was still a teenager i got a gift from jk rowling a huge box of stuff and it forever gave me faith in humanity and the will to go on it was in response to a very long letter i wrote her
books,not_removed,so awesome got to ask him a question when he came to amazon here is seattle and when he did his fight club tour here as well and both times i did my best not to fan boy so hard so i definitely know the feeling i definitely want to eventually receive a chuck bomb one of these days and until then ill marvel at the amazing things he does for his fans its truly hard to find people like chuck these days who understand why regular people no offense to any of us fans im one of you i promise like them so much more than just their name
books,not_removed,whats his address how do i send him a gift box
books,not_removed,chuck p is a great guy but i have to say your daughters letter got me all teary eyed i hope my future children care about me as much as your daughter does about you she seems like a great kid good job
books,not_removed,now i feel jealous the only thing i got was a singed book by bruce schneier lol
books,not_removed,i also received a glitter box from him like years ago
books,not_removed,thats awesome congratulations
books,not_removed,his way with writing characters and themes are as good as gospel to me he paints lovable loathsome leads with tragic heroic antagonists

books,not_removed,this is so awesome this makes me want to reread all his books starting right now what an amazing person youre so lucky
books,not_removed,oh man this brings back some good memories from baghdad in i got back from patrol and was looking for a snack on the community care package table in my barracks when i noticed this box of nothing but fresh fight club books upon further inspection realized they were all personally signed copies from cp himself all with different well wishes like stay safe and sandy or write your story when you come home it really lifted my spirits that day along w a few other guys i wanted to thank chuck when he came to nashville a couple yrs ago and even brought one of the books he sent but he wasnt feeling well or something and canceled his book signing after he spoke if youre reading this chuck thanks man that kind gesture meant a lot
books,not_removed,id buy a safe specifically for all those things
books,not_removed,finished watching the movie for the first time about ten minutes ago congratulations thats amazing the book is next on my list thanks for the coincidence
books,not_removed,yup my hero
books,not_removed,i love that hes barefoot in these pictures
books,not_removed,this is beautiful the letter your daughter wrote the letter from chuck the gifts and the bookmark and especially the fact that a famous author went to this length for a fan im so happy for and slightly envious of lol you congrats on being a lovely person with a great daughter
books,not_removed,chuck did this for me too i was working a shitty waitress job and served him lunch he asked for my address and said he was going to send me a present thinking it was going to be a signed book awesome imagine my surprise when i open a huge care package full of amazing trinkets a stuffed animal a handmade necklace and one of my prized possessions a ceramic skull piggy bank he says he has the same one
books,not_removed,im so unbelievably jealous i love chuck i was bummed that his tour didnt come near me butttttt i did get a care package from him before for donating to a local animal shelter he supports
books,not_removed,i love him and his books he was my favorite author a few years ago and i did a project on him wish id thought to write him what a wonderful brilliant human
books,not_removed,this is so cool thanks for posting
books,not_removed,omg loved seeing this so much i wrote chuck a letter when i was or asking for life advice because i literally had no adults in my life who i trusted to offer me any valuable direction he also sent me an amazing letter a box packed with goodies and a necklace made from stones and beads he said hed collected he even strung letter beads onto the necklace that read to my name from chucky p and placed it in a nice box which he signed ive moved around a lot and years later the only thing i still have is the necklace but whenever i meet new friends and they come over to hang out that necklace is one of the first things i show them its so beautiful and so is yours he certainly has a talent for that chuck palahniuk is incredible
books,not_removed,i knew i loved him
books,not_removed,what a cool and crazy author an ex lent me one of the books i havent read snuff i think it is called holy shit what a messed up book still was a page turner though
books,not_removed,damn are you in nola ill for sure visit your candy store when im down there
books,not_removed,is he barefoot at his signings and meet and greets or should i say feet and greet
books,not_removed,my main takeaway is damn chucks arms
books,not_removed,my main takeaway is damn chucks arms
books,not_removed,this will probably get lost but ive heard some not so good stories about him from people who live in the same city he does so ive always kind of known not to approach him if you see him around town heh it its good to hear this because hes an amazing writer
books,not_removed,your daughters letter to chuck is so awesome what a wonderful person you helped raise cheers to you im so pleased you got something so wonderful from a person you love and respect you deserve all of it peace

books,not_removed,haha awesome i love his books need to get on fight club
books,not_removed,this is awesome
books,not_removed,off to a book signing what the hell ill just go barefoot
books,not_removed,im not his target demographic im not a weightlifter with a fight club tattoo that thinks tyler durden was just a guy that fought a lot im a middleaged mother of a teenager that lives in the suburbs with a two car garage and a cat named after a cow noise to be honest i think youre exactly his demographic i dont believe he was aiming for those dudes to like his books they just did because theyre dumb and thought they were about hitting people in the face
books,not_removed,im jealous in the good sense of course chuck is my authorhero did not think i could respect the guy more than i already was
books,not_removed,this is amazing he seems like a truly wonderful person and you and your daughter are awesome specimens too ive never read one of his books which would you recommend to a noob xx
books,not_removed,thought oh hes more athletic than i imagined thought why is he barefeet i could never thought you are really a cutie with nice teeth thought ugh i just want all this freaking candy
books,not_removed,damn i was fine until i read your daughters letter now im a sobbing mess
books,not_removed,that is a wonderful bookstore in new orleans i try to go every time i am there
books,not_removed,i love how his books can be so dark and depraved which is why i like them and yet in real life ive seen on here and read several stories about how kind and generous he is
books,not_removed,if he left a return address he totally wants you to reply get in there hes a catch x
books,not_removed,he is really cool to his fans i got one of these packages a few years ago when he was offering them to any fans who wrote him a letter it came full of glitter of course and a bunch of weird stuff like a stuffed skunk my power animal apparently and random childrens toys it also came with a signed letter response to my letter
books,not_removed,that bookmark for some reason reminds me of choke i think chuck mightve sent you anal beads
books,not_removed,whats with the comments saying its because shes hot i thought chuck was into men
books,not_removed,man i used to work at still perkin the coffee shop next door to that bookstore cant believe i missed him
books,not_removed,this is so great thanks for sharing
books,not_removed,thats so cool lucky you and now i love chuck even more knowing that he appreciates us nurses
books,not_removed,i have never read any of his books but what an awesome guy treasure that thoughtfulness
books,not_removed,wait are people saying chuck did this because op is an attractive woman do people seriously not know chuck is gay knowing that he thought enough of me to give me things that belonged to his mother things that hes cared enough about to collect is completely overwhelming i am verklempt i wish i could send him a box hed get a kick out of it
books,not_removed,wow made me respect him a ton sounds like a great guy
books,not_removed,rip chucks inbox
books,not_removed,that is amazing authors can be the most deep and sensitive and caring people youll meet
books,not_removed,great story i did a double take when i saw chucks name this morning thanks for sharing
books,not_removed,he sent me a signed copy of fight club for christmas a couple of years ago he wrote you are not your christmas tree chuck palahniuk
books,not_removed,chuck p wanted to give you the chuck d
books,not_removed,this is so cool i went to a book readingsigning of his once im wichita for the release of doomed he had everyone dress up in pajamas and came out we earring red smoking jacket to do short readings he was funny genuine and caring about his fans im glad to know he does this kind of stuff
books,not_removed,thats awesome i got a very similar gift box from him too when he was touring for pygmy he asked people to dress up in cultural garb anything with cultural significance over a tshirt and jeans being a scot descended canadian i wore my grandfathers kilt and bonnet anyone wearing something neat to the book reading got a sealed envelope however though as hes signing books at the end of the event in line i eventually get to him and he comments on the kilt long story short i waited around for him till he finished doing the signings and we went and got a coffee from the place across the street told me hell usually try and grab a local to chat with when he tours super awesome guy talked about literature writing horror and everything under the sun we only hung out for like minutes but it was so cool and i was probably failing at masking how excited i was anyways besides that the sealed envelope i get home and open it up it says something like thank you for participating this is the stuff that makes it fun for all of us fill in your name and address on the back of this card and mail it to soandso so i did few weeks later i got a big box too not only with a personal hand written letter on how it was nice to meet me but lots of glitter a beany baby moose some incense candles a pen shaped like a turd and a bunch of nicknacks plus of his books all personally signed to me two of them in different languages i have invisible monsters in italian and lulliby in portuguese but the coolest was also a bead neckless that spelled out to lumeth from chuck it was my obviously biggest celebrity encounter he is an amazing dude he even listened to me some rank amateur talk about crappy short stories id written and actually gave me encouragement and told me to keep it up
books,not_removed,years ago chuck followed me to a hospital after a book signing to see a friend of mine who was a huge fan cant speak highly enough of the man my friend was a huge fan of chuck and he was coming to town for a book signing unfortunately a few weeks before the book signing my friend was in a car that was hit by a drunk driver and was very badly injured it was touch and go for a bit and we were actually told he had died at one point the force of the impact was so strong he tore his aorta and they had to do emergency heart surgery of the passengers died at the scene my friend was put into an induced coma because he developed an infection anyway needless to say he was laid up for a while so chuck was coming to town and my friend who was a huge fan was in no condition to see him but myself and some others went to get some books signed for him when we got up to see chuck we told him what had happened and asked if there was anyway hed be able to visit our friend who was at a hospital a few minutes away he said stick around and wed talk after he got through signing everyones books he finished between and at night after a long day and still he was willing to go with us to the hospital and visit my friend it was a pretty amazing experience and he was the nicest most friendly guy through the whole thing a little while later my friend received a care package with a note an advance copy of stranger than fiction and some hand crafted bracelets i always tell this story when someone mentions chuck because he was such a nice fellow and it was a wonderful thing he did for all of us youngsters at the time
books,not_removed,thats an awesome story and woof is a great name for a cat
books,not_removed,this makes me so jealous he is my favorite author ever i would die if he gave me a box of rocks and glitter
books,not_removed,no way i used to hang out in the coffee shop in that building i dont work in the garden district anymore so i stopped going im so jealous i had no idea he was doing a signing here congrats on getting to meet him and your sawed one experience
books,not_removed,this absolutely made my day chuck is one of my all time favorite authors and to see that bookmark he actually hand made for you with things that are precious to him just kills me i love it i am so happy you got this care package from one of your heroes
books,not_removed,this is probably the best thing i have ever had the honors of witnessing
books,not_removed,these stories are making my morning so cool
books,not_removed,check out his subreddit rchuckpalahniuk
books,not_removed,chucks so awesome i actually wish i could get him a copy chuck if you read this let me know where to send it
books,not_removed,my little brother hates to read like really cannot get through a book it had been years since he even opened a book when i convinced him to read fight club since then he has read every palahnuik story and went to the book signing as well i couldnt make it so he told chuck how his sister made him love reading again through mr ps books and he signed a very realistic looking severed arm for my brother to bring home to me my bro said that chuck spent time talking to him and made him feel really special it was the best gift ive ever gotten tldr chuck palahnuik is an amazing guy and i have a fantastic brother
books,not_removed,im not a fan of his work but he sounds like a helluva a guy and im glad you had an experience like this its pretty unique probably the only author i would feel like this about would be stephen king and im afraid that if i ever met him in person i would just be unintentionally insulting i would demand to know why the hell did he stop writing good books after pet semetery he wrote the stand and then thirty years of promising shit how sounds like your guy is really something special very nice
books,not_removed,this is incredible palahniuk always seems like such a standup guy talented as hell writes great and disturbing things then sends out handmade care packages i wouldnt be surprised if he ran an abused animal rehab next to the soap factory
books,not_removed,when i finally met him at a fight club qa a couple of years ago i just knew he was the same person i had made up in my head this also cements that way of thinking what lovely gifts you lucky lady x
books,not_removed,ive never been a fan of palahniuk but this gesture is so inherently good i cant help be a fan despite my tastes edit also from just looking at the picture i wouldve guessed your daughter was your younger halfsister way to go op
books,not_removed,why did you require an edit to clarify your cats name after the sound a cow makes to be moo whos the genius not connecting the dots on that
books,not_removed,this is an amazing post thank you so much for sharing
books,not_removed,i met him when he came to vancouver for a signing of pygmy i enjoyed my conversation with him and his reading still have the inflatable penguin he signed in my room
books,not_removed,this is beautiful i met him about a decade ago on one of his book tours and he was absolutely amazing he stayed around signing and posing with people until there was a book maximum that you could have signed and those are some of my most prized possessions the fact that he has been going above and beyond for fans this long makes me genuinely happy and i hope he knows how deeply hes appreciated
books,not_removed,freaking amazing so envious
books,not_removed,i too met chuck palahniuk back in july in louisville however i froze up a little and felt in awe i also went with my daughter who bought me the tickets for my birthday i also feel like im not in his target demoraphic so i knew exactly what you meant when you said that anyway i just wanted to say awesome thanks for sharing
books,not_removed,this is really incredible im glad that this happened to you now how do i make this happen to me is the question

books,not_removed,i want to thank you for this post recognizing a great author and exposing him as a great person i would be lying to say that this didnt bring a tear of joy to my eye ive been having an incredibly hard time and its inspirational to read something like this keep going on and being a great person and mother im glad he did all of this for you as you truly do deserve every bit of joy it brings you
books,not_removed,man chuck looks ripped these days

books,not_removed,that is so cool of him what a great guy i hope you treasure all of it well i know you will your daughter did an amazing thing for you
books,not_removed,i really enjoyed reading this it made me want to grab one of my chuck books off the shelf i have a bunch of them some i havent even read yet im not sure why i grabbed rant perhaps it was the biggest book in it i found some money that i completely forgot i had placed there enough to buy several copies of rant though books arent as cheap here as they are in the uk or the us so thanks op for your chuck story and reuniting me with my money
books,not_removed,this just made my day i love his stuff very cool

books,not_removed,teared up reading your daughters letter and what a truly amazing guy to do something like that for his fans
books,not_removed,im not his target demographic im not a weightlifter with a fight club tattoo that thinks tyler durden was just a guy that fought a lot im fairly certain they arent his target demographic

books,not_removed,happy birthday its my birthday today too
books,not_removed,if you think the target audience is a weight lifter with a fight club tattoo who thinks tyler durden was a guy that fought a lot and you dont think a suburban middle aged presumably middle or upplemiddle class white person are closer to the target audience then i guess im just really confused on how such a huge fan could have missed such a big point

books,not_removed,op you took an intimate and personal gesture from a busy man who made time specially for you and whored it out on reddit for bragging rights and imaginary internet points thoughtless crass and in poor taste
books,not_removed,on every dating profile ive seen every girl says their favorite writer is chuck palahniuk
books,not_removed,when did he become such a daddy fuck me daddy
books,not_removed,fuck fight club
books,not_removed,what are the books he recommended
books,not_removed,how cool is that he told my kid that he likes to make things i believe it
books,not_removed,thats incredible you cant put a price on how much stuff like that means to a regular person coming from someone they admire some people go through life with all the opportunity in the world to make an impact and never do and others go through life like a rock thrown in a still pond creating ripples that multiply into infinity stories like that really warm my heart
books,not_removed,i need to know as well pretty please
books,not_removed,same here but my care package included toy handcuffs that came with the wrong keys i wasnt sure if it was better that there might be a chinese factory accidentally creating mayhamic experiences a day or that chuck was doing it on purpose
books,not_removed,book list plz
books,not_removed,chucky p is about to get a lot of letters
books,not_removed,sounds like the same care package i received but he remembered making my necklace when i met him a few years later he thumbed all the pieces one by one and commented on how he had run out of a certain piece midway through the necklace i still have the soap years later stand up dude
books,not_removed,where do you send letters to ive seen dying to write one but i dont know where to send it maybe im dumb
books,not_removed,it kinda sounds like hes regifting the stuff his fans give him not a bad idea
books,not_removed,yup i got the same thing most of the random stuff that he sent me is gone now but somewhere i still have the necklace and letter he wrote me
books,not_removed,i can confirm i also got a package from chucky p back when he was still answering all of his fan mail not only did he send me a personalized necklace among other great stuff he also sent me a spirit animal bear which made me wonder if he were possibly psychic since it was weirdly appropriate i have nothing but respect for the man and for those suggesting that he delivered because milf you do know hes gay right
books,not_removed,what the hell man
books,not_removed,til hes totally swolle
books,not_removed,captain crunch sent me a small frisbee when i was along with a letter about how he sailed the seven seas to get it
books,not_removed,i wrote a letter to phillip pullman in the sixth grade after reading his dark materials in and got a hand written letter back in my senior year of high school where he had also apologized for the late reply i had forgotten that i had ever did that and it was a pleasant surprise to get it
books,not_removed,whoa you got a note from lauren mayberry nice
books,not_removed,my similar story is getting stuff from writer greg rucka when i was going through some rough shit he wrote me extremely kind words his wife made me a cute handmade card and i cried like a baby opening it all when the creators you admire do things like that its just the most powerful thing in the world i have such respect for anyone like that who takes time out of their lives to think of fans and treat them like friends the stuff greg sent me would be among the first things id grab if my house ever caught on fire an actress from sleep no more sent me some really cool things too around that same time a little bottle of sand from israel fashioned into a pendant among other things it all reminded me that theres light left when at that time i was convinced there was only darkness
books,not_removed,lauren mayberry kissed me on the cheek
books,not_removed,i saw ben carson at a book signing once well i mean i saw a huge crowd of people clapping while what i presume was ben carson walked through the middle of them i didnt actually see the person it was supposed to be ben carson might have been chuck palahniuk
books,not_removed,yes please tell the lauren mayberry story i think i watched her coachella performance thirty times
books,not_removed,there is glitter everywhere chuck palahniuk the evil genius behind the glitter bomb
books,not_removed,that was great i didnt know the part about his mom
books,not_removed,im sorry this happened to you those words were the ones that changed my life too and gave me hope im not your mom but i am a mom so im sending you virtual mom hugs wherever you are
books,not_removed,thats awesome he took the time as well as the people taking the time to listen to your story and trying to get him to sign it he changed my life i watched the movie before reading the book but it changed me non the less if you have a picture of what he wrote as well as what your mother did i would be interested in seeing it if its personal i completely understand
books,not_removed,its good tyler durden returns
books,not_removed,i think it went totally over my head or maybe reading a single per month just hindered my understanding of it
books,not_removed,yup it looks pretty good apparently hes going to keep the comics going with a fight club series
books,not_removed,i didnt know either looked up reviews im not gonna buy it right now ive got like of his books on my coffee table to read anyways
books,not_removed,invisible monsters is my favorite it blows me away everytime
books,not_removed,rant is amazing as well
books,not_removed,i recommend damned and lullaby
books,not_removed,survivor is my personal favorite and the one i recommend to everyone first book of his i read and still my favorite to this day
books,not_removed,his short story guts is really good and quite short to figure out if youll like his other stuff
books,not_removed,i had to take another shower and its still not all gone rip my rug
books,not_removed,thats a special kind of evil that im not at all surprised about
books,not_removed,my daughter is amazing honestly im so glad he sent a copy of her letter to him back to me he kept the original which makes me ridiculously happy as well
books,not_removed,i was thinking the other day about how facebook has stopped everyone from writing to each other last year or so i turned my social media off and asked everyone to either email or write to me barely anyone has but anything i get is so much better to see now than constant menial updates writing on paper is really something i miss doing back and forth with other people high school was the last time that ever happened its sad my kid doesnt pass notes they just text at school now
books,not_removed,prepare to be impressed
books,not_removed,we should start a club xd
books,not_removed,they really are
books,not_removed,ironically he was wearing khaki pants i laughed at that harder than i should
books,not_removed,guts is like a train wreck you just cant look away
books,not_removed,mr palahniuk is on the line shit shit shit shit shit
books,not_removed,im not crying youre crying
books,not_removed,well damn now im jealous of you
books,not_removed,ama ama jk just post the letter please
books,not_removed,oh im laughing my ass off it sounds like a convo my daughter and i would have thank you for sharing
books,not_removed,was going to say the same thing i feel like if fight club inspired someone to lift weights and fight a lot then they really didnt understand it and im not entirely sure chuck palahniuk is all that psyched to have inspired them to do so
books,not_removed,i appreciated your post for a couple of reasonsi too am a middle aged mom a big fan of chucks writing and you gave us insight into the person he is behind the fandom big hug to you some people can just suck
books,not_removed,as someone who recently lost her hedgehog edgar i would have cried even harder rip edgar youre still missed little guy
books,not_removed,please do
books,not_removed,you should finish it great book
books,not_removed,maybe just saying youre way younger looking than him so its a different birthday still
books,not_removed,i had a patient throw up directly in my face today as i was leaning in to listen to her lungs this was such a great thing to come home to
books,not_removed,im stealing the wonderful weirdo line just letting you know funny thing as im pulling stuff out of the box i looked at my daughter and said this is the work of a madman
books,not_removed,sixth rule
books,not_removed,you do not wear shoes when you fight in fight club
books,not_removed,my kid has been through more in years than any kid should she came out on the other side an amazing young woman im a very proud mom shes my best creation
books,not_removed,her name is moo her original name was forsaken because my husband the lit professor found her in the hedges in the front yard left for dead by her mom to save the others she was very sickly and i would bring her to work every day so i could feed her every two hours my assistant would hold her whenever i was busy in the pocket of her sweater she would walk around with her all day as forsaken got bigger she was too big for the pocket anymore so my assistant brought in a big stuffed cow her kids didnt play with anymore well she would curl up with the cow and take naps every time one of us would walk by we would say silly things like for with her moo or moo moo kitty in our defense she was a ridiculously adorable kitten well she eventually started equating the moo with her name and wouldnt answer to anything else plus moo is way better than forsaken sorry honey
books,not_removed,noted i shall carry a vicodin from now on just in case
books,not_removed,when you dont know how to respond to men saying you cant possibly form a coherent thought because of the amount of estrogen in your body
books,not_removed,i know he signed a ton at garden district books and made them sell them at cover price no markups for autographed copies they still have a few
books,not_removed,i just posted the explanation of how moo got her name its pretty ridiculous
books,not_removed,it was oddly endearing
books,not_removed,the original line in the book is i want to have your abortion the studio hated that line said it was too offensive so chuck told them he would write a different line instead but they couldnt change it again so he thought of something worse and the studio execs had to accept it i love that story
books,not_removed,ive worked events with film stars in the past many of them treated me like a peon who was to be ordered around but absolutely lit up and were different people with their fans others were quiet and reserved seemed nervous even but also lit up and were completely different with fans i guess theres just something about knowing someone loves and admires you that brings out the best in some people not excusing the behavior just thinking out loud
books,not_removed,my daughters secret with chuck i am under no secret obligation
books,not_removed,from what im reading from other redditors write him he writes back
books,not_removed,i needed several
books,not_removed,i dont know about survivor fight club was released as a very funny graphic novel through dark horse comics its mostly chuck making fun of himself and his characters its fantastic
books,not_removed,httpchuckpalahniuknetnewschuckpalahniukssurvivortobecomeatvshow
books,not_removed,how awesome i raised my daughter on harry potter that made me so happy for you

books,not_removed,anything but the short story guts try lullaby damned or survivor
books,not_removed,uh oh dont say fangirl or the neckbeards will attack apparently women only like him because hes buff or swole or whatever the vernacular is also chicks that like chuck are as basic as ugg boots and pumpkin spice lattes in the fall i like all three so i guess im just fucked god forbid my feet are warm my brain is stimulated and i like delicious coffee s
books,not_removed,well well heh heh heh
books,not_removed,he made my day maybe getting tons of fan mail will make his
books,not_removed,thank you its a job that is often thankless so every bit of gratitude is so very appreciated glad we could help when you needed it
books,not_removed,that is so amazing
books,not_removed,your friend is a very lucky man yay for competent medical professionals
books,not_removed,that made me chuckle hed make project mayhem take care of the animals it would be great mischief mayhem soap pet rescue
books,not_removed,it really was
books,not_removed,its miserably hot with a heat index of and humidity and i just got home from work its a good day now and yes i was born in in less than two years ill be hitting the big the cat is an asshole and hedgies are the best you are more than welcome i adore how this has encouraged literally hundreds of people to share their random acts of chuck kindness i truly had reservations about posting as it is very personal but lately every post ive seen on social platforms has been so disgusting and negative i wanted to show one true act of kindness i am so so glad i did one act of kindness turned into hundreds and hes even more a hero in my eyes than i ever could have imagined
books,not_removed,whoots found forgotten money is the best money like a payday you give yourself
books,not_removed,no but my inbox is
books,not_removed,imjuns got her
books,not_removed,would be equally cool but i have a feeing it would be filled with more religious and patriotic items and instead of a glitter bomb as soon as you open the box chuck norris would hop out and give you a roundhouse kick to the face
books,not_removed,the tour was for the release of the fight club graphic novel
books,not_removed,the pen is mightier than the sword
books,not_removed,its too damn hot down here for that like satans bowels after taco bell
books,not_removed,at the bookstore they gave away plastic arms that he signed in a free raffle also everyone who bought a ticket had an autographed copy of the hardcover of fight club waiting for them
books,not_removed,i will gladly add a pic of moo
books,not_removed,we laughed for a good minutes over them
books,not_removed,its the green beaded foot long thing in the pictures i need a book the size of mount everest now
books,not_removed,oh please dont it will ruin your opinion of parenting forever
books,not_removed,the beaded bookmark was inside the box
books,not_removed,you see this chuck next time youre here were going out to dinner
books,not_removed,no some coward commented that he could tell from my post that i was a single mom then proceeded to make derogatory comments about single mothers after he was ripped a new one and i posted the edit he deleted the comments
books,not_removed,yep i explain in another comment
books,not_removed,try rtipofmytongue andor rwhatsthatbook
books,not_removed,sigh he told my daughter to keep the letter from her to him a secret not me
books,not_removed,it really is beautiful id like to think the cloisonn√© bead was his mothers he does mention in the letter that his hobby was rockhounding with his dad
books,not_removed,follow their twitter and instagram and his he posts in advance where hes going to be and they have authors there regularly
books,not_removed,she did there is a whole album
books,not_removed,i did of the box he wrapped the mailing box had my info all over it open the imgur gallery
books,not_removed,i actually got it at the mushroom on broadway in new orleans they have thousands of posters there and also one of the most extensive collections of vinyl patches odd clothing and water tobacco pipes ive ever seen its a new orleans institution right near tulane if you ever come this way its a mustsee store
books,not_removed,if you call them they may ship you one i think it was
books,not_removed,i have no idea i would check amazon
books,not_removed,start out with lullaby and moved to damned go from there
books,not_removed,thats so cool shes beautiful
books,not_removed,all he did was write to him and asked him for it chuck wrote all these little quips inside the pages autographed it drew in it amazing
books,not_removed,shame on you
books,not_removed,hes been with his partner mike for years
books,not_removed,pretty sure hes gay
books,not_removed,yeah chuck wants to get into ops pants totally the only possible reason he could have for doing this awesome thing is so he can get laid s
books,not_removed,i believed the title would be too wordy if it said this is what happens when chuck palahniuk decides to send you a gift so i shortened it
books,not_removed,maybe so but im one of literal hundreds hes done this for do you see the other intimate stories of favors hes granted lives hes touched gestures hes made all over this thread i can only assume that you find those posts crass and in poor taste as well or is it just mine despite the fact that this has given many of them a space to speak up and let it be known that this is a genuinely good person who appreciates every single fan who writes back kids and soldiers and people at the lowest points in their lives that is a level of compassion and kindness you couldnt hope to reach on your best day so i posted something positive about a guy who gets far too little publicity about all the good hes done in a point in time where good people are few and far between and i get crap from people like you ok im a crass and horrible person with poor taste ive been called worse by better people step up your game call me ugly stupid whatever floats your boat have a field day at the end of the day im happy with who i am and the life ive built and you need to find satisfaction by trolling strangers on the internet good luck with that meaningful and worthwhile endeavor
books,not_removed,ive never seen a single woman mention chuck on their dating profile but i do see many men mention him perhaps theres geographic differences at play
books,not_removed,ive never needed a dating profile nor been on a dating site so i cannot offer an opinion on this except to say those chicks have good taste in books but id still take them swimming on the first date
books,not_removed,sounds like my kind of club
books,not_removed,is it just his writing that you hate or is there some other reasons
books,not_removed,he would actually talk to you about hating his books and likely buy you a drink while you talk it over hes a really nice and likable guy
books,not_removed,watch the speech i just posted above but will reshare here for ease of clicks i bet you wont think the same way afterward
books,not_removed,i would also like an answer to this question
books,not_removed,the first rule of book club
books,not_removed,why isnt this dude answering im dying to know the list
books,not_removed,pls op
books,not_removed,im so sorry i wasnt on reddit yesterday i dont remember all of the recommendations and the box of stuff is still at my moms house this was probably almost years ago but i know these were in there cathedral by raymond carver the informers by bret easton ellis at the gates of the animal kingdom by amy hempel this one was super hard for me to find jesus son by denis johnson he also recommended the movie session which i thought was good for a horror movie but not really my thing
books,not_removed,thats so cool that she spent his time making that for you im also a mom and huge fan sorry the rest is a little offtopic more importantly i just wanted to say youve raised an absolutely amazing daughter proven by her heartfelt nature and hilarious letter to chuck on your behalf i have girls under the age of old twins and old and i can only hope to be such an amazing influence on my girls as you are to yours and that they are as perceptive and caring as your daughter good for you for being an amazing person and more importantly an amazing mom please pm any tips im often feeling outnumbered husband is a pilot and im often alone and could use always use any advice no matter how small i just want want my young girls to be as thoughtful as yours you have taught your daughter so well and you are blessed in ways that cant even be measured thank for sharing and inspiring me either way xoxo
books,not_removed,is this book store in new orleans
books,not_removed,i actually wore the necklace until it broke which was a questionable fashion choice but i loved it i still have it and didnt lose any pieces it just broke near the clasp
books,not_removed,ill ask my husband he wrote to him and asked him to send him an autographed book for our year wedding anniversary first year gift is paper chuck totally did it decorated it and everything with kissy prints and confetti
books,not_removed,right his arms are huge heh
books,not_removed,til he has a great ass
books,not_removed,holy shit six years later
books,not_removed,i assume it was no i will not marry you no i will not send you my hair please stop writing to me how did you even get this address
books,not_removed,or the girl from chvrches you never fucking know
books,not_removed,awww thank you hugs
books,not_removed,and weird s the characters literally call chuck for a plot device
books,not_removed,ive wondered about this since i first heard there was going to be a sequel does it follow the ending of the book or the movie
books,not_removed,rant is good but hella confusing
books,not_removed,another vouch for survivor definitely my favorite of his
books,not_removed,calm down satan
books,not_removed,now thats just cruel but funny
books,not_removed,as a father of a four year old girl i feel like my home life can be most accurately described as random acts of glitter i still dont know where most of the glitter even comes from it almost seems to just appear out of thin air washing it outoff thats a whole new level of fun itll be days later and ill suddenly notice a bit of glitter on my wrist thatll have been there for a few days then just when ive finally got rid of it somehow she finds more glitter from out of nowhere
books,not_removed,theres a service that will mail glitter to your enemies httpsshipyourenemiesglittercom use it well
books,not_removed,first rule of chucks gift club
books,not_removed,i wouldnt be surprised if there were a lot of us
books,not_removed,he hand made her a four foot beaded bookmark using his mothers jewelry inside a flamboyant handmade box i mean yeah nothing on straight guys who are crafty and thoughtful and all but i bet if you took out that it was palahniuk then people here wouldve been all hes gay that is so much love for fans though makes me want to write to him and my other favorite authorsnot expecting gifts just because you know he must really appreciate it
books,not_removed,nah this is a throwaway account i use for ptsd and getting shit for my height and the letter is pretty unique if it gets big i think it would out me
books,not_removed,i read helter skelter and it said towards the end that he answers mail i found out he was being held at corcoran state prison spelling might be wrong in california so i wrote to him saying that i was a reporter and asking him questions he wrote back and answered all of them but also drew swasticas and other crazy stuff in the margins he has the handwriting of a six year old
books,not_removed,i read palahniuks account of going to a haunted house type attraction and the guide being this exact type of slow beefy dude the guide starts the whole first rule is you dont talk about spiel second rule is chuck interrupts i wrote that book huh fight club i wrote that book the guide stares blankly blinks a few times there was a book
books,not_removed,yep someone confused brad pitt fans with actual brad pitt if i had to describe the chuck ps largest demo based on people i know id say it was theater geeks who read a little bit less than the average theater geek
books,not_removed,rip edgar the hedgehog
books,not_removed,perfectly perfect you should steal the phrase im so happy for you and your daughter authors like chuck who understand the strangely unique and vulnerable relationship between their writings and their fans are the best and chuck is topping that list in my opinion if you and your husband andor daughter ever make it out to portland or hit me up and you can stay in our guest bedrooms full of books
books,not_removed,great story
books,not_removed,moo is an adorable name for a cat i like to think its how a kitty whos too tiny to manage a diphthong says mew
books,not_removed,this bummed me out just know that the few bad apples youve seen and replied to are usually just too thoughtless to think about what theyre saying because its on the internet and that the type of person they are is not a very common one anywhere outside of the internet im sure of that some people just lose their dont be an ass filter online and it sucks for people who arent readyaware of that also theres the other huge factor in that lots of people on the internet are teenage boys most grow out of it thanks for the amazing post always nice to see successful people staying humble enough to interact with people on a personal level im sure it just gets exhausting hope you have a great day
books,not_removed,that might be where i purchased my copies it was awhile ago he personalized them and drew pictures for me fight club and my favorite book invisible monsters
books,not_removed,havent been fucked like that since grade school if memory serves
books,not_removed,awesome maybe one day if i ever get my wish to adopt kids i can do the same thinking about it still warms my heart
books,not_removed,damn
books,not_removed,from what ive heard about him youre probably right editspelling
books,not_removed,hes a super awesome guy and it made me so glad to hear your story ive told other people my story that chuck palhaniuk gave me a personalized beaded necklace and they dont believe me lol it was a really cool experience for me and it makes me super happy to read that he does the same for others
books,not_removed,he is indeed him and the kid next to him were actually the and heart surgeries of that type performed at that hospital the week previous they had done the same to a drunk driver who had hit a power pole
books,not_removed,i am very glad you did as well and im sure your cat is indeed haha my cat was an asshole too sure looks cool though
books,not_removed,and who thought id rediscover it because of reddit and chuck palahniuk the man just keeps on giving
books,not_removed,httpchuckpalahniuknetfeaturesshortsguts forgive me if youve already read this
books,not_removed,as a parent i avoid them like the plague
books,not_removed,oh man avoiding them now thanks
books,not_removed,did you link to a picture i didnt see it what about all the candles and incense and stuff did you post a pic of that
books,not_removed,just finished guts thank you for that experience
books,not_removed,if thats the correct interpretation that didnt happen either
books,not_removed,i dont know if your sample is big enough but tourmaline is pretty neat its got different refractive properties along its different axes so if you shine a light one way it will be a certain color and going another way itll be a different color ill see if i can find something that will make more sense lol
books,not_removed,i follow them on fb but i dont have twitter or ig maybe thatll be my excuse to start
books,not_removed,my title has less words than yours
books,not_removed,i had the same reaction as the person youre responding to you take a meaningful personal connectiongesture and your first instinct is to take pictures and plaster it them on the internet i just dont get it
books,not_removed,idk fuck fighting sounds different from fight fucking if you ask me you might be in for an unpleasant surprise
books,not_removed,see now this makes me sad because it would be easy if chuck was a horrible person who wrote books i hate but the reality is that chuck is an unhorrible person who writes books i hate and will probably never write a book that i dont hate and i will have to continue on with the knowledge that an intelligent decent man with some pretty sizable skill in writing consistently writes books that are about as appealing to me as a shit sausage its the whole wasted potential is worse than simply being bad because in listening to this i grasp that chuck has the potential to produce something id want to read but never will its not in his nature as an author so i suppose a lot of my dislike of the man comes from wanting to like him but finding his work unlikable
books,not_removed,ya wtf bro list or gtfo
books,not_removed,i want an ama now
books,not_removed,but it says some of chucks favorite books
books,not_removed,no fighting
books,not_removed,maybe its such a long and well curated list that hes taking extra time to format it properly and everything bc hes an awesome guy
books,not_removed,my parenting advice is this love them even when theyre assholes set boundaries so they arent assholes in public dont sweat the small stuff its mostly small stuff be nonjudgmental let them vent to you about anything and dont tell other people give advice thats practical to them and their personality not just what you would do be their biggest cheerleader encourage what makes them different theyll stand out in the herd plus it gives them an outlet for excess energy my daughter loved tools so instead of just buying her dolls i bought her a toolbox too shes now headed to be a cybernetics engineer who loves red lipstick love her friends too have an open door policy three years old is worse than two youll be ok mama just remember that its temporary let them get messy i would give her a bucket and a hose and a shovel and put her outside she loved it id just hose her down before she came inside shed be exhausted every time let them make mistakes dont be a helicopter parent dont say i told you so its ok not to treasure every moment or make every moment count sometimes its ok to say im exhausted and drop them off at a babysitter or grandmas and drive to the nearest convenience store and stuff a snickers bar in your mouth dont measure yourself against other moms ever message me if you ever need to chat sometimes all we can do is reach out
books,not_removed,in addition to what kara said id just like to say kudos to you because i have no idea who is daughter and who is mother in that album keep doing what youre doing
books,not_removed,httpwwwgardendistrictbookshopcom yes its in nola

books,not_removed,youve probably seen it but for anyone that hasnt he wrote a beautiful short story called massive attack thats about his steroid use
books,not_removed,is that what a mans supposed to look like
books,not_removed,i dont even know who that is definitely could have been her it was a really big crowd for the frontwoman and lead vocalist of the scottish synthpop band chvrches though also she must be really popular with the older republican crowd
books,not_removed,sounds like what stephen king did in the dark tower series
books,not_removed,the book
books,not_removed,i imagine the book since its written by chuck
books,not_removed,is the ending of the book very different from the film excuse me as i havent read it dont murder me please
books,not_removed,glitter its like herpes for kids
books,not_removed,this is my husbands life
books,not_removed,do you ever wonder if the janitor at the glitter factory has the most depressing job in the world perhaps its seen as the ultimate form of job security
books,not_removed,damn
books,not_removed,this gave me a hearty chuckle thanks for getting what i meant

books,not_removed,you do realize that you can not like something but still recognize it has welldone i have lots of writers movies bands that i dont like because it is not my style but i can recognize their talent not liking something isnt necessarily saying it is bad but you seem to have a level of arrogance to think that because you dont like it it isnt good the funny thing is that because it gets a strong reaction out of you that means it is good even if it is not your thing

books,not_removed,three years old is worse than t you aint kidding my son is about to hit and hes gone from my minime to my miniterror
books,not_removed,i just want to say that its awesome that you helped indulge her interest in technology like that too many people are hung up about outdated stigmas that its a boys club even if it mostly still isit just shouldnt be and definitely agree with so much of this it helps make your kids be independent and confident yet lets them find their limits thats fundamental things that make people better people
books,not_removed,your daughters letter brought tears to my eyes but your words brought me relief good on you for raising an awesome kid for spreading your wisdom good on chuck for brightening your day again and again
books,not_removed,this is an amazing list i may have to share it with a few amazing moms in my life including my wife and mother to our three daughters it never hurts to have a little help
books,not_removed,drive to the nearest convenience store and stuff a snickers bar in your mouth im not a mom but im going to follow this advice thanks
books,not_removed,as a new momma days now currently connected to my pump and trying like hell to keep my eyes open this made me a little teary and i took a screen shot to look back at when i need a little advice thank you
books,not_removed,this is incredible i never knew my mother but occasionally ill allow myself to fantasize that she would have been the type of mother that you are i didnt know that could actually be real before now
books,not_removed,i think you are my favorite person on reddit as a mom of teens mine his i say you are right on target with this advice ive pretty much done the same and i have some great kids too
books,not_removed,this mom of and gramma of loves your parenting advice excellent in every way let them out after the rainstorm to stomp in the puddles kids are washable
books,not_removed,no wonder your daughter turned out so well will you be my mom
books,not_removed,im not a parent but im saving this comment for when the day may come beautiful stuff
books,not_removed,good stuff
books,not_removed,if i had ever been lucky enough to have kids i would totally have followed this advice i wish i had more than one upvote to give
books,not_removed,youre a gem i love this post and this comment youve brightened my day thank you
books,not_removed,you are fucking amazing this is pretty much how we were raised though i did have a curfew but it was pretty late and we turned out really well once my mom even helped to put up one of my brothers friends mohawks with glue and egg whites or whatever they used props to you for sure no wonder chuck wanted to send you something
books,not_removed,let them vent to you about anything and dont tell other people this is a good advice why because my mom would fucking put me on speaker phone for my dad or neighbour to hear when im talking about stuff with her without me even knowing she says she cant hear me well without speakers and this breaks a lot of trust between us and i start closing in my shell and think twice before opening up to her please parents when your child wants you and only you to keep something private and isnt a huuuuuge freaky thing that needs joint parental intervention please keep it a secret on the long term there will be less lies and frustrations between you too

books,not_removed,my daughter doesnt want kids and i completely support that its a very personal choice and one that deserves to be respected i have two rules get good grades dont get pregnant anything else we can deal with i dont expect straight as i want her to do her best and if shes struggling and her best is a c then a c it is luckily my husband is a great tutor ive brought her to planned parenthood every three months to get her depo shot because as a nurse ive given one too many pregnancy tests to year olds and she deserves not to have her life defined by one bad choice and dealing with the repercussions of how she handles that choice shes never had a curfew i dont curb her language i dont go through her room or look at her phone i grant her all the privacy she wants i always knock before going in her room if i notice that shes acting off i ask if she wants to talk about it and if she says no i dont push shell talk when shes ready she has two friends in notsogreat home situations and they stay with us a lot i love them like theyre mine they have a room where they can sleep and keep their stuff but they usually all crash in her room on the floor her cousins from her dads side are also in and out of here all the time i speak to her like an adult i always have she founded the first allgirls robotics team in the state and had been voted president of that team for three years running her gpa is a solid shes had one detention ever and that was because she broke up a fight and told the two freshman to chill the fuck out and a teacher heard her shes an ambassador for lego league and spends her time mentoring little kids and building robots with them and she graduates in less than days and is moving many hours away im going to miss her horribly however im looking forward to our empty nest and the new adventures shes going to have as much as i love her this is her life and her goals not an extension of mine
books,not_removed,anytime i lurk on some of the parenting subs but always find myself more in agreement with the folks at child free some moms need to read chucks snowflake line over and over
books,not_removed,rosie is my daughters robotics team mascot we can do it
books,not_removed,ive told my daughter many times i love you but i dont like you very much right now we both need to walk away and calm down before we say something we regret im not a perfect parent by any means ive flown off the handle over silly shit shes gotten caught up in needless drama and gossip which is a pet peeve of mine sometimes i come home and she hasnt done something ive asked her to do and i get irritated if i said it was all sunshine and rainbows id be lying however once you learn to just let go something chuck helped me realize life becomes much easier i fail as a parent sometimes i failed as a parent for a long time when i trusted someone family to take care of her so i could work a night shift and they took off with her for two years talk about beating yourself up i still beat myself up but if that wouldnt have happened she wouldnt be the person she is and i certainly wouldnt life is messy and beautiful and you must play the cards youre dealt youre going to be okay and one day youll look back with relief that you made it i promise
books,not_removed,thats awesome
books,not_removed,oh no honey mom hugs for you too lots of them
books,not_removed,once trust is broken you can forgive but youll never forget my mother is a horrid woman when i was growing up i had no privacy she would regularly search my room listen in on phone calls and walk in whenever she wanted she micromanaged my time told me who i could and couldnt be friends with put me down mentally and physically abused me and allowed whatever man she was with to do to me whatever he pleased i finally was able to go nocontact with her last year having a horrible parent allowed me to be a better one because she set such a stellar example of how to do it all wrong being an overbearing helicopter parent makes for insecure and resentful children my kid is too awesome for that

books,not_removed,ha much appreciated i wish you many many more adventures
books,not_removed,haha im your fellow pale girl i havent tanned for at least years now and i use sunscreen religiously i live in a country where we dont get that many sunny months so everyone looks at me funny but whatever it hurts when i see my girlfriends just throwing clothes off and sprawling out in the sun as soon as the spring sun gets warmer i mean do you but use the god damn sunblock
books,not_removed,yes fellow new orleanian you are

books,not_removed,coffee consumed crisis averted feelins still happening must just be an emotional sap today
books,not_removed,wouldnt that be fun i did take kat von ds side though does that disqualify me
books,not_removed,agree i turned this year and i live in a college town full of young faces i feel fucking ancient but i still get carded of the time and have a hard time convincing anyone im over it was the sunscreen i have no other explanation
books,not_removed,i wish you were like my big sister your post and comments indicate that youre an awesome person with a good head on her shoulders
books,not_removed,nope it makes you our queen at least in my eyes
books,not_removed,this is like saying ive just started watching films and started with two uwe boll flicks
books,not_removed,alex cross was awfully poor and basically copied the tv show the following not sure which book you mean specifically but alex cross was around way before the following patterson is like junk food it is ok to like it and it is ok to want something more since you are just starting out try as many genres and authors as you can give the book or pages and drop it if you dont like it it is also ok to be a slow reader you will get faster with practice you can do some ya lit or some fun thrillers at first to have things happen even though your reading is slow i recommend you some harry potter and hunger games and jack reacher series maybe some enders game and the martian too
books,not_removed,american gods is fantastic if you like hard boiled detective noir check out james ellroys books
books,not_removed,if you want woo james patterson isnt the place to find it he would tell you himself that his books dont have a lot of depth he doesnt build elaborate mythologies or study the human condition he just tells simple breezy fun often predictable stories or and this part rustles a lot of book peoples jimmies he writes a plot outline and gives the book to a lesser known author to write the specifics black and blue for example is credited to james patterson with candice fox in all likelihood he came up with a plot outline and she did the rest of the writing
books,not_removed,oh jesus dont do that hes terrible
books,not_removed,neil gaiman is a great author if you like american gods i recommend stardust and the film after that you should either read his other stuff or read some terry pratchett stephen king is a must for anyone beginning to read
books,not_removed,this is like saying ive started watching films and i just finished two michael bay films american gods is awful in my opinion thats a rather unpopular opinion here but it really is its so cheesy and the plot is just a jumbled together mess gaiman was clearly just trying to smush as many american folk tales together as possible into one novel and he didnt care about the characters for fucks sake the main character is named shadow gaiman is a comic book author and it really shows in his more serious works in a negative way i appreciate some of his short stories and his childrens literature stardust for instance but all of his adultoriented novels have just been cringeworthy to me
books,not_removed,any chance it is the redwall series by brian jacques
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules your post is better suited for asking in rwhatsthatbook or rtipofmytongue
books,not_removed,the wolperting creature rumo and his miraculous adventures
books,not_removed,no but thank you for helping me most of the beasts in the book would not exist on earth i just remember the author making outlandish creatures not all were large but they were just different
books,not_removed,ok thank you i will move post i dont create many posts so ima just copy and paste and delete this one if i can
books,not_removed,this community is muuch large than those other two anyway i can keep this post up over the weekend and remove it monday ive been thinking about reading this series for weeks now
books,not_removed,no that is a crazy creature but the most memorable ones were humanoid and the story revolved around chronicling all these creatures
books,not_removed,the animorphs
books,not_removed,nah bud thanks though
books,not_removed,i read in my bed if i come upon a word that i need to check i do it in a dictionary app on my phone i try to avoid this as much as possible though as it takes me out of the book
books,not_removed,i typically try to read the entire sentenceparagraph if the word doesnt become clear by that point or become redundant where you could always leave it till later then you can look it up times out of i can guess what the word means or just jot it down for later it might take some practice but youll get there
books,not_removed,typically i look them up google spits out a definition for most words right in the results page
books,not_removed,check google if google definition seems off use an actual dictionary app
books,not_removed,look them up every time if i cant get a full idea from the dictionary maybe its like a certain type of architecural trait then i check wikipedia or images you may not notice it at first but your vocab will grow a lot if you do this
books,not_removed,first i try to infer from context if that doesnt work then i look up a definition
books,not_removed,hey there one of my favourite things about reading using either a kindle or a kindle app is that any word you come across that you dont know you simply tap it and a little dictionary window pops up telling you the definition andor wikipedia entry i had to read a paperback lolita with a dictionary next to me but reading infinite jest on a kindle has made having a smaller lexicon than famous authors a breeze
books,not_removed,just look them up dont risk misunderstanding the material because you decided not to look it up dont you want to get exactly what the author is saying
books,not_removed,this became a big issue for me when i started reading wordy translations of borges i now keep a paper dictionary on my shelf a dictionary app on my phone and even a command line dictionary program on my laptop i use whichevers closest when im reading
books,not_removed,ill write them down and look them up later sometimes ill write out the whole sentence to put the word in context when i look it up
books,not_removed,look em up thereby decreasing the number of times this will happen to me in the future
books,not_removed,like most others have said context clues then looking them up if you use an ereader sometimes youll be able to tap the word for a definition other than that i would recommend trying to get a handle on latin and greek roots a lot of english comes from them and theyll probably be useful at some point since it seems like youre still in school
books,not_removed,since i read most books on my phone a long press on the word brings up its definition super convenient
books,not_removed,if its an ebook they usually give you the definition when you hold down and highlight the word for sure kindle does i cant recall using it in google play books i use it frequently and accidentally enough that when im reading a paper book i almost reach for the page to highlight a word lol for paper books i like the versions that have notes about the novel words that need defined or background info on customs of the time and things like that have a reference number and the back of the book has the explanation ive also read books where there are notes like that at the bottom of the page ive bought most of my books secondhand and theyre all from different publishers so its not too difficult to find copies like that
books,not_removed,maybe unrelated but in japanese books second native language although its weaker than my english i will brute force my way with context unless its a word that comes up often and therefore probably important to the story in german books language im learning ill look them up with my google translate extension
books,not_removed,if its taking too much away from my reading like narrative of the life of frederick douglass an american slave by frederick douglass than i look up the definitions otherwise i just skim over them so long as i get the gist of what im reading with the frederick douglass so far i believe i looked up words and only made it to page
books,not_removed,yeah theres also the issue that it takes me out of the book
books,not_removed,ive been thinking about getting a device but physical books just look so nice and i get a special feeling from them ill think about it
books,not_removed,in the older books it sometimes gets tedious my school also does not have good internet connection so sometimes i have to resort to paper dictionaries which dont contain some of these old words
books,not_removed,oh damn do you have a smart phone maybe if i couldnt google them quickly i dont know if looking them up would be worth it maybe write them down and look them up later that will be better for remembering anyway
books,not_removed,i dont personally do this but ive heard of a lot of people jotting words they dont know on their bookmark and looking them up another time usually you can make sense of the book even missing a word but you still increase your vocab
books,not_removed,im doing this with infinite jest feels like im writing a new word down every other minute
books,not_removed,some people really disagree but i think that book is way better on a kindle its so easy to hop to footnotes and get definitions quickly
books,not_removed,definitely makes sense
books,not_removed,at one point you said lied below its lay below just in case that isnt a typo as for the actual writing it feels just a little rushed it can be easy to want to get right to the clever twist you have in your head but make sure to build a scene describe as many senses as you reasonably can not just sight tell us about the feel of the light breeze the scents in the air make the reader feel like they are actually in this scene not just viewing from a distance
books,not_removed,it reads like english isnt your native language also rwriting
books,not_removed,its too quick its over without a moments notice dog fire done my reaction is okay and not really care for how it could or should go further
books,not_removed,im no expert but to me it feels like you drug the first sentence out instead of breaking it into two sentences that followed by the short choppy nature of the next handful of sentences doesnt flow very well to me also grassy field that lay below as well as symbolizing the homes former i think it would also help to have more of an idea of what were reading before asking for feedback im assuming its some sort of fantasy piece because of the statement about no human being able to cause the fire but i really have no clue its hard to truly know if what were looking at is something wed be interested in reading with so little to work with
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,httpmoellerhauscomrevdirhtm this is an online book
books,not_removed,oh gosh i kept searching for reccomendmeabook im sorry delete it if you must

books,not_removed,thank you i lurk but dont frequent very often you very welcoming and i apriciate it
books,not_removed,hi im sorry but we dont allow fundraisers in rbooks i suggest you check out rdetroit but please check with the mods over there first before posting there are also some other subs that allow fundraisers but i dont know any off the top of my head good luck
books,not_removed,for writing advice rwriting might be a bit better for you not really understanding why youre looking for quotes to use in your own writing though but good luck with it
books,not_removed,male and thats why they lost faith because the one thing they believed in was created to control them female but it gives me strength male strength in what following their rules and living your life exactly how they want you to female its freedom male youre still living on this planet arent you youre not free you just think you are female where do you find your freedom then male death
books,not_removed,lucifer the million lords of hell stand arrayed about you tell us why we should let you leave helmet or no you have no power here what power have dreams in hell dream tell me lucifer morningstar what power would hell have if those here imprisoned were not able to dream of heaven neil gaiman sandman best advice i could truly give is to read an endlessly
books,not_removed,writing is a skill not a talent fiestalemon feel free to use above quote no need to cite me
books,not_removed,i dont think writers ask strangers to write their opening lines for them kind of your job
books,not_removed,please post writing questions in a writing subreddit like rwriting read their rules before posting
books,not_removed,well it seems other redditors have spoken anyway i dont know why youre being so harsh to me when you asked for dialogue between a male and female i was simply offering my thoughts at your request
books,not_removed,and if you hate religion then surely my context relates a similar detest for it to begin writing i suggest that you learn to read intertextually because it appears to me that youre lacking in that department are you mad because no one cares about your post do you have attention issues perhaps neglectful parents goodluck may god be with you
books,not_removed,you didnt even know it was about religion before you judged me i told you after go be nasty and hateful somewhere else
books,not_removed,and i see you deleted your post
books,not_removed,i was a teacher in a low income neighborhood where the students were given free pencils most of the students were on free or reduced lunch they threw the pencils on the floor and generally didnt have an appreciation for them one of the janitors collected the pencils the kids discarded probably a day around the school and sent them to poor communities in latin american where the students didnt have school supplies it amazed me that he thought to do that thats an everyday hero in my opinion
books,not_removed,i could never understand why people throw away books its not like its going to go out of date o spoil i lived in auckland for years and you could leave old books in the front door of your apartment and if someone wanted it they could take it or leave others there were also spots close to the waterfront were the same thing happened leave a book take a book i loved that
books,not_removed,so i work at an organization that accepts book donations ive also worked with people at a bookstore and a library and the one thing ive learned is that sometimes books have to be thrown away they mold mildew suffer water damage and fall apart paperbacks from the or earlier especially and they are rarely worth anything when the spine glue no longer can hold the pages inside the cover it unfortunately isnt much use to anyone yes you could try taping it but when there are thousands of other books for people to choose from its hard to rationalize saving one book especially if its a pulp romance no ones heard of fun story though after my father died i had to clean out his house in order to give it back to the bank i hired a local company that would clean out the house they were very family run and said that its often cheaper to donate to goodwill than to pay the landfill fees well the lady in charge told me about a man who died and left all of his books to a local university they had three large rooms full of books the university couldnt use any of them the lady told me that they tried to donate what they could but they ended up having to take to the landfill our local recycling center isnt even equipped to recycle them because they have glue and plastic mixed in with the paper as someone who works with a lot of books ive found that most people dont really comprehend how many physical books are out there especially if youre like the man in the story who is a magnet for local people to give books to im sure even he has to be picky about which ones he takes especially if theyre going to kids
books,not_removed,he really took it to the next level leaving the first floor of his house open too thats awesome üëè
books,not_removed,im sure everyone in this thread takes good care of their books unfortunately some people dont speaking as a former used bookstore worker i saw many books missing pages torn smelling of smoke or cat pee eaten by silverfish and the like we recycled whatever we could and threw away the rest books getting thrown away is just a sign that there are a lot of them out there
books,not_removed,the jvm really improved over the years

books,not_removed,books containing stories might not ever go out of date well maybe even those with new grammarspelling but books containing information certainly getting outdated frequently with better understanding of the world i love my old books about the solar system and dinosaurs for example but much what is written in there isnt up to date anymore
books,not_removed,former used bookstore employee here some others have already provided good reasons to recycle your books or why certain books should be discardedarchived based on content but i wanted to weigh in because i have answered this question to literally hundreds of customers at our bookstore we didnt just sell usednew books we bought them directly from the public so people would come in every day with boxes bins bags suitcases garbage bags armfuls or even truckloads of books it was our job to sift through every buy and determine first whether any of it was salvageable then whether any of it had value then what that value should be the thing most customers who came in to sell didnt understand was that not every book has value just because its a book twenty copies of your local churchs selfpublished catechism do not belong on our shelves ok maybe in clearance but even more than that all of that paper from books that people are unlikely to read serves far more purpose getting turned back into paper for new books an outdated book while it may have historical or archival purpose is likely already kept somewhere for such purposes anything we find that appears to be old or outdated but still hold some collectible value wed clean up and put in our antiques section however beyond mere questionable content value many buys would come in filled with books that were waterdamaged covered in black mold filled with handwriting obscuring the text bent up and curled over to the point where pages were falling out or the spine was broken rotted to the point of disintegrating covered in stains infested with critters experiencing readability deterioration due to foxing stinking of smoke or worse we did donate a ton of old books to childrens reading charities but none of these damaged ones are suitable for children to be handling not only are some of them hazardous black mold or completely unreadable theyre just plain nasty and kids should be given books that are at least in ok shape no matter what part of the world theyre in so we would throw all these heavily damaged ones in the trash and any recyclable ones waterdamaged was still ok to recycle etc in the recycling bin theres nothing wrong with used books or books that are a little old especially if youre responsible about maintaining your old collection but most people arent and its important to toss your damaged books and recycle your old outdated ones this also helps book retailers and printers stay in business as they resupply old books that are still in demand while literally throwing out brand new books is pretty stupid since you can donate them or sell them for cash online the general practice of thinning ones collection is not without its merits from watching the video it appears that mr gutierrez is responsibly only filling his shelf with tossed books that are still in good shape which is what the kids deserve good on him
books,not_removed,water damage mold devoured by rodentsinsectspests infested with bugs that will spread to your home and destroy your other books source work at a used book store people want to dig through our trash all the time but the books we throw away are there for a reason any books we cant sell in the store we donate any books we cant donate we recycle and books we cant recycle we end up having to trash stay out of used bookstore dumpsters yo fill out an application to receive a donation from us instead
books,not_removed,there are also libraries that will happily take them
books,not_removed,some books are just so awful that they have to die i use such books as firewood

books,not_removed,my christian mother made me throw out all of my harry potter books because of magic i wasnt allowed to donate them to charity
books,not_removed,people throw away everything in the united states i am a teacher and have rescued uniforms electronics money and books in the trash
books,not_removed,books dont go away after youve consumed them and dont need them they usually collect until they become clutter they can be hard to get rid of if you try to sell them you realize how little their worth friends only pick out a few used book storesthrift storesdonations boxes only want the ones that will sell if you donate the rest they usually end up recycled anyway i myself have boxes of books that i stored away in boxes i cant bring myself to recycle them but i dont have time to sort through them i have recently seen a free library box near me and have considered bring some books there
books,not_removed,i know you probably get super overwhelmed by the shear number of books you have to go through but some of the minor damage glue no longer holding books that still have nice looking covers could be collectable unfortunately it would require someone to sort and look the books up for possibility of niche collectors some of the old crime noir pulps and even old scifi like the old ace doubles might not have existing reprints they could also be a bit collectable due to original cover art these go into collections rather than carried and read so a loose cover or pages isnt as big of a problem but maybe im just weird in that i collect some of the old scifi in its pressing lol i usually see the romance novels put in large paper bags or boxes and sold for nobody has time for sorting those
books,not_removed,the salvation army where i live got into some trouble a few years ago when some idiot reporter wrote several shocking reveals that they threw away books that the didnt sell within a certain time period not grasping the fact that it cost more to store them then the profit from the sale
books,not_removed,not at all creepy
books,not_removed,our local used book library goes through its stock once every month or so and throws tons of books each time we go through what they throw out but the large majority of the nondamaged books are pure trash out of a hundred nondamaged books we end up keeping maybe one the others are cheap romance novels diet fad cookbooks selfhelp bullcrap new age scams and exercise manuals from hell it made me sad to realize that we cut trees to make what is essentially glued toilet paper granted i might have more chance by going to a rich neighborhood like this guy id be amazing to find a tolstoy
books,not_removed,how can i just bring old books to a library and leave them i was looking to cut down on my book collection next time i move i would love to be able to give them to someone who needs more books
books,not_removed,the half price books near me throws out books all the time its the only dumpster ive found myself in
books,not_removed,people who just want to get rid of it the easiest way
books,not_removed,this is always the kneejerk response to stories like this as though the people who deal with this dilemma on a daily basis havent already gone through all viable options yes you can try to donate old unwanted inventory but usually its unwanted for a reason
books,not_removed,i have never bought my son a new book hes received a few as gifts and he is in the imagination library program so he gets one every month but of his book collection are used books that i got at thrift stores or little free libraries we also use the public library a lot but its nice to have those favorites on the shelf
books,not_removed,we would give away magazines once they were a year old or so wed have people pick them up read them then donate them right back to us only now in worse condition
books,not_removed,since they read them yes how do i know they read them the garbage collector wouldnt put in all this effort if they werent reading them
books,not_removed,your boyfriend didnt realizethrow away really means throw in your car after your shift and sell it i do retail store installations sometimesthey tell us remove from site for the oldend of discussion ive collected some awesome stuffstrangely they always want the old printer shipped back nobody how heavy
books,not_removed,seems like a raunchy title to a book
books,not_removed,i hate to break it to you but libraries throw books out constantly
books,not_removed,projection much
books,not_removed,i know its just a joke but fyi porous materials like paper are poor harborstransmitters for pathogens bacteria and viruses dont survive very long on paper products the only likely illness anyone could get from an old book would be a reaction to fungus or dust
books,not_removed,is your mom an elephant
books,not_removed,maybe they just got tired of peanuts you might too if you get them every day
books,not_removed,no we did the thing where you move the pencil really fast and it looks like it bends
books,not_removed,i think thats somewhat unfair to say some kids have tremendous fun with simple things like a cardboard box a ball or a pen and paper its true kids need to be taught to appreciate things but impoverished kids face struggles and difficulties that impede and flood their lives
books,not_removed,yeah all those old how to manuals for year old os and software you find at thrift stores certainly comes to mind reading old cold war geopolitical assessments or managerial guidebooks can be pretty entertaining if not downright interesting though
books,not_removed,thats why textbook companies print new editions every two years that one edit ruined the edition only the is accurate now s
books,not_removed,send them to me i find it fascinating seeing what used to be held as truth
books,not_removed,the facts that have changed are completely irrelevant to kids the general ideas is what matters
books,not_removed,booo dont come here with your logic hahah you are right but i was comparing books to food and talking about barely new books that get tossed because they dont want them anymore or the kids outgrew them
books,not_removed,as a buyer at a used bookstore thank you for this im not sure how many times i can explain why we dont want a book that is water damaged and has a cracked binding
books,not_removed,actually librarians usually have the job of throwing away bad books or books in bad conditions because no one else will do it some books just dont get read
books,not_removed,please please please do not donate old ratty crap to your library we dont want your years of national geographic magazine or your textbooks from years ago or your mildew smelling books that you found in your attic but youre donating to us because you just cant bear to throw away a book its a nice sentiment it is the thing is that an individual book has little value but instead the fact that we have easy access to reading materials of all sorts is what has value we love it when people donate things for our book sale that will actually generate us money and dont just require us to haul it to the dumpster at the end of our book sale
books,not_removed,when i lived in fairfax county va the libraries threw away books many of them in demand books like harry potter in excellent condition
books,not_removed,not really in colombia
books,not_removed,i wish there were more of those around where i live ive seen two one in someones actual yard and one in front of a store
books,not_removed,i need to know the reason behind that did he wanted to read them later was it an experiment did something else happened hahaha i need to know
books,not_removed,our organization doesnt throw them out unless theyre literally falling apart and missing pages we also reject books we dont want such as textbooks or outdated medical guides but i know several people who work at half price books and they say that there are several books they cant buy and will offer to throw them away for people most people care more about getting rid of their books more than they do finding the book a proper home but to your point yeah the biggest problem in distributing books is having knowledgeable people who can sort and catalog specialty books there are just so many books out there that its astounding plus when you take into account textbooks magazines novelty books like the million lol cats books that were popular or books of inspirational quotes and bibles that the gideons are unloading by the crateful it becomes really obvious that the shear number of books outweighs the logistics required to find each book a happy owner after all taking the time to find the person who would want a copy of even more chicken soup for the teenage soul ends up costing far more time and resources than its worth i think a lot of people who dont work with books every day imagine that every book these sorts of places get is a childhood classic or a great find like theyre littered with first edition paperbacks of the maltese falcon or james and the giant peach those sorts of books they notice theyre also the first ones that people take leaving the million selfhelp alternative medicine family cookbook poetry collections national geographic travel guides to random countries from sixty years ago readers digest condensed collections to collect dust
books,not_removed,correct
books,not_removed,i dont think so hes a nice guy who loves books and kids and improving lives if he was inviting them in for individual reading time or some shit thatd be a different story but it sounds like he turned his first floor into a comeandgoasyouplease type deal just a regular old good deed
books,not_removed,i hope things improve for you soon
books,not_removed,mine did something similar hopefully once you are out you will be able to rebuild your library
books,not_removed,i understand not all are a fly went by but maybe nursing homes would like a steaming romantic novel just saying no need to trash what maybe others can use or repurpose
books,not_removed,librarian here check with your library some do some dont we used to take donations but of the time what people wanted to donate was crap that nobody really wanted and we ended up with piles and piles of objectively terrible books that nobody borrowed we tried to sell them for literally pennies then tried to give them away for free and still couldnt shift them due to diminishing shelf space weve had to say no to any future donations but unofficially well take it if its a good one
books,not_removed,yes you often can i dont know about your library but ours resells those books to raise money for the library
books,not_removed,i understand that i saved tubs of childhood books my daughter and i have so much joy reading them at bed time its was a great choice to save them for years just to share my favorites with her and seeing the joy they give her
books,not_removed,clearly i know trash is trash my point is many people cant afford an added expense of books so donate when you can
books,not_removed,i find that the kids library books atleast the ones in our library are so used and so dirty i feel like putting them in a biohazard bag instead of my kids hands hehe we bought two new books full price which luckily they got the most kilometers from my year old wwwbobstaakecomlookabook i actually wrote the author letting him know how much my kid liked them super nice guy otherwise my kid gets an armload of used books every two weeks or so he loves it fun for me completing the collections too almost have all munsch books
books,not_removed,i think they were talking of the kids not the books
books,not_removed,they do but they also have a bunch of good books for free that havent been picked out of the garbage
books,not_removed,too close to the truth for you
books,not_removed,w its just a joke but fyi porous materials like paper are poor harborstransmitters for pathogens fyi most books covers are not porous theyre often coated this is precisely why reddit is evil people say what they think and not what they know the calicivirus the culprit of the stomach flu lives for days or weeks at room temperature and normal humidity other microbes form exoskeletonlike spores as a defense mechanism like the bacteria staphylococcus aureus which is responsible for toxic shock syndrome food poisoning and wound infections in this way they can withstand temperature and humidity extremes this bacterial spore can survive for weeks on dry clothing the bacillus anthracis the anthrax bacteria can also form spores and survive tens to hundreds of years we are talking about garbage trucks ok imagine the breeding ground for the plethora of bacteria from peoples vomit sperm rags menstrual pads need i go on its garbage most flu viruses can live one to two days on nonporous surfaces and to hours on porous surfaces but a study found that avian influenza seemed particularly hardy surviving as long as six days in germany researchers found that kinds of bacteria such as ecoli and staph survived on paper was still present after three days three freaking days ahem
books,not_removed,yeah but bob barker spent to move her to a better climate
books,not_removed,shes certainly the size of one
books,not_removed,reading old cold war geopolitical assessments or managerial guidebooks can be pretty entertaining if not downright interesting though this is true just make sure that you understand the context and maybe keep them away from elderly relatives with even mild dementia
books,not_removed,i believe some of those can be valuable more of manuals for old machines that are still in use rather than personal pcs but people collect all kinds of things
books,not_removed,of course thats an exaggeration and i agree with you that it is silly but for example the books i have mentioned are years old and certainly out of date on more than just one or two occasions
books,not_removed,my son was studying medieval english literature he was required to buy the current edition which was the prior edition used the year before was available for the stories were obviously identical it was the commentary that differed
books,not_removed,i used to have my fathers encyclopedias under l was lead uses of lead included lead foil for wrapping food to keep it safe
books,not_removed,go to any library book sale on the final day and you can buy bags of books for cheap and often free at the end of the day youll find as many outofdate text books as you want
books,not_removed,my partners grandma has encyclopedias from decades ago that are so out of date and full of what would now consider offensive information
books,not_removed,well first of all no sorry and secondly even if i were to send them to you you would have to be able to read german which you might be to but it is very unlikely
books,not_removed,i wholeheartedly disagree also i am not sure why you scale it down to kids in the first place as if adults wouldnt face the same problem if they read an outdated book
books,not_removed,yeah but you never know when microwave cookbooks will come back into vogue
books,not_removed,this is why people shouldnt donate junk books to libraries they dont get sold during their book sales and no one even wants them for free and so the library gets saddled with finding a way to get rid of them which is a real problem if theyve accumulated thousands or tens of thousands of books
books,not_removed,we have finite shelf space and finite staff if you bring us a pickup truck bed full of paperback romance novels that have been rained on we arent going to take them yes this happened once
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,isnt that one of the wealthiest counties in the us couldnt they have donated to other libraries i know that costs money but still
books,not_removed,is harry potter in more demand than supply or are the zillions of current copies enough
books,not_removed,columbia has some pretty huge libraries bogota especially
books,not_removed,i wanted to keep them safe and secret it worked against the other people living in the house not so well against the earwigs outside
books,not_removed,i didnt say repair or of significant value you dont repair oop or paper backs the value isnt there and never will be resell value usually maxes at its more that there are people that will take them in fair condition or less because there are so few better copies an example would be some of my copies of amazing stories theyre rough but these arent super common so i wont be tossing them in the trash
books,not_removed,hah i havent thought of sending steaming romance novels to nursing homes there might be potential there thanks for the idea
books,not_removed,i understand that i saved tubs of childhood books my daughter and i have so much joy reading them at bed time its was a great choice to save them for years just to share my favorites with her and seeing the joy they give her your gonna love craigslist and estate sales
books,not_removed,there are limited avenues for that most places do what they can but you eventually hit a wall and whatevers left heads for recycling
books,not_removed,thats too bad my towns public library is just amazing and has a very good childrens section not only do i check out books from the library i also check out dvds and puzzles for him
books,not_removed,i hate to break it to you but libraries also throw kids out constantly
books,not_removed,jesus dude just live in a bubble the point is that a lot of people are paranoid about germs on old books and shouldnt be since you want to get technical this study something i saw a while ago the first time a customer asked me about this found transfer efficiency for porous materials to be between depending on humidity compared to nonporous transfer efficiency of about six times higher pathogens dont survive well and dont transfer easily on porous materials sorry that you think this knowledge makes me part of the evil of reddit i happen to be a bookseller and ive had people ask me whether a person can get sick from handling a book of unknown provenance unless a sick person is directly handing it to you as they sneeze and wheeze the answer is pretty much no edit autocorrect
books,not_removed,renting out the aint cheap
books,not_removed,oh i very much do theres so much old literature by experts from the era thats been proven to be farce by history i once found a huge box in the basement of a place i was living at in austin that had dozens of old cold war policy and analysis books and some great old school scifi in it it was an absolute treasure trove its interesting to see how people thought in the about the soviet unions internal workings
books,not_removed,i mean like windows for dummies or clariswork for kids type books definitely if it pertains to hardware i wouldnt be so quick to discount something like that
books,not_removed,our cities free bookshelves became dumps for all those windows manuals out there cause its bad to throw a book into the trash you know
books,not_removed,when i was in middle school i had to do a report on the moon i grabbed one of our encyclopedias and somewhere mid paragraph i read someday man may even travel to the moon looked at the date of the encyclopedia and it was
books,not_removed,the commentary is what youre paying for though
books,not_removed,when i was studying literature in college the books we used were by w w norton i remember them being extremely heavy and bulky and expensive the reason why we had to buy the latest editions was because our professors had contracts with the publishers the commentary from what i remember didnt contain any new insights from one edition to the next it was just the price and the names of the editors and the color of the cover
books,not_removed,my brother still has my fathers encylopedia britannica very interesting stuff
books,not_removed,keeps your food safe from xrays
books,not_removed,my library wont accept donations for the book sale of textbooks that are more than years old because no one wants them

books,not_removed,ban the books words are dangerous
books,not_removed,i recently found out that hoard and horde are spelled differently a hoard is a trove and a horde is an army youre right though loktar ogar
books,not_removed,niemals es tut nicht weh zu fragen
books,not_removed,it isnt a huge problem as they can be recycled
books,not_removed,thats why i no longer feel bad thowing away bad books i will share all the good books in my library but the worse the book is the less likely its going to be read until it falls apart
books,not_removed,yes it is after someone discovered the books in the trash and it made the news apparently hundreds of residents offered to help sort the books for donating but the library manager said they couldnt get enough people to do that before it hit the news but there was also a friends of the library group and they said the library had stopped sending them books to go through for like months
books,not_removed,they are basically eagleton
books,not_removed,well my little sister was on a waitlist for almost a year to get the first book and that was just a couple of years ago she lived in a small town and the library had a small budget of course the logistics for getting books from a library with an ample supply to a different library without are pretty overwhelming
books,not_removed,colombia is more than just the capital large libraries are not the same as your neighborhood library which is what people in this thread are talking about
books,not_removed,i read the first comment to quickly and failed to realise you were talking about yourself jajaj i thought you had a
books,not_removed,thanks
books,not_removed,youve quoted the effect but not the cause there the vast majority of donations we received are things we couldnt even give away for free as they were titles nobody wanted we can hire as many people as we want people still wont want to buy a dummys guide to windows the amount of space they took up was ridiculous and has now been replaced with relevant desirable titles from the library archives that we can cycle on the shelves on a monthly basis anyone with any knowledge of the library can see immediately that this is a much more effective use of space
books,not_removed,another library worker here no no we really arent nobody wants your year old college textbooks we can sell one set of dictionaries for a craft project of the twenty old sets we get donated or the ones that smell of smoke or are moldy or piss oh how i hope its cats but in my heart i know it probably isnt always the ones where the dead or live bedbugs come out the spine the seventies cookbooks with recipes for broccoli and spam suspended in gelatin the ancient history books talking about civilizing the savages the twentyeighth nearly pristine copy of a danielle steel that hasnt moved from our book sale shelves in months look we do highgrade save the stuff that has a chance go to your local library book sale near the end and you can buy bags of books for a couple of dollars but there are always more and we need to make room as thousands upon thousands more are made every day including some that people would actually want to read

books,not_removed,if you read further down youll see that they actually cant always the glue and gloss creates issues for recycling so only some recyclers take them
books,not_removed,certain facilities are able recycle books but even if theres one nearby you still have logistical problems getting rid of so many books the recycler doesnt just drive over and toss heavy boxes of books in the back of their truck
books,not_removed,youll have to pay someone to haul and recycle those
books,not_removed,oof seems like something a company like amazon could support for goodwill its a tough problem of the logistics of sorting a ton of objects

books,not_removed,has she read them yet does she need me to send them ohmygod
books,not_removed,youre coming to this from the point of view of a book seller though your job your goal is to make money everyone has bills to pay this is your living theres nothing wrong with that being your livelihood niche collectorscompletionists are a bit different they dont make sense from a money stand point youll get people that have to own several copies of the same book for little things like text edits foreword additionschanges or art changes some copies have literally no monetary value my point was that it would be nice to shuffle some of the old not completely ruined books off to the side offer them for free somehow if theyre too poor to sell since its hard for a person to know what makes a specific edition collectable without a time investment its the same amount of effort as boxing them up and driving them to a landfill i have seen many small independentphysical store book sellers and thrift stores do this with a box out front labeled free and i do have a few with just glue and minor fade issues these came from a dry environment where mold isnt a common problem they cannot however be handled much they have no reprints and alas im a completionist for some authors
books,not_removed,its funny that people who work with books place the lowest value on the book as a physical object look we know what were talking about
books,not_removed,look we do highgrade save the stuff that has a chance go to your local library book sale near the end and you can buy bags of books for a couple of dollars but there are always more and we need to make room as thousands upon thousands more are made every day including some that people would actually want to read someone will give you money for the donations and take them away its not a trick its my entire business model
books,not_removed,look we do highgrade save the stuff that has a chance go to your local library book sale near the end and you can buy bags of books for a couple of dollars but there are always more and we need to make room as thousands upon thousands more are made every day including some that people would actually want to read somebody needs to tell my local library that in downtown nashville they wanted each and some during their last book sale
books,not_removed,some people seem to exist just to make this website less pleasant
books,not_removed,where i live hardcover and paperback books are accepted with cardboard and newspaper recycling
books,not_removed,yes i worked at a place that owns all those donation bins for books basically they scan all the books for value and store the ones they can sell on amazon all the rest are thrown into gaylords and sold to recycling by the ton the charity received a percent per pound
books,not_removed,im surprised and happy they get so many donations that space is a factor
books,not_removed,i never said we did it because we dont think those things have value no one buys these textbooks and it makes additional work for us
books,not_removed,im poking fun at the idea that a book has no value at the very least it gives us insight into what other people thought was important enough information to write down this is useful for divining context and bias in history and its damn interesting someone said that a book was really offensive that probably means those offensive idea were how someone thought other people learned those ideas and were shaped by them thats worth knowimg about why do you think they still print mein kampf
books,not_removed,i bought them for her when i found out she was on an almost equally long wait list for the second book
books,not_removed,niche collectorscompletionists are a bit different they dont make sense from a money stand point youll get people that have to own several copies of the same book for little things like text edits foreword additionschanges or art changes some copies have literally no monetary value niche collectors have ebay for that my point was that it would be nice to shuffle some of the old not completely ruined books off to the side offer them for free somehow if theyre too poor to sell since its hard for a person to know what makes a specific edition collectable without a time investment its the same amount of effort as boxing them up and driving them to a landfill have you ever been to the free book section of most places its all random junk bookslast thing they need is more junk booksthose bins make goodwill look like a treasure hoard
books,not_removed,one issue libraries have to consider is that many people in the community appreciate being able to buy the donated books at the library sale and wouldnt be too happy about a forprofit company taking all of them to split the profits theyre already not happy with the people who come and scan books to sell online also many of the people who donate books would be hesitant if they knew all the books were being outsourced to a company to sell online they want the library to make money but they too like the idea of their books going back into the community
books,not_removed,pretty bad at your business if you havent called the library to make an offer yet when the payment is less than the cost of handling them its not worth it stop offloading your labor costs to libraries
books,not_removed,does your company just take everything without sorting what happens to the books after you take them
books,not_removed,you could just download it
books,not_removed,since ive moved to virginia i certainly see how big of a problem mold can become sigh in drier regions paper can get brittle and the outer edges will break and flake away but you can also find old farm houses half fallen in on themselves or cow sheds with old books magazines and newspapers that are in at least good condition you might see if local thrift stores would take your acceptable cast offs ive spotted at least one seller doing that in my area
books,not_removed,also many of the people who donate books would be hesitant if they knew all the books were being outsourced to a company to sell online due respect ive never seen this be the case not once if anything ive seen donations increase as friends groups explain to patrons that theyve been able to increase library funding because of our relationship this sounds like you personally dont like the idea which is understandable why should i make money from something you gave to a library i understand the sentiment really though is it better for me to net your library for a book or for them to make selling it to another patron edit theyre already not happy with the people who come and scan books to sell online you can solve that by just not allowing it booksales im not sure what it has to do with me
books,not_removed,pretty bad at your business if you havent called the library to make an offer yet what the random anonymous library that could be miles away when the payment is less than the cost of handling them its not worth it stop offloading your labor costs to libraries you quite literally have no idea what you are talking about
books,not_removed,do you service the entire world if there was someone willing to pay these people for shit books that nobody wants this wouldnt be an issue stop projecting sure that makes sense only in the boston area do valuable books exist because of the leprechauns compelling argument i throw gold away someone would buy it how do you know
books,not_removed,it depends on the client we have a client in affluent town of about people who has quarterly public sales at public sale they sell books for each and net around just from the public sale for them we consign books we think we can net them on and store the rest for them on site at the library we will pay them generally between and in a given year we have another client in a similar sized down with less favorable income demographics where they have a section of honor carts in the library where people can buy used books for donations into a box they net a few hundred form the honor carts for them we take any book we think we can sell for any amount of money and they donate the rest to an intown charity i dont know what the charity does with the books we pay them closer to per year we have several other libraries with storage issues where we take all of their donations sell whatever we can recycle whatever we can and pay them based on what we net some of these are in or around boston where real estate is at a premium but still receive high value donations we pay some of them per year some of them are smaller more rural libraries we might end up paying in a year to access to unsorted donation streams has value to me what we dont do and what weve fired some clients over is pick up books that have been searched already thats more of a recyclers business model and not what we do
books,not_removed,you might see if local thrift stores would take your acceptable cast offs paper recycler pays me per pound if i strip covers and stack pallets so i do that we do end up donating books if we can find someone to donate to at our volume of presearched books though thats a harder sell than you might imagine
books,not_removed,im not saying what you do is good or bad as im a book dealer myself just trying to make a more nuanced counterpoint i have been to quite a few friends library meetings however where people bring this exact issue up they think of book resellers in a similar way as scalpers artificially raising the cost of books that they want to give to their community for cheap often times the complainers are cranky people who have nothing better to do than complain but they do have a point about serving people in the community by selling them cheap books really though is it better for me to net your library for a book or for them to make selling it to another patron even though you can sell certain books online for a lot more than a library can there are a lot of books that are worthless online but could easily sell to someone in person at a library book sale fiction and classics come to mind if someone at the library or you could separate those out itd be a lot easier to convince skeptical people but ive never seen it done well before you can solve that by just not allowing it booksales im not sure what it has to do with me my point was simply that some people get really touchy about people making a profit off of books donated to a library
books,not_removed,probably made harder by over saturation book buyerscollectors have many more options for shopping in densely populated boston do try to find someone to off load the weird old books onto though you never know who would want an swahili to english dictionary the most random real life example i could think of
books,not_removed,even though you can sell certain books online for a lot more than a library can there are a lot of books that are worthless online but could easily sell to someone in person at a library book sale they do again i dont see a conflict i only take books i cant sell if the library wants me to
books,not_removed,im not saying what you do is good or bad as im a book dealer myself oh now it makes sense everything you said that was costing libraries money is geared towards you still being able to buy books from for almost nothing to resell
books,not_removed,do try to find someone to off load the weird old books onto though you never know who would want an swahili to english dictionary the most random real life example i could think of id love to but the problem is the same problem as with twilight somewhere theres someone who wants to buy a copy but im going to recycle copies i have contacts with lots of people in the book selling community here people who own shops sell in niches etc if i can make a quarter on a book thats more than the recycling value if i can donate a book and write it off against profits thats more than the recycling value its really hard to find people who will take most books even for free sure you might find someone who will take weird books from the though unless its an author who is still read or a subject that has some lasting niche appeal occult or medical quackery maybe its very very hard to move those books
books,not_removed,we by yevgeny zamyatin written in before orwell wrote and its lessknown in the usa but wow is it similar and good
books,not_removed,my favorite genre as a kid in the late and early ill start with anthem i guess its somewhat popular but unfortunately associated with its author its probably the least preachy thing she wrote and definitely the most enjoyable my favorite is probably more of the postapocalyptic than dystopian alas babylon which is one my favorite stories of my childhood i feel that a lot of the writers for the walking dead could use a good read through it to see a more realistic resolution to a eotwawki scenario
books,not_removed,i love the drowned world from the jg ballard novel of the same name the polar ice caps and permafrost melted decades ago the temperature at the equator is over degrees and all life on the planet seems to be devolving giant cycads and ferns tower over flooded london while the members of a scientific expedition struggle with or embrace their increasing psychic atavism
books,not_removed,hmm i havent read too much dystopia but probably gone by michael grant
books,not_removed,uglies by scott westerfield
books,not_removed,the core of the sun by johanna sinisalo kicked ass awesome writing really unique hilarious story and a fairly quick read isbn eisbn
books,not_removed,the tomorrow file by lawrence sanders seems nobody has heard of it and i loved it
books,not_removed,the death of grass by john christopher is great its not unpopular but if im reading you right you just mean not popular rather than disliked by the majority
books,not_removed,two of my personal favorite dystopian settings are from short stories that are probably read in secondary school but totally forgotten about there will come soft rains ray bradbury harrison bergeron kurt vonnegut
books,not_removed,the maze runner triliology i dont understand how people dislike these books their one of my favourite trilogies
books,not_removed,was gonna say this pretty good book
books,not_removed,alas babylon is great
books,not_removed,one of my absolute favourite novels gorgeous descriptions and intriguing throughout have you read high rise thats good though i dont think its as good and far more of a traditional dystopia than the drowned world
books,not_removed,i really like highrise it was the first ballard novel i read and i still come back to it every few years what i especially like about it is that everything that happens in the tower is entirely voluntary the inhabitants actively choose to be there doing what theyre doing there is no outside agency to shoulder the blame for the mayhem the inhabitants of the highrise have made the world they want to live in and i love that ballard did that
books,not_removed,in the context its set it works really well too as ballard explores how britain basically tried to tear itself apart in the mid to late seventies entirely voluntarily
books,not_removed,cant you just say youre studying a text for a class dont look up from the book or just glance up i find most people realize pretty quickly that im trying to read and dont want to make conversation if i dont bother to make eye contact or keep my replies super short also theres nothing wrong with honesty as long as youre polite about it just say sorry but ive only got a few minutes and im at a really interesting part could we talk later otherwise take a few minutes and be friendly or sit in a library or find a hidden corner or sit in your car
books,not_removed,i consider that kind of thing as part and parcel of working in public honestly im fairly extraverted and i think what i do is fascinating so i talk to randoms about what im reading all the time if theyre not genuinely interested they usually back off after the seventh minute of intro to conceptual editing but thats also how ive made good friends if i have to actually work though big headphones all the way not just the inear ones like really big ones
books,not_removed,i am a kinda rude person i often enjoy discussing books with people so i just ask them if they are in for a interesting conversation that enrich our lives or if they will say something like i watched the movie it wasnt like that to every title i start talking about it usually end up with them going away otherwise just wearing headphones help you dont even have to listen to anything people respect the headphones
books,not_removed,words thats the answer of the time wait wrong sub
books,not_removed,you dont owe them a conversation if youre not comfortable saying a book and then ignoring them which in my opinion is acceptable but apparently makes people shitty then i would repeat the title and author for them and after that just say sorry i am trying to actually read it im sure you can research it online i generally reply to is it goodwhats it like with i dont know people keep interrupting me which also tends to make the point but at some point and probably sooner rather than later i think one just needs to say excuse me i am trying to read
books,not_removed,it can be kind of annoying but i try to just appreciate the fact that someone was interested enough to ask me about it i think interactions with strangers should be more common in our society and i try to make it a positive experience
books,not_removed,they probably see you as an interesting dood and want to take the opportunity to get to know you better and try to develop a connection with you so maybe later youll be friends i say embrace it and talk with them who knows what they might have to say or what you can learn from them you might meet someone that inspires you in some way or another your newest friend lover worst enemy etc you should embrace it if you want to keep the conversation more literature based ask them questions and direct the conversation that way people love talking about themselves and their opinions so ask them about the last book they read and what they thought about it or ask them about their favorite book something along those lines
books,not_removed,not really
books,not_removed,i probably need to be more forward but its baffling to me how someone with eyes down and book open translates into talk to me please
books,not_removed,i kinda share the opinion yes we can tell people to basically fuck off between the lines since we are so busy with our book but usually we talk with people about stuff which is far less interesting than the books we read so no reason to be a jerk about it if i see somebody i know at university who isnt reading anything which looks like a textbook i definitely‚Äãengage them since its a signal for me that the person just has some time to pass by
books,not_removed,my answer is suuuuuper cunty but it works when they start talking hold up a finger like youre telling them to wait then continue reading for seconds just to make a point then close the booklock your phone and very dramatically turn towards them and say what was that then as soon as you can go back to reading and if they start talking again just repeat those steps and theyll get the point i think my goal for should be to be less of a passive aggressive asshole
books,not_removed,you are not alone at the risk of assuming your gender anecdotally it is my experience that it is rarely about the book or even about conversation regardless of gender its certainly not about whether you might want to talk about the book

books,not_removed,the eink screen and battery life are the major differences my kindles eink screen looks like paper without the glare of a phone or tablet screen and the battery lasts for weeks it cant browse the web very well or run apps but thats a feature in my opinion it doesnt let me get distracted from reading books and the screen its so good
books,not_removed,i prefer an actual kindle ereader for reading books its lighter easier to hold and the screen is designed for long sessions of reading so its easy on my eyes reading on a tablet or a phone with its bright screen is far harder on the eyes plus its bigger and heavier if youre like me and read well over books a year youd need a dedicated ereader like a kindle if youre closer to the average reader whatever that exactly is and read a handful of books a year a tablet or phone might be perfectly acceptable i carry my kindle everywhere and im lost without it
books,not_removed,the eink kindle is easier on my eyes but im so used to my phone now that i hardly ever use it i do get more distracted while reading on my phonethe internet is just sooooooo close
books,not_removed,just to confirm you ask the difference between an ereader and a kindle they are one and the same thing both have eink displays which is the closest to reading print as anything else normal tablets have displays that generate light while ereaders use the lack of light to portray text the lack of light is less disturbing to the eye and therefore much easier to read for extended periods of time reading light generated text puts strain on the eye which over time becomes uncomfortable
books,not_removed,tablets have a few things in their favor they can access services like scribd or zinio that ereaders cant because they have color screens tablets are better for magazines and comics they can work with rich content like animations or videos embedded in the book they also allow for a greater degree of touch control so they dont feel locked in to a certain screen size like ereaders sometimes do however for the basic task of reading a book i prefer ereaders probably the biggest difference between the two as others have said is the display im not really qualified to explain how eink works but long story short youre looking at pigment rather than projected light that makes it easier on the eyes and the image doesnt get washed out in direct sunlight like backlit screens do also kindles are specialty devices theyre thinner and lighter than tablets because they dont need as much storage memory or power as a tablet does a full charge from an ac outlet takes about two hours and will keep the device powered for hours of reading or several weeks of standby time the software is likewise specialized to a readers needs there are generally no games or social features so i dont get notifications every few minutes and theres no temptation to pop over to facebook for just a second to see whats happening there
books,not_removed,i too read over books a year and all on either my ipad or android my wife gifted me a kindle last year and though i liked its paper like feel but there were two major issues first it was an additional device to carry and it couldnt fit in my pocket either second i have a habit of researching the events characters references etc given in a book as i love historical fictions technofictions and nonfictions therefore sometimes my research really goes deep and i end up making lots of notes about them with the ipad or phone that are connected to internet i can do the research immmediately by just switching windows and create notes easily with a kindle i have to pull out another device to do that which is a mighty inconvenience of course if you are a person who reads only during flights then ipadphone would be same as kindle but i travel by train mostly so my devices ability to browse net definitely becomes a major advantage apart from that as pointed out above ipadphones are better when reading comic strips cartoons etc i have huge collection of garfield wizard of id beeltle bailey hagar the horrible and phantom all in jpegs on my tablet i dont know if they can be even transferred on kindle
books,not_removed,ereaders generally have better battery life i tend to find plus reading is softer on my eyes than a tablet

books,not_removed,has he considered audiobooks if he has trouble with sitting still for extended periods of time to actually read audiobooks can make typically menial tasks like chores a little better i struggled with reading confidence myself dyslexia and audiobooks saved and rebuilt my childhood passion
books,not_removed,i just want to throw out the possibility of reading together like one of you reading out loud so you experience the book together it might seem childish at first glance but theres nothing wrong with it and he might find it easier to concentrate if hes reading out loud or listening to your sweet voice p
books,not_removed,try short story collections there are a lot of short story collections for pretty famous authors hemingway is always a good place to start
books,not_removed,im more of a nonfiction fan myself so i dont have any specific suggestions but whatever he ends up reading you should read it too you can have conversations on the book and whatnot also and this is simply how i would react the desire to be equal in those conversations would drive me to really get into the material in the end he may end up realizing he can digest everything you can maybe just in his own way
books,not_removed,start him off with ra salvatore drizzt novels homeland exile then sojourn based in the forgotten realms of the dungeons and dragons universe high fantasy and a still running story line he has been writing on drizzt since the late its really good to see how he evolves as a writer and see drizzt grow

books,not_removed,i dont remember the exact phrasing but in the sea wolf there is a passage where the captain talks about a sailor up in the rigging the gist of the exchange is that you cant pay a man enough to die but you can pay someone else enough to kill him you are the only one who values your life above all else never would have thought id be shaped by a seafaring adventure story but that bit still stands out odd years after i read it

books,not_removed,joseph conrad on the fury of the sea and of nature in general there are many shades in the danger of adventures and gales and it is only now and then that there appears on the face of facts a sinister violence of intentionthat indefinable something which forces it upon the mind and the heart of a man that this complication of accidents or these elemental furies are coming at him with a purpose of malice with a strength beyond control with an unbridled cruelty that means to tear out of him his hope and his fear the pain of his fatigue and his longing for rest which means to smash to destroy to annihilate all he has seen known loved enjoyed or hated all that is priceless and necessarythe sunshine the memories the future which means to sweep the whole precious world utterly away from his sight by the simple and appalling act of taking his life

books,not_removed,from the mysterious benedict society one of my favourite series from when i was about ears old i was having a philosophical phase and thinking about people and good and evil and all and there was a quote along the lines of for someone as observant as you reynie snakes are easy to spot but if snakes are all you see then maybe youre not looking hard enough that one line had a massive impact on my perception of other people and i still remember how mindblown i felt reading it

books,not_removed,this passage from foxlowe by eleanor wasserberg is one of the most hauntingly beautiful things to me both just as reading but also personally as someone with a somewhat verbally abusive mother i understood he meant for me to let freyas words drop off me like the trees shaking off their names so that when she told me about the crisis reminded me how i had the bad threaded through me like stitiching in a dress i could imagine her words floating above how things were just sounds kai couldnt know how freyas words were written on the inside of my skin how they werent like other words how they could never be only sounds with a different truth but i loved kai for his trying to rip freyas words from me even as i held on to them ever tighter

books,not_removed,i finished the book minutes ago and came here to talk about how that passage probably will stick with me as well
books,not_removed,i love big brother has stuck with me in a chilling way
books,not_removed,there is a chapter in mobydick that has stuck with me where ishmael narrates a warning to captains on hiring dreamers like himself it makes those kinds of people terrible at standing watch for whale sightings i fancy myself a pretty good deckhand there isnt much to it if youre just starting out im terrible at security watches and piloting though any task that involves me having to do a lot of monotonous looking or watching is an invitation to daydream how can someone look out on to the ocean and not be inspired i think washington irving called it the blank page of existence something like that add that as a passage that has stuck with me over the years your second passage from is powerful i sort of imagine it out the context of the book and apply it to our world
books,not_removed,not a fan of this long winded description honestly there needs to be just enough to paint a picture in my mind for my personal taste
books,not_removed,so ursula is pretty good then i was introduced to her in a recent article from the new yorker as ive been getting into science fiction more than ever lately maybe ill give her a shot any suggestions

books,not_removed,the passage from to kill a mockingbird where scout walks boo radley home and then turns around to look at the view from his window i love that passage
books,not_removed,pretty amazingcraziest thing is it was written before wwii which really makes it hit home for me to think just years later history would repeat itself in a way
books,not_removed,very good she was a pioneer in using sci fi writing to challenge race and gender norms all while being a rare female author in the genre in the starting out shes won about a bajillion hugos i think pretty much all of her work is absolutely worth picking up personally left hand of darkness is my absolute favorite of her work and played a big part in shaping how i think about the world but many people do find it a bit heavy a huge portion of it takes place in bleak snowy isolation the hainish cycle the telling or the lathe of heaven is probably a better first lead in to her work in sci fi or the earthsea series is an above average ya traditional fantasy series there is also a short story of hers the ones who walk away from omelas which if you enjoy and arent entirely mindcrushed by it you definitely will love her work
books,not_removed,i read earthsea when i was kid and it blew my mind the left hand of darkness is probably the most renowned but the dispossessed is my favorite novel shes written both are lauded and prizewinning and set in the same universe
books,not_removed,the quote is from good omens which is all about the end of the world antichrist four horsemen and all that so i dont think the comment has anything to do with being literally that just a statement of the hypothetical tone of gods doings in that ultimately he always has the upper hand by a longshot and finds it amusing the whole time maybe thats why i like pratchett so well actually there wasis a webcomic called sinfest i was reading on an ongoing basis probably years ago that portrays god as terribly sarcastic and he communicates only via hand puppets sticking out of a cloud i always thought that seemed more potentially accurate than any actual religious portrayal of god there is
books,not_removed,totally i was inspired to read aqotwf because im listening to dan carlins series on wwi and the two together really hit me this totally human story complemented with dans unimaginably detailed and horrific accounts make for quite the pair just picked up bill brysons a walk in the woods to calm my mind

books,not_removed,i never throw out a book ever sometimes i might give them away or sell them to used book stores but even then i hate it i love all my books
books,not_removed,when i moved the other year i had half a dozen seven foot bookcases stuffed with books in every nook and cranny a lot of them were books i inherited from love ones who had passed and it was hard to give them up even if i had no interest in reading them but i just didnt have the option to keep them and i could at least donate them rather than throw them away
books,not_removed,aw i hope you keep them all or at least the ones that meant the most to you i usually donate to my local library or stick them in a coffeeshop bookshelf when my family moved when i was little i got to keep a box of bookstoys one book about dragons i absolutely loved to bits and its taped up and stored in a baggie now but i do remember it was the first time i really got excited about reading

books,not_removed,tuck those ads in for a good nights sleep
books,not_removed,a deep sleep
books,not_removed,one of my favorite books and ive read it about times two of those times for school the ambiguous ending reads so strong to me it lets the reader fill in the blanks for me its hopeful jonas created the change he wanted and gabe was loved every moment whether they made it through the drift or not if you liked the book enjoy it on its own its stronger that way if you didnt and you need more then read the rest of the series the other books may feel a bit disjointed but they fill out the world and you get a bow on the jonas and gabe stories
books,not_removed,i never thought of it as he and gabriel finding refuge its been a while since i read it but i distinctly remember him identifying the noise as music in the end the old man never shared music with him which suggests the old man was killed releasing the memories to the world the image we see at the end is only in his head the ambiguity of it all is almost certainly meant so that we can choose which way it goes thats just the way i saw it
books,not_removed,i actually liked the ending its been some time since i read that book i considered that jonas and gabriel may have died in the end than going to the elsewhere so i guess considering how vague it was in the end i felt that it was a good way to finish the story
books,not_removed,that book is the reason i stopped reading for a long time i loved the book and hated the ending
books,not_removed,i loved the series i thought it tied up everything together nicely with that being said i will agree that the other three are no where near as memorable as the giver on the topic of the ending there was an interview of lowrey where she said that she didnt want there to be an official ending and only wrote son to please the fans
books,not_removed,i always figured that since he had described something like music then the old guy had to have died because thats how the memories would be released for jonas and gabe i just thought that maybe he and gabe kept going but gabe probably died being a baby and my theory was that jonas would eventually find something like another test settlement or hopefully though unlikely some sort of normal settlement
books,not_removed,as a kid i always interpreted the ending as a very happy one jonas makes it to a part of the world that isnt so regimented and all is well it was one of my favorite books as a kid then i reread it as an adult and realized how the ending could have a very dark interpretation and i really liked that the book can mean so much in so many different ways
books,not_removed,he and the baby froze to death going to the afterlife but the movie makes me question that then i remember movies suck
books,not_removed,i was pretty sure he died didnt even consider that you could interpret it the other way i figured esewhere was an apocalyptic wasteland and theres no way that there are some people enjoying christmas dinner a few miles away and that it matched one of the archetypal memories he had been given come on
books,not_removed,i actually loved the ending a friend actually wrote out the last sentence in calligraphy on a small poster board for me and it stayed on my wall all throughout high school
books,not_removed,i dont think i liked the ending but bc i read it a long long time ago as a child i remembered it bc it was the first ambiguous ending ive ever read on my own and i felt uncomfortable w that im still not sure how i feel uncertain endings but i think a small degree of uncertainty is ok like eragon or the gemma doyle trilogy where not everyones story is resolved i still dont really like completely ambiguous endings where youre not sure if the main character will physically survive or not
books,not_removed,i enjoyed the entire series gathering blue book is odd to say the least and messenger isnt terrible the final book son in my option is the second best book of the series and does a wonderful job of tying everything together at the end the giver is by far the best out of all of them but id give the others a chance especially if you want more if that universe
books,not_removed,the book has an interesting concept but it was executed poorly and the ending left much to be desired
books,not_removed,i did not realize this was a series i might look into the rest of it maybe simply for curiosity sake
books,not_removed,i agree i enjoyed the book on its own and it left a stronger impression on me
books,not_removed,yeah for class in high school we had to write what we thought about the ending and i wrote about how they were freezing and were going into the next life peacefully it seemed apparently i was the only person in the class who thought they might not have survived and was asked to come up with another answer
books,not_removed,dont
books,not_removed,i love the giver i reread it countless times growing up but reading the rest of the books as an adult really ruined the way i thought of the book i feel like the giver is strongest on its own
books,not_removed,i dont recommend it
books,not_removed,i also always thought he was hallucinating while dying from the cold at the end i might have been influenced by living in iowa where that form of death isnt too uncommon
books,not_removed,thats kind of weird that you were asked to think of something else just because your answer happen to differ from most students i never had to write a report on it i do remember when i had to read it in middle school the teacher said the ending was meant to be ambiguous
books,not_removed,seconding this the following books especially son are pretty awful
books,not_removed,what exactly is it about the rest of the series did you guys hate i know sequels arent always good but with an ending that ambiguous i cant help hit wonder how they really continued it
books,not_removed,yeah the fact that the story continues really ruins it for me too i read it for school in grade i thought the ending was great because i thought he died it seemed poetic that he died for what was right and what are the odds of him actually finding this place in the middle of nowhere with a goddamned sled no less the whole class had a debate about it and it turned out i was wrong i still prefer my ending
books,not_removed,you didnt even like gathering blue
books,not_removed,the ambiguous ending is what makes the book so great the rest of the series feels like a cash grab by lowry
books,not_removed,iirc the series wasnt planned the first book was supposed to be the end writing more came as an idea years later and it just feels off feels like a money grab
books,not_removed,for me i just read the synopsis on wikipedia after finding out the next books didnt fit into what i had envisioned i felt like the following books would of ruined the greatness of the first book its a big jump in the future and you dont learn much about what happens right after the first book ended it was just a let down for me i loved the first book incredibly much such a good story the ending was abrupt and definitely left me wanting to know more have you seen the movie
books,not_removed,you werent wrong the whole ending is up to personal interpretation i completely agree with you i thought is was a beautiful and poetic way to die
books,not_removed,thats exactly how i read it in the grade and im sticking to it hmph
books,not_removed,i think it was the better of the rest of the quartet but still not good the gifts actually seemed really out of place and a lot seemed shoehorned in
books,not_removed,that makes a lot of sense i cant see the way it ended being meant to be continued into a series after hearing a lot of the responses here it doesnt seem like the rest of the series is what id be looking for
books,not_removed,i have not i remember it coming out but since i hadnt read the book didnt pose much interest in it at the time
books,not_removed,thats a shame i really enjoyed them all i do happen to be really good at isolating things so im not constantly comparing them to something better plus i already knew they werent going to have the same feel
books,not_removed,its not really a series like everyone is making it out to be gathering blue had at most the vaguest of references to a place that might be the place at the end of the giver theyre not really related i think it was more referred to as a spiritual successor at the time it was released messenger has more direct references to the giver but its more of a follow up to gathering blue than the giver you dont have to have read the giver too read gathering blue or messenger son is the only book that is dependent on having read the giver it really ties all of this books together this is the only book that is in my opinion overrated i would recommend gathering blue if youre interested in a book similar to the giver without really being a sequel if you like that i would then recommend messenger id only really recommend son if you really enjoyed messenger and want further connections to the giver
books,not_removed,i do the same thing when i learned of the movie that was when i read the book i never watch the movie first it is a really good movie though
books,not_removed,it wasnt even that i needed to read the book first at that point it just really didnt interest me to see or read i waited till i was more intrigued to actually sit and read it i appreciate what the ending did after more thought and i dont know if the movie would really keep that for me

books,not_removed,anything that is a series should work it should keep you busy entertained and you really have one story that just continues from book to book
books,not_removed,ideally id stop in a city along the way and buy some regional books if feasible mail order care packages visits to town id try to find something that i could share with the locals maybe there are a few readers there and we can pool our resources other than that probably the classics tolstoy dickens austen and so forth id probably also bring or read ahead of time a history of the region i dont know where youre going but for a general history of subsaharan africa john readers africa biography of a continent is pretty solid
books,not_removed,id want something deep and challenging with multiple layers of meaning to discover and analyze so i could reread it again and again i might actually bring a bible ive never read it covertocover and im not religious but what little ive read has explained a lot about western culture maybe shakespeare too
books,not_removed,ha i had this happen to me ok so there was electricity but i didnt have a kindle at the time in rural thailand id second lord of the rings its super rereadable and there are very compact copies out there the count of monte christo was a great read and took up a fair bit of my time take something meatier that youve wanted to read but never gotten around to the bible infinite jest ulysses you will definitely have the time finally take a book on some sort of hobby along with the stuff to do it i had a book on how to play harmonica
books,not_removed,i would say salmarillion to get invested into some world building into the wild when youre feeling lonely thats always been a very contemplative read for me and i can get really into in when i feel im in solitude at least one book that you can trust to have a fair bit of rereadability
books,not_removed,i would bring some thick novels to bring along maybe a fantasy series that spans several books and probably some sort of textbook to learn some thingsbecause im a nerd
books,not_removed,i would take the only books that i have ever reread harry potter series i always discover something new on the next read through
books,not_removed,the hobbit by jrr tolkien lord of the rings by jrr tolkien war and peace by leo tolstoy by joseph heller one flew over the cuckoos nest by ken kesey these are basically my favorite books and i think they are all very rereadable in comparison to some others i considered choosing these are what i would bring in addition to this i recommend bringing several nonfiction books you find interesting these are the books i would bring but you should obviously pick what is best for you white over black american attitudes toward the negro by winthrop d jordan black majority negroes in colonial south carolina from through the stobo rebellion by peter h wood many thousands gone the first two centuries of slavery in north america by ira berlin do or die men the marine raider battalion at guadalcanal by george w smith band of brothers e company regiment airborne from normany to hitlers eagles nest by stephen e ambrose and a bible my preference is esv but nrsv and nasb are good too edit added the bible if i had to cut this list down for weight i would eliminate white over black its the only heavy book and one of the largest too edit my absolute minimum list would consist of the hobbit lord of the rings and war and peace that could get me through a year in a pinch
books,not_removed,drizzt dourden book series i reread them and i catch something i missed each time
books,not_removed,when i camped at the summit of lomonosovfonna in svalbard i took the forty one i have read it infinite times so yes it is perfect reading for year in a remote place

books,not_removed,same even in remote villages in impoverished countries most people will have cell phones there second bringing an ereader even an old kindle where the battery lasts long for when electricity is randomly cut for a week or something
books,not_removed,while its true the electricity issue can be remedied im leaning away from investing in an ereader since the chances its stolen or broken are very high im completely okay with just bringing a handful of books with me for the year i am simply curious as to what people would bring for themselves in a similar situation
books,not_removed,yes to this solar powered chargers do exist i picked on who a few years ago some go for pretty cheap so i would highly suggest looking into one
books,not_removed,already packed in my carry on
books,not_removed,wow some of those are expensive op should just google one because there are much cheaper ones unless op has the money to spend on something like that
books,not_removed,i dont know man i got through fellowship and then about half way through two towers and just had to stop i couldnt stand the descriptions in the book and for being a guy thats a big hugo fan who has a hard on for descriptions in his books i just hated tolkiens descriptions they felt a little empty to me
books,not_removed,if hes worried about space or weight would be a great option theyre only and lbs compared to my perfectly normal set which is and pounds
books,not_removed,while i would love to invest in both of these the likelihood of one or both being stolen is high im leaning towards bringing a handful of books since i can bring a book anywhere and not worry about it me being a target
books,not_removed,theyre bucks on amazon automod wont let me link but the best selling one is by by inches and weighs ounces maybe buy a couple and get a bunch of locks theres just no way you can carry enough physical books for a year long stay in africa a single kindle can carry ebooks if youre worried about people stealing your kindle theyre also going to steal your books collection then you need to talk to people whove been to wherever youre going find out how they prevent getting robbed blind
books,not_removed,i probably shouldve just stuck with the series to say i finished it ill try again someday
books,not_removed,if you can carry enough books to last you a year then chances of those getting stolen are pretty high too the kindle would be much more compact and manageable on your person if only paperbooks though id probably bring something instructive rereading will help you learn the material and with a year youll be rereading it for sure
books,not_removed,the good thing with classes similar to the one you are taking there is a sense of subjectivity with anything you need to understand what dualism is and apply that to the characters this really shouldnt be that difficult and this sounds like you have a hw assignment that you dont want to apply yourself to

books,not_removed,i didnt care for a film adaptation but i absolutely loved this comic interpretation
books,not_removed,i enjoyed this thank you that said for me at least the embedded video was a bit irritatingi couldnt fullscreen nor go back i was also a bit disappointed that the very last verse was cut out as well as a few of my favourite lines but taken by itself it was a really good reading pretty well directed and performed look forwards to seeing more of this series
books,not_removed,on topic that is a lovely reading in the movie it reminds me of latenight conversations not the intense declamation that you get in some readings and in daytime conversations but a sleepy flow of thoughts with long pauses that are half woolgathering half dropping off

books,not_removed,another one thats kind of related is wit starring emma thompson technically its based on a play but john donnes holy sonnets play a big part in it iirc
books,not_removed,as has been mentioned many times before read it out loud joyce specifically designed the book as an aural experience as well as visual he called it pure music the amount of poesy alliteration lyricism and rhythm is truly extraordinary which is why its confounding to me when people call it unreadable hard to understand absolutely but unreadable i dont think so not if you love words or just language in general theres also large use of phonetics which is why it helps to say the words out loud the first time i read it i didnt bother trying to make sense of every detail i knew that would just give me a headache even if i read the thing for months with an encyclopedia i just sort of felt my way through it and i ended up reading the whole thing out loud my second and third time reading it i found literally hundreds of things i missed the first go round a lot of readers find it egregious but the style gives the book insane reread value you will find something new every time above all else i would say dont take it too seriously enjoy the ride and remember the words are as much the story as the story itself which is about finn lying dead beside the river liffey dreaming about the whole history of the world the main pillar of the book is based off of giambattista vicos work scienza nuova the new science which posits that history is not a straight line but a circle starting from chaos passing through theocratic aristocratic and democratic phases and then back into chaos finnegans wake is cyclical hence the significance of the last line of the book being cut off mid sentence and the continuation of that sentence on the first page closing the loop even the title itself is a pun on the cycle of rebirth which is emphasized early on page hohohoho mister finn youre going to be mister finnagain and many references to vicos cycle of life most notably on page the vico road goes round and round to meet where terms begin any accusation of gibberish falls apart on closer examination this being probably the best evidence for any person who thinks that joyce was just a mad man whod lost his way turns out he knew exactly what he was doing httpwwwricorsonetrxazdataauthorsjjoycejaapxsundrycolloquyhtm the draft of this section is written in plain english and is deliberately tweaked and modified into the mind boggling pidginesque final draft of joyce wrote fw this way because its a book of dreams it takes place during the night and so is specifically written to be bizarre and disorienting as our unconscious always is the style is the entire point just have fun with it
books,not_removed,all good comments so far but i have one more to add besides the reading out loud and reading multiple times i allow myself to admit that joyce was infinitely more intelligent than i and that i therefore could use some help i loved reading the explications from stuart gilbert along with the text of ulysses and of joseph campbell for the wake during my first reading their respective erudition esp gilbert is incredible gilbert knew joyce and had the opportunity to ask him questions to debate topics and to get his insight into the references to other texts to the languages and the multilingual puns and jokes all of it on my second reading of ulysses for example after i had read it through once and realized i didnt catch much of what was happening especially in the sequences after dark i would keep gilberts book handy and just read his corresponding chapter simultaneously with joyce that way i gained more depth of understanding and i learned something to boot campbells skeletons key to finnegans wake is similarly helpful joyce spoke something like fourteen languages maybe more cbb to look up and was capable of making jokes and references in all of them remember these books are funny if you read out loud with his voice and get some insight into the genius bits that are above your head no offense then you can ride along and really gain something from these truly great works of art please dont let others convince you that joyces works are gibberish that is lazy thinking and is inevitably only spoken by those who have either not read or not understood them great art exceeds current capacities for thought and pushes culture forward cf clement greenberg it is a claiming of untamed land in the intellectual wilderness a cultural raumplan and hell theyre super fun to read i like fun
books,not_removed,its my bedtime book i use it like a sedative reading with the lowest setting backlight on my kobo ereader pages and im good zzzz with that said i do enjoy it a lot of it is to be perfectly honest falling down into a forgotten memory hole a split second after i read it like that pit in inside out but a lot of it is connecting too i think my subconscious is doing most of the heavy lifting the fog is clearing a little bit with each page i read
books,not_removed,i felt the same way and after about a pages i put it aside life is too short to read something you dont enjoy
books,not_removed,im listening to httpsthemostevercompanybandcampcomalbumfinneganswakeaudiobookworkinprogress fantastic audiobook while i read along its amazing hearing the runon sentences and onomatopoeia out loud whilst being able to read really carefully instead of having to focus on pronouncing it myself the pacing of the audiobook is awesome im around page after a couple hours reading which is reasonable for such a dense text edit to answer your question im laughing nearly every page at the puns dialogue and weird events i particularly liked the museyroom section which i feel was a hilarious parody of tour guides its honestly just a lot of fun
books,not_removed,above all else i would say dont take it too seriously enjoy the ride and remember the words are as much the story as the story itself which is about finn lying dead beside the river liffey dreaming about the whole history of the world fascinating ive yet to read the wake apart from the first six or so pages but what ive read of it has said that its about the dreams of a woman sleeping in bed with her husband i love how the book allows for such a variation in interpretation
books,not_removed,i had actually never heard of reading the book out loud im returning to reading after rehabilitating a neurological impairment that inhibited reading ive always considered myself an intellectual so once i was able to read again i had to try and pick up the wake thank you for the encouragement ill start reading it out loud and keep on moving through it
books,not_removed,very very well said i couldnt hope for a better explanation i find reading out loud to be the most enjoyable too i have even listened to the recordings of joyce himself to try to get just the right voice just the right tone and tempo and reading through multiple times is far and away the best thing one can do in life the text once it has become a familiar friend can color your thoughts in ways unexpected little phrases little moments can get repeated in your memory and give to me anyway a little personal chuckle at the most mundane of lifes moments
books,not_removed,i would try reading the ending the ending is the only part that makes sense to me as a guy on his deathbed saying goodbye to eternity and its pretty moving
books,not_removed,youre actually thinking of the final chapter of ulysses mate similar in that it was a likely precursor to the dream of the wake in style and experimentation but different
books,not_removed,im absolutely not believe me true that theyre similar but the article or possibly reddit post now i think of it i read was definitely about finnegans wake i may have to try and dig it up
books,not_removed,fair enough but the book is definitively about the dream is he dreaming or dying of a man the last chapter of ulysses is the semisleeping state of consciousness of mrs marion bloom in bed with her husband leopold the wake is from the mind of hce cf truly not trying to argue with you just thought it might be an interesting conversation to engage you in ive read both works and know from experience that my above statement is true as far as i know i would however be delighted to read the post or article you mentioned ill read anything
books,not_removed,i think whats probably happened is a failure of memory whatever it was i read for which i have searched and failed to find certainly mentioned the main character being asleep in bed and certainly mentioned a woman and mentioned the main character sleeping beside and at one point having sex with his or her spouse in my memory i have probably conflated the sleeping main character with the wife sleeping beside him forgive me
books,not_removed,you are forgiven
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or
books,not_removed,finding a good philosophy of law textbook will no doubt give you pointcounterpoint on originalism vs a living constitution interpretation i cant remember the textbook i used back in the day though we also read articlestranscripts from both scalia and ruth bader ginsburg who both have opposing viewpoints on the matter they were probably commencement speeches or something i recommend however that you read both sides of the issue before taking a side
books,not_removed,the approach i have taken to understanding this series of arguments is to first understand the foundational philosophical principles behind the constitution in the first place in this regard i personally think the best place for you to start would be with john lockes because it is one of the principle wells from which the founders drew of their idea of natural rights you cannot understand the constitution without understanding the idea of natural rights and natural law to see an alternative take that largely seems to have spurned lockes position refer to thomas hobbs leviathan in which he argues for the divine right of power of kings another facet of the constitution was the principle of checks and balances mostly derived as far as i can tell from montesquieus httpselfgutenbergorgarticlesengthespiritofthelaws finally the principle that ties these subjects together is the idea of from jeanjacques rousseau this is where the princple that the government is only legitimate with consent from the governed is from we the people for the general subject of freedom i think is the best start further relevant reading would be the magna carta the english bill of rights the connecticut fundamental orders and the federalist papers once you have read these things you will have the foundation you need to argue the points you seek beware though i have sent friends and family who thought similar to you down this path and many came back with a new understanding of why the founders wrote what they wrote into the constitution and how so many of its principles are timeless and do not fall to the evolving interprative modernist understanding you seem to seek points for honestly the best arguments i have heard about this are the ones from lawyers about the differences between methods of law such as textualism and legal formalism so something along those lines would probably be more of what you are looking for in a quick pickup and have argument points kind of way
books,not_removed,no i definitely want to understand their view as well but i feel like the problem i have with their understanding is the literal words are all that matter no reading anything into it an argument i got into with three of them over the first amendment went something like congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion means they can build an establishment that is religious therefore no churches we can still put christianity in the schools because it doesnt expressly forbid it the idea that the public school system didnt exist back then doesnt matter because the public school system isnt mentioned in the constitution therefore they as christians can do whatever they want with it they being my family im looking to argue that kind of stuff not so much the rights of humans and such
books,not_removed,if chuck tingle ended up being a puppeteer for lazytown it would be amazing
books,not_removed,as weve seen there are parallel theories and layers within layers its probably time now to note that like sylvester stallone his colleague in the classic action film hall of fame chuck norris was reduced to low budget softcore to make the bills during the lean years of the early to midseventies norris was credited in those rather sexually progressive features as chuck tingle
books,not_removed,and his name is john cena
books,not_removed,there is no valid argument against somone who changes logic between you stating your point and them answering it
books,not_removed,i did this in higher english class at high school for an essay i think the point of the novel is with power the absolute scientific truth becomes meaningless so is the sky blue or green if you are terrified of me and i tell you it is green you will agree if everyone is terrified of me absolutely the truth doesnt really mean anything people are just speaking to appease me
books,not_removed,orwell in part demonstrates the usage of truth and reality to demonstrate the danger and difficulty of a totalitarian government the partys rule can only succeed indefinitly with the twin sets of logic o brien describes double think allows the inner party to thoroughly understand every aspect of their rule while also ignoring the horror immorality and opportunities for rebellion inherent in dictorial institutions although most people understand that there are absolutes true regardless of our acceptance or denial orwell touches on a fascinating aspect of human behavior often our actions contradict what we know and the logic preceding from that knowledge we think one way but act and therefore think in another way without the former thought or belief being discarded even if both beliefs are contradictory double think and the examples used are so obtuse they are dismissed as simply a tool for control but for the partys ultimate domination over the country its quite necessary to avoid a coup inflitration or internal conflicts between members in answer to your question id demonstrate the motivation behind his way of thinking and therefore its flaws although it seems absolute its intended to be soul crushing and force obedience and confusion the fact that inner party members both understand how double think works and require double think to understand it and continue serving the party demonstrates its just a manifestation of their goals and has no credence in truth or reality although im sure obrien would describe that reply as inconsequential due to the partys control
books,not_removed,for an argument against someone who constantly amends their logic to suit a presupposed knowledge that if something occurs and it is believed to be true by all witnesses if a tree falls with no observers does it make a sound it is true you cannot presume that a logical argument would have any effect in addition they stick to this logic as if machines and the only prime emotions they deem worthy of existence are anger hatred and fear you cannot appeal to their sympathy as they only sympathize with themselves i cannot fathom an argument that would work or change their opinion as they do not function on either emotion or logic but a sense of duty to an illogical construct which i could not even begin to empathize with i believe that in the passage you are referencing by posing this question where winston cannot come up with an argument against obrien that winstons reaction is the only logical one up until the point he sees himself in the mirror and his ideology is stifled winston realizes that nothing he could do or say could disprove the egocentric logic of the party he only says that they will some day fall he cannot express his reasoning to the party as they would discredit it with their faulty logic and reasoning so to match the sentiment of winston to not provide proof but state a feeling obrien resorts to attacking his mind in an act of cruelty by showing him what he has become where his thought processes have got him thus reducing any feelings of pride or hope in his own logic to cinders

books,not_removed,the way of kings it was my first sanderson and i just wasnt feeling it a friend suggested it to me and i felt like i owed it to him to finish since hes usually pretty good with recommendations but god it was a slog but then about a third of the way through it started picking up and then just exploded im so glad i stuck with it and now ive read everything of sandersons and hes probably my favorite author
books,not_removed,cadillac desert its nonfiction but extremely fascinating totally exposes californias apocalyptic water mess and the entire western uss hilarious water laws but there is a part in the middle that could really use some lube
books,not_removed,the teacher by katerina diamond i read the prologue and thought it sounded predictable and clich√© i came back to it out of boredom a few weeks later and within a few chapters i was hooked its now one of my favourite books
books,not_removed,i honestly cant think of any offhand i can however think of several i wish i hadnt bothered to complete but im in the couldnt make it through dracula category that book was so damn boring it took me a month to get halfway through it and it felt like even longer i abandoned it at the fiftysix percent mark on my kindle version van helsing had already been introduced at that point and that didnt make things any more interesting for me so i doubt ill ever return to it its one of my biggest bookrelated disappointments actually i expected so much more from the grandfather of the vampire mythos but frankly i walked away with the conclusion that anne rice does it better than bram stoker anne rice
books,not_removed,years of solitude started great got way way too repetitive in the middle got great again
books,not_removed,the satanic verses by rushdie it was on my toread for awhile and i finally got this massive hardcover tome for when i worked for half price books beautiful slip cover art too ate it up for the first pages or so but like any long ambitious epic it lagged around the middle and i wasnt seeing how all the timelines were tying in but i kept at it and i thought the ending was quite satisfying and having read through the whole book has opened me up to a lot more to understanding references criticisms controversies and homages to this book and his other work now i cant get enough of rushdie and am slowly digesting the ground beneath her feet
books,not_removed,pride and prejudice i loved the ending the first half of the book was a chore to me the first time around but i think the ending made up for it i havent reread it in some years so maybe ill pick it up again and see how i feel now

books,not_removed,our mutual friend great expectations hard times and a tale of two cities when i was at high school and even later at university i keep trying and trying to get into dickens but i just could not get over the general verbosity and fussiness then when i was about i bought a copy of our mutual friend and loved it followed by the other three in quick succession i have no idea what changed but somehow i could just read him without getting distracted or put off anymore
books,not_removed,sometimes a great notion by ken kesey picked it up and put it down once then forced myself to read it later on and wound up loving it
books,not_removed,moby dick the first few chapters where we meet ishmael and queequeg and join them as they look for a ship really grabbed me i loved the way melville wrote and ishmaels readyness to befriend someone so alien to him then i hit a wall of text on the minutia of whaling i felt obligated to read it but there was so so much and it written in such close and clunky technical language that i almost walked away eventually i broke down and skipped those chapters and im really glad i did its such a magnificent heartbreaking story i really felt for ahab by the end gripped by mania recognizing his compulsion and completely unable to break free
books,not_removed,children of dune it drags in a number of points but holy shit the ending is mindblowing one of those things you cant possibly see coming and yet in the universe thats been established it fits perfectly its a sudden radical expansion of context in a direction you didnt even know was there and allows you to see the entire dune series up to that point in a much deeper light
books,not_removed,im currently reading the mandibles by lionel shriver and at first it was a bit of a hard slog and i was struggling a bit mentally and really thought about stopping i kept going and now im over half way through after two weeks im not a fast reader anyway and im really enjoying it it still feels like a dense book but i like the story line and the characters
books,not_removed,i havent read dracula yet i have a lovely vintage paperback copy on my bookshelf waiting for me but the heart of darkness by joseph conrad is definitely a book i nearly abandoned but am delighted i didnt it too is very description heavy but all that description is what makes the book it has an incredible sense of place it was of course the inspiration for the film apocalypse now it also inspired one of my own published short stories
books,not_removed,every malazan book that introduces a new plot or setting gardens of the moon deadhouse gates midnight tides always has me almost leaving it halfway through or at least takes twice as long to finish as the other books in the series that being said the payoff is always immense the way midnight tides depicts a clash of empires capitalistic imperial state vs traditional authoritarian tribe is beautiful alone not even factoring in the characters you grow to love midnight tides is definitely in contention as one of my favorite books of all time and im not the biggest fantasy reader around
books,not_removed,the night circus is a fantasy novel by erin morgenstern i started reading it and and at i thought this book is not for me but thankfully i kept reading and soon found myself hooked when i finish the book i was actually sad that it was over its not by any means the next great american novel but it is a really fun read
books,not_removed,actually i have a book now that i cant get into and i feel like i should is a soldiers pay worth reading

books,not_removed,i read that stephen king basically made up the story of the dark tower as he went along and ive just finished book the waste lands and found it a little unsatisfying knowing that king himself didnt know where the story was going makes me feel the plot with little thought to its direction is just rambling from one crazy idea to the next and it has put me off the series a little im thinking about not continuing the series anyone else feel like this
books,not_removed,sylo book
books,not_removed,wheel of time i thought it was pretty good at first with an interesting world and a decent cast of characters but once i reached the middle books it just became an absolute slog i felt like nothing really happened for hundreds of pages but i was already so invested in it i felt i had to continue to the end it definitely picked up near the end though and it was pretty satisfying to finally finish that whole series
books,not_removed,you see the cover for oathbringer yet
books,not_removed,i have this on my shelf fantastic book d
books,not_removed,credit given ive tried so hard but i always get like pages and give up i dont think the length helps
books,not_removed,just started my first dickens book a tale of two cities so this is great to hear as a dickens beginner any particular order of books you would recommend
books,not_removed,yeah i feel like every dune ending especially messiah for me is a masterpiece
books,not_removed,ive met a lot of people who complain about the dune books after the first one but seriously every one that frank herbert wrote is great even if they do get weird as shit
books,not_removed,ive only read the first three malazan books but i absolutely agree i remember thinking over and over again during deadhouse gates what the hell is the point of all this walking around but then the last fifty pages or so of the chain of dogs storyline were some of the most emotionally devastating and harrowing pages ive ever read in a book
books,not_removed,the next book is flashback so you get some back story on roland its many peoples favorite and i enjoyed it quite a bit you meet a lot of characters from rolands past and get a good idea of what the gunslingers were
books,not_removed,infinite jest is not about finishing it if you read it like that youll be disappointed with the ending it really picks up around page although if you didt get anything from the prose it might not be worth it for you still most people whove read it will agree the general understanding of the world the politics and the character relationships start to come together in the second half of the book there are a lot of references to events that you could not possibly know about in the first pages that can be frustrating to many
books,not_removed,david copperfield is often recommended as the dickens book to start with i think i havent read a tale of two cities yet but have read dc and can confirm its a very easy read ive read bleak house which personally i prefer but its very long indeed so i admit i skipped through some of it
books,not_removed,completely unrelated but i visited dickenss birthplace yesterday its a house in portsmouth in the uk this might sound a bit mad but i think the best way into dickens in retrospect would be to dig into or before the novels its well worth it imo but other than that id recommend hard times or great expectations before the others hope you enjoy
books,not_removed,messiah is one of the best tragedies of all time like shakespeare extended into whole other dimensions of thought perfect counterpoint to the triumphalism of the original dune children struggles quite a bit to find its stride before unleashing that explosive conclusion we can rationalize that herbert was expressing the confusion of the characters but he probably was just straining to find the right way to show what he wanted to show and only finally got there near the end of it god emperor is the dizzying pinnacle of the whole thing herbert basically wrote a mountain of a series where a middle book is the most extreme and profound and then the two after it start coming back down to earth
books,not_removed,thats whats amazing about them every single one of them is like an outside context problem made manifest herbert pursues the blind spot you have no idea what hes getting at until he shows you still havent come across anything operating on the same level the best of the rest only dare to try in a few heroic chapters what every single part of every single dune book does always chasing the unknown unknown and somehow making sense his words are like a hologram and the depth in them is dizzying
books,not_removed,thanks very much david copperfield is definitely on my toread list i didnt start on it as i heard it was a long one but i suppose if its an easy read then it will be one of those that fly by
books,not_removed,thats very interesting you suggest his journalism will have to take look thanks for the suggestions
books,not_removed,good as he is he is also rightly famous for using several hundred words where half a dozen would have done but in his journalism and in both those two novels he is leaner more efficient more focussed imo and so you get to the core of it much quicker its also very helpful as a primer for the kind of world he was writing and living in about as seen through his eyes

books,not_removed,fear and loathing in las vegas by hinter s thompson i was in middle school and it was the first book that showed me that books did not have to conform to any expectation of their own most books you read in or for school are pretty standard literature many of them are great works but they follow generally accepted patterns of what we expect from books fear and loathing in las vegas revels in breaking as many of these expected norms as possible and it all comes together in an amazing way many people felt it glorified drugs but i actually took away the opposite while i enjoyed reading his crazy drug fueled exploits i never wanted to experience it myself it seemed mostly sad rather than fun

books,not_removed,a painted house john grisham i dont know why exactly i was young and had been on a grisham kick pretty much just buying whatever book of his i liked the name or cover of rinse and repeat when i read it it wasnt about lawyersand i honestly was like thats a fucking modern tkam its still the only book ive read more than once
books,not_removed,i was when i checked out beezus and ramona by beverly cleary with this i became a lifelong reader
books,not_removed,when i was quite young it would have to be moving out
books,not_removed,especially as its about books if remember correctly
books,not_removed,that is a good book i cant tell you how many times ive quoted that book in conversation
books,not_removed,slaughterhouse five was my first kurt vonnegut book it was my gate way book so it goes
books,not_removed,thats beautiful
books,not_removed,same here i read the trilogy numerous times the first time when i was i think and i feel like each time i notice new things or look at some aspects with a different perspective there are so many layers in these books its an inexhaustible source of pleasure and reflection
books,not_removed,my favourite book by far i love it so much and still laugh every time i read it
books,not_removed,i wonder how many people now have a love for reading that they would not have had if not for harry potter
books,not_removed,i had a similar experience i found a book at my grandparents house an old paper back missing the cover and first few pages so i started reading it and couldnt put it down the clan of the cave bear i dont know that i would have read it if i saw the cover of new what it was about but it is one of my favorite reading experiences now
books,not_removed,completely agree
books,not_removed,on book now and its great also im the same way but with stephen king
books,not_removed,im rereading it for the or so time now at years old i first read the series when i was or so and its amazing to look back and see how much it has impacted on my life so much of my personal beliefs about religion free will and morality have their seed in these books
books,not_removed,a great many my generation was definitely the harry potter generation jk rowling did a lot to get young kids reading i can still remember my old english teacher reading it to us it just felt magical i think the chapters in philosophers stone where we are introduced to more and more of the wizarding world are genuinely some of the best childrens literature of all time

books,not_removed,oh ok sorry üòÖ
books,not_removed,i read salvation on sand mountain my freshman year of college i absolutely loved it the book gave me much more empathy for and a greater understanding of snakehandling churches its also written very well and is an interesting personal journey for the author i think there are numerous moral and educational lessons to be drawn from this interesting read
books,not_removed,i read it loved it and hated it at the same time real pageturner but at the same time made me furious at the illogical and major contradictions just embarrassing i honestly think like others had said here the less you are familiar with this sort of scifi the more you can enjoy it and the less you try to make logic in it as well remember that average tv show sliders same thing it was pretty obvious real quick who was the abductor if was that smart he was pretty dumb at coming there hoping to steal the protagonists life because infinite other versions of jason would do the same and they would all come to the same world therefor it totally contradicts the very notion of the whole plot the moment one reality creates the box it branches into infinite realities lets say the above didnt happen still would have to know better than to leave the protagonist alive and bringing him to his own reality since he would know that very thing would branch into infinite possible realities where the protagonist somehow find his way back wrong move the idiots back at the lab seemed to have never even considered to possibility that whoever is coming back wont be the same person that came in that would be one of the first things you might want to check when you build a portal to other realities theoretically the moment such a box is invented and creates infinite possibilities of the user to choose a place to go to it will cause a bug where infinite versions of that user will might exists simultaneously at the same spacetime since infinite versions of jason could have chosen the same door to the same world entering at the same time why were the lab people back in world so evil towards the protagonist it was obvious to them he isnt their jason wouldnt they want to be nice to the very first person they see from another reality and make him cooperate they tried to be nice for like minutes fake nice then it seems like they honestly hate him why would even try to come to the cabin with a gun hes supposed to be smart he honestly thought he could shoot the protagonist next to his wife and just simply continue like nothing happened find it extremely hard to believe theoretically each jason of the desperate ones who came back could have easily settled going back to the box and choosing a world with is almost identical to theirs in such a tiny irrelevant way they would be far better there without competition getting rid of and taking his place also going with the logic of the book with possible worlds the moment the protagonist enters world he would branch to infinite possibilities and of course in one he is ought to came back imminently to his original world because everything that might happen does happen so it would have never taken any reality jason sooo long to come back never there would be a continuous flow of infinite jasons from the very moment he came in his son never asks questions and his wife is a flat character that only drinks wine and thinks about thoughts a day and go with the flow of everything thats happening without any doubt very convincing
books,not_removed,this is the first longish over pages book ive ever read in one sitting im not a fast reader but i got so engrossed in this i couldnt stop even though you can figure out the whodunnit aspect pretty quickly it takes a lot of twists and turns that you probably wont see coming i loved it and cant wait for the inevitable moving probably starring matt damon
books,not_removed,i finished it yesterday as well and wasnt as taken with it as everyone else seems to be for science fiction aficionados the concepts are actually really conventional even oldfashioned i suspect the level of enjoyment you will get out of it corresponds with your familiarity with old sci fi tropes the more familiar you are with these ideas the less you will probably enjoy it there was nothing here i havent encountered many times before i guess the novelty is that hes writing for the mysterythriller audience instead of the science fiction audience
books,not_removed,i plowed through this in two days it was a bit routine through the first act the second act was routine and a bit tedious however the third act is where this book takes off it is gripping heart wrenching and thought provoking without getting into spoiler territory i consider myself well versed in the science andor thought experiment this books gets into but i could totally relate to jason when he realized the one thing he didnt account for in his journey that realization came crashing down on me at the same time it did him then i was totally hooked i couldnt put it down i had to see how he was going to deal with that monumental problem this is what made the book so good great stuff
books,not_removed,im reading it now loving it
books,not_removed,read this in days one of my fastest given i read multiple books at a time first real page turner for me in a while i was expecting a much more complex metaphysical presentation with mathematical equations and all but ultimately appreciated how it was laid out with his fragmented sentences style which i loved
books,not_removed,just finished the book its the first time i read a scifi thriller and im blown away to say the least can anyone recommend any similar reads
books,not_removed,ive listened to it while pok√©mon hunting three times this week i do tend to get fixated on stuff like this ive listened to the end of the whole mess by steven king at least times but this one feels special this is to multiverse scifi what back to the future is to time travel scifi
books,not_removed,this book was absolutely amazing anyways hey guys i have a question regarding one of the incidents that occurred in the book s there was a scene where jason and amanda were walking through the corridor when they suddenly saw a naked fleshed out version of jason running by them in the same corridor how is this possible
books,not_removed,im so glad you started this thread when i finished it a few days ago i thought no one was going to read it which bummed me out
books,not_removed,so glad i found this thread i finished it the other day and wow what a great read as with a lot of people im left with some questions and hopefully some other readers have insight into this s when amanda leaves jason the note that she is leaving she took half the ampoules implying that she was going to use the box if she uses the box doesnt it disappear leaving jason with no box to use or does it exist in every reality if the latter in the reality where created the box would it just then appear in the other realities
books,not_removed,the book was ok i liked it enough to read to the end but like you listed there were many flaws ive noticed while reading
books,not_removed,yep same as me i couldnt believe how quickly the pages were flying by it was good and obviously quite gripping but i think its fair to say the pace came at the cost of any real beauty in the prose
books,not_removed,im with you it wasnt the the worst thing ive ever read but it wasnt the best either it was just a good solid read in my opinion i think the fact that it is such a quick read helped it im not sure i wouldve enjoyed it if it had been much longer overall though id still say it was good
books,not_removed,i finished it yesterday as well and wasnt as taken with it as everyone else seems to be for science fiction aficionados the concepts are actually really conventional even oldfashioned i suspect the level of enjoyment you will get out of it corresponds with your familiarity with old sci fi tropes the more familiar you are with these ideas the less you will probably enjoy it there was nothing here i havent encountered many times before i guess the novelty is that hes writing for the mysterythriller audience instead of the science fiction audience yeah i enjoyed it but its far from original in fact i saw one of the twists coming ten minutes into the novel
books,not_removed,i havent read the book what other books with similar premises are there
books,not_removed,im totally happy you enjoyed it
books,not_removed,its so good it is heart wrenching until the end that being said i emailed blake last night and told him i want more stories from the box andhe was kindenough to reply
books,not_removed,i know im days late getting here but just wanted to note that i too finished in only two days and that i consumed this book faster than any other ive ever read i believe in the beginning i thought the fragmented sentences was just lazy writing or that it was just a cheap way of adding more pages to the book overall but i grew to really enjoy it
books,not_removed,the wayward pines series by the same author d
books,not_removed,exactly how i felt
books,not_removed,was a much more ambitious person probably had a lot more self control over his emtions it was probably easier for him to navigate the box than
books,not_removed,for the same exact reason that they saw multiple jasons in his universe for the most part the duplicates only came into focus when he entered his destination universe however there is also that likelihood that one of his selves could have slipped into a hell scape and gotten away in a bad state thus
books,not_removed,i have been thinking about the realities of this a bit myself and it seems like the physical idea of a box itself is where you really have to suspend your disbelief s what happens in universes where the box is destroyed after theyve left it what happens in the other realities when created the box i feel like there was no express or implied answer in the novel about this side of the equation
books,not_removed,im sure there were several plot points that were predictable like the main plot of how jason was abducted s granted i never saw the multiple jason plot even though it was so obvious that this is inevitable when having such freedom of multiverse access
books,not_removed,to say would be a spoiler but s its a parallel universemultiverse novel where he jumps through a lot of parallel worlds a la televisions sliders trying to find his way back to his prime universe where he is confronted by evil versions of himself from other universes who all want to steal his life so ive seen a lot of parallel universe stories and a lot of stories where the villain is your shadow self from another universe there are at least hundreds of stories with this concept in all honesty its possible that there are thousands
books,not_removed,what did he say
books,not_removed,i totally understand the multiple versions bit but im just trying to understand the mental corridor stage when they saw the naked jason in the same corridor when jasonamanda went into the box that time they went into the corridor stage together how did the naked jason who presumably went back into his box after a horrible experience with the hell world also see jasonamanda when naked jason went back into his box from the hell world shouldnt he be in his own separate corridor superposition mentality rather than sharing the stage with the healthy jasonamanda so my main concern would be is it even possible to share the corridor stage if so then that must mean that jasonamanda somehow entered the superposition stage at the same time that naked jason went back into a box but still this perplexes me hope you can clarify thanks
books,not_removed,ive been thinking about this more and i think it has to do with the impact of observing the box from the outside s so in my original question amanda uses the box but the box doesnt disappear only she does which is why jason could still go use the same box i get that part now as for what happens if the box is destroyed in one reality i suppose the way the book described it is that all the infinite realities are branches and if the box ceases to exist at some point in time that branch just stops while the other realities that still contain a box keep going
books,not_removed,please use spoiler tags spoiler tags are done by s spoiler content here which results in s spoiler content here send a when you have updated and well reapprove it
books,not_removed,thats what im talking about yup glad it was revealed at the midpoint and in a mr robot kind of way like duh why didnt i see this from a mile away
books,not_removed,he saic he appreciated my kind words and was happy i enjoyed his work the box stuff was a hard maybe but i am optimistic i cant say much more about my vision without spoiling
books,not_removed,nono he gave him the drug first remember he had the hammering head sensation right after he gave it to him then he gave him the ketamin which rendered him unconscious at first but then groggily awake later this cause his mind amnesia when he first arrived in world he took the drug himself as was falling asleep so he drugged him got him out of his mind on ketamin took him in the box with him traveled back to his own world and kicked him out of the door and then went back to world
books,not_removed,no problem took me a minute too i wouldnt have pieced it together completely if there wasnt a passage wherein they explained jason was staggering like he had been pushed out of the box into jason world it was in the part where he was reviewing video footage of his arrival
books,not_removed,ah so the ketamin
books,not_removed,kind of homophobic
books,not_removed,well thats in pretty poor taste
books,not_removed,um phrasing
books,not_removed,true success naturally corrective linguistic programming how to achieve your positive life intuitively by michaelson williams link
books,not_removed,the stand big loud crazy with a bangup ending
books,not_removed,salems lot it one of his early works after he started writing as stephen king his writing is still raw but clearly showcases his potential read it in high school and scared the bejesus out of me writer extraordinaire
books,not_removed,hard to choose i loved bag of bones but probably the best
books,not_removed,the eyes of the dragon i believe its called its amazing
books,not_removed,the stand is my favorite as its just epic i read the long walk a few months ago and loved it such a simple concept and a pretty short book but he just has a way of telling his stories almost any king will keep me captivated but just beware that his endings are often lackluster it often feels to me like hes being forced to end the book by the publishers so he throws something together
books,not_removed,if i had to choose it would be a cointoss between the stand or it both have immense stories and both books totally absorbed me when i wrote read thembut then you have pet cemetery never been so moved by a book than that onebut then you have the mist terrifying book to read sorry not sure ive helped much edit im not stephen king
books,not_removed,the shining has always stayed with me
books,not_removed,the long walk is my personal favorite
books,not_removed,the green mile imo
books,not_removed,in my mind its misery hands down i also enjoyed very much
books,not_removed,the dead zone i was spellbound by the plot and the tragic character that story stuck with me
books,not_removed,stephen king is my favorite cujo christine pet semetary it firestarter and the stand though that was
books,not_removed,i always loved desperation its evil and it has the feel of alternate universes which are defined more in the sequel the regulators both of my favorite elements from king books like it and the stand hands down best tv interpretations
books,not_removed,im not a horror fan so i might not be the best person to ask but i really like under the dome the bill hodges trilogy and dreamcatcher im probably the only person i know that liked dreamcatcher and the mist
books,not_removed,pet semetary i find it unsettling due to the fact that i live on the edge of wilderness just like the characters in the book its also kings personal choice for the novel he believes is the scariest hes written
books,not_removed,bag of bones is the best in my opinion and most peoples top easy if they read it
books,not_removed,is hands down the fastest one ive ever gotten through
books,not_removed,firestarter so creative original wellwritten nothing like it
books,not_removed,the shining the only book that scared the shit out of me i remember reading the second half of the book alone at the hotel in the middle of the night and it really gave me some goosebumps it was really doozy and then theres the gunslinger the first dark tower book
books,not_removed,the stand is my favorite of his books that i have read the shawshank redemption is my favorite story written by stephen king i have never read the book though
books,not_removed,on writing a memoir of the craft
books,not_removed,the bachman books specifically the long walk absolutely fantastic
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,the stand it is epic i recently reread it i forgot all about the trippy world on a giant turtle stuff and of course the bit where they all bang each other aged
books,not_removed,the stand is a given my mom introduced me to stephen king when i was about and easily spooked with the talisman now i know king only cowrote it but it had a quirky sense of humor that i absolutely loved hard to describe but you see it in joe hills novels too that mix of terror and lighthearted banter
books,not_removed,different seasons best character development and subtle touch on plot and narrative does not rely on horror and supernatural for suspense overall best storytelling
books,not_removed,i know you were going for a pun but the ending was actually hugely disappointing for me
books,not_removed,thank you im a big king fan and i rarely if ever hear anyone mention this one its one of the few books ive read more than once fantastic read
books,not_removed,you wrote the stand and it wow
books,not_removed,just floating there like a luft balloon
books,not_removed,definitely one of my favorites of his
books,not_removed,agree great story
books,not_removed,let me just edit that s
books,not_removed,the deadmans tomb it is ok to make jokes at the authors expense by now is a long harrowing adventure across humanitys existence and humanitys collective philosophy it is above all heismans personal work and is truly a suicide note left to explain why he has chosen to off himself it was as if he were trying to defend his own suicide his own depression by pulling off the ultimate act of human dignity suicide by reason he failed in this task but instead showed us a remarkable view of his insecurities while creating a ludicrous synthesis of western thought that is somehow implicitly and explicitly both parody and not parody heismans stated reason for killing himself are essentially that he wants to do an experiment this experiment is seeing whether or not his book is stopped from being read truth be told everybody can read it and this is wellremarked upon in other places but that is not the reason he kills himself the reason he kills himself is this hypothesis if he wants to do the experiment truly objectively then he reasons he must be dead because the fact that he is alive means he has tendencies to view the data in a subjective way furthermore because he says western thought is increasingly moving towards the abolishment of anthrocentrism materialism means that whether or not he is alive does not matter thereby his suicide is the result of him trying to do this experiment subjectively bullox he gives like a bad magician away most of his secrets at the beginning and the end of the book the rest is filler material heisman shows quickly that he is not psychologically healthy despite having a degree in psychology he has a desperate occupation with judaism despite being atheist that stems from the early death of his father and the resulting mental isolation that resulted from the rest of the world his chapter names though funny are meant to be both true and offensive it speaks to an incredible narcissism where he essentially states that none but he have been honest with themselves that he seeks to both find followers and to offend in his death the actual content of the tomb is a sort of magnification of history that ultimately results in his experiment as the turning point firstly we begin with his concentration on the battle of the natural versus the unnatural the natural is the biological the unnatural is the technological the first seeks its own survival its own replenishment while the latter does neither it is ultimately suicidal it is heismans own repetition of singularity theory and it is interlaced with jewish commentary which he obsesses over he says that the jews developed their own religion which is inherently unnatural inherently suicidal this tendency was spread through mankind by jesus who himself was suicidal because of his own internal conflicts about his father indeed heisman uses psychoanalysis to present and accept or at least flirt with the idea that jesus was the son of a roman soldier the technology of religion morphing into the unnatural sciences will eventually result into a singularity aigod he then backs up and begins tracing the lines of political powers the viking the saxons and so on to show that america instead of being the battle ground of whigs versus tories is actually the battle ground of saxons versus normans suicidal tendencies once more erupt in this center of the population as they die for ideals and freedoms this summary does not do the note any justice however the book is too large too repetitive and too unedited to really make a true dent into what heisman is trying to say he has paragraph after paragraph that rambles repeating the same idea in different ways his grammar and sometimes his spellings make no coherent effort in being true he asks questions many times through the journey and he never answers them he makes us ask question and those are not answered it seem that he killed himself so that while he may not have attention in life he may get attention in death well ive obliged him this was not written by me it was a review about his work which i thought fit perfect here author aaron link
books,not_removed,that was pretty fucked up
books,not_removed,ive tried reading his book before and it always struck me as an argument against forced societal equivalence between things that truly arent equal and that the slippery slope of that equivalence is that there would be no societal difference between life and death his public suicide served to punctuate that absurdity
books,not_removed,this guy raised the bar in suicide notes
books,not_removed,remember kids always use latex
books,not_removed,the original tldr
books,not_removed,seems like an odd choice to name a college football trophy after
books,not_removed,he strikes me as bipolar but somewhat a genius too i like this part analytic philosophy is not analytical enough the very existence of a philosopher of the analytic school or a scientist skeptical of the very term synthesis is dependent upon bodily processes such as protein synthesis the most converse cognates extreme analytic philosophers and scientists are thus hypocritical organisms whose existence is conditioned upon synthetic processes that they deny in theory but perpetuate in practice life itself is almost distinguishable from nonlife by the ability of its constituent synthetic process to outcompete the analytic processes that would normally break life down into death if analytic philosophers were more consistent they would be lead to bring down the hierarchies of their own mind
books,not_removed,this guy is really the james joyce of suicide note writers
books,not_removed,looks like the usual antimodern sophistry
books,not_removed,is an interesting cathartic read written by clayton atreus who became a paraplegic in a motorcycle accident wherein he rationalizes his suicide and challenges common views on disability
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,cant say that he didnt think it through
books,not_removed,the table of contents is even too long to read he obviously was troubled and then tried to rationalize his mental illness
books,not_removed,i tried reading his bookmanifesto but i found little to no profound insights within it
books,not_removed,the problem with nihilism is that it doesnt really make for a functional society its a captivating concept but useless in the end kind of like anarchy it is a childish philosophy
books,not_removed,my favorite chapter how rome was raped by jesuss penis of the spirit contracting a deadly virus
books,not_removed,why he was going to do it
books,not_removed,he misread nietzsche
books,not_removed,its sad that if i have one of his assumptions correct he didnt seem to follow the perfectly logical line of reasoning about meaning not existing and thusly meaninglessness not existing either
books,not_removed,years banned without reason farewell reddit ill miss the conversation and the people ive formed friendships with but im seeing this as a positive thing
books,not_removed,bottom of page
books,not_removed,the saddest part is that his hypothesis was wrong what a troubled man
books,not_removed,i did it because i wanted to
books,not_removed,thats some dedication
books,not_removed,when was this
books,not_removed,read nothing but the title index which came across as the scribblings of a madman the poor guy was troubled indeed
books,not_removed,ah so this is what people mean when they say get out of your head if this dude was a nihilist i guess you could say he died for nothing oh the irony
books,not_removed,if my hypothesis is correct this work will be repressed oh well
books,not_removed,wow fascinating stuff
books,not_removed,imo his perspective is hasty and overly rigid it would feel more seasoned to balance the nihilism with some humanism
books,not_removed,i read some of this a couple years ago i quit after reading its bibliography and realizing this guy who is passing himself off as having read extensively about the philosophical implications of suicide somehow made it pages without a single mention of albert camus thats such a glaring oversight that you can just sort of dismiss the whole thing even if he had spent a paragraph brushing him off thatd have been one thing but to not even address one of the most famous thinkers on the subject is bizarre then again why wouldnt this whole thing be bizarre
books,not_removed,some dude wrote a big book on why he blew his head off supposedly a convincing philosophical essay on his outlook on reality pardon me if i miss reading this one loli already fuckt myself up enough reading catcher in the rye at a young age
books,not_removed,holy fuck this is awesome
books,not_removed,it looks like the ramblings of a mad man to me without reading pages im going to gamble that no one finds a gem of wisdom or deep life altering philosophy inside i also think he was expecting this to get more attention what a shame
books,not_removed,wasnt hugged as a child
books,not_removed,is there a specific mental illness that refers to people who take themselves waaay to fucking seriously is it narcissism it cant be just that its like they are biologically unable to look inward at themselves and laugh and just say lol dude shut the fuck up what are you talking about chill out look how beautiful of a day it is stop being such a negative little bitch its almost like the guy was just the biological sentient robot aspect of what people are without the soul dudes a total fuckin bummer and while shooting yourself in the head might catch peoples attention it certainly doesnt make me think your headbox was capable of producing anything capable of enhancing peoples lives
books,not_removed,he was to smart for mankind he has thought way to much some famous philosopher said that once a being reaches mental realms of such high capacity u are incapable of living with humans
books,not_removed,bachelors degree in psychology he wasted all of that money on a useless degree no wonder he killed himself
books,not_removed,he is not psychologically healthy despite having a degree in psychology those two things may actually correlate
books,not_removed,just a note that when referring to a large book its a tome not a tomb so the review writers joke doesnt work
books,not_removed,caveat we see the world not as it is but as we are so since were all projecting heres my projection i think the author was suicidal from the start and tried to figure out ways and means to rationalize it i find myself thinking of david foster wallace who was also struggling with depression and also wrote incredibly verbose work some will say that its much better literature probably true but i dont want to get into that dfw tried to fight it as best as he could but ultimately succumbed i wonder how powerless we all ultimately are to such inner demons the authors exploration of suicidal tendencies and ideation throughout history strikes me as a sort of selfsoothing behavior if that makes sense some people explore these things out of incidental curiosity but this seems likely to be something more than that he was intensely suicidal he sought out stories about other suicidal people throughout history he constructed an elaborate explanation for why his suicide was justified and then he did what he was compelled to do from the beginning
books,not_removed,at least these rambling winding sentences en route to suicide actually have some possibly researchvalue this was a sad and poignant insight into the tortured mind of an isolated academic the honest selfeffacement of a man facing down his own death with only what he took for reason i found much more nobility and naked honesty in the schizoid titles of heismans table of contents than i found in an entire slog through david foster wallaces infinite jest for example which i would contrast against this work as pathologically narcissistic selfindulgence and evasive through fiction to the very last in spite of its celebration as a tour de force at least in comparing the works of late men i do not feel so slimy in criticizing dfw but it is an ample mirror to highlight the weakness of his oeuvre oblivionmr squishy obliviongood old neon and the saccharine bit he wrote about the morning of whose name escapes me present us with dfw speaking from the heart with that sincerity he is noted for these are the exceptions he was capable of being an excellent writer when not masturbating unfortunately heismans toxic deep dive into antisemitism made the conclusions inedible unreadable for me im fascinated with his attempt to rewrite history as the universal history of suicide but he really ought to have just read some cioran and called it a day a more contextually apt comparison may be with the unabombers manifesto which also culminated in radically antitechnological resistance and perceived the ai singularity god in similar terms we could also link him to the cult figure httpwwwbentoandstarchkycomdecmrfrchtm in which he foretold a communist gangster computer god containment policy to atomize society into a technologically isolated melting pot for all cultures to create a jewish mulatto world antisemitism schizoid influencing machine concerns an underlying reaction against the machine are common themes heismans tragedy wasnt the suicide it was that his radical individualism drove him to believe that his suicide hypothesis was in some way unique or exceptional and this blinkered him from responsibly applying academic rigour to his own ideas and maturing them this disconnect is probably where mental health made all the difference

books,not_removed,do you mean bollocks
books,not_removed,does this idea of jesus being fathered by a roman soldier have precedent i dont believe ive read that before
books,not_removed,sounds like he and ted kacinsky of unabomber fame would appreciate one another im not sure what his name is
books,not_removed,officially sounds like the worst book ever
books,not_removed,yeah i started to feel like i was reading the play the king in yellow and had to stop before i went crazy
books,not_removed,ive read your comment a few times and still dont know exactly what you mean could anyone explain it a bit simpler please
books,not_removed,i guess its true that there actually wasnt a societal difference between his life and his death especially if it happened in and im just hearing about it now so he was right someone call and tell him oh wait
books,not_removed,so pages of anguish over a false premise poor guy
books,not_removed,to me his suicide was more of a performance piece than a so called experiment as someone just hearing about this all that was my initial impression it almost reminds me of black mirrors first episode or birdman
books,not_removed,and clearly spent a lot of time thinking about this stuff thats a trap you can spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about a leaf that doesnt make you better qualified to understand the leaf like say a horticulturist or a biologist thought can be and often is useless meaningless just the background noise of a brain ticking over someone giving attention to continuing mental processes as someone with ocd i can assure you thinking heavily and repetitively on something in itself doesnt do anything does not provide any greater insights into the truth of the thing psychology is an ironic field in that way in large parts just pure philosophy and that hollow thought the best psychologists are those that are informed by other things like neurology biochemistry that tangible knowledge reality i havent read that guys book or being familiar with his work but by the sounds of it that book was justas mentioneda sophistic drawn out suicide note the consequence of a deeply unhappy man in the throes of depression i suspect that under all that he still wanted a meaningful death but death is unfortunately often meaningless or at least of no special meaning beyond the common and mundane such as a depressive desiring to escape somehow their demons
books,not_removed,i had a similar but slightly different impression of his suicide it reminded me a lot of the kind of people who commit spree killings a lot of times there is no real underlying agenda in who they target be it race religion class etc despite what they may claim before or after the attack to justify their actions it is simply a desire to have power be someone important and go out with a bang rather than the whimper their death would otherwise inspire and good dose of suicidal tendencies obviously if the author just wanted to make a statement about life and modern culture and our relationship with death or whatever the fuck the point of his tome was why does he have to commit suicide in such a theatrical manner i would hazard that it was far less about any academic pursuit and very much a matter of ego selfimportance and selfesteem he was a nobody his work would never stand on its own merits but god damn it mitchell was born to leave a mark unfortunately for mitchell his death meant nothing because he isnt special and even with such a spectacular book reveal it also means nothing his mark isnt much greater than the bloody smear an illiterate person who never read a book let alone wrote one would leave in their wake

books,not_removed,im a nihilist and i agree
books,not_removed,i dont see the problem nihilism is a school of thought not a political system its value isnt to be found in whether or not it would make a solid foundation for society beyond that the core tenets of nihilism are far from childish and entirely compatible with society as it stands today
books,not_removed,well i dont imagine the pragmatic downsides to nihilism really bother true nihilists if we live in a world where we do nothing but paint rocks and a nihilist claims that our rockpainting lives are pointless and you retort that that childish attitude doesnt get many rocks painted i dont see that the nihilist should care
books,not_removed,the question isnt do i have sufficient support for nihilism and it isnt even do i have sufficient support to refute nihilism the real question is do i have sufficient support for any value system or rather more generally can there exist support for any value system now you may want to answer yes of course there is however a large amount of the work related to nihilism is by philosophers attempting to refute the idea and so far all attempts have been unsuccessful sure you can choose some foundational moralethical system like secular humanism or whatever else you prefer but as far as we can tell there is no rational foundation for any of those systems if you dig deep enough you find some axiomatic moral choices and often some sociological or psychological reasons for those choices this isnt some abstract problem this is probably the greatest challenge of the century given the fact that we are presently creating ais and given it is only a matter of time until they reach a level that is beyond our direct control we need to treat this problem seriously it is actually frightening to hear people suggest this is childish watch this httpswwwtedcomtalkssamharriscanwebuildaiwithoutlosingcontroloverit to get a flavour for the issue

books,not_removed,looks like he killed himself around
books,not_removed,it seems to be a bit of a paradox to write anything if you believed nothing mattered information doesnt matter teaching people doesnt matter explaining yourself doesnt matter doing anything doesnt matter what nihilists stupidly ignore is the idea that some things matter to some people in the context of their life experience societal differences happen based on the abundance of efforts or lack of efforts if everyone but you killed themselves it would clearly have a difference on society
books,not_removed,good point camus argued that the question why shouldnt a person kill themselves is the most fundamental question underlying all thought on the human condition it is then reasonable to say that everything anyone has ever said or will ever say about anything to do with humanity is implicitly about suicide so not only can this mans book be mindlessly ignored but in fact every single book ever published every song ever sung every movie made in fact every verbal utterance can immediately be discarded if it doesnt mention camus by name really theres no reason at all for language we may as well get rid of all words except for albert and camus since any sentence that doesnt mention him is worthless albert albert camus albert camus camus albert albert camus camus albert albert albert camus albert albert camus camus camus camus albert
books,not_removed,bold the experiment in nihilism is to seek out and expose every illusion and every myth wherever it may lead no matter what even if it kills us this literally makes no sense if nothing matters then seeking out and exposing doesnt matter the answer to caring about anything is that it doesnt matter and thats the paradox of nihilism if nothing matters nihilism doesnt matter it isnt heroic or even interesting to kill yourself because you seek answers from death know why because youre going to die anyway speeding it up gosh doesnt matter

books,not_removed,as someone who studies psychology i absolutely agree with you one of the biggest motivational factors in me pursuing psychology was my own mental health problems what started with a need to understand ended up becoming a passion it seems as though a lot of people in the field are in the same boat not only that but it does take a bit of a toll on your mental health when youre constantly being exposed to the deepest and darkest reaches of someones minds i swear its almost like these psychologists get contact ptsd it takes a lot out of someone to stare people dead in the eyes and keep composure as they recapture the worst moments of their lives in emotionally descriptive detail

books,not_removed,this hypothesis implicates you have some nice insights into the human condition
books,not_removed,a century greek philosopher celsus wrote that jebus was the son of httpsenwikipediaorgwikitiberiusjuliusabdespantera but there is very little evidence for that although one can argue theres even less evidence for the accepted story of immaculate conception to me the theory that jebus was a bastard son resulting from a horny roman soldiers fling is much more plausible than the bullshit theyre trying to sell us officially

books,not_removed,i can think of a couple of books with titles that are so bad they make the instructions on a bottle of shampoo look like a literary masterpiece
books,not_removed,i think zort is saying that society is attempting to make different things be viewed as the same and exist under the same conditions for example the idea that men and women should fulfill the same requirements eg fitness test for a certain position if we take this idea of making different things be equal to the extreme life and death must be equal which is clearly absurd his public death illustrates this point

books,not_removed,it is people like you who would rather live in a world of mediocrity than a world of invention
books,not_removed,i had a philosophy ta in college who was offered an administrative position at one of the insurance companies in ct philosophers are valuable at that level because they approach problem solving with a different skill set than professionals with a businessfinanceeconomics background its actually quite common to see professionals with a philosophy background in many diverse positions not just writing books or becoming a teacher to use your own logic from another post just because it is unimportant to you doesnt mean it is unimportant
books,not_removed,i disagree wholeheartedly psychology is a very integral part of modern philosophy understanding the brain allows us to understand behavior and in turn our self absolute knowledge of self is freedom according to hegel and without building a firm foundation of how the human mind operates we wont progress for instance what good is a computer if you dont know how to use it or any complex tool for that matter the brain is the most complex tool that humans have access to and if we dont understand every facet of it we wont ever properly utilize it
books,not_removed,very strong opinion have you read a philosophy book ever you seem to fundamentally misunderstand the topic as a result i cant imagine you even almost picking up a book about philosophy
books,not_removed,heres what philosophers can do that would impact society figure out if ai sentience is equal to human sentience the decided answer to this can easily end humanity or extend it to the stars work out values of various cultures find a compromise and create a unified value system work out ways to make everyday living better in a behavorial setting at the very least they make great fictional work
books,not_removed,hahahaha cant belive that people are so offended
books,not_removed,dont worry dude im with you all they do is yap yap yap and it is all a battle of semantics none of it accomplishes anything people like us live in the moment and enjoy it rather than try to find some hidden meaning or logical approach to it there is none fuck socrates fuck plato fuck descartes i think the most hilariousironic part about these sophists is that after all this material theyve read they still cannot let go of their egos long enough to refrain from downvoting somebody because of a differing opinion

books,not_removed,its an americanism historical myth wrapped up and perpetuated by the legend of columbus columbus did some crazy brave thing by sailing west because only he had an inkling the earth was round while noone else had ever done it and thought he was mad because hed sail off the edge of the world its a mythological tale which makes his legend a bit more exciting the new world being new not just geographically but intellectually a maturing of mankinds understanding of the universe america and thus americans are the future etc the truth is that people simply thought it was ocean all the way to east asia and columbus and his expedition would die of hungerthirsta giant sea storm before getting there maybe a sea monster or two as well but people knew the earth was round

books,not_removed,i am a child and i agree
books,not_removed,yeah i dont know childish seems to be the least thoughtful of all insults
books,not_removed,tenets
books,not_removed,but its meaningless all the way down so why care about whether you care why not paint rocks its literally as equally meaningful as any other endeavor if you truly are a nihilist its like starting with a contradiction anything follows

books,not_removed,one need not cause the other to be connected they can also correlate if they are both being caused by a third factor
books,not_removed,it actually isnt a causal question the author thinks its somehow remarkable that heisman is both not psychologically healthy and has a degree in psychology just a correlation between being psychologically unhealthy and having a degree in psychology is sufficient to question the authors point that this is somehow unusual whether one causes the other or some other factors cause both is irrelevant in discussing the remarkability we see the two traits together commonly therefore its not unusual
books,not_removed,are you currently a psychologist
books,not_removed,for some reason i find myself reluctant to show unmitigated faith in your objectivity
books,not_removed,getting my doctorate in clinical psych in a little over a year can confirm
books,not_removed,its a small point honestly for me thats where i lost any regard for this reviewer if he cant even spell bollocks right its also compounded by some of the following sentences heisman shows quickly that he is not psychologically healthy despite having a degree in psychology he has a desperate occupation with judaism despite being atheist to both those points so how does having a degree in psychology preclude you from mental illnesses do doctors also never fall ill and why does atheism preclude you from any occupation with religion if anything id almost argue the opposite
books,not_removed,i dont know how you personally pronounce those two words but it does not work verbally in american english
books,not_removed,i think its important to make that distinction i agree its an important distinction
books,not_removed,thats nice of you to say
books,not_removed,youve conflated the virgin birth with the immaculate conception the latter of which refers to mary not jesus but dont worry its a common misconception
books,not_removed,and in that case the son of god could be a good metaphor
books,not_removed,thats a weird thing to kill yourself over
books,not_removed,he would probably say that the fact i didnt even know what year it happened supports his theories
books,not_removed,not a native speaker myself but that sentence with shitloads of that makes things hard to understand probably could have worded it better
books,not_removed,when people say using big words to sound smart they usually actually mean using stilted andor unclear english like here an argument against forced societal equivalence between things that truly arent equal no one knows what the fuck a forced societal equivalence is but hell thats what he wrote that phrasing comes off as trying to be erudite but instead im left not knowing what he means it feels like he might mean that societies tend to treat unequal things as if they were the same but in what way how often do societies tend to do that or sometimes do it or always do it and i was only able to come up with that interpretation after another reddit user brought up the idea clearly and gave the example of physical fitness between genders without it a societal equivalence sounds like a state where two societies are equal it doesnt sound like an equivalence of two ideas within a single society
books,not_removed,there is no question because we do not have minds to form said questions
books,not_removed,philosophy is not about studying the mechanisms of thought its about learning how to think critically edit removed unnecessary hyperbole
books,not_removed,one can properly utilize a thing without fully understanding that thing
books,not_removed,i mispoke i think psychology is important like studying behavioral disorders and stuff but philosophy is not important you dont need philosophy to understand the brain the brain is and isnt like a computer in the sense that we dont have to learn to use it i also dont have to ask the trivial why questions that philosophy ask to understand how it works either people do all kinds of practical experiments to understand how the brain works
books,not_removed,misunderstanding what topic so me not having your opinion means what do you major in philosophy
books,not_removed,chose a shit major and theyre taking it out on me
books,not_removed,none of it accomplishes anything yeah when has philosophy ever influenced any civilisation in any way lol

books,not_removed,very zen
books,not_removed,that is indeed smart far smarter than declaring in front of a global audience i am very smart because i have a big brain that said nihilism is frequently misunderstood its not that theres no good or bad but there is no deity or other authority who determines such its up to us to decide for ourselves what is right and wrong and not live our lives dictated by an ancient code or morals in short its freeing liberating to not live your life as if some ancient deity has already cast into stone what we can and cannot do how we should or shouldnt live our lives

books,not_removed,i am an anarchist and i agree
books,not_removed,ill never understand how childish can be considered an insult generally speaking children make a lot more sense than adults
books,not_removed,thank you edited
books,not_removed,i think he meant the actual tenants were children
books,not_removed,just because meaning may not be inherent in existence does not mean that everything must be meaningless a nihilist can lead a meaningful life they just understand that their endeavours are only meaningful because they themselves have ascribed meaning to them
books,not_removed,yes except from the mistaken comparison to ex falso quodlibet thats exactly right and supports what i said if one has no reason to care about anything then one has no reason to care about the pragmatics of nihilism
books,not_removed,this reasoning can be reduced infinitely to absurdity how do you judge best results to compare cultural value systems requires a value system in fact if youve already come to a conclusion of best result then you arent actually looking for a new value system since the conclusion already exists in the premise
books,not_removed,this is the curse of our generation and you cant say we didnt see it coming i mean ai is a clear and urgent impetus to this line of thought since the effects may be so dramatic but the seeds of this nihilism are centuries old how can we be sure our ai wont spell the end of the human race the creeping realization is that we cant we do what we do in the face of every intractable problem we hope everything will turn out all right and it just might turn out fine maybe even better than we could hope for maybe ai will become our bestest bro suicide seems like a fairly exaggerated response to a possible calamity i can understand that some people will never be able to find comfort in a world devoid of moral certainty it is worth having compassion for those who willingly suffer the burden of a meaningless life it is something i find easy to have empathy for because i feel it too
books,not_removed,you said it was a problem no it was developed for consideration to present a new viewpoint nihilism strives to answer questions regarding life and its purpose it is neither for pure entertainment perhaps entertaining your philosophical mind although nor for providing for a functional society it provides an answerviewpoint to its related issue and so im still left wondering what the problem is
books,not_removed,it was smarmy enough for the upvoters though

books,not_removed,this seems likeliest people who are interested in psychology are likelier to become psychologists than people who are not interested in psychology people who are psychologically maladjusted are likelier to be interested in psychology than people who are psychologically healthy or to appropriate the quote about politics ‚Äì you might not be interested in psychology but psychology is interested in you p ergo people who are psychologically maladjusted are likelier to become psychologists than people who are not important caveat its important to be mindful of base rates here its possible for psychologically maladjusted people to be much likelier to become psychologists and for psychologists to be psychologically healthier than the general population this is even if we completely discount the quite probable possibility that studying psychology can help you remedy your own mental health the variance in outcomes high x low base rate vs low x high base rate trips people up a lot anyway all of this would be cleared up quite a bit edit or not with some survey data im sure its been done
books,not_removed,insightful observation mypenisisawmd
books,not_removed,indirect exposure to aversive details of the trauma usually in the course of professional duties eg first responders medics great reference thats really interesting i wouldve figured this applied more to people who indirectly experienced the trauma like the professionals examples you use first responders medics those people are on the scene they witness the blood and detached limbs its interesting that just hearing about the memory of the trauma can cause contact ptsd and i wonder to what extent kinda reminds me of actors who say they carry the psychological turmoil of the characters they play even after the role is over like heath ledger as the joker
books,not_removed,im not ive still got a long road ahead of me im just speaking from experience with the psychologists ive come to know along the way a good friend of mine was one and he spent a lot of time hanging onto his patients problems they kind of share the burden at some point or another
books,not_removed,to both points its ironic its strange to be so infatuated with one specific religion when you dont believe its real
books,not_removed,studies have shown that atheists tend to have more knowledge on religion than the religious do from npr makes sense having been raised catholic my transition to atheism involved a tremendous amount of study on religion specifically i intensely studied the apologetic works of cs lewis in an attempt to stave off the erosion of my faith it felt like i was a bowl with a hole in the botttom and i was trying to stop the leak eventually i accepted that my reason would not allow me to continue the believe the things i used to believe but i fought hard to hold on to it after that i became fascinated with religion and read everything from the bible to the maharabata i imagine a lot of atheists had the same experience and to be honest its fun to be able to talk with a religious jew or christian or muslim or hindu when youre not coming from a place of complete ignorance having read the koran ive made a few muslim friends just by being able to have an intelligent conversation about their faith coming from a place of respect a lot of religious people arent offended by the idea of you not believing what they believe but rather ignorance of their beliefs
books,not_removed,to both those points so how does having a degree in psychology preclude you from mental illnesses do doctors also never fall ill and why does atheism preclude you from any occupation with religion if anything id almost argue the opposite agreed the argument for people studying psychology being actually more likely to suffer from mental illness has been discussed in comments above im also an atheist thats pretty obsessed with religion it can make me so irrationally angry its crazy maybe i should start studying psychology to find out whats going on in my head
books,not_removed,oops got my lore wrong thanks for pointing it out
books,not_removed,he is not psychologically healthy despite having a degree in psychology yeahi think that explains it from a separate comment thread
books,not_removed,so his experiment was a success wait a minute
books,not_removed,i often find that too many sentences that i read seem to be lacking in that so its a welcome change
books,not_removed,did you just answer the question
books,not_removed,i will right after my lunch i promise
books,not_removed,i disagree wholeheartedly
books,not_removed,philosophy is not about learning how to think critically any more than it is about any given thing philosophy is a broad church with many domains from metaphysics to formal logic it is about whatever subject the philosopher chooses to focus on source six weeks of introductory philosophy seven years ago and i also follow existential comics on facebook so come at me bro edit to remove first sentencesecond sentence format
books,not_removed,how have you studied philosophy and yet manage to be so sloppy with your logical operators and clarity of phrase that you appear make the rather absurd claim that a philosophy does not include philosophy of mind and b the subject matter of philosophy simply is critical thinking it certainly parses that way and thats bad enough i suspect you meant it though and i am not being charitable enough maybe you can explain imo ops post was fairly good about discussing the relevance of cognitive science to contemporary analytic philosophy lol yes this comment is self aware i even left some easter eggs for anyone whod like to continue the chain of pedantry
books,not_removed,meh youre both right studying philosophy teaches you to think critically but philosophy itself is the study of the fundamental nature of knowledge reality and existence
books,not_removed,one can maybe muddle ones way through to do a thing properly you need a proper understanding
books,not_removed,how can they do it properly if they dont fully understand it
books,not_removed,utilize to derive value by using successful utilization speaks nothing for effective utilization let alone innovation or invention only understanding can yield progress all other paths lead to ruin
books,not_removed,im genuinely curious about this so why dont you think philosophy is important does this apply to both past and present tense
books,not_removed,okay thats good however i still disagree that philosophy is not important philosophy literally translates to love of wisdom the main fields of philosophy created logic focus on critical thinking problem identification and problem solving philosophy at its base is pure logic and those logic skills have to go into any social field the main case for my argument is ethics which is a concept completely founded in philosophy this governs what is okay and not okay to do in the medical field in engineering in politics in law etc most cultural advancement only happens in changes in philosophy the ideas governing right and wrong our priorities our purpose these ideas in the most general way govern everything anybody does if you exist and you think philosophy directly applies to you source i am a philosophyhistory major
books,not_removed,what hes trying to say is how can one be so critical of a subject when one is not even knowledgeable about said subject have you read any philosophy books taken any philosophy courses of course you are entitled to your own opinion but for your opinion to be valid it must have some sort of factual or theoretical basis pertaining to the subject whether a persons in a science field or not philosophy is crucial in critical thinking it can be argued that learning the fundamentals of philosophy help build a strong foundation in stem based fields later in life i think if you keep an open mind youll understand what i mean
books,not_removed,whenever im having trouble with something i try to take a step back and look at the big picture find most problems seem smaller this way unless it is something threatening your life or something essential to your existence like not having a roof over your head or being able to feed yourself or your family also occasionally take breaks from your thoughts by meditating edit also exercise stress is something animals evolved with to prepare us for a physical outburst of either running or fighting for our lives humans rarely do either nowadays but the primitive part of our brain that regulates stress doesnt know that to add to this problem our neocortex can imagine up a stressful scenario and signal to the more primitive part of our brain to cook up a stress response without the prescence of any external factors that would require one in either case exercise can usually act as an off switch for mundane every day stress for things like chronic stress anxiety or depression things probably wont be as simple
books,not_removed,waiter theres an existentialism in my nihilism
books,not_removed,but how can one objectively say what is right or wrong if there is no higher agrees upon standard to a group like isis their existence is completely justified who are you to say they are wrong by this logic and before you claim that as humanity we can just tell what is good so thats what we should do how do you know we can just tell many who have differing views of morality would say we can just tell as well yet their conclusions will be opposite of yours my point is that nihilism does not free it only further confuses things
books,not_removed,i see i was a little misinformed httpsenwikipediaorgwikisuicidenote
books,not_removed,and he didnt say he did only that he was a major
books,not_removed,we cant all have psychology degrees doc
books,not_removed,is hes not a valid contraction of he was
books,not_removed,im a contrarian and i disagree
books,not_removed,agreed it always seems as though the speaker intends it as an insult but more often than not i find myself to be on the side of the children not sure what that says about me
books,not_removed,thats existentialism nihlism means even self made meaning is completely false you cant be a nihlist theres no way to build any moral framework on nihlist grounds because there no reason to do or not do anything why no commit suicide why not steal why not kill people nihlism definitionally cant prohibit anything nor say that theyre worth doing there are people who accuse certain philosophies or philosophers of nihlism but no one is a self professed nihlist
books,not_removed,then youre not a nihilist youre an existentialist
books,not_removed,you are correct i am not looking for a new value system
books,not_removed,nihilism is something that most healthy people consider and then get over if you havent gotten over it yet then hopefully you will soon

books,not_removed,what you wrote says that psychological illness causes psychiatric studies not that there is a third factor
books,not_removed,indeed good job mr penis sir
books,not_removed,he has a bachelors in psychologyso hes got about as much knowledge in the field as any other undergrad who took psych and sociology as electives
books,not_removed,its ironic not really in fact its often causal its strange to be so infatuated with one specific religion when you dont believe its real again not really many atheists arrive at their worldview specifically through the study and subsequent rejection of religion why this guy focusses on judaism i dont know maybe he was raised in it but its still not unreasonable in itself
books,not_removed,speaking as an atheist i personally believe the atheist who hasnt to some extent studied religion is doing themselves a disservice its the apex of cultural expression for every preenlightenment civilisation and many thereafter if you dont know anything about religion you dont really know anything about civilisation or people thats fine but such atheists shouldnt presume to talk about history or culture in any depth they are willfully blind and ignorant and will not fare well if they try to live in poorer countries among religious people who have great respect for tradition youll notice all the prominent new atheists know their scripture at the very least
books,not_removed,i would have been more impressed if he jacked off onstage instead if youre gonna go the existentialist route why not just cum in the front rows face instead of shooting yourself it probably would have disproven his theory because unlike his suicide i bet i would have seen him ejaculate about times by now on youtube
books,not_removed,heh its just that when there are too many thats it is hard to distinguish which that is that and which that is not that that there must be a name for that situation which i dont know
books,not_removed,do you agree with using a random selection of people on the street answering vignettes about ethical situations to be a way of studying ethics
books,not_removed,thats the entire point focusing on any of those fields requires the use of critical thinking which is honed through the study of ethics metaphysics etc
books,not_removed,ill concede my terseness and brevity made it hard to unpack my statement but i wasnt indicating that philosophy of mind isnt a part of philosophy nor that the only subject matter is critical thinking but that philosophy is about the act of critical thinking i think therefore i am not since my mind uses process x to formulate thought therefore i am

books,not_removed,funny how the philosophy people start arguing just like the guy a few posts above said they would solve some real goddam problems and quit it with the circular bullshit philosophy is a circle jerk of semantics live your own goddamn life and make of it what you will
books,not_removed,i think in the past when you could possibly attribute things like freedom of speech and stuff to philosophy it was more applicable its not important today because it doesnt produce anything that we cant live without or that makes our lives easier every single other field of science produces things even today that we cant live without i dont consider philosophy a science because you cant test your hypothesis and then have someone else test it and come up with the exact same results on anything anything can be important to you but that doesnt mean its actually important philosophy could go away tomorrow and things would go on business as usual but could math or anatomy no because they are important
books,not_removed,i think before any philosopher picked up a pen we had all of those things without critical thinking problem identification and solving we would have never been able to form society for example we are big but we arent big enough to take down anything worth eating alone so humans banded together to increase their odds thats identifying a problem and solving it before anyone had written language or maybe even spoken language i dont think philosophy created morals either i think certain things are ingrained into us like we dont murder because we know its wrong but in the past murdering someone thinned your numbers making your group weaker so there could be some deep psychological instinct going on when it comes to morals cultural advancements happen for a buuuunch or reasons like today the vast majority of americans dont hate black people in say that would be alot different but i dont think we got to the acceptance and understanding that we have today by someone asking why do we hate black people i dont know what causes cultural change but i dont think it can be linked to one thing
books,not_removed,good luck with that major i hope you have a trust fund
books,not_removed,perfectly stated personally i never completely appreciated the fields of science until i took a course in the philosophy of science and read kuhns book even though at the time i was a cynic when it cam to philosophys meritsworth it seems that today we have many people who believe the current scientific paradigm is infallible and for the most part static which is an issue all its own philosophy isnt a circle jerk its the active assessment of what it means to observe and understand the world around us to call it meaningless would be similar to saying we dont need our ears or eyes to understand the world either
books,not_removed,thanks ill give it a shot ive been thinking heh about mindfulness meditation in the past so maybe time to give it a proper go
books,not_removed,i know the pain
books,not_removed,but how can one objectively say what is right or wrong if there is no higher agrees upon standard or even if there is so what if something is agreedupon so what if god exists and he thinks a certain way i dont think its even possible for objective morality to exist
books,not_removed,theres logic reason etc the golden rule is do unto others as you would have them unto you it relies on the logic and reasoning that if you wouldnt want to be treated that way then you shouldnt treat someone else that way its a great example because it doesnt tell us what to do but why in other words we should act in a way that we know is right and good not in a way that we are told the fighters in isis have been told what is good and what is evil they arent using logic or reason they arent even thinking for themselves they have clergy figures of moral authority telling them and they arent using their own intelligence to recognize that they are wrong
books,not_removed,sorry but no thats not the case nihilism rejects the idea of objective meaning but leaves the door open for subjective meaning
books,not_removed,existentialism and nihilism are not mutually exclusive when most knowledgable people talk about nihilism theyre talking about existential nihilism
books,not_removed,that is completely irrelevant to the point im making anyways im hardly healthy depression and anxiety have screwed over my life normal happy people wouldnt understand the complexities of living with depression do enough lsd and it becomes ingrained into your brain anyways you dont seem to understand philosophical thinking do you not everything must have a societally based purpose i dont know how you arent understanding my point i cannot present it in any clearer a manner than saying philosophical ideas do not need to have a functional society in mind
books,not_removed,haha good point the data would be unreliable maybe we should be surveying the psychologists families or childhood friends or something
books,not_removed,gotcha i didnt take any psycho courses in university but im an engineer and ive read the wiki pages on most of the subjects and i would say that i have about as good of an understanding of the field as any undergrad actually probably more due to the heightened level of logic thats required to complete my degree i disproved freud when i was

books,not_removed,oh i was just pointing out what the first sentence of the other persons post was but i see that youve edited that part out
books,not_removed,xra below has given an excellent explanation of why your assumption is wrong but ill take another stab what youre saying is the equivalent of describing the point of mathematics as being learning to draw numbers edit so saying that the point of philosophy is to teach critical thinking is to say that once someone has mastered critical thinking philosophy ceases to have any further purpose
books,not_removed,dae anything not hard science isnt worth discussing
books,not_removed,as a dual major in philosophy and a hard stem field you remind me of the pompous fuckers littering my science classes who failed to realize that by dismissing structured philosophical traditions as useless they were themselves doing philosophy western philosophy at least has solved quite a few problems including ironically a formalization of what circular bullshit entails funnily again semantics is also one of many fields to have budded off from philosophy like physics linguistics psychology computer science etc and triple funnily your iteration of the cliche of an engineerish person naively articulating a preexisting philosophical idea is especially entertaining because you essentially just glibly restated currents within existentialism as if it were an original thought philosophy haters are like people who say seinfeld isnt funny they dont realize that the reason seinfeld doesnt seem original to them is because damnnear everything that came after either spunoff aspects of it or incorporated its overall tone
books,not_removed,it is called a discussion philosphy people are doing what philosphy entails
books,not_removed,that sounds like that creationism vs evolution argument about finding a pocket watch on the beach but applied in reverse and out of context wow a lot of different government have formed on their owned and etched out an existence for themselves but i dont see any stop to the praise for the thoughtful considerationcrafting put into the magna carta the declaration of independence etc indiscriminate use of resources will not bring our civilization to a be a httpsenwikipediaorgwikikardashevscalecurrentstatusofhumancivilization any sooner nature seems to balance itself out well enough sloth is a road that leads to ruin
books,not_removed,argument and structure cant stop existing logic critical thinking and argument arent something that can disappear its like asserting that causality could be switched off i feel like the underlying issue here is your understanding of philosophys role in knowledge generation theres a good reason that many lawyers and scientists take a lot of philosophy courses but if you are still convinced that philosophy offers nothing and could simply not exist post it to rphilosophy im no philosophy expert im just a scientist
books,not_removed,i think this is the same vein as why i dont need feminism the idea seems to be somebody already did all the thinking for me so i dont have to do any now its pointless
books,not_removed,philosophy is extremely important many successful people live their lives according to certain philosophies that they learned about by studying well philosophy go listen to marcus aurelius or any other great philosopher if you listen well itll change at least one area of your life if not several math and science are powerful but dont underestimate how much philosophy can change an individuals or societys behavior
books,not_removed,philosophy seems like one of those things thatll continue no matter what as long as people ask questions and seek answers i think philosophy will endure
books,not_removed,philosophy is to the brain what the theory of computation is to computers
books,not_removed,i just want you to knowmathematicians and philosophers consider their respective fields to be a subset of the other sometimes viceversa philosophy is an integral part of many fundamental machinations of our civilization any pioneering field brushes against computer science or delves user design coordinating effective ngo operations into philosophy thinking and expressing thoughts effectively is a first step in the fundamentals of the study of philosophy and to express it simply these fundamentals are the key to people being smart some people chance upon these fundamentals from others or reinvent them on their own and write books about them that people read and praise for being smart in the fields of ethics economics politics etc but its really sad that such discoveries are repeatedly being rediscovered because people dont bother to pick up philosophy it is said so often that the first step in becoming wise is admitting ones ignorance because this hurdle causes people to stop talking all the time and introspect and some become lost in this introspection and never talk again because they never run out of things to admit that they were previously ignorant about dont let this scare you but be prepared to reject your initial second third and position on things throughout life as you grow an ever stronger foundation for reasoning this is the ancient beginnings of the study of philosophy
books,not_removed,huh welp i dont agree with your understanding but its an interesting point of view thanks for sharing
books,not_removed,i might have had a hard time putting into words the argument for why people cant change or be fulfilled without philosophical thinking but your viewpoints prove exactly how misguided people are without it critical thinking problem identification and solving are at heart philosophical questions because theyre exactly that questions questions of survival are only the evolutionary decisions made by any animal species questions of living are different instincts are not the same as morals either the instinct to not kill a family member unless it ensures the survival of a greater portion of the family is not a question of morals but again a question of survival everything you are describing is indeed a scientific problem but in being a scientific problem it avoids a multitude of questions that are essential to how people with our sorts of consciousness can live fulfilled good lives to not ask them necessarily means that your life wont be as fulfilled or good now at a societal level the cultural advancements youre mentioning havent even happened sure there is a difference in laws between and now thats politics at work for you but clearly what the present times show is that there has not been an advancement in acceptance and understanding the only progress weve made is because of a generation dying and another being born so we forget but if you havent noticed the abundance of signs to show that no ideological advancement has been made then you likely will never see asking why do we hate black people is precisely the question we are not asking that will allow us to resolve it without philosophy you dont know what questions to ask without knowing what questions to ask you will always arrive at the wrong answer and with the wrong answers you will never change anything i dont care if you solve cancer the life someone leads after theyve been cured of cancer will be the same as before and that is the point youre missing
books,not_removed,youre talking around the point any time any of what you just described is analyzed or really just articulated on a conceptual rather than subconscious darwinian level that allows for reflection and thus noninstinctual reasoned approaches to matters of the human condition in this case bonding instincts and tribal norm policing giving rise to plato on society and justiceethics and the ability to reverse engineer things with eyes open
books,not_removed,jon kabat zinn mindfulness guru has been a great help in tough times of my life also therapy exercise proper sleep and good nutrition strong mental health takes more work for me than i could have imagined but the hard work pays off in so many ways
books,not_removed,haha there are varieties of nihilism qua existentialism some existentialists acknowledge nihilism as a problem to be solved a diagnosis of a condition but its not universally binding insofar as it is an actual attitude adopted by some existentialists its more of a commentary on contingent attitudes regarding meaning based on question begging beliefs about god and truth if an existentialist wants to push the definition of nihilism past this observation then id argue they are wrong
books,not_removed,socrates and i disagree with that last sentence
books,not_removed,nope not at all you have missed the point your critical thinking skills are always being honed there is no point at which it ceases to have any further purpose
books,not_removed,as someone who did a comp sci degree i love this ultimately i think the problem is that engineers are very good at focusing on details but they often miss the big picture where philosophy tends to be most relevant personally i find philosophy useful in understanding different types of people im of the opinion that understanding the motivations and desires of others and their roots in culture and philosophy are as pragmatic and logical as engineering
books,not_removed,thanks there is such a marked difference isnt there its just hard knowing how to keep it going thanks for the reply will look at jon kabat zin
books,not_removed,nietzsche was an existentialist so was kierkegaard youd be hard pushed to find two more diametrically opposed figures in popular philosophy the term existentialists is so broad as to be all but meaningless it encompasses a great many schools of thought both nihilistic and otherwise
books,not_removed,youre still arguing around your own point im not debating that critical thinking isnt crucial to philosophy but your claim was that philosophy was about critical thinking and not for instance and using your example about how the mind works clearly theories of mind are very much the stuff of philosophy so youre wrong on your original point but youre also confusing the tools of philosophy critical thinking with the objects of philosophical inquiry to say that inquiries into metaphysics and ethics hone critical thinking skills is not wrong but to say again returning to your original point that the reason for those inquiries is primarily to hone critical thinking skills is to say that the subjects of philosophical inquiry are not what philosophy is about i suspect that we have reached an impasse already however and if the explanation from xra which was far superior to my own longwinded exegesis hasnt clarified why youre in error then i dont suspect im going to offer any more illumination
books,not_removed,or how about this you have a class called critical thinking by your original statement that class does exactly what philosophy does and is about exactly what you claim philosophy is about so in a university that offers critical thinking is there any need for philosophy
books,not_removed,i think this discussion has digressed a little i just went to straighten this out are you somehow advocating against the usefulness of philosophy either to society as a whole or in everyday life
books,not_removed,and i wouldnt classify either sk or nietzsche as nihilists they both certainly saw something like nihilism as a threat to living a meaningful life but they didnt endorse it nietzsche was largely responding to the nihilistic implications of judeochristian views sartre is perhaps the closest to a nihilist given his remarks about existence and essence but i think his view is self defeating and certainly at odds with the likes of nietzsche the true nihilist has to believe that existence is meaningless because theres no external source of meaning but thats really just question begging ie one is assuming that meaning must come from an external source nietzsche realizing that this was going to be the european response to the death of god outlined the importance of meaning creation but not assenting to the truth of nihilism rather it was a corrective to the inevitable nihilism that was derived from a faulty premise about meaning
books,not_removed,xra seemed to go off on some weird tangent about me denying the philosophy of mind problem which isnt the case and i am not sure how to address he made a lot of assumptions that ill assume were generated by my terseness and brevity which made it hard to unpack i guess i should have clarified being taught those courses in school hones the critical thinking via instruction and feedback from your professor practice makes perfect and all that jazz
books,not_removed,i guess i good analogy would be advances in biological understanding of how our bodies feel pain just because we know now that when one is slapped in the face its our nerve synapses producing a chemical reaction that sends a message to our brains inducing a feeling of pain doesnt add or detract anything from the question is it wrong to slap someone in the face when we have know for millenia that such an action produces pain the mechanisms of how we feel that pain is irrelevant its the cause and effect we are concerned with
books,not_removed,just because that is the title of the class doesnt mean its the end all of critical thinking its obviously just an introduction to the endeavor just like ethics isnt the end all of ethical study there are obviously higher courses on the subject eg ethics metaethics etc and i would go so far as to claim that requiring critical thinking as a prerequisite to taking further courses in philosophy would help to reenforce my point
books,not_removed,of course you wouldnt classify kierkegaard as a nihilist hed be the last philosopher youd associate with that label nietzsche on the other hand would probably be the first although i agree that it wouldnt be entirely correct to classify him as a nihilist per se while satres being and nothingness obviously deals with nihilist ideas ie the titular nothingness the precedence of existence over essence is not the point that id pick out to make that point im not entirely clear what you mean about his views being self defeating or at odds with nietzsche because of course they are theyre wildly different and you lose me a bit with your definition of a true nihilist im not sure how the denial of objective meaning necessarily constitutes question begging
books,not_removed,i apologize for my lack of clarity and i cant promise it will get any better i would define a true nihilist as one who believes that life is devoid of meaning and that this is an ontological claim about human existence i think sartre plays dangerously close to that idea but i havent read his work in a long time so i cant say for sure the question begging arises from the assumption that existence is meaningless because theres no external source of meaning this claim presumes by way of an undefended assumption that existence must have meaning defined by some outside source further that this lack of external meaning is somehow troubling or results in absurdity is similarly problematic since it also assumes again that an objective meaning would somehow resolve this issue the nihilism that i think is more reasonable and what nietzsche espouses is a contingent historical condition it could be the case that a society existed and never found itself in this predicament this in my mind is a really weak form of nihilism since its all a matter of confusion about meaning
books,not_removed,it may be that i am misunderstanding you but your argument about the question begging still makes no sense to me to say existence is meaningless because theres no external source of meaning presumes nothing about the necessity of meaning it just says the same thing twice sartre certainly would reject the argument that existence must have objective meaning indeed one of the principle arguments put forward in being and nothingness is that the opposite is the case i see no issue with simply stating that objective meaning does not exist and is in no way required however comforting an illusion it may be to put it another way meaning is imprinted upon our own existences by ourselves but any impression that we may have that meaning somehow exists apart from us is a false one that is the titular nothingness of which sartre writes just to touch upon another point absurdity doesnt result directly from the absence of objective meaning in existence which any self respecting nihilist would hold to be selfevident rather it stems from the willingness of the aware man to forge ahead in spite of it if youve not read it i cannot recommend the myth of sisyphus by albert camus highly enough for defining the nature of the absurd it is a wonderful book further to that i must say that i cant make sense of your last paragraph apologies these are in fairness difficult conversations to have in this format i mainly come to reddit for the funny cat pictures
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,i did i had to know my enemy
books,not_removed,yup read most of them its fast and enjoyable escapism rather like fast and the furious movies the thing is there have been lots of not wellregarded books especially for teenagers in the past only we now have social media and its the information age so every popular thing and trend gets overhyped and receives way too much attention fear street and vc andrews books are the twilight comparables from the im certain they have counterparts from the previous decades too and let me tell you if my mother knew how pervy and outright incestuous some vc andrews books were i would have gotten a lot of flak
books,not_removed,yep read them so fast my best friend and i waited for the breaking dawn release and only allowed ourselves to read chapters a day so it wouldnt be over so fast hahah i was obsessed too it didnt have a lot of depth but it was incredibly entertaining
books,not_removed,oh yeah üòÖ i read the four books in the space of about a week or two for me the writing was super easy to read and in fact i think the pace at which i read the books helped me to block out the details and errors of the writing where it technically wasnt fantastic i just got lost in the world and for that sheer fluff it was a very fun experience
books,not_removed,nah my sister bought me the book before they became popular im cringing at how hipster that sounds but i couldnt get into it because i dont care much for vampires shrug
books,not_removed,i read the first one admittedly i mostly read it so that i could understand and justify the criticisms of it but it wasnt for meit was very easy and quick and bella seems to have been written to be an everygirl character which can be very enticing but again not for me
books,not_removed,honestly it was the same with shades i found myself cringing during the awkward writings or would notice the instant chemistry that would literally never happen like anastasia steele tripping and billionaire christian thinking it was so hot or when bella was just so average but edward cullen was obsessed with her anyways but i read the books so fast and i still enjoyed them and its just like candy or dessert its okay to have it every now and then right edit and when edward broke the bed while having sex with bella im starting to laugh right now thinking about it all
books,not_removed,i havent read the books only around pages of the first one amazon inside look because i believe you should never judge something without at least trying it first i disliked it mainly cause the characters were annoying and im not exactly in the target audience of it althought i must say i thought the writing style wasnt that bad for ya standards you should not be ashamed for liking it every piece of art may it be literature movies games or whatever has a place in this world as long as something makes someone out there happy it has its purpose fulfilled and no one can say anything against that
books,not_removed,i liked them a lot and read all of them in a span of two weeks or so i didnt view them in a negative light for a long long time the first time i got an inkling about the hate most of the world harbours for the series is when i was in a book club meeting and talking to a person i met there i mentioned i had read them and the guy asked me what i thought of them i being very much in love with the series gushed about how good i found them he gave me an incredulous look and proceeded to tear me a new one citing all the things wrong with the series i looked online and found about all the things wrong with the books slowly i became ashamed that i had even read them let alone been a fan of the series anyway ive moved on but sometimes i think about how i abandoned a sinking ship and what does that say about me
books,not_removed,nope got halfway through the first book put it down and never picked it up again it wasnt the writing it wasnt the improbable instalove it was the normalizing and romantacizing of abuse
books,not_removed,i hate read them i realize that may have been an incredible waste of time but i wanted to be educated on the story when i ranted about the problems i had with it
books,not_removed,i loved one and three when i was a teen while i got the angst in book even at i thought it was unrealistic and unhealthy unfortunately book came out when i was almost so im not sure if i didnt enjoy it because it was bad or just because id outgrown them by then i tried rereading them as an adult and they havent aged well
books,not_removed,it wasnt an obsession but i did read them you can criticize the content quite a bit but the technical side to her writing is actually very very very good its why the books are so successful they flow easily and communicate well
books,not_removed,i read twilight got halfway through new moon before i got bored the first was entertaining enough yeah there were cringey bits but overall it was okay i remember there being a really wellwritten passage when bella and edward enter a meadow i believe it was posted in a good writing in bad books thread
books,not_removed,i was never a huge twilight fan but i did read all the books the books are thick but really quick reads and engaging the second to last movie was just awful
books,not_removed,i read the first three there was so much hype around them good and bad and i thought hey ill check em out while i was able to make it through the first three and even decided to check out the book i just could not make it through the one i got partway through it and just couldnt continue reading it i ended up just reading a scathing review of it that included a full synopsis so i knew how it ended and that i hadnt missed much by not finishing it
books,not_removed,first i dont like twilight but i wouldnt say that the series has no value you cant do everything wrong and still sell all those copies the writing is bad the plot is trite the worldbuilding is laughable the characters are bidimensional so whats left its simple no i mean the book is simple and simple is good sometimes the maincharacter is a loser but two hot guys are in love with her a good guy and a badbuthesgoodinside guy the love is simple pure no complicated feelings im the first to say that its unrealistic and its heavy on sexism but yes theres a but the first love usually is like that the first love is awkward you dont know much about sex youre even scared from it you love your partner you love him so much you dont know why but it feels so important to love him of course later you understand that you didnt love him and probably he wasnt so cool and you didnt know the first thing about love but still you tried hard its not surprising that the author is a mormon and probably she didnt have sex until marriage she poured lots of repressed feelings in that book but she also nailed how a years old girl feels and the the fact that the main character goes to highschool is just a bonus
books,not_removed,absolutely my friend lent me the first one and oh my lord i tore through it one night this was before the days of everyone texting or having cell phones so i couldnt even contact her to bring the next books the next day i had to wait over hours for her to lend me the rest of the series and it was the longest ive ever waited in my life i raced through the entire series in like a week i went through the typical ewww twilight sucks haha phase like everyone did around years ago then i grew up lol in retrospect i realize that while the books obviously have their flaws theyre not anywhere near as atrocious as people claim them to be ive definitely read far worse ya many of which are generic dystopian novels whose plots can all be summed up by the twitter parody account dystopianya for all its flaws at least the twilight saga tried to do something different and i will give credit where credit is due it got young people reading we all have those series which are the gateway to reading and while mine was hp i know it was twilight for thousands of people and we cant undermine how important that is as for now i have no problem admitting that twilight is entertaining fluff which isnt a crime to indulge in lol
books,not_removed,read the first one when i was and only because i knew i would hate it and my best friends grandma bought the series and would only give them to me if i agreed to read them i read most of it while working at my first job whenever it was slow not only was the writing god awful but i just couldnt like the story i might still have the other two books but the first one was definitely not my this so i will probably never finish edit also laughing at teenage self because i was way more into gay fanfiction than the completely unrealistic love stories that others were into at the time though i did try to get into the ya section and a few stories jumped out at me and i did like some of relationships twilight was just plain uninteresting to me i like those relatable charactersüòâ
books,not_removed,i always compare my experience with the twilight books to a grocery store sheet cake i read all four in a week on vacation i couldnt stop like you eat a huge piece of that cake with the nasty crisco frosting and you cant stop but afterward you feel like you are going to throw up and think about all the horrible stuff that was in it i read it in my so the a going to high school instead of a college who would do that and instantly falling in love with a girl really squicked me out and b the reason jacob was so drawn to her i also found out after reading it that the author was is mormon so the whole abstinence thing made a lot more sense anyway i later found the series that i wished twilight had been elizabeth hunters elemental mysteries series
books,not_removed,i read the first book and i hated it but i was about when i read it i remember thinking as i was reading it that this is exactly the sort of thing i would have loved if i were a teenager again i can easily see why they were so popular among younger readers
books,not_removed,i loved them too until breaking dawn came out i was rereading them all the time breaking dawn pulled me out of my addiction because i couldnt stand what happened bella was such an easy character to relate to i also read a lot of hard sci fi and fantasy at the time and most of the star wars eu it was a very different genre for me and unlike anything ive really picked up again
books,not_removed,no but i watched the entire film series with my girlfriend while we were both feverish with the flu and hopped up on meds it was great
books,not_removed,i wasnt obsessed with twilight by any stretch of the imagination but i did fly through them especially the first one and to be honest i did enjoy the first oneit was the sort of book i put in my guilty pleasure category not a whole lot of substance but entertaining the rest of the series i read more out of a sense of obligation though if im entirely honest i did want to read them but was using the sense of obligation to finish as an excuse lol i didnt enjoy them as much as the first one for a variety of reasons but they were still quick albeit problematic reads and didnt make me feel like id entirely wasted my time
books,not_removed,i was a teen during their release so the hype was there and i wanted to see what it was about did not like them but i wanted to back up my arguments about why i found bella so annoying and edward so troublesome that i just read the other books except the last one ive heard the host is better so im actually looking forward to reading that one some day dont feel bad about liking junk or serieseveryone has their guilty pleasures for me its the sweet valley series
books,not_removed,guilty pleasure
books,not_removed,i was the target demographic when i read it at they were very addicting reads so ill give the series points in that regard i found the first book to be average and had the series stopped there id think it wouldve been better for it i was uncomfortable with the second novels imho poor handle of bellas depression book three had some interesting tidbits on backstory and four was so incredibly full of wtfery that i couldnt finish it
books,not_removed,i read the first two and even as a teen the angst and like pages of just month names pissed me off and was too much so i stopped i wasnt interested i skimmed at the library the last two when i got a bit older and it was very ridiculous
books,not_removed,okay first off the handle martianpotatoes is awesome i read breaking dawn in one sitting staying up all night unable to put it down not because it was great but because it was so all over the place it fascinated me the roller coaster nature of it all i had come to twilight a bit late this was the first book of them that i bought the week it came out theres nothing wrong with being obsessed with a story not at all anyone who tells you differently is conveniently forgetting a story that they themselves feel that way about but wont admit
books,not_removed,never read the books in my communityfriends it was incredibly shameful to even admit you liked it i watched the first movie to make fun of it but liked it i told everybody i liked it i watch the whole series every december now its just so entertaining i like their universe yeah its not deep but the story is romantic and its a good escape why reject it i am not interested in reading the books but i just might
books,not_removed,nope youre the only one
books,not_removed,i read pages of new moon because my sister and a few classmates kept talking about it just couldnt care for it but i was in the grade at that point and discovering my own literary taste
books,not_removed,it was your enemy before you even read it bro you cant live like that
books,not_removed,i agree with you there they were very easy to read and the type of writing would bore me today with its plain descriptions and style but back then it was just easy and i did not care i dont even know how i learned of the books but i know i had never hear of them online or tv i think i might of just grabbed one at the library by luck and i say by luck because every book after the first one i was on a waiting list for almost a month until i received the box set for my birthday
books,not_removed,so entertaining my family lives in washington and i was born there but grew up in california but visit often i still quietly freak out inside when we drive through forks my mom was looking for a house in port angelas awhile ago and i was in heaven walking around there i ate at the same italian restaurant they ate at went to the bookstore bella went to and then drove to la push beach üòÇ it was just like the book everything was there
books,not_removed,this is exactly it they are very entertaining not every book has to be shakespeare i love reading all kinds of genres as well ill even admit that i reread the twilight books on occasion when im in the mood for something quick and fun
books,not_removed,im not a vampire fan never have been interesting history with them and all but fictional nah for me it had nothing to really do with vampires though it was the love story that teenage me was obsessed with
books,not_removed,yeah i totally understood why i was in love with the books so many young girls were like bella you can relate put yourself in her shoesand then get swept out of them something special happened to her people wanted to be her and thats why they were so popular
books,not_removed,i read them in my book was objectively much worse
books,not_removed,definitely dont age well im with you on that one
books,not_removed,it is interesting to hear from older people that read them as a teenager i could tell that it wasnt right but still didnt realize how correct i was in that feeling you dont know that it is wrong at that age now that im older i can see what a messed up relationshipstory it was i still absolutely love it but yeahmessed up also i had not known stephenie meyer was a mormon until this postit just made sense to me since edward was of that abstinence until marriage era
books,not_removed,since i was obsessed as a teenager i told my mother to read them she was probably mid and she totally loved them and read each one but i know if i was to pick them up now having never read them before i wouldnt be into them the writing style is not my thing anymorebut at the same time they contributed a lot to my love for reading it was the first thing that showed me that reading could be amazing and not a chore i dont think i would of read nearly as much if it wasnt for those books putting me on the reading track
books,not_removed,i loved them all never reread them though i do think i read breaking dawn slower than the others simply because it was the final book and i knew there wasnt going to be another after i was done with that one but i did love how the story ended though although a little creepy
books,not_removed,well at least you gave them a shot which i respect i feel that most people view them often with disgust having never even read a page or have total obsession with every word so i really appreciate when someone doesnt follow either of those masses and just does what they want
books,not_removed,well you would have to start with the first one or else it wont make sense although i do think your age was a factor most people i know were
books,not_removed,i completely agree with you why are you being downvoted
books,not_removed,this topic is covered by our faq
books,not_removed,reading is not only about intellect its also about imagination and emotion it takes practice its also not about how long the book is but whether or not you can get immersed in the story or empathize with the characters something has to hook you and then pull you through to the end a book youre really into will grab you and next thing you know its over even if it has pages start with simple but fun books ones that are more about action or characters nothing that requires deep concentration or complex language skills read a few thrillers or good ya stories or books where youve already seen the movie version these are good because you dont have to focus on the story so much since you already know the basic plot you have to lose the conscious act of reading and the only way i know of to do that is just practice with fun and easy stuff until it becomes second nature
books,not_removed,i honestly dont see the hype around finishing a book in one sitting there is nothing wrong with you for not finishing a book in a set time you should just read at the pace your comfortable with if you try to force yourself to do something it might have try he effect of pushing you away or becoming burned out
books,not_removed,i take it you are reading novels also i just want to say that language skills reading writing speaking etc is way different than math skills its very common to have one and not the other the thing with a book is that i kind of feel like you shouldnt have to force yourself to keep sitting there to read if its a really good book it can be hard to not read it a few years ago i was so heavily into a novel that i was literally sneaking off into corners at my workplace to sneak in a read i did that until i was done with the book as i just had to know what the characters were doing and saying it certainly wasnt work and i didnt have to try to do it i wanted to once you get more comfortable with reading and comprehending what you are reading with little struggle you can then move on to books that maybe dont immediately grab you but you should definitely start with something that is interesting to you for instance with movies we dont first watch citizen kane you might first watch disney cartoons and even as you get older you progress to action movies and things that immediately grab you its the same with books
books,not_removed,man i used to be the type to read a book in one sitting until a bad case of depression kicked in and just made me lose interest in everything slowly as i started to recover i found that it was easier to just start with one page two pages a day and slowly work up its important to be forgiving and not exert that much pressure on yourself take it slow one step at a time soon youll sprint
books,not_removed,i would say that you find books that really interest you first i developed my reading habit by reading game of thrones pig farm all great books that you can easily read not because you need to read them but because you genuinely enjoy and want to finish and also switching to audiobooks did wonders for me i dont know when i last managed to read a book traditional way but im devouring audiobooks especially when it comes to listening to something like the first law series now as other commenter said sure if you suffer from depression and nothing interests you than its a different ball game
books,not_removed,handcuffs and a safe word
books,not_removed,dont worry about reading a book in one sitting work on reading daily even if for short periods of time you can also gamify the process set a goal of books or pages to read in a year or month or whatever works for you figure out what you would need to do a day and then do a little more than required
books,not_removed,after a certain point just take a break for a few daysweeks and when i come back to the book i end up rereading a lot of what i read the previous day if you forget what you read a few weeks ago thats pretty normal you could probably help that by taking notes or reading more regularly if youre forgetting by the next day thats different my best guess is that youre either tuning out while you read or pushing yourself to read faster so that youre basically skimming as for the title question reading a book in one sitting is mostly a matter of having lots of free time even a fast reader would need hours to read an average length book
books,not_removed,for me it mostly has to do with ease of the language time and interest in the novel i dont think id ever be able to read something like years of solitude in one sitting but recently i read never let me go im one sitting im a teacher on christmas break so i have time to read a book in a sitting never let me go has great characters and is a wonderful but terribly sad story however while it is a wonderful read it doesnt have difficult or flowery language and the plot is pretty straight forward thus being a great book for one sitting find something to fall into
books,not_removed,one sitting is bad if you are reading doing something physical helps every minutes just light up your imaginary air guitar or silly walks for a minute then return to the book keeping your mind playful is important and physical creativity resets a lot of boredom
books,not_removed,there is a saying that paper is more patient than man unless you have some required reading to do i dont see the importance of reading faster or through a book in one sitting i have other hobbies and things to do as well no one is going to be impressed by it and i can promise you that no matter how fast you read and how long you may live youll never read everything you may have wanted also and that was the case for me once or twice ask yourself am i really enjoying this enough to go on reading
books,not_removed,how fast do you read if you read fast enough with short enough books you can get done in one sitting if its a struggle to get through pages of course youre going to be tired of it if you had good reading comprehension skills to begin with and practiced then youd probably be cranking through books but thats still not going to help there are enough words published every year that you cant read them all in your lifetime much less the classics and the things yet to be written if you apply sturgeons law to the problem and say or even are not crap and that only are ontopics you might be interested in theres still enough written each year to occupy you for that year so youre never going to catch up on everything you might want to read youre going to have to make choices if something doesnt grab you doesnt compel you to read it then whyre you wasting the portion of your life to read it youre forgoing your opportunity to read something that does grab you if its an issue with a poor memory well sometimes that happens not everyone remembers everything but look at memory things instead of reading things
books,not_removed,i love doing this d i generally buy food on saturday with an extra new box of tea or coffee because everything is closed on sunday and pick out a book that isnt a high level some of the book are comicbooks like fun house or just books like harry potter i think my mind would die trying to marathon a henry james book just something easier than you would normally spend your time reading a tale for the time being was one i read in one sitting afterwards i feel like my mind is numb so i go for a walk outside to set things back to normal i generally take breaks for food or getting drinks also i never plan to sit down and read a book in one sitting it just kind of happens have fun d
books,not_removed,have you considered that the books you are reading do not interest you enough if you struggle to continue it might be just the book itself you mention kindle maybe try to read in paper version and in solitude setting phone and other internet devices turned off no other person in room good but not too strong lighting etc
books,not_removed,when i was in grademiddle school we had a competition where you read books within months and then competed in trivia that helped reading more will get you longer sittings if you start at minutes you will gradually improve to min an hour or awhole book its easier if you like the book though relate to it
books,not_removed,i used to have trouble sitting still and reading for very long since discovering marijuana i have no trouble sitting in one spot for hours and digesting an entire book
books,not_removed,i feel like the first chapter has to draw me in to make me want to finish a book ive done so on quite a few cats cradle good omens ready player one all great books that drew me in right away i would have finished american gods in one sitting but i wanted to take my time with it due to the adventure it took me on reading a chapter or three a day and reading until you fall asleep at night is a great approach though
books,not_removed,to further your point what really helped me was when a friend told me that he will cast each character so instead of try to picture the person being described and having to hold onto that ill read the description and thing what actor i already know that fits that description at least for me it makes building the scene in my head a lot easier the easiest example is the martian because i watched the movie before i read the book
books,not_removed,what book was so engrossing just curious
books,not_removed,let the right one in by john ajvide lindqvist
books,not_removed,martian chronicles also a couple of his short stories were made in to twilight zone episodes i sing the body electric was one so you could use that angle as well

books,not_removed,the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy
books,not_removed,i guess youre talking about one two three infinity i just googled it the synopsis says theories of mathematics and science explained at a middle school level that sounds really great ill see if i can find it on kindle
books,not_removed,one two three infinity look at the mr tompkins books
books,not_removed,not just that one though check the other ones too the titles are sometimes misleading if you have access to a physical library try to read a few pages of each
books,not_removed,of course you cant show off ebooks and audio books to visiors you cant lend good ebooks and audio books except for cds to friends the only time i get to show off my audible library is when i meet another audio reader
books,not_removed,at first i wasnt sure about ereaders but when i saw how many classics are in public domain i decided to get one and like it that said i recall buying only one non public domain book in eform all the rest have been still been printed even though i have books taking up a lot of space
books,not_removed,this study appears to be a survey that doesnt support any more conclusions than the share of americans who have read a book in the last year is largely unchanged since more americans read print books than either read ebooks or listen to audio books
books,not_removed,i imagine its the smell nothing smells better
books,not_removed,maybe if ebook licencing wasnt such a rip off they would be more popular said the bitter librarian who purchases ebooks in bulk
books,not_removed,audiobooks are great for a busy lifestyle ebooks are great for travelling on vacation or reading on bus commutes and such nothing really takes away the feeling of sitting down and reading a physical book at least not for me def the preferred way to get a story even though im usually audiobooking these days
books,not_removed,old school cool
books,not_removed,i cant read ebooks without getting bored for some reason
books,not_removed,i prefer print books because i love coming home to walls filled with bookcases overflowing with books
books,not_removed,ive found a healthy balance between the two but i find myself perusing bookstores more and double buying ebooks ive already purchased
books,not_removed,but have you heard about how found that reading books makes you smarter wealthier and a better lover
books,not_removed,my kindle is small fits in my bag and lets me read classics for free id love a bookshelf but i move a lot and rarely ever even have room for one
books,not_removed,you cant lend good ebooks and audio books except for cds to friends i thought you were wrong and i almost said it but then i remember that too many people make the mistake of supporting stores that sells ebooks with drm the powers to be in rbooks only allows me to suggest stores that sells drmfree ebooks rather than other alternatives and heres some of them httpswwwdefectivebydesignorgguideebooks though there are many others
books,not_removed,because this thread is full of my reading preference is better than your reading preference can we just like books in any format
books,not_removed,seriously whats wrong with a physical book
books,not_removed,id say that if your books smell then you have a problem
books,not_removed,agreed
books,not_removed,compared to the price of physical books at the bookstore i find ebooks to be a bargain unless i am buying a used paperback that seems to be the only option that is cheaper than ebooks
books,not_removed,i am wondering the same thing does the seeming turnaround have more to do with actual preferences or with the weird way ebooks are suddenly frequently more expensive than physical books and i buy mostly physical books because i read mostly nonfiction and need better cross referencing than ebooks support
books,not_removed,i feel the exact same way
books,not_removed,what are you getting bored of
books,not_removed,i enjoy reading ebooks but those restrictions on sharing severely limit what ill pay for an ebook an ebook that i cant freely share because of drm is about equal in value to a massmarket paperback that i cant freely share because itll fall apart to be clear im not advocating piracy id rather wait for a sale get it from the library or just not participate
books,not_removed,there are limited selections of ebooks and its a much bigger problem with audio books have to go to piracy and if it becomes too much of a threat theyll pass a law making the drm free publishers pay fines for not using drm or some such shit i have very little faith in basic humanity when money is involved
books,not_removed,what you cant mention amazoncom on rbooks bullshit
books,not_removed,none of my books have noses i must be doing it wrong
books,not_removed,im just hoping that with articles like these ebook publishers will start worrying that they will lose business if the market loses interest personally i tried ebooks and like you i will usually buy the physical book for most things i just like them better
books,not_removed,im not sure why but i cant pay attention while reading an ebook but i can while reading a printed book
books,not_removed,staring at a screen
books,not_removed,there are limited selections of ebooks and its a much bigger problem with audio books indeed drm free publishers dont have enough buck to match the ammount of marketing that estabilished publishers invest in it as most of them have less than years old but one thing i can say is that by supporting them youll help future writers to choose the selfpublishing route
books,not_removed,you gotta stop thinking youre reading an ebook just focus on the story
books,not_removed,opposed to staring at a piece of paper because eink screens are great
books,not_removed,but you can lend books with kindle they have a book lending program
books,not_removed,i dont have anything against ebooks and just discovered that hating ebooks is a thing maybe i should adjust the lighting
books,not_removed,sure try adjusting the lighting whatever works
books,not_removed,this ama is taking place in rstevenaveryisguilty please follow the link provided above
books,not_removed,i may wonder what im missing in the translation but theres a good chance that most of the goodbad of the original work made it through intact maybe you should try to find some material on the works in question such as how the translator approaches their projects or what they felt were the respective difficulties some translators are lucky enough to have lines of communication open with the original author which can help them tackle certain challenges
books,not_removed,arturo perezreverte was the first spanish author whose novels i read i went through three of his books in a fairly short time frame and loved two but the third felt off for me for some reason i discovered that one translator had done the two books i really enjoyed and a different translator had done the one that didnt sit right with me thats when i realized just how important the translator can be
books,not_removed,i have read years of solitude in both english and spanish and nearly all of nerudas poems in both languages years of solitude to me doesnt really matter if you read it in one or the other because its quite a difficult read either way there were snippetsquotes that i remember liking better in spanish for example a particular pun didnt have to be explained in the original spanish but had to be explained in english which ruins the joke however reading it first in spanish and then two years later in english helped me understand it better and gave me a confidence boost in my spanish reading skills as spanish is not my native language however nearly all of nerudas poems are better in the original spanish they get translated well and have basically the same meaning in both buti dont know how to explain it i could just be romanticizing the otherness or foreigness of spanish but i just like reading his poems out loud in the original better
books,not_removed,im from relatively small country and english is my third language so ive read and still read translations a lot i feel quite positive about them usually i try to read books in original but occasionally i read translated works too i believe important thing for translated work is that translator should not try to rewrite the book but just translate it imo puns etc should not be explained in text but can be explained in footnotes the same with cultural stuff if it is important for understanding it can be explained in footnote but otherwise translator shouldnt add or remove anything from the text regarding murakami ive read his books in three languages and in all cases his books had the same general feel roughly the same prose style etc i think i prefer murakami in english his works flow very well in english but i guess particular language is not that important i dont know japanese so in any case itll be translation
books,not_removed,any russian translation by the great bernard guilbert guerney nabokovs favorite translator and largely out of print today but used copies are still available
books,not_removed,yeah i think ive read some stuff about the person who translated the murakami book but ill have to look more extensively hopefully theres a good amount of material for this type of thing like ive read some stuff about murakami translations here but it was always without a source
books,not_removed,thats interesting how you can tell them apart so easily i guess translations are also a subjective thing
books,not_removed,weird i wouldve thought that certain nuances would be lost in the translation from spanish to english thereby altering the meaning just the slightest bit its reassuring that they have the same meaning though
books,not_removed,footnotes can bog down a text though theyre not always appropriate theres a translation into swedish of eugene onegin thats something like footnotes in this case its appropriate since its an important work of russian literature‚Ñ¢ and the translation reads beautifully on its own as well on the other hand there is the excellent swedish translations of the aubreymaturin books not a footnote in sight in spite of the rampant punning and age of sail jargon because those books are fun adventure novels and the fine details of the puns dont matter its the fact that jack aubrey dropped another delightfully horrible pun and everyone had a good laugh any pun will do two completely different approaches both perfectly appropriate for the text in question
books,not_removed,kind of neutral about footnotes honestly im currently reading the book thief and i noticed that they incorporate footnotelike things in the text its just like an offhand oh btw this means thats still within the story and not like refer to footnote
books,not_removed,yes i agree that footnotes are not always necessary although i do think that translator should try to modify original work as little as possible otherwise it becomes more like derived work than translation edit but of course genre of book matters too fun adventure novels can indeed be translated more freely than serious literary works
books,not_removed,yeah but was it like that in the original text if not then its text from translator and not author which could break story in some particular cases i was more thinking of footnotes that are on the same page only on the bottom so you dont have to turn pages forward and backward something like edit anyway footnotes actually are not that important not everything needs to be explained to reader right away and rarely cultural differences are that big that reader cant understand text at all without detailed explanation
books,not_removed,yeah i mean its not a translated bookprobably shouldve noted that i see those footnotes in textbooks and such but ive yet to see them in translated fictional works this is probably because i havent read too many of them according to someone who translates a lot of murakamis works commercial publishers usually dont allow these footnotes

books,not_removed,ive got a few comments on this the only way to get of your royalties vs is by putting them in kindles selectprogram which is essentially like netflix for books this isnt true the percentage of royalties is based solely on price it doesnt matter whether you enroll in select or not under ¬£‚Ç¨ and over ¬£‚Ç¨ and you will be entitled to royalties inbetween that price range and you can earn the only instance where you need to be enrolled in select to earn higher royalties is if you want to market to brazil japan mexico or india enrolling in select puts your book on kindle unlimited essentially a digital library and kindle owners lending library both of which you earn by the page turn it also allows you to access more international markets you also get days of free book promotion as well as being able to schedule countdown deals the agreement to get all this is exclusivity with amazon for a day period at the end of days if you still want to be on select you sign up for another days if you dont you dont you still get your due to repeated content guideline violations in regards to books you have submitted through your account specifically books that disappoint our customers your account has been terminated i dont think readers were quite as happy with your book as you make out quality control wise the plethora of grammatical errors and spelling strongly suggest a lack of editing save your money or gift cards and buy anything else literally not great writing and poorly edited the first story was good although it felt hastily put together and seemed like the author never read it himself i feel virtually no effort was put into ensuring the quality of this product you have a couple of suspicious reviews but importantly the verified purchases gave it one star amazon weights reviews toward verifieds nonverifieds dont have any real impact on ranking or anything if the people who actually bought the book didnt like it at all and complain then yes amazon is going to pull it if i write doo doo wars the empire sharts back is it allowed or not maybe maybe not but i dont think this was your issue you fell foul of the quality guidelines we dont accept books that provide a poor customer experience we reserve the right to determine whether content provides a poor customer experience see the guide to kindle content quality for examples of content thats typically disappointing to customers whilst i agree that the tos for sexual content is incredibly vague its fairly well known that books featuring rape scat bestiality and snuff are not going to get through but again your book wasnt pulled for that it was pulled because it was poorly written not proofread and wasnt edited you just churned out a book and hit publish with no care or attention to detail
books,not_removed,phrases you didnt expect to read for so later that year some friends come up with a little challenge for me it was to write a book of pokemon themed erotic bdsm storiesi honestly wrote most of it at dragoncon and on the way back worked on a joke cover but i knew i was onto something
books,not_removed,this didnt bother me that much but if i were a full time writer it would of been would of a writer
books,not_removed,so in summary i had no clue what i was doing wrote porn go banned amazon sucks
books,not_removed,this could probably use a nsfw label for the ads on the right
books,not_removed,a lot of people are criticizing this article while not everything is on the nose he is right in some of his complaints about amazon amazon is really squeezing writers
books,not_removed,former seller on amazon they literally dont give a shit about merchants of any sort including authors many people are banned without cause toobigtofail
books,not_removed,i wish the guy on the cover of inaugurate her by the pussy was our real president also i have no issues with kindle select i have one book thats pages that i sell for amazon takes a buck and i keep if someone buys it if someone reads it netflix style i think i get half a cent per page which totals about a dollar when someone reads it all which happens often enough more often than an actual purchase for every read fair enough for me
books,not_removed,i like that he wrote it at dragon con
books,not_removed,appalling thanks for sharing this
books,not_removed,i stopped reading when he said he wasnt much of a reader what fucking writer who doesnt read much is worth his salt not much if any
books,not_removed,the part about at dragoncon is redundant
books,not_removed,its either would have or wouldve but never would of see httpwwwgrammarerrorscomgrammarcouldofwouldofshouldof for more information
books,not_removed,try to milk ban for all its worth and get publicity from reddit
books,not_removed,last i heard they allow anything but child porn sounds like op didnt edit and the books werent quality enough to stay in their market
books,not_removed,a throwaway and the exact same grammatical error as the author hmmmmm
books,not_removed,its either would have or wouldve but never would of see httpwwwgrammarerrorscomgrammarcouldofwouldofshouldof for more information
books,not_removed,i stopped reading when he said he wasnt much of a reader what fucking writer who doesnt read much is worth his salt not much if any but we dont know what that means maybe he finishes reading a book every two weeks but doesnt consider himself to be a reader two books a month isnt that bad
books,not_removed,thanks bot thanks
books,not_removed,sounds like a plan to me
books,not_removed,if you self publish without editing you are asking for trouble
books,not_removed,you know i think youre onto something
books,not_removed,if he only he showed up every single time a redditor makes that mistake i bet a lot of people would stop doing it
books,not_removed,ive noticed amazon reviewers are far more ready to leave a bad review if you dont edit if they just disliked the plot they can forgive it as a difference of taste and walk away but when the author looks like they put no effort into the book you just spent money on you feel personally slighted
books,not_removed,wouldnt of caught it without the help of that bot thanks bot
books,not_removed,just shorten that to wouldntve
books,not_removed,its either would have or wouldve but never would of see httpwwwgrammarerrorscomgrammarcouldofwouldofshouldof for more information
books,not_removed,i would get annoyed with the constant notifications from the bot
books,not_removed,you could of but you learned something
books,not_removed,perhaps try reading something that is different from what you normally write pick a different genre or change the lengths of what you read if youre writing a novel pick up a collection of short stories or a novella try a different format maybe listening to an audiobook will be different enough for you to forget to nitpick as it were
books,not_removed,is one of the reasons youre not enjoying books is because youre being critical of it from a writers stand point theres a huge difference to me when i read as a writer than when i read as a reader
books,not_removed,what have you been trying to read
books,not_removed,youre not the first person to experience this usually the problem is the genre of choice some people think they are destined to write for one of the major genres high fantasy science fiction mystery etc only to find out they hate all of those genres and their true calling lies in romance or something of the sort the problem could also be that you chose the wrong books books of the same genre arent necessarily as similar with each other as they are with books of other genres a good modern example would be grrms a song of ice and fire which turned the high fantasy genre on its head with the release of a game of thrones you shouldnt restrict yourself with genres author names publishers etc just pick up and read something anything that looks interesting to you of course theres also the possibility that you dont actually need to read anything for your first book i remember there was a somewhat famous writer who had never read anything in his life other than the bible if none of that works out for you just seek a career in tv and become a scriptwriter reading books isnt as required there as it would be in the literary world
books,not_removed,idammit i really hate to sound like that guy but i find when ive been smoking im so much more immersed in the bookworld than i am otherwise not that im not engaged to begin with its justmore i do read more slowly when im baked but its worth it to me
books,not_removed,this subject has been very popular in the past please check out the httpswwwredditcomrbookswikifaq
books,not_removed,i dont know if any of you have read jane steele but thats the last novel ive enjoyed but i think the genre for it is just literary fiction please correct me if im wrong
books,not_removed,i love some as a reader and cringe at them as a writer thats how i feel üòÉ and i chastise myself like how could you read this youre an idiot find something high brow high brow shit can be droll though i really do just need to enjoy it and stop discriminating against some of the books
books,not_removed,this is an excellent point i find that im always reading as a writer because i read that you should but how can i stick with the book if its not up to my read like a writer standards is it truly bad or do i just need to put a sock in it and see if i enjoy it
books,not_removed,mediocrity is a big problem for me when i read in addition to a really slowly paced plot slow enough to be uninteresting oh and awful and outdated dialogue
books,not_removed,whoever told you to always read as a writer is wrong im assuming that you started writing because you have a love for reading books and words why ruin that love when you dont have to the good news is that you can read as a reader and then analyze it as a writer after youre finished every time you start to get overly writer critical of something either stop reading or convince yourself to look over that aspect does the sentence structure and dialogue really need to be scrutinized that badly no because that isnt a fun way to read youre missing the story because youre bogged down in the details think of it this way you know when youre writing a scene and it isnt coming out well at all and youre just really frustrated because it sucks but then you go back and read it after some time has passed and boom all the sudden it isnt as bad as you remembered youre too stuck in the little things to enjoy the whole now once youve finished reading the book as a reader its pretty easy to think back about those critical writer thoughts you had trust me youll remember the things you hated or loved as a writer even after the book is done i dont think this is necessary for every book to be viewed this way but it isnt a bad exercise as long as you can separate your feelings about the book into writer feelings and reader feelings i love some books as a reader but cringe at them as a writer
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules your post is better suited for asking in rwhatsthatbook or rtipofmytongue

books,not_removed,should i finish x type questions are considered recommendation requests
books,not_removed,while were on topic of cheryl strayed are there any other books similar to this books from female writers talking about their road trips traveling across country etc im reading john steinbecks travels with charley again for the second time now and id really like to read something similar from a female point of view any ideas
books,not_removed,i havent read this book but i saw the movie and it was phenomenal
books,not_removed,cool whyd you share
books,not_removed,tracks by robyn davidson
books,not_removed,girl in the woods by aspen matis girl hiking the pacific crest trail well written different than wild but really well written
books,not_removed,i agree with your thoughts on the movie i do love the book more so far though i am almost of the way finished currently ive been thinking that the movie is as fairly spoton as expected despite leaving out some very cinematic instances that occur in the book and also not getting strayed completely right but what a good movie
books,not_removed,i find it one of many great quotesselections from the work
books,not_removed,thank you
books,not_removed,thank you
books,not_removed,its much easier to maintain a consistent level of tension in a shorter period of time rather than trying to drag it out over the course of a page book the longer a written horror story goes on the more authors tend to overexplain which kills the scariness of it its generally much scarier to leave stuff to the imagination when you show the monster or describe it or explain what it is its much less scary than what your mind can conjure based on a dark moonless night a rustling in the leaves and the sound of heavy breathing a short story can take a scary concept and bang it out succinctly
books,not_removed,in my experience while most authors can get the initial scare or buildup right they dont know what to do with the rest of the book do i tone down the scares do i drop it completely and start all over again stuff like that and ive read a few that dont even change the formula every scary part start to feel more and more like the last one theres also the problem of the whole horror hook getting padded out short stories tend to not overstay their welcome in fact i think i can safely say that most horror short stories revolve around a single frightful episode and dont show what happens afterwards this is not to say books cant be scary as balls stephen kings shining is still the only written piece of literature that made me read with my back to a corner
books,not_removed,whats a good horror short story book im a big fan of stuff like alien jaws the ring paranormal activity etc not so much the stuff like scream chucky saw and stuff like that
books,not_removed,personally i think so ive neverr been scared by a novel but i sure as shit have been creeped out by short stories or short novels
books,not_removed,same goes with movies and video games horror games tend to be shorter due to a tendency to become boring and tedious id dragged out for too long and have you ever seem a horror movie push hours
books,not_removed,i heard skeleton crew by stephen king is good
books,not_removed,ill check it out
books,not_removed,platos fantastic hes obviously considered one of the most important western thinkers in history but i dont think people appreciate how good a writer he can be some of the dialogues do drag on or become a bit mired in minutiae but he is a philosopher but when the dialogues catch they are quite exciting and as you said funny to read i wish plato was required reading for us high school and college students the stuff on justice piety and love if only to teach how to question
books,not_removed,as udukepaul said other works influence the west quite a bit if you have the time you should try philosophers from other eras william blake is a good example of the romantic period nietzche for realistpreexistentialist and john paul sartre or heiddiger for existentialism all of these movements had some impact on our collective culture and each was born out of different circumstances romanticism came from a time when industrialization was crushing the land and people the movement brought respect to nature and idealization of natural things in the nietzche and others saw romanticism as unpractical and proposed new ideas that shape life full of passions and struggles lastly existentialism after world war put perspective on our responsibility to act and the inherent freedom of this of course there are other movements and philosophers but it would be great to at least read a little bit of different eras to see how western thought has progressed
books,not_removed,long live philosophy though plato may have believed philosophy was a pursuit for the elites iirc i think everybody needs a little philosophy in hisher life platos works certainly formed a basis for much of western thought through the succeeding centuries but other philosophers over time have also had a great deal of influence many of platos ideas about archetypes and ideals have been countered or edged out by future philosophers the dialogue format is fun to follow but i always have trouble determining where the conversation will turn which makes it harder for me to critically analyze his argumentsclever bastard honestly i would say that reading the entirety of pretty much any author is not necessary to find how they influence culture and society some of platos works a few of shakespeares playsthat should be enough and final pointto really understand western culture you absolutely need to dive into the works of the scottish enlightenmentthomas paine john locke thomas hobbes even hume and edmund burke those authors formed the backbone of thought which made the american revolution possible and transformed the nature of government in the entire western world
books,not_removed,plato is a beautiful prosestylist in philosophy second only to perhaps nietzsche of those that ive read at least many of the dialogues are very important in a practical sense and many arent but i think the most value in reading plato comes from the method of inquiry the process itself
books,not_removed,have fun with theatetus parmenides and the timaeus
books,not_removed,yes exactly how to question and argue so for example in charmides the discuss the concept of sophrosyne and try to define it and dont actually reach and satisfying conclusion but the discussion is in itself valuable because it reveals important facts about how we think and how we perceive the world and our predispositions and beliefs
books,not_removed,where would you place dada in that picture
books,not_removed,yeah i already read thomas hobbes leviathan and i think locke second treatise on government and i do plan to read all of what youve mentioned thanks for your recommendations
books,not_removed,yes i think the way socrates goes round and round and round and then comes up with a conclusion that is absurd and then says so what you said earlier cannot be true and the other guys is like quite true like wtf dude how do you do that
books,not_removed,thanks
books,not_removed,im just a big fan of the scottish enlightenment philosophies thats all
books,not_removed,all of these are great books so many books so little time
books,not_removed,april fools
books,not_removed,wow rbooks as usual cant even read this is great stuff frankensteins frankenstein lol
books,not_removed,sadly enough i was fooled until the segment of tolkien which made me stupidly start googling tolkiens title the lord of the rings and origins of title facepalm
books,not_removed,cannot upvote such a blatantly clickbaity title
books,not_removed,sad to say i only realized it when i got to to kill a mockingbird i skipped frankensteins thinking i knew what it said
books,not_removed,a lotta killjoys downvoting april fools fun stuff
books,not_removed,what
books,not_removed,i liked the little book of mice and men lol
books,not_removed,the perfect way to guarantee your kids get beat up at school
books,not_removed,i dont know why this appeals to me but it does maybe because kids wont think its meta
books,not_removed,i just finished the book wonderfully written fantastic ideas about cosmos and the fate of mankind though im not quite sure what the ending made me feel
books,not_removed,the plot and ideas sound fascinating so i wish i was able to read this series but i only made it part of the way through the first volume i could only put up with just so much of the clunky prose and characterization before i had to give up however im very curious to read a detailed synopsis because im interested in what happens through the course of the series
books,not_removed,this series has ideas it is hard to put a label to them and i struggle when calling them allegories as imagined by minds confronted with larger problems yes there is something abstract and clunky to the characterisation but perhaps it is unavoidable and i am just a little haunted by the three body problem because we live in a world where the sun rises and sets predictably but this book invites to imagine something different a world where cosmically absolutely nothing can be taken for granted the sun may or may not even rise not just one life but all the lives on a planet may or may not survive another day perhaps nothing can be done i have to read deaths end even though i already sense what the ending must be
books,not_removed,at what point did the trisolarans become adept at lying in what ways did they misrepresent the fundamental laws of physics during the deterrence era i think this would have been a useful although it would have required the author to speculate even more about the ways in which our own current cosmology is wrong but the whole idea that cosmological constants like earth ecology may have coevolved with life is really cool
books,not_removed,do you get an advanced copy
books,not_removed,is it anyway that you could sell it to me
books,not_removed,amazonca just post quite a few preview chapters of this book just go to amazonca searh the book deaths end by cixin liu then do click look inside above the book image in the left column click surprise me a warning mass spoiler are included in these preview chapters thought they do skp the best parts of the book
books,not_removed,trisolarans still cant lie to each other but after yrs of observing human society they came to realized lying can be useful they built some super quantum computers to mimic human brains and use them for deceptions
books,not_removed,they learnt lying and deceit from human they are good students of good teachers though they still could not be able to lie to each other but they at least understand how to lie and become good at lie to other speice
books,not_removed,oh sorry for the misunderstanding i should have mentioned that what i just finished reading is the original chinese version
books,not_removed,it is no problem xd i have been craving this since after i finished with dark forest this series is so good and i would rate it up there with foundation and dune

books,not_removed,all his books are separate stories generally all i have to say is that even though some have the title of tom clancy he has passed away and sometimes youll see another authors name writing basically for him i guess just make sure whichever one you pick up has tom clancy as the actual author i enjoyed the original rainbow six games uptill rainbow six iii the most
books,not_removed,yeah ive seen that against all enemies was published under tom clancys name but peter telep actually wrote it
books,not_removed,yeah man not that they arent interesting but just different
books,not_removed,orson scott card enders game then enders shadow after that you can choose which character youd like to follow both series are very good and deal with a plethora of amazing ideas read them in college myself and quickly became my all time favorites
books,not_removed,lately ive been really enjoying the dresden files books
books,not_removed,terry pratchett but dont start with the colour of magic the light fantastic or equal rights they all can easily stand alone but improve with the company of their kin moving pictures would be a good introduction
books,not_removed,the name of the rose umberto eco a stunning education under the guise of a murdermystery eco defines what true education paired with the amazing gift of storytelling can achieve read the opening chapter stop pm me if you get what he does

books,not_removed,you dont joke about something like that
books,not_removed,is this post an april fools day joke
books,not_removed,so where is the damned ama edit nevermind i found it i wasnt sure if it was another dumb april fools joke
books,not_removed,me too seems he is a real author but im personally finding all the posts about him that are taking over right now to be really obnoxious
books,not_removed,it was out yesterday aaaaaand ive bought it its actually free for kindle so
books,not_removed,you guys are the best
books,not_removed,ikr
books,not_removed,of course not dr tingle is a hugo award nominated author take a look at his ama he puts his heart into his work and he really loves his fans
books,not_removed,did you even look at rbooks
books,not_removed,edit deleted comment said did you see the banner yes im pretty stoked that rbooks put up that banner to help showcase some of dr tingles work im willing to bet that dr tingle felt a bit of a tingle when he came here and saw it really shows how much we love and support his work
books,not_removed,youre kidding right
books,not_removed,nevermind i found it i wasnt sure if it was another dumb april fools joke
books,not_removed,my only concern is that im on reddit at work and since i work with the public my screen is now mildly nsfw
books,not_removed,im not kidding he made a post about it yesterday i think
books,not_removed,spoiler alert s his penis
books,not_removed,pretty sure you can shut of custom themes in your preferences but i know for sure that you can do it with the res extension i guess you might not be allowed to install res at work though
books,not_removed,im not so sure s his butt
books,not_removed,very possible
books,not_removed,no no he puts s his butt obviously
books,not_removed,i used to have a magazine in my bag that i opened to the middle and shoved my book in between the pages does that make sense haha as if i was making a book taco like the magazine was the taco shell and book is the filling yeah i found that worked enough for the level of knocking around it was getting in my bags now now i just shove them in there i sort of like the look and feel of a well wornread book but thats just me
books,not_removed,whenever i buy pillow cases curtains sheets etc i keep the sturdy plastic zipper top bag that they come in most of them are the perfect size for books and they work really well
books,not_removed,here are some relevant past discussions here on rbooks
books,not_removed,ive actually bought handsewn cross stitch fabric bags and tried out using one of those it works awesome you can also check out etsy and use a smaller tablet bag that will fix standard sized books they arent hard like a pencil case but they definitely wont bend and would be protected against the grime of a bag
books,not_removed,for mass market paperbacks that are those pocket sized versions i have a fabric book cover that includes a bookmark as well as a velcro strap to keep the book closed similar to httpwwwscrapstitchingcomprojectsbookcover mine looks like a puppy and the second ear is a bookmark i misplace it a lot though so usually what i do is reserve a pocket for my book or find a makeup bag to cover it instead
books,not_removed,i use an snopake polyfile when you close it the tension keeps the book in place so it wont get damaged
books,not_removed,upvote for book taco
books,not_removed,oh good thank you i wasnt entirely sure what kind of keywords i could use to search it up
books,not_removed,ill second lotr just spent months reading the hobbit and lotr to my son every night and weve both loved every bit of them ive just started elena ferrantes neapolitan novels book series so i cant personally attest to them as a whole yet but everything written about them suggests theyre great the whole way through
books,not_removed,here are five consistent fantasy series joe abercrombie first law trilogy mark lawrence the broken empire trilogy brent weeks night angel trilogy scott lynch gentleman bastard sequence steven erikson malazan book of the fallen here is a consistent scifi series richard k morgan takeshi kovacs series not so much a scifi series as a collection but seriously good with surprising consistency iain m banks culture novels
books,not_removed,stephen kings the dark tower series i never experienced a drop off while reading any of the books
books,not_removed,the mistborn novels were amazing
books,not_removed,imho i would say pierce browns red rising trilogy
books,not_removed,joe abercrombies the first law trilogy and the three standalones that follow it are consistent in the fact that theyre always good but inconsistent in the best possible way they keep getting better i absolutely love the trilogy but damn are those standalones great in terms of endings the trilogys conclusion is satisfying and each standalone ends well abercrombie is working on another trilogy but if that never came out id be more than satisfied with what we have now
books,not_removed,i enjoyed every one of the main series dragonlance novels its been awhile since ive read them but thats a large series that i found entertaining throughout with no drop off
books,not_removed,the empire trilogy by jenny wurts raymond feist
books,not_removed,im kind of in the minority here i think but i loved all five books of the hitchhikers guide series and i think the ending was brilliant
books,not_removed,i think cs lewiss the chronicles of narnia fits this bill it has consistent quality throughout i know i would be hard pressed to pick a favorite although it might just be the voyage of the dawn treader and the ending might not have been particularly spectacular but it maintained the quality whereas a lot of series have trouble tying off all the loose ends and they come out too tidy or unsatisfyng the magicians nephew may be the one exception in this but it serves a unique role in the story and even though i cared for it less than the others it doesnt diminish the overall series significantly in my opinion
books,not_removed,the foundation series is fairly uneven but for me the ending was extremely satisfying asimov doesnt do characters well but he nails endings
books,not_removed,derek landys skulduggery pleasant series started out well and consistently improved the gist is a skeleton detective and his teenage sidekick valkyrie trying to stop the world from ending in different ways but the books are rather wellwritten and the humoras well as the way landy creates conversationsis of a high quality he also does an impressive job of balancing a growing world of characters read them all
books,not_removed,mary stewarts merlin trilogy are amazing david eddings belgariad and mallorean i thought were consist through the entire series might be closer to ya though
books,not_removed,the original four entries in the book of the new sun series i read the fifth urth of the new sun should better be avoided so i did
books,not_removed,ill just say the obvious harry potter
books,not_removed,about foundation series did you get to read the final two novels where hari seldon is chief protagonist imo it tied up entire series very well but you have rightly said that book is a big drag and its completely skippable
books,not_removed,justin cronins the passage trilogy excellent multilayered narratives centered around mankinds future hundreds of years after a viral outbreak of immortal vampiric creatures destroys civilization and how humanitys future rests in the hands of a mysterious and ageless little girl named amy
books,not_removed,peter hamiltons nights dawn trilogy
books,not_removed,i hated wheel of time its one of the most inconsistent book series ive ever read the farseer trilogy gets progressively better and starts very well others have said other ones that id mention i will say that discworld is remarkably consistent given its size its consistently great for sections much longer than your average book series however i will also add that the series ive read of it were not consistent in their entirety although still pretty entertaining
books,not_removed,frank herberts dune series
books,not_removed,considering i knew out of the you listed and loved those it seems i know what my next books are going to be
books,not_removed,if anything malazan gets better as it goes on i also loved the ending i sat and stated at a wall for about an hour just trying to wrap my head around the journey i had just been on its my favorite series by far and the only fantasy ive read quite a bit series i consider literary i love the others you listed as well but i truly believe malazan is a masterpiece
books,not_removed,i was a bit let down by the end of the broken empire but i very much enjoyed the journey
books,not_removed,to add the contrarian opinion to thus the books suffered tremendously from book on and the ending is is something that people either love or hate i fell into the hate crowd
books,not_removed,not surprisingly the wheel of time books pick up again when sanderson takes over
books,not_removed,i loooooove abercrombie but i think that the heroes is not quite as good as the first four and red country is several steps down from the rest still great though its also worth noting loads of people complain here that the ending of the first law trilogy isnt satisfying somehow personally i think those people are crazy or have pretty basic tastes but anyway these people exist personally i think the first law series is by far the best fantasy series just great from page to page barely letting up for a sentence if it does at all
books,not_removed,comments that mention harry potter always get downvoted here why
books,not_removed,i think the last two books have a noticeable drop in quality particular book and i know a lot of others feel five is lower quality as well
books,not_removed,thanks thinking of getting these
books,not_removed,i disagree about wot but i also loved the farseer trilogy and the tawny man trilogy
books,not_removed,yeah no
books,not_removed,its is long and can be a difficult read but i enjoyed the hell out of it
books,not_removed,im sorry it dropped off for you real sadness applied for me it seemed action packed and kept me in suspense throughout the whole series but i do suppose that for some people that was not the case the ending i loved mainly because it left the story open which for me means that it could be added to i can see how some people could hate it it wasnt fulfilling for them this is where the old adage applies to each their own
books,not_removed,i read both stormilght archives books and reread them like times read twot too and have nothing else to read
books,not_removed,probably because its not a dystopia a cormack mccarthy novel or lolita i dont necessarily think harry potter is high fiction but that wasnt the question was it for the record i think the vicomte de bragelonne was a wonderful series i believe that the current glut of serialization is partly driven by economics and partly because its fashionable and like any popular style has produced a few winners and mostly books that will be forgotten the last one that interested me enough to complete was the millennium trilogy and i havent read the fourth installment on the flip side we have the current disinterest in short stories which are in and of themselves totally different and where some of the most interesting fiction has come from maybe it will come back around when people get tired of reading page counts instead of quality work
books,not_removed,why not being snarky i legitimately would like to know what you find less about six and seven or five ive read them all multiple times and never felt let down by the quality in later books so im interested to know what others find lacking
books,not_removed,to each his own indeed i am glad that the series is so loved by many others just didnt work for me it is his style of writing in general that seems to doom a lot of his books for me i tend to prefer books where it is obvious the author had a pretty concrete outline devised from the beginning and they knew where the story is going king is pretty much the opposite of that not right or wrong just a preference thing
books,not_removed,steel heart is pretty good as are his follow up books to the mist born trilogy
books,not_removed,not op but the last book really needed a good editor i think she feel into the trap that a lot of authors of popular series fall into im looking at you grrm which is that they think everything they write is amazing and everyone needs to know every detail about the world theyre creating this is hardly ever the case the middle pages of the last book could have been removed and the plot would have been the exact same an editor who wasnt afraid of upsetting the cash cow should have stepped in and made her trim the fat
books,not_removed,about book five to steal from ebert its a four hundred page novel squeezed into eight hundred pages also get your hands on an eversion and search for out of nowhere during the climax those three words appear far too often far too close to each other similar issues plague six and seven namely laziness and lack of editing
books,not_removed,i havent read it but i just want to say good job for picking up a book when youre not a prolific reader and hopefully welcome to the reading cult happy reading
books,not_removed,at first i thought this was a sequel to his bizzaro im still here now thats a bookfilm id want to see
books,not_removed,haha thank you
books,not_removed,hey there this is better suited as a comment on our as it doesnt do a whole lot to encourage discussion as for your recommendation request that should go under our weekly recommendation thread but you should read the idiot because its great
books,not_removed,thanks
books,not_removed,do not post shallow content im sorry but your post currently counts as shallow content do you have something else to say about the book that you could edit into the text preferably your own thoughts about the book or at the least a description of the book without spoilers let me know if you edit it i can reinstate your post
books,not_removed,thats a shame its one of my favorite books interesting look at ways of being an american working hard making your way creating a nice middle class life from that sanctuary working to protest and destroy symbolically systems of oppression it was also a good look at fatherhood and love
books,not_removed,i felt like the first two thirds roth was basically carefully spinning atmosphere building up certain expectations the characters living going through few big challenges but not as exceptional as in many other stories in parts even boaring then towards the end he basically smashed everything to pieces in a glorious manner throwing everything over board
books,not_removed,ive been making my way chronologically through roths work he can be a very uneven writer most of his early work is pretty bad until he finds his voice with portnoys complaint and our gang is unreadable it picks up dramatically when he starts the zuckerman series some of my favorite books of his
books,not_removed,i thought it was a great book but i didnt enjoy it im still glad i read it and felt i gained insights from it
books,not_removed,and thats not even the worst one he does repeat himself
books,not_removed,i hope youre excluding goodbye columbus and when she was good from that pretty bad classification
books,not_removed,no goodbye columbus was a fine early work by a promising writer and when she was good is hardly roth at his best
books,not_removed,not his best but id argue its a solid novel and i think that goodbye columbus is exceptional tons of writers were writing things similar to it at the time but roths novella was just an order of magnitude better than anything else around imo
books,not_removed,that is why we have different opinions other than portnoys complaint for me his best work started with the ghost writer

books,not_removed,it depends on the book i have trouble sometimes with the greeks and romans on gutenberg and usually prefer newer translations the translations on gutenberg of the russians almost always constance garnett and the french are usually fine for me
books,not_removed,do you know how to use google
books,not_removed,im quite happy paying for better translations if they are out there and i can always just stick to getting books in english for free there are certainly enough of them but i just thought i would see what peoples experiences were like before downloading a whole bunch
books,not_removed,i was looking for stuff from all sorts of languages so will keep this in mind is there anywhere that reviews translators
books,not_removed,actually constance garnett is notorious for mild censorship ive read that she would tone down anything too racy for early century britain
books,not_removed,yes but this has a more subjective answer so i thought i would ask for opinions
books,not_removed,i dont know of any one place ill usually google something like best english don quixote a lot of times youll find forums discussing the issue which can help sometimes if youre lucky youll find a good review that compares passages from two or more translations if the old free translation seems readable and i understand it as well as the newer one then i stick with the free one sorry if thats not super helpful i havent found a good resource for that either
books,not_removed,its a shame there doesnt seem to be one different translations can almost make a book entirely different if they take a different tone or a different style to the original
books,not_removed,liesel and rudys in the book thief how about a kiss saumensch gets me every time
books,not_removed,probably the ones that are left out i do mean this in earnest though no snark if i want to read about moist glistening trysts left and right and live in a jojo moyes or nora roberts world ill go there theyre the experts but for me the best romanticanything scenes have to be work ups to forbidden whatevers then against all odds starved and exhausted they make it to the uncertain rendezvous they wordlessly stare at each other never having met in a burning coastal french city ravaged by wwii bombing and it ends ahhh
books,not_removed,ive also noticed the kiss being hot i read a fair amount of romance novels so that probably affects the trends i see but recently ive seen the phrase plundering her mouth appearing rather frequently when i read what is your favorite the first scene i thought of was from the host by stephenie meyer the setup is absolutely ridiculous but its so hot in a sexy not temperature way also you might want to spoiler text the characters you mention
books,not_removed,in hopeless when sky and holder finally kiss oh the feels
books,not_removed,gone with the wind has some steamy kissing scenes
books,not_removed,levin kissing kitty when he goes to her house to ask her hand for marriage now i hate chick flicks but that made me feel warm and fuzzy inside and put a massive smile on my face
books,not_removed,does fanfiction count as literature my favorite is literary in terms of quality and length pages and certain characters dont kiss until roughly chapter out of super slow burn but one of the best descriptions of kissing ive ever read that made it worth the wait
books,not_removed,i like the scene where faramir kisses eowyn on her brow in the lord of the rings its not hot at all but still so beautiful
books,not_removed,im on my phone and couldnt figure out how to spoiler text it sorry if i spoiled anything for you
books,not_removed,no worries i havent read the second book and i dont really remember what happened in the first so i just did my best to purge the names from my memory the second i read them also for future reference spoiler text is spoilers about xyzs spoiler content here its in the sidebar but it can be hard to see and i dont know if its visible on mobile
books,not_removed,we do have a lot of stuff in the sidebar and the mobile apps are awful at preserving it we try to keep an eye out and nudge folks in the right direction but if you ever see any unmarked spoilers just report it post or comment and let the user know how to cover it i usually just copypaste the example with a between the tag and the spoiler reporting only goes to the subs mods afaik so its not like youre getting anyone in trouble unless theyre breaking the rules then they will get in trouble but its also anonymous so well never know it was you unless youre a mod of the sub then theyre not anonymous i found that out the hard way

books,not_removed,i have i havent read hidden bodies yet but i did enjoy you and liked the unique voice my book club read it and though i remember us quibbling about a few things overall we liked it and thought it was creepy i wish i could remember more details but i read it when my son was a baby and my memory is crap
books,not_removed,dammit i recently read you by austin grossman and you by charles benoit theres a third in the youtrilogy i know theyre unconnected
books,not_removed,i liked you i just finished hidden bodies and i loved it i thought it was more involved what are your thoughts on that one
books,not_removed,its definitely unlike anything i have ever read the voice of joe was seriously creepy and beck i liked how in the end joe learned that they are more alike in their lying and stalking tendencies than he thought i cant deny that i was really caught off guard when i got to the part where beck and dr nicky got together i knew all hell was going to break loose after that
books,not_removed,i was thinking about grossmans novel as well
books,not_removed,what are the other yous about
books,not_removed,i bought hidden bodies immediately after i finished you so good i agree it was more involved and thats one thing i really enjoyed about it
books,not_removed,you by austin grossman is about video game development and needing a better editor it gets kinda incomprehensible you by charles benoit is a short novel about a deadbeat high schooler told in second person id recommend the latter but theres a great book hiding somewhere in the former
books,not_removed,try posting this in rwhatsthatbook
books,not_removed,sounds like enders game at a military school children play war games and they use a tablet for their school work
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules your post is better suited for asking in rwhatsthatbook or rtipofmytongue
books,not_removed,thanks i didnt know about it
books,not_removed,nah thats not it very virtualworldish
books,not_removed,i really dont think so
books,not_removed,american gods is one of the few books ive put down and not picked up again after getting a good way through because i wasnt really enjoying it
books,not_removed,the journey is the story of course it all comes together in the end but if youre not hooked and youre over halfway through its very likely you wont enjoy the rest of the book my first time reading it i read the last half of the book in basically one sitting because i couldnt stop reading
books,not_removed,i dont know how to respond to this because it seems completely inconsistent with my reading of the book i felt like the narrative was very strong throughout and even when it ventured into vignettes the relevance of the scene becomes apparent pretty quickly if its simply that you feel like youre not getting the whole story it could be because the reader gets to know little more than shadow does and mr wednesdays plan is somewhat cryptic and yes theres a lot of going places and talking to people i suppose but im not sure what thats meant to be in contrast to each of the individuals wednesday either brings or causes shadow to meet are meant to teach shadow something that will influence the coming war its not a light read by any means and is a bit of an aberration both in gaimans catalog and the genre in general as the main action of the book is contemplation and the big war is one of ideas not of violence shadow is both the protagonist of the story and the battlefield the different gods are fighting upon
books,not_removed,it has a pretty good ending and twist if thats what youre after all the characters participate in the climax and the vignettes about random people and gods dont connect gaiman is just worldbuilding i loved his style but its also very british perhaps not for everyone
books,not_removed,its overrated in my opinion dont force yourself to finish it if you dont feel youre getting anything out of it
books,not_removed,the scenes that take place in the and like that are the stories of the gods that you dont meet if that helps any
books,not_removed,how versed are you on mythology in general gaimain assumes that the reader already knows who odin and thor are and the symbology and stories around them as well as other the gods from other pantheons personally even though i had a lot of that back ground knowledge i couldnt race through the book it is dense id suggest boning up on your mythology then going back to the start and taking it slow the book does come together in the end but maybe not in a way youre expecting
books,not_removed,i didnt read the physical book i listened to the year anniversary audio book and it made immediate sense to me the cast is rich and the voice acting is top notch the visualizations are clear and the coming to america segments are very much separate from the main plot if you cant through the book try audio
books,not_removed,it all comes together in the end
books,not_removed,i am in exactly the same situation of the way through reading on ereader only somewhat interested so far i have taken about weeks off to read other things so i think ill pick it back up and see if it gets any better
books,not_removed,ha same here i didnt even make it that far in
books,not_removed,it does come together in the end i liked it pretty well the first time i read it but i actually enjoyed it better my second time around when i had a better grasp on the characters and the kind of story it was
books,not_removed,im a big fan of gaimans other books and this was probably the of his i read i personally enjoyed the many characters after hearing it was was going to be made into a tv series my girlfriend listened to the audiobook and loved it i listened to the audio version and enjoyed it more the second time around i agree that it is rewarding if you finish and the full cast reading of the audio version is a bonus however if you get deep into and are not enjoying it you probably wont like it even if you finish
books,not_removed,i see youve reached the part where shadow pointlessly wanders around eating meat pies for pages with nothing else happening i swear i dont think ive ever read a book that would benefit from a heavy handed editor as much had american gods
books,not_removed,i gave up about halfway through might be a book thats just not for you dont sweat it
books,not_removed,but arent you as a reader as clueless as shadow for me it had a very gratifying end and i felt like it all came together in the end it can feel like nothings happening but i enjoyed most of these parts if i hadnt enjoyed these parts i wouldnt have read it lifes too short to read a book i dont enjoy and there are so many books to read have fun
books,not_removed,im not not enjoying it i just nothing it at the moment
books,not_removed,its not a light read by any means if this novel is not a light read then what is
books,not_removed,ive been reading through it most of the day and now at i may as well finish it i mentioned before that its not that i am not not enjoying it its just not doing anything at the point its moved on since
books,not_removed,it has a pretty good ending and twist id call it disturbing but i guess from a this was a well told story perspective it could be called good
books,not_removed,if you cant through the book try audio lol maybe just abandon the book altogether
books,not_removed,it does not i think you either like the writing style or you dont
books,not_removed,if a book doesnt capture my interest within the first pages or so i cant push through and finish it ive started many books that ive never finished due to this i am currently reading a book of american martyrs by joyce carol oates im about pages in and it has pages im going to see how i feel about it by page or so
books,not_removed,for me a light read is something where i dont have to pay more than attention and im just reading because why not i wouldnt call american gods a light read simply because i needed to pay attention more like to details allusions etc to know exactly what was going on beyond the surface example of light read for me shantaram by gregory david roberts or the inheritance cycle by paolini
books,not_removed,a magazine article unless youre being sarcastic p
books,not_removed,i thought it was pretty well told definitely didnt see it coming i never see twists coming though so other people might not like it
books,not_removed,ive read a few different translations one in high school a different one in college and a third for fun and i found fagles to be my favorite his writing matches the pace of the action without feeling like a paraphrase and i found the introductory materials and notes to be the best ive seen id try to get an exchange on that illiad but thats just my opinion
books,not_removed,you should be ok with two different translations the style of each story is already so incredibly different
books,not_removed,there are many wellrespected scholars that believe the two poems did not have the same author or creator so i dont think changing translators should be a problem at university back in the stone age we read lattimores iliad and fitzgeralds odyssey a fun sidenote compare canto from ezra pounds cantos with i think its book of the odyssey anyway the descent into hades from whatever odyssey you have
books,not_removed,also just a heads up for books like that you can find epub versions for free easily online check out gutenbergorg it has many great works available and wont cost you a dime
books,not_removed,richmond lattimore is good
books,not_removed,fagles is good
books,not_removed,i read the fagles translation for a course last semester and liked it a lot havent read the hammond translation but ive heard of him and hes legit from what i hear so im sure it would be fine it might be a little weird and jarring to read different translations of the two poems just because of how closely related they are but not a huge deal in short if its not too expensive and you want a more optimized experience it might be worth it to send out for the fagles translation but youd be fine with either one
books,not_removed,in my opinion you should try to different translators that way you can figure out which one you like best
books,not_removed,im absolutely curious but its late and i have no clue where my odyssey copy is so im screenshotting on my phone and hoping to return later i am ready to be amazed or at least suddenly look up and stare at nothing as i process it
books,not_removed,depends on what you want out of life if all you want is sex and lack of germs sure but if you want to paint or just have babies nope sorry no one had pets either and no place is utopia unless it has cats
books,not_removed,werent the people in the city genetically modified and harvested though that sounds pretty dreadful especially if you end up being lower on the caste totem pole
books,not_removed,its been years since i read it but i remember feeling extremely unsettled after finishing it i dont think im quite that desperate for comfort and easy sex
books,not_removed,no i wanted nothing to do with the brave new world i think heinleins for us the living was a better version of that world and laid out in betterdeeper detail
books,not_removed,it definitely has its appeal you will know for a fact your purpose in life youll have a lifetime job youre guaranteed to love you wont be allowed to become homeless or starve
books,not_removed,not exactly it wasnt the perfect world but it wasnt the nightmarish world huxley wanted his readers to envision either one of my problems with books like this is that it tends to romanticize suffering like the message is its totally worth it to have other people living in horrible agony because it keeps life on earth interesting john saw people on his reservation suffering he saw infants dying from diseases they couldnt treat and hunger and extreme poverty huxley seems to just hand wave these problems away as if they are minimal annoyances or worse something people must endure to grow up the right way in real life suffering doesnt always work as a convenient teaching tool more often than not it breaks and kills people before they ever have a chance to see any reason behind it there were a few horrific parts of bnw like the deliberate impairment of peoples brains to fit the level that they are classified under and then there was a bunch of irrelevant stuff about how apparently if people dont get married and become baby makers then theyll grow up feeling unfulfilled whether thats bs or not depends on the individual but the people free from the bnws influence werent exactly full of joy with the freedom to witness their babies die from starvation or diseases either
books,not_removed,our world is pretty clean and full of easy sex if you live in a liberal city and use hookup apps move to portland oregon or seattle washington or amsterdam connect with the lgbt community lots of sex for everyone theres plenty of somalike substances too if you hang out with the right people its even legal in some states and you can buy it in retail stores and wherever you live psychiatrists dispense feelgood drugs and health insurance pays for it brave new world right here right now wheeeeeeeee
books,not_removed,not to mention the island existed in bnw alpha we have a place for you beta we have a place for you etc fed up with this society go fuck off to the island sounds like a pretty alright world to live in
books,not_removed,lots of sex and soma and no worries sounds pretty good to me of course the point of the novel is that this is a pretty morally bankrupt society anyway but then its not like huxley was a postmodernist either
books,not_removed,or dogs dont forget the lovable companions
books,not_removed,its been a awhile since i read brave new world but i dont recall them harvesting anything collecting resources after you died but not harvesting when alive and yeah life sucked if you were below the beta class but thats why you got to hope your an alpha
books,not_removed,i guess their world has a different effect depending on what you value is important in life
books,not_removed,for us the living never heard of that book but will check it out
books,not_removed,and if you dont like it you can go to an awesome island full of people who like the same stuff as you
books,not_removed,danm thats some really good insight i never knew huxley wanted to romanticise suffering
books,not_removed,i live right next to toronto so i can see the easy sex for some people but unfortunately i dont think the easy sex is shared in the straight community
books,not_removed,thats what i found nice about the world too if you disagreed with or disliked the society you were in they would move you to a place full of people who had the same ideals and pursuits as you
books,not_removed,i guess the reason why it seemed so appealing was that our world feels as morally bankrupt at least to me but doesnt have the soma
books,not_removed,your chances of being beta or above are very slim of the community is beta and below
books,not_removed,i meant harvesting as in growing humans in test tubeslarge containers i dont remember if that was correct though i do remember being disturbed during the tour scene
books,not_removed,its a draft of a book that was published years after being discarded it actually pre dates his first published story
books,not_removed,a place for everybody and everybody in his place
books,not_removed,might i recommend hanging out in a dive bar at or using tinder and okcupid okcupid lets you filter by people looking for casual sex casual sex is out there but you gotta pursue it its easier than you might think and dont write off gay sex its fun too and highly available
books,not_removed,wont matter though because youre guaranteed to feel at home wherever you are
books,not_removed,this might be an unpopular opinion but id rather be born in a test tube than in a womb that is another level of disturbing if i recall correctly life only really sucked for the epsilons but only if you had the mental capacity of da to know that life as an epsilon sucked
books,not_removed,yeah they abolished the family children are brought up in state facilities tended to by professional childminders who presumably are rotated out every month or two so the kids dont get attached actually i would like to see some nation do this successfully just to watch the family values folks heads explode
books,not_removed,haha okay i wont forget that the next time im in toronto
books,not_removed,yeah but op envisions himself as a tall handsome alpha not a dwarf with a grotesquely narrow head btw bnw never talks about sex among the lower classes only the beta and alphas
books,not_removed,this goes into some of the problems with their world but what they did was reduce the intelligence of epsilons with the use of drugs so that they would never know what they were missing out on they also brainwashed them when they were born to make them hate the hard work of the classes above them so yeah that part was fucked up but you would always be in a fools paradise
books,not_removed,we kind of already do this with public schools just not to the same degree or intensity as the book
books,not_removed,well the viewpoint characters are all alphas there would be no reason for anyone except doctors psychologists and sociologists in their professional capacities to concern themselves with the sexual behavior of the lower castes
books,not_removed,but we are not even told if they are sterilized i think the eggs are only harvested from alphas and betas but i dont think they make that clear in the opening walk through and i dont mean an indepth analysis of sexual behavior i mean a quick mention of whether or not sex is even a thing for them i think community sports are not because they are never on the field
books,not_removed,lenina is a pov character and a beta
books,not_removed,the delta of venus by anais nin should be on the list it is considered a seminal ahem work of erotica another book that should be better known is the notebooks of don rigoberto and its sequel in praise of the stepmother by mario vargas llosa the former has a unique scene featuring kittens and as weird as it may sound it is a good one
books,not_removed,sabbaths theater by philip roth bad behavior by mary gaitskill what belongs to you by garth greenwell a sport and a pastime by james salter written on the body by jeanette winterson the rachel papers by martin amis lust by susan minot g by john berger the unbearable lightness of being by milan kundera couples by john updike endless love by scott spencer house of holes by nicholson baker
books,not_removed,hey im just glad lolita is not there
books,not_removed,fannie hill the story of o
books,not_removed,these are great books especially kunderas but like someone else mentioned this has a lot of straight pretty normative heterosexual sex fetishistic and kink novels always stuck with me more like story of o and nonfiction like the sexual life of catherine m and though labeled horror poppy z brite has written some of the best gay erotica ive ever read also while maybe not conventionally sexy henry millers books stand out to me
books,not_removed,this list seems to have chosen a lot of books written by men when erotica and romance novels are generally written by women how is story of o by pauline reage not there it was one of the most influential bdsm of all time esquire definitely messed up with this list
books,not_removed,what about lady chatterlys lover not that ive read it
books,not_removed,lady chatterleys lover
books,not_removed,i havent read all of these but they mostly seem to be focused on straight sex
books,not_removed,slammed in the butthole by my concept of linear time by chuck tingle must be
books,not_removed,i vote for lightness which is so much more followed by couples
books,not_removed,dont know how the fermata isnt in here before house of holes
books,not_removed,perhaps in a different list i would definitely consider it an erotic novel as the taboo can sometimes be even more erotic but you would find fewer people admitting to it thats the magic of nabokov though in that he was able to write using humberts lurid voice and make us a willing or unwilling voyeur into his forbidden sexuality
books,not_removed,yeah but what about ada much more erotic
books,not_removed,o is for special tastes
books,not_removed,a most people are straight b im willing to bet that written on the body by jeanette winterson is a lesbian novel
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,written on the body is definitely one of my faves but surely there are other books that arent quite so straight that could have made the list as well as i remember even casanovas confessions featured a lot of different types of sex also i think the idea that most people are straight is a little oversimplified i think sexuality is more of a spectrum that people move around on throughout their lives of course thats just my opinion
books,not_removed,it got robbed
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,but i think if you were to survey the entire population at any point in time and get truthful results the straightlgbt ratio would be similar to the ratio represented by this list thats what i would think anyway perhaps the problem of only having one lgbt book would be rectified by making a longer list
books,not_removed,i was just thinking about how the list should be longer too i wouldnt want to take anything off necessarily the books on the list ive read ive enjoyed but i can think of lots of things to add what ive noticed is that even people who identify as straight tend to fantasize about all kinds of things my opinion on this comes from a mix of my own personal experience and on collections of men and womens sexual fantasies that have been compiled by people like nancy friday most of those people were straight and happily in heterosexual relationships but their fantasies were all over the map i know this is eye roll inducing and i definitely dont expect everyone to agree with me but i really do think that gaystraight is a constructed binary and a lot of people round up to one or the other i think the resistance to the idea of bisexuality speaks to how important the gaystraight divide is in our culture but things are definitely changing on that front
books,not_removed,perhaps not only sexuality differs from person to person but also the flexibility of ones sexuality i would absolutely classify myself as straight and ive never had the urge to be otherwise but of course there are others who lean toward widerencompassing sexualities or who change their preference as time goes on its difficult though because no one knows for sure how other peoples minds work and sometimes not even their own
books,not_removed,good point so much goes into what people find interesting or exciting or the opposite ive changed a lot over the years i definitely prefer one type of sex more than others at this point in my life but i want to read about all kinds of sex haha
books,not_removed,you might want to post on rtipofmytongue
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules your post is better suited for asking in rwhatsthatbook or rtipofmytongue
books,not_removed,oh will do thanks
books,not_removed,do or do not there is no should its entirely up to you and any decision you make about it is totally fine and acceptable
books,not_removed,ill track authors that my favourite authors read to some extent simply out of curiosity but otherwise unless youre a fan its kind of pointless
books,not_removed,i just think theres too much to read and discover to restrict yourself to reading all of an authors work but if their style really impresses you then i see no reason why you shouldnt
books,not_removed,well if theyve written one thing you liked odds are there is more its always worth looking into that but you may also want to check what theyve read and enjoyed themselves
books,not_removed,i like to explore more of an authors work if i really enjoyed their writing style i dont marathon through their work or cut out other books i want to read though
books,not_removed,dont bother too much about this tracking authors is nice if you like their styles but is also a good thing to discover other writers im currently doing this with sanderson books because there are so many but i also have a long list or other books to try
books,not_removed,i do when i come across something i really enjoy and sometimes this does set you up for disappointment when the next book isnt as enjoyable it might even be just as interesting but vastly different etc i now try to go into the rest of an authors work with zero expectations and discover some extra gems that way i definitely think the positives outweigh the negatives
books,not_removed,you can do whatever you want what difference does it make
books,not_removed,youre looking for the rise and fall of the roman empire
books,not_removed,asimov himself wrote a book about the roman empire he makes everything interesting to read
books,not_removed,its been some time since i last read it and i intend to again when i can find the time it was one of the first pieces of science fiction i ever read and i credit it to opening the door to that wonderful wonderful genre of books also wasnt it hari seldon im guessing that was autocorrect
books,not_removed,i always wondered in what order you should read all these foundation books tried it once but i was lost after the first foundation is there a clear reading order including the prequels and extras and such
books,not_removed,i think that we are already in a seldon crisis i personally think that the time that we live in will be marked by future historians as the turning point of humanity depending on what steps that we take our species will thrive in the future or face complete annihilation
books,not_removed,i should really reread foundation my dad had a shedload of asimov books and i still remember how amazing foundation was when i read it think i was about not sure if i finished all i seem to remember it got harder going for me at the time somewhere in the book
books,not_removed,i had a hour drive a month ago and threw on the audio book for half of it because of a recommendation from this subreddit it was the first audio book i ever listened to and i was unsure about the whole thing because i wasnt sure id be as immersed as i am reading the first time jump really screwed with me knowing nothing about the book beforehand but now it is one of my favorite books and im completely sold on audiobooks being effectively trapped in a car completely immersing myself in this world for hours straight was an amazing experience
books,not_removed,love this series are you able to find a copy of foundation and earth i remember having a hell of a time finding it because it was out of print
books,not_removed,the rise and fall of the roman empire simon bakers or edward gibbons cheers
books,not_removed,im amazed about how extremelly intelligent he is and subtle even if readers love him i think hes still underrated i mean i knew about him had him as a sci fi writer end of story now i think hes a genious will try to read all his work what an extraordinary human being isnt he edited even if readers love him
books,not_removed,hari seldon the prophet d
books,not_removed,i suggest the trilogy first then the two prequels for perspective then the final two for closure after youre done with that pepper in irobot then the robot trilogy then robots and empire and finally end it with the end of eternity your mind will be blown with the fantastic world he created through intertwining his works
books,not_removed,i have read them all and actually quite a few times the original trilogy will stand the test of time re read over and over down through the years but the rest not so much
books,not_removed,i recommend reading in the order written and honestly i would skip the prequels
books,not_removed,i think that we only have one alternative as the reduction of consumption of resources is not enough or too late we need to find ourselves other planets long live the galactic spirit owdear
books,not_removed,thats pretty much the summary of the past years more or less
books,not_removed,audio books work best if you have already read the book i do it all the time when i am working on the road a lot but i find if you have not read the book you rewind a lot
books,not_removed,will check out as im not very good economically im using ebay old editions and one by one
books,not_removed,i like your assessment well done
books,not_removed,ok thanks ill do that ill continue my journey with starting all over again with foundation then foundation and empire and then second foundation is that the right order
books,not_removed,yeah that makes sense doing nothing for so long except listening to it though i could pay attention well enough to not have to rewind at all
books,not_removed,thank you much appreciated hes been my favorite author since i started cranking through his works in the last year or so happy to share what ive learned
books,not_removed,that is a brilliant ending
books,not_removed,and rand wasted so much time just running against the wind
books,not_removed,just make sure you go to the stormlight archive next written by brandon sanderson youll be drooling for the next book its easily the best high fantasy ever written imo
books,not_removed,against the wind
books,not_removed,will do thanks for the tip
books,not_removed,still runnin
books,not_removed,to expand a little on what i said first of all i think sanderson is my favorite fantasy writer mainly because he does such an amazing job of building a world that my imagination can take and run with he spends more time describing things like what stuff looks like and how the world works some people think it makes for too long of a book his two stormlight books are both like pages i think it makes for an engrossing story that you dont want to leave its perfect because i can spend four hours reading one of those books and just feel like im in his world i loved lotr and i think lotr is still maybe a higher level of writing but i enjoy sanderson more because of the length of book and coolness of the magic system technology system thats in place in the stormlight series theres just so many connecting story arcs and you want to know exactly whats going on but you dont so you just keep reading
books,not_removed,if you read the stormlight archives make sure to read warbreaker by brandon sanderson before you read the second stormlight book also you might like rwot
books,not_removed,thank you for the recommendations ill definitely check warbreaker and rwot much appreciated
books,not_removed,i love his war poems i had to study them for literature class and i remember his poetry was one of those texts that really made a huge impact on me my sensitive self actually got emotional quite a few times reading the descriptions about the horrors and inhumanity of war and the kind of suffering that the soldiers had to go through some of my favourite poems include mental cases anthem for doomed youth and disabled
books,not_removed,love this will definitely use with my students when teaching world war i there is so much great raw poetry from that time period
books,not_removed,one of my alltime favourite antiwar poems i love the way owen involves the reader you to implicate us all
books,not_removed,i dont know why we do that prowar propaganda bullshit flanders fields on remembrance day instead of something good like this
books,not_removed,they messed up the flow its deaf even to the hoots of the tired outstripped fivenines that dropped behind i get they were clarifying what a five nine is but still that was my favorite line
books,not_removed,you enjoyed something you had to study i never could even beowulf a story about a guy who goes around murdering monsters and being a general badass managed to bore me to tears when it was required reading
books,not_removed,because in flanders fields far better emphasises the mentality and thought of the men in the trenches than does dulce et decorum est owen has resonance today because he and sassoon basically created the theme of how futile the war was reinforced by the selfserving memoirs of politicians like lloydgeorge written after commanders like haig were safely dead entire books have been written analysing letters and diaries from the trenches and none of them carry in them a sense of futility you need only look at the provenance of in flanders fields to see that mccrae wrote it in a dressing station after seeing one of his friends die and yet he never lost faith in what he was fighting for
books,not_removed,yup i didnt enjoy most of the books that i was assigned either so i was quite relieved that i ended up digging his poetry writing a paper about the subject is always a lot easier when you actually like what youre reading haha
books,not_removed,this subject has been very popular in the past please use reddit search andor check the httpswwwredditcomrbookswikifaq
books,not_removed,once i got a more demanding job my reading slipped when i was a teen i could read a page book in two days now after coming off a nine hour shift its a struggle to read without falling asleep ive made it a habit to arrive to work about minutes early and just sit in the car and read at least then i wont pass out from exhaustion haha
books,not_removed,i was a massive reader from very young childhood through college then a couple years after went into a multiyear lull of reading nothing at all or near enough just making the active choice to read more make it a priority and setting a goodreads challenge goal for the year was all what got me back to it
books,not_removed,yup got out of the habit for a couple years one day i got angry with myself and made it a rule to read for just five minutes before bed if i wanted to keep going fine but i was only required to do five minutes just to make sure i was doing it daily it got me normalized again and now i read as much as i ever have and dont even think about it
books,not_removed,ive always been a reader but there is a lot of competition for my time i remember those days as a kid where i could spend just about all my free time reading not so much anymore and a lot of the reading i do now is jobrelated
books,not_removed,i find switching genres revisiting an old favorite or reading something absolutely terrible whether a published book or fanfiction cures me of read fatigue
books,not_removed,i hit that point this year forcing yourself to read is one way but i also decided to out books down and enjoy life after a while few weeks i missed it so dont feel bad on putting books down theyll always be there when you decide to come back
books,not_removed,this time of year every year it seems like whenever i finish my reading challenge i mentally take some time off it picks up again by the middle of january
books,not_removed,i try to read at least minutes a day if im in a bit of a reading slump reading multiple books at a time can help too finding a short story collection or some graphic novelmanga can also help draw me out of a slump
books,not_removed,yeah but i have been quite drunk last few weeks
books,not_removed,i read constantly as a child and then stopped from ages or so because school kept me busy with required reading but i got back into the habit when i started commuting one thing that helps me get out of a dry spell is rereading something i know i loveusually ya fantasy tbh it eliminates the intimidation of starting something new
books,not_removed,i find it hard to read much when im in school college and grad school werecurrently are all time lows for my reading i found it helpful to build in blocks of time in the day while i drink my coffee in the morning on the half hour break i have between classes during lunch or before bed after reading all the goodreads love above im going to try to set a goal and get back into that community
books,not_removed,this subject has been very popular in the past please check out the httpswwwredditcomrbookswikifaq
books,not_removed,i was totally the same way when i was younger your job sounds rough i dont think i could force myself out of bed early to read but i bet its relaxing to have some me time before work i suggested it to someone else but maybe give audiobooks a try then you could listen while youre driving and not have to wake up early i have to admit though i could never get into them it feels weird to have a stranger read to me for some reason
books,not_removed,thanks for the advice i havent ever actually used goodreads before though ive heard a lot of good things i thought it was mostly a kind of book social network i didnt realize you could set goals with it too you like using it
books,not_removed,thats a really good idea i totally have found it much harder to start but once i get going i dont want to stop i guess i just have a hard time with forcing myself to do it because i used to love it so much it feels weird
books,not_removed,i can totally relate as a kid if i had a free second i was spending it reading im sorry thats a huge pain im in a bit of a different situation ive been sick a lot this past year so ive had loads of free time but i cant bring myself to read for some reason i havent tried them personally but maybe give audiobooks a go you can listen to them on your commute or while making dinner and theres lots of codes to get your first audiobook free from audible
books,not_removed,read fatigue is a good word for it ill have to give your suggestions a try those are some good ideas haha the funny thing about it is ive been reading a ton of fanfiction this past year i think because i dont really count it as reading
books,not_removed,this is such a sweet comment thank you for leaving it actually the reason why i made this post is that ive been missing it so much i was hoping for some strategies and new books to help me to get back into it its really cool that theres such a reading community here on reddit and that i have a place to go to ask for help
books,not_removed,im amazed at how many of you guys have reading goals ive never really aimed to read a certain amount of books before i guess its because i never had to schedule in time to read when i was younger its really admirable of how many books you guys can fit into a year though i might have to give it a try good luck with your next reading challenge
books,not_removed,thanks for the suggestions ill give them a shot
books,not_removed,i can totally relate with required reading although i always loved book discussions in school thanks for the suggestion im big into ya fantasy too
books,not_removed,same working within blocks of time is how i used to read i think maybe the trouble is that i havent found a book thats hooked me in quite awhile haha i know im gonna have to give goodreads a shot i didnt realize it had such a big community
books,not_removed,sorry i did check out the faq but i guess i thought my discussion was different enough from what was there especially because a lot of those posts didnt have many answers and none that suggested specific books this is literally my first post so im still figuring out etiquette and how to do things are you going to take my post down
books,not_removed,i listen to audio books occasionally but tend not to because they can get expensive plus audio book chapters not syncing with my paperback chapters are like my biggest pet peeve hahaha
books,not_removed,i use the social networking part of it very little if at all i do have it linked to fb so you add any friends from fb automatically that use goodreads if you want and then can see what theyre readinglogging but thats more or less all i do with it though i recently just started following a couple authors i like which is interesting because they actually actively post basically blogs mainly i use it to track what im currently reading finished reading ratings commentsreviews on those books there was a recent goodreads thread mistook the one i linked first updated link actually with to their results from goodreads and it displays a nice layout of all the books you read so you can see exactly what that looks like from the link there but more or less from your own view for the yearly challenge you set a book goal then it displays a progress bar on the page all the time showing you if you are keeping up with your goal or how much you are behind pace to hit it
books,not_removed,im with you i do find it difficult to read when im ill but its really more trying to read new things or something requiring a lot of concentration when im sick i tend to go back to reading a lot of the books i enjoyed as a kid that keeps me reading without having to concentrate too hard i hope you get to feeling better in
books,not_removed,you probably read too much fanfiction and your brain has made you stop reading to protect itself
books,not_removed,no problem ive read over books this year however i go through spurts where i refuse to read and just go out and do stuff books are great however sometimes you just have to go out and spend time with friends and family if you need any recommendations let me know give me a genre you like and ill do my best
books,not_removed,i have taken the post down yes if you want suggestions for specific books please post your request in rsuggestmeabook or our weekly thread
books,not_removed,i didnt know that authors used goodreads too thats really cool im not crazy into the social networking aspect of it but i can totally see how that would be encouraging and interesting to people i had a look at the page you linked me to and it was actually pretty interesting it must be fun to have a look at everything you read and all the statistics at the end of the year ive never set a reading goal for myself but so many of you guys seem to do it i might have to give it a try can i ask what was your favorite book you read this year
books,not_removed,thats a great idea i imagine its comforting to cozy up with an old favorite when youre not feeling great ill have to give that a try thanks i hope so too
books,not_removed,holy crap congratulations on thats amazing im totally the same way i dont sweat it when i havent been reading but lately ive been really wanting to get back into it sure id love some i mostly read ya and fantasy but im up for pretty much anything what was your favorite book you read this year
books,not_removed,favorite was monstress but thats a graphic novel so for books proper my favorite was the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime
books,not_removed,lol i have lots of people ask me that however i read so much that its hard to pick one some of my favorite authors this year however are stephen king patrick rothfuss daniel abraham ra salvatore dean koontz and jim butcher
books,not_removed,ive heard good things about the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime ill have to add it to my toread list
books,not_removed,haha i feel the same way whenever someone asks me what my favorite book or my favorite author is it feels like an unfair question ill have to give some of your authors a look i have to admit though the only one ive heard of is stephen king
books,not_removed,oh read jim butcher the dresden files it is better if you read them in the order he wrote them because they happen on a sort of timeline bringing in new characters as the tale grows and the main characters evolve you will be so hooked
books,not_removed,thanks for the suggestion ill have to add them to my toread list i read the summary and some of the reviews and they sound really interestinglike a mix of film noir and fantasy
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,ok thanks
books,not_removed,atticus does not appear to be racist one thing is for sure he stood for equality
books,not_removed,is she referring to mockingbird or the novel go set a watchman the latter is the story as it was originally intended and atticus is portrayed as a racist not sure about the claim regarding microagression though
books,not_removed,screwed up the title my bad
books,not_removed,ive mentioned that to her during our conversation my sister portrays atticus as the white guardian that makes everything alright she believes that his effort to prove tom innocent was just an attempt to make white individuals look good
books,not_removed,shes referring to mockingbird she never read go set a watchmen
books,not_removed,if it were me id probably wait a few years if you enjoy rereading certain booksseries like i sometimes do it will be worth the wait the final book wont be as fresh in your mind which should make the first two books more interesting and surprising
books,not_removed,i would say it really depends on if you liked the characters if reading more about bill holly jerome and brady sounds appealing then definitely go for it i really enjoyed the trilogy myself i will also say book of the series finders keepers involves an entirely different villain and story brady is barely mentioned bill and company are still the same old crew though as for the first one seeing how brady ended up the way he did and seeing the infamous mercedes killings first hand is a pretty great story hope this helps and enjoy
books,not_removed,let me start by saying i have never read these books so my input is not specific to this trilogy if you choose to go back it will be like reading prequels so even though you know the eventual outcome it will likely give you a deeper understanding of why things end up how they did i think if you truly enjoy a story in a series it is always worth it to give the rest of the series a try
books,not_removed,if youre interested in how it started you should read the rest
books,not_removed,i havent read them myself but i always recommend going back and finding out how things were in the beginning especially with it being king and a well loved series it probably wont suck
books,not_removed,i would read them especially if you enjoyed the final one
books,not_removed,the first one is the best i wouldnt bother with the second but if you liked end of watch i guess maybe you will like it i hated the second and third books all the stories are selfcontained so it doesnt really matter the order its just you get a bit of a conclusion in the third
books,not_removed,too late
books,not_removed,this is an interesting option ive already started another book so i wont be reading them right away regardless maybe i will just wait a while to start the others thanks
books,not_removed,i really do like the characters they were the best part of the book i enjoyed the overall story but the character interactions were my favorite part its funny when i started the book i found myself wishing they would elaborate on the mercedes killings more instead of moving to another storyline haha i guess thats a sign i should just go back and read it huh
books,not_removed,very good point i liked the story and the character a lot and more stephen king is always a good thing thanks
books,not_removed,thats how i felt about it as well fairly average crime story but with fantastic characters getting in the mind of brady was very unsettling i saw in another comment that youve moved onto another book so once eow isnt so fresh in your mind give the first two a visit
books,not_removed,when she finishes reading she says something like and thus ends mr pepys for today assuming this is a realworld book she may be referring to httpwwwpepysdiarycomdiarysummary he was a british mp who kept a very detailed diary for pretty much all of the giving us wonderful insights into life at the time
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules your post is better suited for asking in rwhatsthatbook or rtipofmytongue
books,not_removed,thank you
books,not_removed,oh sorry ill do that next time
books,not_removed,you adrenaline junkie you
books,not_removed,someone call the police and stop this mad man
books,not_removed,easy there big fella
books,not_removed,i quite often have two or three books on the go and itll take a few pages to pick up the plot when switching books for a book like war and peace id recommend not reading another book at the same time because there is so much information
books,not_removed,read book one and book two in the same series you daredevil you
books,not_removed,the only way i can sanely read two books at once is if one is fiction and the other non
books,not_removed,im like you im more of a one book at a time person if i try to read more than one book at a time i usually lose interest in the first book and finish the second and dont feel like picking the first one back up again not because its a bad book but because my attention span is that of a squirrel its very easy for me lose interest in a book just because i want to read a different book
books,not_removed,i am currently reading books and about to start book my only recommendation is dont read a little every day portion the books into parts or logical sections and read one book until a logical stopping point and then read the other book this way your brain will feel like it is watching a show one episode at a time the other way is to read chapter of a book you are not enjoying but feel the need to read it and then spend the rest of the day reading for pleasure
books,not_removed,i recently realized that i do much better when i read multiple books at a time it also helps me spread my branches more quickly and thus enables me to find a book that truly captivates me i was reading book of he new sun hard boiled wonderland fianovar tapestry and redwall at the same time and ended up flying with just fionavar and hard boileddepending on my mood that day i feel like a lot of the times we as readers feel like we have to stick to one book that can be a huge commitment and stifle our desire to start certain big reads just let it flow read what you want when you want and the book you need will come your way maybe you will get sucked into one maybe you will finish a couple at a time either way dont let that fear of commitment come into your heart too many times i think that will ruin a reading experience for us as we will always be asking ourselves if we should have started book a instead
books,not_removed,if one of the two is indeed going to be war and peace to be safe maybe the other one should be goodnight moon or the bimart coupon book it would have be for me anyway
books,not_removed,the best way to read more than one book at once i think is to keep everything about them separate where you read each when you read each and the two or more books should be fairly different in style and genre so you read le carre during the day when you take reading breakseat lunch or are commuting or whatever then you read war and peace for half an hour when you get into bed at night and you keep a humorous or nonfiction book in the bathroom and you have a collection of short stories on your phone for standing in line at the banksomething like this it will keep them separate in your head dont just read one for half an hour put it down then pick up the other one and read that for half an hour the two styles wont mix your brain will still be thinking about one while you read the other and youll most likely have trouble with both being unsatisfying or annoying its not hard to do but it does take more brain power and focus than just watching an episode of one tv show and then one of a different tv show for example
books,not_removed,wp is a fairly easy and pleasant read it just looks and feels daunting but if you can read asoiaf you can read wp
books,not_removed,oh you should probably not be thinking this hard about douglas adams novels no good can come of this
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules your post is better suited for asking in rwhatsthatbook or rtipofmytongue
books,not_removed,man that sounds infuriating i did a few quick google searches but with no luck i was in a similar spot a few months ago when i was trying to remember the name of a book i had really liked as a kid httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinterstellarpig ps i went to school with bruce covilles kids its neither here nor there but just kind of funny to see his name out there
books,not_removed,haha it really is quite frustrating thanks for looking anyway ill have to check out interstellar pig sometime it sounds interesting and haha no way that is funny what a small world
books,not_removed,i am surprised to hear about the dust jacket recommendation i always viewed it as being more geared towards the citizens instead of the soldiers as a heres what you should do if you get invaded type of deal i wonder what the intent was with sending it to the soldiers what not to do if they invade a town
books,not_removed,do not post shallow content im sorry but your post currently counts as shallow content do you have something else to say about the book that you could edit into the text preferably your own thoughts about the book or at the least a description of the book without spoilers let me know if you edit it i can reinstate your post

books,not_removed,ebooks go
books,not_removed,its a cool old book but it doesnt seem like its worth anything as its not a first edition and it doesnt have a dust jacket you could double check at rbookcollecting if you wanted to through
books,not_removed,i can post some more pictures of the artwork its really unique compared to other editions of this book ive read
books,not_removed,i work at an indie bookstore we have a copy similar to that one listed for in very good condition
books,not_removed,grosset dunlap is primarily a reprint house so the vast majority of their books are worthless but in this case they actually used the original printing dies on loan from macmillan to print their editions so it isnt completely worthless its still the equivalent of an printing with no dust jacket and minus the more iconic original artwork so the value is quite limited but probably or so
books,not_removed,if its actually from then not having a dust jacket is no big deal as keeping the dust jacket on wasnt a big deal until a couple decades later used to be theyd come in brown paper and then the paper got more elaborate but it almost looks too good might be a reissue they often just recreate the book altogether as it once looked right down to the date of issue and whatnot is there a thread on the spine keeping it together is there a price are the pages cut different lengths does it smell old in general the poster recommending rbookcollecting is right people there are pretty great but they would probably like to see a few more photos
books,not_removed,thats what i figured im keeping it either way but i like to know what ive got in my collection i try and get early editions of all my favorite books the brothers karamazov seven years in tibet and brave new world are my favoritemost unique ones
books,not_removed,please do
books,not_removed,as keeping the dust jacket on wasnt a big deal until a couple decades later not true if it came with one that is still important for its value
books,not_removed,just to clarify what the other guy said dust jackets not being kept doesnt make them less important it makes them infinitely more important for example you can buy a decent copy of the first printing of call of the wild for a copy with a dust jacket in the same condition is worth at least that
books,not_removed,absolutely if its there thatd be amazing but to the best of my knowledge seeing they were often just a brown paper wrapping they were rarely kept and so its not a thing that collectors necessarily look for or hold out for seeing its so rare as to be nonexistent a collector would hold out for a copy of the grapes of wrath in the original dust jacket but for a book that came out thirty years earlier which was issued in a brown paper wrapping theyre probably not even looking for it to have a dust jacket
books,not_removed,he was my favorite author as a kid
books,not_removed,the short stories of jorge luis borges address time memory and paralleling or competing realities
books,not_removed,faulkners the sound and the fury comes to mind if youre wondering about time in novels
books,not_removed,many of virginia woolfs novels are heavily centered on both time and memory and she was influenced by henri bergson ‚Äìwhose ideas on time and memory shed used in writing to the lighthouse‚Äì and proust himself ‚Äìwhom shed read i believe in the original french‚Äì she praised john ruskin ‚Äìa strong and direct influence on proust‚Äì in one of her common reader series saying that his praeterita was perhaps his best and most anxietyfree work as a lengthy multivolume book of his own recollections impressions and observations it resembles prousts search and so where to start with her largely depends on what perspective youre most interested in jacobs room is a meditation on the bergsonian moment though interestingly mediated more heavily by snapshots rendered in spatialized time orlando is a meditation on the persistency of personhood the way in which our experiences are gathered together memories constructed and arranged and their implications as to our person to the lighthouse is another meditation on how time is experienced and remembered as well as its effects ‚Äìand this subtly constructed in its narrative two days separated by ten years each day being rendered in extremely exacting detail while the intervening section that of ten years is highly compressed and obscure‚Äì
books,not_removed,right jennifer egan a visit from the goon squad
books,not_removed,i have literally never heard this where are you reading literary criticism where its implied that proust is the only author referred to or discussed when time is a theme thats not a thing
books,not_removed,nabokovs autobiography speak memory reminds me a lot of proust same idea very detailed memories of childhood sensations and feelings
books,not_removed,i think that is probably because humans remember visually rather than verbally it is hard to get that mix of haziness from years passing and comforting nostalgia in writing that being said kundera often writes about memory the book of laughter and forgetting is an obvious candidate
books,not_removed,how about timequake by kurt vonnegut and joyces a portrait of the artist as a young man
books,not_removed,thank you for this amazing post please if you have any more recommendations please do this was what i was looking for congratulations on your reading
books,not_removed,yes a book that deserves attention and scholarship
books,not_removed,i think op is asking for other authors works with well developed themes of time and memory like proust you seem to think there are others do you mind sharing them
books,not_removed,speak memory that i may not forget the taste of roses and the sound of ashes in the wind do you happen to know who the poet is

books,not_removed,i really like the farseer trilogy by robin hobb it is my favorite fantasy series such interesting and likable characters while also feeling like a completely unique take on how a fantasy series should go doesnt seem to suffer from as nearly as many of the common hats we see fantasy novels all wearing
books,not_removed,the god of small things by arundhati roy the giver by lois lowry
books,not_removed,i wouldnt say that i have a favorite book in any category but here are a few standouts ive recently read novel the handmaids tale by margaret atwood short stories a good man is hard to find by flannery oconnor nonfiction the six wives of henry viii by alison weir
books,not_removed,all the masters of rome books by colleen mccullough in my opinion it does not matter at all whos writing our books as long as they do a great job but i find that most of the books by female authors ive read tend to be rather slowpaced and introspective that is not good or bad it is just the way it is
books,not_removed,its really hard to pick just one but if i had to it would definitely be the night circus by erin morgenstern its not high literature like the awakening or anything but its always an emotional read for me it always makes me feel like theres a little magic in the world even if i cant always see it
books,not_removed,notorious rbg by irin carmon and shana knizhnik bio of ruth bader ginsburg wild swans by jung chang memoirbio of the author her mother and grandmother living in china in the earlymid good girls revolt by lynn povich hopefully the tv show gets picked up for a second season great true story of a class action discrimination lawsuit the fifth season by nk jemisin im not usually a fantasy fan but this was amazing the scarlet pimpernel by emmuska orczy classic swashbuckler and many many more

books,not_removed,id be hard pressed to pick one since i honestly dont pay attention to whether the author is male or female
books,not_removed,oh the handmaids tale i love that book margaret atwood in general is phenomenal
books,not_removed,the bell jar has always been one of my favorites even including male authors like you said
books,not_removed,i was also going to say the bell jar sylvia is very close to my heart as well as cats eye by margaret atwood although i loved the handmaids tale as well
books,not_removed,havent read gone girl but dark places and sharp objects were awesome
books,not_removed,really ill give it to her that shes imaginative but i think her writing is abysmal sharp objects read like it was written by a sixth grader who just discovered figurative language
books,not_removed,i am ashamed to admit that i didnt realise until then that harper lee was a woman but i do now so thank you for inadvertently educating me
books,not_removed,how has this only been mentioned once thats one of my all time favorite books
books,not_removed,ive read that one too it was certainly thoughtprovoking i find atwood generally is very much so have you read the rest of the trilogy
books,not_removed,she is so fricking good her short stories are wonderful
books,not_removed,her short stories are amazing especially agmihtf
books,not_removed,picked up ancillary justice a few months ago great book and series with a really great way of handling languages but iirc it was the authors first fulllength series which sometimes shows a bit still really enjoyable

books,not_removed,robin mckinley writes my favorite fantasy without a doubt
books,not_removed,i loved the ending seeing her old home with new eyes is something that really resonated with me like odysseus return to ithaca
books,not_removed,ive been meaning to read that one
books,not_removed,a true classic
books,not_removed,i read it for the first time last year and i found it surprisingly insightful on feminism
books,not_removed,thats definitely why i asked
books,not_removed,i just read the diviners and i adored it libba bray is awesome as is ya
books,not_removed,a tale for the time being is so beautiful really loved the ending

books,not_removed,genuinely one of the funniest writers ive encountered

books,not_removed,the cipher was not an easy book to get a hold of but it was worth it
books,not_removed,ive read a few of atwoods and completely loved them but not the blind assassin yet so ill definitely be giving that one a try soon
books,not_removed,definitely yes to the blind assassin beautifully written
books,not_removed,honestly this is why i asked this to get people to think about what books they read and by whom
books,not_removed,i think the god of small things remains to be one of the most surprising books ive read started expecting nothing and was blown away
books,not_removed,omg the god of small things is devastating in its beauty i havent read the giver yet but we read lyddie when i was in fifth grade and i didnt realize they were by the same author until recently i just bought number the stars last week to read again i loved that book growing up
books,not_removed,i agree excellent book
books,not_removed,i was going to say the thorn birds ive come across masters of rome often but never picked it up im reading thorn birds again for the nth time
books,not_removed,i loved the night circus i should reread it its been much too long

books,not_removed,a du maurier mention silently nodding to what you said about gone girl

books,not_removed,yes most of her stuffgood to hear shes still alive and still sharp as a razor
books,not_removed,harry potters to be expected so people are probably skipping it

books,not_removed,i actually have a bell jar inspired tattoo i am i am i am above an anatomical heart
books,not_removed,the writing didnt bother me admittedly but to be fair sharp objects was her first novel

books,not_removed,do ir was a book i had to read in high school but it was pretty interesting

books,not_removed,now i want to list a bunch of stuff on sale on cl
books,not_removed,per httpswwwredditcomrbookswikirules please post book recommendation requests including asking if you should read a certain book in rsuggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread
books,not_removed,you said that this can sometimes turn you off of some books or authors just out of curiosity what are some authors youve consistently had a problem with in regards to your imaginationimportant traits being introduced too late im not a visual person at all and i very rarely visualise characters so this is interesting to me and i can see how it would be jarring
books,not_removed,how to take the fun out of reading in different ways is more like it schedule it make it part of your job get a kindle and audible subscription write regularly track it and use social pressure only read books that get you physically excited seek a transformational reading experience realize its really high leverage some of these tips really make it seem like reading would become a boring chore pretty quickly just read what you like to read how you want to read and when you want to read maybe schedule half an hour of reading for yourself before you go to bed
books,not_removed,i definitely use some of these tricksaudiobooks and planning ahead have had the biggest impactbut i think some of the other items on this list are less valuable social pressure only really works if you have a community like this one but smaller as i figure most people wont really care to keep up with a new book every week i dont even know what this nonsense is about transformational exciting books some books are not exciting and most are not a transformational experience and thats fine
books,not_removed,i have a long commute so i listen to a lot of audio books between that and not watching tv i get over books read a year
books,not_removed,hey i recommend scheduling reading especially for people who are trying to find the time
books,not_removed,that is probably the one i have the least problems with and it actually makes sense to pick a time of day to read when you naturally have some dead time that you would normally spend watching tv or browsing reddit i wouldnt call that scheduling though more like making a conscious decision to change your priorities i get that some or all of these would work for others i just think if i were to follow this advice reading would start to feel forced
books,not_removed,theres an aftertheending epilogue which got cut but you could read it by jumping through various social media hoops its delicious
books,not_removed,i kinda liked the ending the feral kids were the future humanity was over spreading the spores just helped it along
books,not_removed,i felt the same initially when i finished it during the rbooks bookclub read of it but ive come around it was different and interesting you might be interested in reading through the bookclub posts and author ama threads are collected httpswwwredditcomrbookswikibookclub
books,not_removed,i cant say that i was expecting that ending but i wasnt surprised either once the group arrives to london it gets clear that theres no turning back its not anymore about fighting hungries or junkies but about the loss of any hope of salvation for humans i didnt like everything about this book sometimes its too slow gallaghers ending doesnt make much sense to me and other small things but i must say it delivered i wonder if the movie will be able to capture that feeling of despair and end of the world which permeates the whole book in a way it reminds me of children of men
books,not_removed,i actually didnt expect this ending which was great it was different from something predictable i was getting a bit bored with it halfway through but the end started to really pick up
books,not_removed,httpwwworbitbooksnetwpcontentuploadsgwatgsecretchapterpdf
books,not_removed,i want to keep this link thanks
books,not_removed,thank you so much for posting this link i loved the book and the ending but wanted just one more chapter and this delivered everything i felt was missing from the books ending
books,not_removed,i only reread if its been so long since the previous book that i feel i no longer remember the full story
books,not_removed,i dont reread the previous installments because of two reasons i generally never reread books ive made some exceptions in the past but overall i dont reread second i burn out on a certain writing style pretty quickly as in two or three books in a row by the same author and i will become annoyed by their writing quirks so if i were to reread every previous installments before reading the new one i would probably be incapable of fully enjoying the book on its own merits i also dont really have a problem picking up on references to previous events in the book while i agree some authors are better at it than others most do try to include any important matters from previous books at the beginning of the new installment
books,not_removed,depends on how much of a gap between when next installment is coming out and when i have read the last released installment if its a couple months then i read on if its close to a year or more then i reread
books,not_removed,yes i reread the previous installments or sometimes only some parts of the last books
books,not_removed,it depends usually i reread same thing if i have to put a series down for an extended period of time before finishing it the only times i dont reread is if the series is overly long or if ive read it so much that i pretty much know it by heart
books,not_removed,i reread them if its been a long time since the last book came out
books,not_removed,if its been a while since i read the previous book in the series i might reread the last few chapters before starting the new book
books,not_removed,if its something ive been anticipating i generally listen to the audio book while im at work or doing something else its an easy and less time consuming way to refresh myself on the events that happened without putting forth a lot of effort
books,not_removed,i used to but now that ive started reading more i simply dont feel like i have the time there are too many books to read i have however started writing reviewsnotes while reading books so i can revisit those later and get a bit up to speed
books,not_removed,i reread but i also rewatch a series when a new season comes out lol
books,not_removed,read the next book reread if its been a while
books,not_removed,same here
books,not_removed,great reading list big fan of coetzee why only the bellow in march i read the victim and dangling man this year my
books,not_removed,i listed in another thread yesterday so i shant repeat them in summary books completed in progress probably another in december so probably books this year i read about half fiction half non the fictions pretty mainstream i didnt read much when i was in college or do anything else really im just now watching the office so was mostly me catching up on the books ive heard about but havent read nonfiction is somewhat slanted toward religion and memoirs by female comedians but not overwhelmingly so
books,not_removed,i robot is the only book we have in common for the year i thoroughly enjoyed it though i have only read books this year been digging deep on manga some of it is incredible but a lot of fluff
books,not_removed,you read moby dick during one of your busiest months im impressed
books,not_removed,usually im reluctant to read books when ive already seen the movie based upon it i like to read the book first but this year i read stephen kings the shining after having already seen the movie and my god i loved it
books,not_removed,sometimes life gets in the way i try to make up for it when i can i love bellow and roth ive read most of their stuff in the past few years
books,not_removed,ill usually have at least one physical book on the go and one book on my phone for commuting mobydick was the commuter that month
books,not_removed,starts reading article laughs buys more books
books,not_removed,i get rid of books that were just meh or not my taste by donating them but if i like or love a book im keeping it its not a one time thing for me i know im going to want to read it again its just silly to get rid of something you know you will use again and books arent clutter to people who love them theres ways to make a collection work even in small spaces
books,not_removed,all i know is that epub drive more reading time than i have life left
books,not_removed,he mentions the resale value more than once i suppose thats valid if someone takes the antiquarian approach and the books are just objects to be bought and sold for a profit the same way any other commodity object is someone doesnt even need to be a reader to take that approach theres definitely value in reducing clutter though i think we all have that pile of books next to our bed thats mentally labeled i will read this pile one day as were still visiting used book stores and the library rather than reducing clutter internally im reducing clutter by just accumulating less of it perhaps not as efficient but i dont buy a book new or used unless i know its a keeper or i cant get it from the library everything else i get from the library
books,not_removed,buy more bookcases make furniture from stacks of books easy
books,not_removed,i was prepared to be offended and defend my book collection touche sir i was just chatting with my friend about building up a bookshelf on one wall of the living room
books,not_removed,funny to me the books with resale value are likely to also be the ones worth keeping lots of old reference books and books on history are still both valuable and useful and are full of tons of things that cannot be easily found on the internet i know its hard to imagine that there are useful things that are not on the internet but in fact the vast majority of human knowledge is not on the net or in any other digital form this is even with guys like google scanning in books continuously every day i am surprised the article didnt just link to some craft diy on how to make tree ornaments out of books or something
books,not_removed,i really dont understand why reddit has a such a problem with what to do with books nearly every day theres some thread like dae that to do with extra books used book store for money donate to practically anywhere library church goodwill etc recycling garbage craigslist for free in a box
books,not_removed,so how do you actually get rid of them this article is about choosing books to get rid of not how to get rid of them what places buy them i know libraries take donations but some books are worth selling
books,not_removed,
books,not_removed,i just had a flashback to when borders shuttered
books,not_removed,this makes me feel better that im not the only one that has trophies or sentimental value i have a lucille ball biography that ive been meaning to get around to but even if i dont i will never get rid of it because my uncle gave it to me who is a big i love lucy fan too but seriously just donate those book you finished reading and know youll never read again give someone else an adventure in that world maybe leave that person a note in that book
books,not_removed,life changing i dont know about that i just got rid of boxes of books and the only thing that changed about my life is that i got over a thousand bucks in store credit to buy more books
books,not_removed,i read this with the marie kondos book literally by my side now i feel empty and confused on the inside
books,not_removed,i guess the author of that article and i come from very different paths in life some of the books most integral to my collection still have dollar tree stickers on the back i couldnt give a shit about resale value
books,not_removed,books arent investments theyre resources and sources of escape
books,not_removed,books arent clutter to people who love them aw this made me smile
books,not_removed,and yet nothing smells better than a brand new book
books,not_removed,agreed the problem is always not enough shelves too many books is a problem that just doesnt exist
books,not_removed,i dont need a bedside table because there are several stacks of books at varying heights at the side
books,not_removed,give the ones that are worth selling to the library too
books,not_removed,i miss borders
books,not_removed,its just a reference to the book the lifechanging magic of tidying up
books,not_removed,or an old one too
books,not_removed,well not everyone lives in spacious houses i only have room for my three bookshelves although i havent started making furniture from books yet
books,not_removed,until you have to move then it very much does exist i just switched apartments in my building and i was pretty fed up at the end of that process
books,not_removed,i love the smell of
books,not_removed,love his books i wonder how much his name affected his popularity i know there have been times when i could have recommended him when i recommended an author whose name i knew how to pronounce project gutenberg has of his books available copyright was never renewed
books,not_removed,i remember reading big red and loving it when i was younger i remember there was a sequel that i read too but the name escapes me i enjoyed it too i believe i read something else be him but i cant remember what
books,not_removed,additionally i thought haunt fox was very reminiscent of call of the wild in a lot of ways this added to my surprise that his works arent very celebrated considering how iconic call of the wild is
books,not_removed,kyellguard i think
books,not_removed,irish red and outlaw red are sequels to big red
books,not_removed,irish red i remember it now good stuff

books,not_removed,when i was my grandparents gave me edmondo de amicis heart it was the first long story i had ever read and it was so easy to relate to schoolage children that it soon became my favorite it also boosted my childhood and adolescence obsession for collecting stamps i tried to read it every other year if time allows which inevitably takes me back to checking my old stamp collecting albums
books,not_removed,no i dont want to destroy my good memories of the book i guess if ill read some again ill realise how bad they were
books,not_removed,the girl with the silver eyes by willo davis roberts
books,not_removed,pride and prejudice is one of my favorites that i read every few years ive read jude by kate morgenroth again as an adult and its was very interesting how much my perception change affected what stuck with me im currently reading the count of monte cristo for this reason also im only halfway through so i am excited to see how it ends because i forgot almost of the book i will add a wrinkle in time to my reread list as well i remember loving it one day ill work up the courage to read wuthering heights againit was just such a horrible experience the first time that ive been putting it off for years i tried to read the heart is a lonely hunter again but it was too sad i didnt finish it

books,not_removed,little women i reread it once every year or two in the winter i purchased the humongous annotated edition last year so thats the edition ill be reading this year im looking forward to it
books,not_removed,ive been reading some to my daughter most recently it was charlottes web i loved that book as a kid and i couldnt remember why or much of what the book was about when i read it to my daughter i cried like crazy in hindsight i understand so much more of why that book spoke to me when i was a kid i read it shortly after my father died i was confused about life and death
books,not_removed,i realized a few years ago when the giver movie came out and i looked up the plot of the book after nothing in the trailer looking familiar that i didnt really understand that book when i read it i didnt have the societal context to understand it so im making it a point to reread all of the books i read and enjoyed as a younger human to glean more from them and to see what has changed what the impact of the book is on me today as an adult versus when i was a kid some ill be rereading are susan coopers dark rising series madeline lengles a wrinkle in time the redwall series by brian jaques never finished it anyway so i want to do that
books,not_removed,i read my side of the mountain when i was like or then read it to my son when he was about the same age i read it about once a decade atlas shrugged is one i first read in college and have reread it almost every presidential election cycle since never gets old
books,not_removed,ive never heard of any of these but my friends have children so i may look them up for them thank you
books,not_removed,i love how books do that dont just take us back to the story world but to the time in our lives when we read them
books,not_removed,hmm never thought of it like that so far ive been lucky and have still enjoyed the old books
books,not_removed,ohhh i like the title may have to check it out
books,not_removed,oh man pp is an all time favorite as is comc i also loved the three musketeers i should look at that again
books,not_removed,oh man such a good book i havent read it years now i want to again
books,not_removed,always a good read i got copies for my friends kids so id have another reason to read those stories again
books,not_removed,i never read the phantom tollbooth but the way everyone talks abt it i want to now
books,not_removed,its definitely a winter time read i hope you enjoy it
books,not_removed,i always adored that book my friends have a daughter names charlotte so i bought her a fancy collectors copy i hope shell like it when shes older
books,not_removed,i never really liked that book as a kid or an adult but i reread it when i saw the movie was being made i never read the dark rising series may have to look into that
books,not_removed,you should its a pretty fast read and i think it holds up pretty well
books,not_removed,poorlywritten dialogue would ensue
books,not_removed,i believe prim and rue to be younger than rachel and she would seem older than she is anyway so i do not think that would be an issue but i do not think rachel would just fight everyone that easily katniss would not pick a fight and merely try to avoid her if she had nothing to say rachel probably would be impressed with katnissis skills with the blow and think it is pretty cool
books,not_removed,rwhowouldwin
books,not_removed,katniss would either a start crying andor hyperventilating b lock herself in a cupboard c possibly faint and then rachel would turn into a bear and eat her like the bamf she is
books,not_removed,is the hunger games a poor written book im actually curious i have maybe read books tops in my lifetime so i dont have alot to compare it too i thought it was consired one of the better written young adult novelsthe one atleast
books,not_removed,actually rachel starts off being twelve as are both prim and rue only in the final books the animorphs are older but i think youre right that they wouldnt just fight
books,not_removed,remember that it got to you without any special handling its what books do bide their time a hundred years is nothing frankly to a book a serious bookseller in fact would never refer to a book as old even after years let alone put it standing on a shelf between other books not tight and not leaning picturesquely not lying down either unless it is a large quarto or folio if lying nothing goes on it unless it is another book keep it out of direct light sunlight especially not in the direct line of forced air or air conditioning not in a humid room not over a radiator not near smoke dust infrequently dust doesnt harm the book just brush it off with a soft brush if it is a prize book it may be a leather binding the english were given prize bindings in school often dont polish it or try to hydrate it nothing really works better to leave it alone unless it is gummy and dirty from previous applied dressing as ugrandfatherrat has said no bags and certainly never sealed heshe is also correct about a clamshell box you can pretty easily check out the series of youtube vids by sage reynolds edit tone phypos source book collector bindings specifically none in horrific plastic bags made a few clamshell most just sitting on a shelf
books,not_removed,light handling if you open it try not to bend the spine if any of the pages are disconnected or falling out you may be able to repair that with a thin coat of white glue but be careful doing any kind of repairs best advice if you want to retain it exactly as it is is to put it in a sealed bag and put it flat on the bottom of your hope chest and forget about it
books,not_removed,sealed bags are a bad idea they promote condensation and you will never see them in a collection of really rare books if you must keep your book in a plastic bag dont seal it up or you risk mold or foxing a clamshell is the proper thing to preserve a book in if you can afford one you can also make one yourself if you have the time and patience it doesnt have to be pretty just hold the book securely in a space where it can breathe

books,not_removed,i went to a readingtalk thing in like or i didnt really meet himi hadnt read anything by him but i knew who he was by reputation and some older friends of mine were going so i tagged along i remember thinking that he seemed kind of combative and pretentious like he thought he was better than everyone therebut i was in middle school at the time probably too young and it was a public event which ive come to realize takes a lot out of authorspublic figures i wouldnt dismiss him entirely from that one event but i do remember everyone i was with feeling really disappointed and let down by him i imagine if hed been met on his own circumstances it would have been totally different
books,not_removed,why are you assuming anyone on here met him at best maybe years ago someone went to a book signing or something but thats hardly meeting him
