canada,removed,he is left to canadians on some issues education minimum wage he is for higher levels of cooperate taxation than even the ndp proposed but america can get away with higher levels of cooperate taxation he is for a tax on stock transactions which is generally opposed on the left and right because its goddamned stupid if you look into what happened in countries that implimented similar taxes it has a significant impact on investment gdp negatively affects stock market trading volume which increases stock market volatility or keeps it the same which basically eliminates any argument that this tax will somehow tame the stock market i consider a tax like that something you implement during a large war there are much better places to raise taxes generally though

canada,removed,this happens because a segment of the population actually thinks that people who criticize the more violent bigoted homophobic and misogynistic aspects of islam are necessarily doing so from a place of hatred obviously there are intolerant and ignorant assholes who cant tell a sikh from a hindu from a muslim and who think islam is the brown religion there are also intelligent logical rational people who see issues with the practices of a small but significant population of muslims as well as the religious beliefs that encourage those practices that are embraced by larger segments of muslims at large there is more doctrinal and practical diversity in islam than most people know but that does not excuse the shitty doctrines and practices so when i see someone make a salient point about something like death for apostasy something we have seen happen and some apologist says well you islamophobe the prophet said let there be no compulsion in religion so there isnt it makes my blood boil

canada,removed,the greatest thing about opposition to pipelines is that most people treat them like they do a burger from a fast food chain that burger gets to your plate by sacrificing a mammal grinding that dutiful mammal up packaging it and sending it to your gullet you think a butcher is overly fond of killing his flock what these people who are anti pipeline dont understand is that if you flick a switch and just stopped oil flow the planet stops the amount of things developed and produced jobs included by refining oil allows them the bikescars to attend protests the things in cell phones and computers to organize the protests and those are two small examples alberta and other oil based industries take the hate and animosity and do the heavy lifting so these starbucks drinking yuppies can sit there and say not in my backyard or we should have alternative energy now who do you think are investing in renewables o g why cause they know that eventually theyll need to change directions and pivot and shut off the tap but you know to get electric cars you need electric car refueling stations and you need infrastructure to support them do you think the government should foot the bill or private enterprise if the government why why should they do it when companies like shell already exist and have gas stations private enterprise theres not enough electric cars on the road to validate installing the infrastructure even just adding one electric fuel pump on each station would be a huge cost sink thats just one example of the hurdles the planet has to get by before you can get us all off oil so why dont you let us in alberta do the work we choose to do get shit on for doing and if the rest of canada could stop vilifying us for it and stop standing in the way of progress that lets canada obtain more wealth thatd be great tldr fuck right off and if you think you can do something better go right ahead you antipipeline people

canada,removed,women and society will beseech your apology in an effort to see if you are a weakling and unable to stand by your actions are you a beta they will subconsciously ask as the men prepare a hasty guiltridden comment these days they hardly even have to ask anymore men are freely handing out apologies like prayers on sunday an apology is a disguised shit test a man acts with intentionality his words and deeds are grounded by fundamental purpose and thoughtfulness as the primary designer and originator of this purpose a man accepts full responsibility for any outcome of his actions this responsibility is not shared because overall responsibility cannot be delegated therefore very few things a man does are by mistake whenever someone asks you to apologize or the social atmosphere begs your apology stop and think if you had acted like a man ought to there is no apologizing you did what you wanted to do you may have caused damage or hurt someone but that was your will that was your intention what are you apologizing for it is very much in the feminist agenda to reframe the debate by redirecting blame to make it a sexist one real world example when germany cried for sigmar gabriel to apologize for flipping his middle finger to a bunch of nazi protestors in august his response was that his only mistake was not using both hands that shut everyone up really quick because they knew they were dealing with someone who owns his actions a leader not a follower

canada,removed,not all speeding leads to accidents super also firing a gun at someone does not always result in injuries you know bullets miss so i guess firing a gun at someone is a victimless crime i did not realize something must result in a specific consequence of the time for it to be a reasonable possibility of the action perhaps i should move to your black white absolute world it sounds awesome many accidents happen when people are under the speed limit yes and a lot of the time it is because those people are breaking other laws governing use of motor vehicles such as running red lights and driving by stop signs are all of those actions victimless actions as well because they not have the same negative consequence of the time but going or in an zone isnt a crime then why do people have outstanding fines for going or in zones it seems odd that we would fine if they were not breaking the law seriously i feel sorry for your coworkers whoever they are i only had to read two posts of delusions but they are properly stuck with you for hours a week
canada,removed,jesus stfu
canada,removed,well it felt like he was driven over backed up over then raped and dismembered feels count as facts in
canada,removed,amazing i didnt think that was possible but then again i only watch rebel media infowards and breitbart make canada great again sjws are everywhere but seriously toronto does kind of suck it really has no soul in fact probably its multiculturalism and lack of crime are its only redeeming features

canada,removed,its called war for life and sovereignty you candy ass fucks dont know shit about it
canada,removed,thanks for the instant downvotes guys i would much rather you try to justify this buzzfeedmtv level of government funded blatant propaganda but if you want to just anonymously downvote like the true heroes you are please continue
canada,removed,there is he is extremely antitrump antirepublican proscience but that means he doesnt believe in magic too now do you have any comment about the article or just leaving an ad hominem comment
canada,removed,it is called a typo anyone with an iq higher than their hat size would recognize it as that and let it pass
canada,removed,ooohh hes digging into my comment history now im one step away from getting doxxed for anyone following this comment chain our enlightened liberal here posted and then immediately deleted a comment that went something like and im paraphrasing here go suck trumps dick
canada,removed,oh god fuck thank you youre a breath of fresh air someone finally putting in a bit of intelligent perspective however as much as i would love to engage you time to head off to sleep but thanks for putting in that bit of sobriety there appreciated
canada,removed,reported for being a bully
canada,removed,labour is like all other commodities subject to supply and demand when the state under the subtle direction of big corporations brings in massive amounts of immigrants what theyre really doing is creating an ultra competitive labour market where wages can stagnate of course the economists will claim that the demand these people create will spur more more demand but this simply isnt the case i honestly cant even fathom how young people are watching their future slip away because their state would rather import people than encourage growth from within must be really terrible being a hopeful young canadian leaving college and finding out you cant even afford to have a child
canada,removed,the left and right are in agreement that all people should be able to access healthcare and daycare if they want the left and right both believe all kids should have education that all people should have food security and so on and so forth we simply do not agree on the means to get to the end point i dont think that you should be able to access childcare at the cost of the taxpayer theyre your fucking children so you take care of them why the fuck should i have to pay anything at all because you decided to have unprotected sex fuck that its current year wear a condom and get your old lady some of that free birth control thats floating around everywhere additionally please find the line in the canadian charter where youre entitled to food security or higher education neither of these rights exist anywhere except in that liberal brain of yours if you want to be food secure or work towards earning a useless degree in greek mythology or french literature get a fucking job and pay for it yourself its actually a pretty basic principle you want something you work for it
canada,removed,very sad i think she might be a victim of sex trafficking i hope the police find her if you google her name theres a twitter page for her maybe one of the suspects is a follower who knows very sad
canada,removed,of course the guys are brown
canada,removed,she put herself out there so having a valid complaint makes it alright for people to threaten her what the actual fuck is wrong with your brain man
canada,removed,just judge people by their character you mean like judging violently hateful bigots that worship a pedophile warlord and cause mass rape and misery everywhere they spread as bad people
canada,removed,fuck you seriously go fuck yourself in your fat fucking ass with a pineapple
canada,removed,none of the students here i attend the same school as her are really surprised
canada,removed,she can just make up lies and everyone will believer her only men need facts to prove their side of the story in a hesaidshesaid the man is doomed
canada,removed,by a witness theyre not typically named you also made an earlier comment suggesting she ran off on her own apparently completely unaware that she was reportedly forced into a van so dont pretend you read the article you ignorant fuck
canada,removed,canada and america werent destroyed by waves of immigrants because they are countries of immigrants you dim witted buffoon or from a different perspective the natives owned lands were destroyed through european immigration so your americas example backs my argument so your bs counter is to say that my wording is wrong any number of foreign born non german children is bad if its over and rising rapidly by all estimates germans will be minorities in their own home in years unless theres some drastic change but sure keep saying how i misread the data i can literally walk into a classroom or the street and see that youre full of shit
canada,removed,not sure if our fair mods will leave this up but theres some truth in it party like hell hedonism get older worn out you rise to your level of incompetence and your childhood sweetheart settles for you httpiimgurcomkgoiqvhjpg
canada,removed,its prostitution call me old fashioned but i think this kind of thing is pretty degenerate i doubt anyone will want to marry these girls once they find out they sold their bodies in their prime to old men with money but i guess for some people you can put a price on dignity
canada,removed,that is assuming that youre not actually insane and living with your parents
canada,removed,pwnd
canada,removed,damn shes pretty hot hope someone is at least making good use of her and getting some pussy
canada,removed,not during their schooling of course but afterwards within years many will be married im saying that they should think long term realistically no quality man is going to wife an ex whore if he has self respect sorry that the truth hurts
canada,removed,keep playing stupid troll
canada,removed,says the troll
canada,removed,the xir that hasnt contributed a single data point to this thread wants to talk about intelligence lol
canada,removed,just wont stop trolling
canada,removed,member the polls before the election saying trump had no chance of winning no because those didnt exist the polls gauged public opinions and hillary ended up wining the popular vote by nearly votes which would agree with lead most national polls had her at the day before election polls are faked an ignorantass unsupported allegation
canada,removed,some human traffickers are south asian not all south asians are human traffickers i didnt say they were i have to assume at this point that you are either trolling or some incapable of rational thought i mean that literally i mean something is broken in your head that is preventing you from engaging in rational discourse how can i put this more simply you cannot invent the position you are arguing against you cannot pretend your conversational partner has said things they didnt you cannot imagine things that you think they might say these are not rational ways of arguing so you are either a troll or literally defective i am done with you and i am sad that you know how to use a computer because you are muddying the waters
canada,removed,if you cant answer why marrying an ex prositite is a bad idea then youre still emotionally naive andor a promiscuous woman
canada,removed,extend that same line of thought onto single mothers and you have me on board lets remove any assistance they get its their own fucking fault after all
canada,removed,youre racist and im not
canada,removed,good hopefully we can get rid of the white males in our military and replace them with people that actually reflect what we want canada to be
canada,removed,most people however do believe in the transcendent when it comes to love and relationships thats debatable and opinionbased whats transcendent if theres a connection of any sort does that count does it have to be love how much of this transcendence is needed before copulation occurs theyre soulless imitations of the real thing and they threaten that rock our society and culture is founded on b u l l s h i t there are far far more cultures on the planet earth where relationships are not defined by love but rather by barter familial ties and plenty of other factors this is anthropology its incredibly ethnocentric to make a statement like you have sorry but i have to call bullshit on this facts dont support the statement at all
canada,removed,its openly subversive to civilization india china and a hundred other cultures both primitive and modern would not only highly disagree with you but prove you so utterly wrong beyond your beliefs facts are facts you dont get to pick these ideas like youre picking out a puppy dog here civilization and other cultures that have outlived and outdistanced n american society which is what you are talking about western civilization essentially cant be argued with that is unless you want to resort to dumb ideas like those arent civilizations or start calling them savages who need christianity or some other hogwash crap that history showed to be morally corrupt monogamous pair bonding has throughout the course of human history and to this day been more about convenience and practicality and strengthening ties between families than it ever has been about love or feels or anything of that nature if you doubt my claims id suggest heading down to your local community college and taking an introduction to anthropology course or sociology perhaps your beliefs are grounded in ignorance im sorry but its true
canada,removed,monogamy doesnt work on a societal scale without love and commitment uhhhh again run down to your local community college here mmmkay you truly are ignorant of other cultures history and the social sciences ill leave you alone now
canada,removed,the vast majority of women are not pimped out or trafficked you lying fuck
canada,removed,good riddance
canada,removed,ill spell check that for your people more people come to alberta than leave pal youre probably only born here if anything youre so quebec it hurts
canada,removed,i did read a textbook or go the fuck away im relating accepted social science tenets to you and youre spouting some bullshit opinion that has zero basis in fact its like im on my front porch talking to a bible thumper telling me physics comes from god and he said so blah blah blah you sound like those people sooooo slam turns up his tv
canada,removed,sure you had income tax more like aish payments
canada,removed,lol
canada,removed,so youre years old you know it all lived in calgary resented the oil life went to toronto to make it didnt bitter about his friends back in alberta who made itmoves to quebec to shit on his home province
canada,removed,so of course you have no argument and cant support the slanderous accusations youre lucky reddit is a meaningless medium where your arent held accountable to your words
canada,removed,i am sure that trump with his investment banker advisers will do miraculous things for labourers and the poor by massively cutting taxes for rich people i am sure all the money those rich people save will trickle down or something it absolutely amazes me that people like you are still this out of touch people wanted someone that would actually listen to their concerns would you rather trust the person that is actually saying theyre going to try and help you or trust the person that didnt even give you the time of day its completely irrelevant what is realistically capable of happening all people knew was that clinton at best would be just more of obama which wasnt good for them and at worst shed do nothing because she didnt even stop in those states and said nothing regarding their worries the left has got to get their heads out of their asses and i say this as someones whose never voted right when it comes to just how fucking smug they are regarding peoples concerns you think people give a shit about identity politics or whether the pm visits a mosque when theyre losing their jobs and struggling to provide for their family
canada,removed,right you should stop doing drugs or start on of the
canada,removed,bullshit feelgood identity politics imaginary problems cooked up by attentionstarved you are
canada,removed,so the people who booed harper and made a campaign to vote for whichever party would beat him regardless if its one they support werent childish only the albertans who boo are childish because heres a news flash trudeau was voted in because of children the youth is why hes in

canada,removed,well if anyone knows about fake news its fucking macleans fuck you
canada,removed,absolutely it isnt immune and were seeing more and more hatebacked posts on rcanada all the time and usually from the same posters i wonder how long the mods in this sub will tolerate these obvious hateinspired postings before they grow a sack and draw a clear line between what is and what is not acceptable
canada,removed,a token brown girl is allowed on set as long as she keeps her mouth shutits the punjabi way

canada,removed,more bullshit i guess when that is all youve got btw im not even close to an extremist im not so sure about you
canada,removed,i post in metacanada because they have a sense of humour theyre also rabid altright freaks who think that syrian refugees are invaders and that muslims and middle easterners in general are the enemy in this sub people just get butthurt over everything i wonder what you are in real life im getting a shitposting neckbeard vibe off of you
canada,removed,waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
canada,removed,correction butthurt elitist
canada,removed,sorry to hear that youre incapable of dealing with conflicting views youre a joke youre like that rational hitler meme just because not everyone agrees with you does not make them stupid or pathetic metacanadians who post here are indeed very stupid and extremely pathetic let go of your superiority complex man we have every right to feel superior to the likes of you your idols lauren ezra etc cant even stop lying or distorting even for a minute
canada,removed,you literally just told me to get better heroes and to grow a spine blah blah blah i get that youre an idiot really i do but what i literally told you was what your heroes literally were i also said grow a spine because normal people dont see the cbc as some kind of hub of far leftism get a grip
canada,removed,youre a dangerous lunatic at best the only caveat is that youre a fat worthless neckbeard whod get stomped the minute he tried to murder people or burn down certain religious buildings
canada,removed,if its such a joke why are you so mad bro this is what im talking about your level of intellect ends at lolololo u mad when i think something is a joke ie people like you who believe in religious fairy tales i just ignore it snore
canada,removed,no some places they are just thrown in jail much more civilized than being thrown off a building right yeah and homosexuality was open and tolerated in the west for millennia right i guess you dont want any immigrants from eastern europe either canada worked hard to stamp out that sort of nonsense in our country we dont need to import any more hate well we have you and your ilk so we need to do our best to help groups that are widely persecuted in the middle east there are many the number one victims of daesh are sunni muslims and youd see them slaughtered sorry but youre a pig ill stand by what i said regarding immigration
canada,removed,are you retarted i just wrote for reddit standards an essay on his invention of speculative term whitelash that not only further exacerbates racial tensions without evidence but it also muddies the water about why exactly hillary lost and you keep harping on with a side of ad hominem
canada,removed,excuse me its current year justin sjw trudeau
canada,removed,sounds like somebody is into trans girls but theyre too insecure to accept it so they pretend to have a problem with it
canada,removed,is that why you have anxiety
canada,removed,i too can go on the internet and find random articles to support my side of the argument what i find quite telling is that you find the term mentally ill to be an insult no where do i even remotely allude to that youre a bad person who is purposely trying to get a rise out of people the fact that you have become so vested in this conversation disagreeing with so many different people really speaks to your character
canada,removed,great brown north more like it
canada,removed,youre just fucked and spend too much time on the internet

canada,removed,as if any of you cheap fucks who advocate this would ever pay for anything given the option
canada,removed,really dont care either way would you complain if there was writing in hebrew script i think not i would care see the two reasons i just listed so youre saying that cop cars dont need to have police written on them in english then not really its more of a formality because of english and in some cases french being our de jure official languages and yet only your kind there you go again with your weird terminology are complaining about it most seem to see it as a nonissue it shows that the police are willing to waste time and money over nothing youre the arabhating middle easternerhating wrong wrong muslimhating depends on the muslim as i hate extremists and islamists not me mo youre just the person whod sell out their country and commit suicide if it meant a pat on the back
canada,removed,the grandkid is transgender doesnt mean theyre a sexual predator fuck you i did not say that
canada,removed,i think you deserve to die more than that kid did
canada,removed,i know lynch mobs arent the answer but kathleen wynn needs to be taken removed from office by a lynch mob there i said it

canada,removed,ive yet to meet someone that says they dont believe in dark matter well now that you mention it it is hard to see at night how many other sciences do we have people walking around saying they dont believe the science does it really matter if they believe in it this is where the religion part comes in people rarely act as if it exists anyways so what difference does it really make i mean aside from knowing who to ostracize defending this guy is as just as bad you had plenty of opportunity to offer up a reason a source contradictory science but you havent instead you clung to a belief that because science is disputable i have in no way shape or form suggested implied or outright said that i do not agree with the current evidence in fact i have explicitly stated that i am merely agreeing with the fact that science is always unsettled but in the true religious fashion you took this as an attack on your faith and you ignored that there is no testable hypothesis that disproves climate change yet for decades weve been testing hypothesis and failing to disprove it which has built up our scientific understanding that every scientist in the field has come to the same conclusion and invariably if something comes out tomorrow that disproves the consensus they will all change their position on the matter it really doesnt matter what the study is about it is always subject to new information
canada,removed,whats worse was his statement on his own facebook page at the same time
canada,removed,holy fuck youre stupid

canada,removed,or another way to determine if employees are properly paid is to look at the extent they add value to the company i bet if they are disposable because they add no value their salaries will be low for fuck sakes if you want to get paid more dont go into work and do a shitty fucking job like everyone else how fucking hard is it to realize you have to actually work hard to make money instead of sitting on your sorry ass smoking weed all fucking day pathetic fucking loser
canada,removed,hahaha what a pathetic fucking excuse you must lead a truly miserable fucking life to have to post this to make yourself feel better fucking loser
canada,removed,rpussypass
canada,removed,pussypass pure and simple bro
canada,removed,you face problems you work on them to overcome them for some people its easier to complain seemingly all day to an audience on reddit than do something tangible about it so they do that instead why are you making baseless assumptions about people who faced different struggles than you
canada,removed,youre sitting there smug telling this person you dont know anything other than what i told you about how things are youre just being a jerk you know that but keep doing it because you can youre malicious and other people can see that if you didnt care like you claimed you wouldnt be telling me im a big baby who just needs to try harder because you wouldnt care enough to obviously you care just not in the way the other user is talking about but you care enough to assume im just not trying hard enough like you did because grandpa offering you a job is the same thing as me walking to work in a fucking blizzard right same thing as me making sure my mom takes her medication right same thing as having to drop out to work full time just to eat yeah stop projecting just to feel good its gross and other people can see it to
canada,removed,why did you read it why were you compelled to voice your displeasure at the post maybe your just an asshole looking to pick on someone to make yourself feel better
canada,removed,no true scotsman puts sugar on his cereal i was just pointing out you are being a dick for no apparent reason now youre pointing out how unprepared for discussion you are
canada,removed,probably a good looking female i heard they carry around some pass to be able to get away with shit like this
canada,removed,its very sad this great news for canada has to come along with insecure men minimizing her accomplishments found the femintard your movement has failed nobody likes you people you need to get over it
canada,removed,sometimes i think some peoples brains dont work right they are so emotional and irrational that they will ignore reality facts and anything else just to let their emotions lots of people need serious therapy
canada,removed,fake news he was shot as a traitor read about it in official reports
canada,removed,she ugg as fugg
canada,removed,it is what it is shes uggo wouldnt vote for her plus this stopkevinolearyorg or whatever is exactly what happened with trump they just focus on the extreme opponent instead of themselves thus giving them all the attention so idiotic to not learn from the democrats mistakes shes ugg and stupid and i wouldnt vote for her if she was fine and stupid cause of this
canada,removed,yes people who live in cities are used to living together small town people are clueless and afraid of strange people they dont know

canada,removed,found the real canadian because all other opinions other than ones that conform to your own should be discounted and dismissed i think youre either just a drama queen or a sensitive special snowflake if you think that this sub is either too far right or too far left
canada,removed,
canada,removed,oh so because the world is happy its not really its not despite children suffering despite all the bad things that happen you just need to move on nevermind the slave children who made your cheap toys enjoy them if anything phases you youre just mentally ill give me a break

canada,removed,pussy pass kill yourselves mods
canada,removed,
canada,removed,violent conservative
canada,removed,you are clearly one of those quebecois who think its quebec v everybody else because you buy into all the separatist horse shit i think my logic works well you are so close​ minded that you cant relate to people from the same country so why would you get a long with people who are citizens of actually different places the only difference between the other provinces and quebec is that quebec thinks its special and better than everyone else newfies are probably the most unique canadians and they dont have a stick up their asses
canada,removed,tell people on this board that hockey and tim hortons are part of our identity and theyll crucify you for being a shallow cunt
canada,removed,ok bigot and i bet you think all black people look the same or that all asians are chinese
canada,removed,found the racist
canada,removed,just leave then for fuck sake its your fault canada is flooded with immigrants with your multiculturalism shit you pushed on the rest of us
canada,removed,a scary mafia of pound manlets
canada,removed,the science is definitive if now evidence comes up then it can change but that evidence hasnt shown up yet you are arguing with yourself over nothing no one cares about your hair splitting science is capable of having difinitive results despite your best efforts to argue in circles that nothing in the universe can be set in stone whats the point of arguing this honestly you have still avoided the question twice why do idiots like yourself feel the need to die on this pointless hill only on climate change ive never heard someone so desperate to claim science is incapable of making any conclusions when discussing taking an advil for a headache or for putting gas in their car instead of magic fairy dust who knows what kind of evidence science may find about magic fairy dust just why you never answer this
canada,removed,sorry you are so truth adverse maybe you can pull your head out of your ass and look at the world as it is not the way you would like it to be
canada,removed,til being a sex criminal is merely creepy and odious please excuse me while i go vomit youre a fucking awful shitlord and fuck all people that upvoted your comment

canada,removed,you know sikhs are not muslim and dont follow sharia lawlol uneducated hick
canada,removed,which is where people like you belong youre just an armchair warrior who would get bitchslapped around if he tried talking tough in real life pot kettle black and thats rich coming from limpwristed cuck antifa type you people are definition of weak look at you capitulating to islam hoping to sell canada down the river like your ilk did with europe why in the hopes youll be shown mercy under the caliphate fucking cowards
canada,removed,looks like you need bernie in your life
canada,removed,this is simply too much to be believed i hope it is an invention the judge and the mother are both guilty of abusing this child they are negligent in not seeking treatment for her mental illness the father is completely correct eleven we have gone insane if you want to know your gender look in your pants if you disagree with the evidence therein seek psychological help not a surgeon not an idiot tg promoter this is so clearly idiotic
canada,removed,why do you have chinese friends youre part of the problem
canada,removed,httpsthepiratebayse thank me later
canada,removed,you have reason to trust that you do not have the source code and have no idea what its doing in the back end
canada,removed,lol understand it or not take away something that people used constantly from your service and people will stop using your service nobody cares that it was a work around if it doesnt work anymore then people will find something else that works for them
canada,removed,yeah and now that they cant watch their damned shows theyll go elsewhere to watch them
canada,removed,because there is a threshold people will pay up to for convenience and after that you can fuck yourself
canada,removed,outraged because theyre taking away convenience justified or not and surprised because netflix is shooting themselves in the dick a bit
canada,removed,incredible so youre an advocate against illegal downloads when it isnt something you personally wanted to pirate but if its something you want then its totally gucci amazing
canada,removed,who are to say whats reasonable uh the fucking consumers bud we are the reason businesses survive or fail heard of capitalism
canada,removed,ahhh reddit users who think theyve got it all figured out and are smarter than everyone else
canada,removed,interestingly i havent region hopped in a while but i just went to try it out and pia vpn still works at least the nyc one suck it netflix i guess
canada,removed,lmao sweet summer child theyre going to torrent it buddy
canada,removed,yes except pirating something is not the same as stealing a car when you download something they still retain the original if i steal your car you dont have a car anymore
canada,removed,did i say that i said its not the same thing as stealing a car or any physical product which it isnt its more like youre using your car as a taxi and most people pay for their ride but you didnt yes its stealing but its not as bad as physical theft
canada,removed,a fine comes with a criminal record but it sounds like the conviction got overturned so no record that being said if he had to hire a lawyer hes spent thousands of dollars on this more likely at least given that he also went through an appeal or if he got legal aid the tax payers have spent thousands of dollars on this
canada,removed,considering that the fed did nothing what the hell are you talking about since the federal government has handed bombardier billions in subsides no and lowinterest loans and just plain handoverthecash grants after pratt and whitney bombardier is the nations second largest corporate welfare bum industry canada alone has handed over billion adjusted to in separate transactions the vast majority of that has taken the form of conditionally repayable contributions thats government code for outright gifts that bombardier has no legal obligation to ever pay back and it most of those instances it never has paid back more than a dime five years ago in the feds gave bombard yet another conditionally repayable contribution this time for million dollars less than six months later bombardier announced that it was going to spend million building a brand new aircraft parts manufacturing facility that would employ people in morocco in fact the feds have arranged things so that any federal information request regarding how much and when bombardier has paid back to the federal treasury can only be released with bombardiers permission and of course the only time bbd only gives permission is the few rare occasions when it wants to brag about how it has managed to pay back the money it was handed in the meantime bombardier has hung on to its unethical and immoral dual class share structure whereby the founding family maintains complete voting control over the corporation and the common stockholders have no say in how it is run or who runs it despite shouldering the majority of the financial risk and the only organization that has been more foolhardy and irresponsible in its subsidies and gifts to bombardier than the government of canada is le gouvernement du québec
canada,removed,the only people who are worse than the people who make their voices heard are the people who think theirs are more important than the rest you dont care about my devils advocacy because you are too deluded and dimwitted to understand why devils advocacy is important in the first place not everything or everyone fits your cookie cutter opinions of the world once you figure that one out you dumb fuck come back and talk like a real man or woman whichever it is until then go back to preschool you have a lot to learn
canada,removed,any chance this mythical character will be at any of these ive heard so much about him
canada,removed,g
canada,removed,youre an idiot
canada,removed,disgraceful fucking quebecers
canada,removed,heres the website fox has up httpwwwdesireecapuanocom this guy was thorough

canada,removed,upvote to spread awareness downvote for false information shillery
canada,removed,owning a pet it not a right what the fuck is wrong with you
canada,removed,sjws are gleefully happy to lie twist subvert and outright manufacture evidence to advance their cultish causes
canada,removed,ok theres clearly no point in trying to explain anything against this level of cognitive dissonance im still in your face standing here waiting for you to show the cognitive dissonance really what im doing is embarrassing you in front of everyone for trying to use the term cognitive dissonance when you dont really know how lol now go home and get your fing shinebox
canada,removed,cant wait for brad wall to go full retard over this news
canada,removed,shh go back to metacanada
canada,removed,who cares the victim probably did something to deserve it anyways and isnt telling the whole story these muslims are always so quick to play the victim card but are never willing to admit any fault of their own
canada,removed,why the fuck would grant morrison be speaking the voice of the us did you even think about that or did your brain just see violent and hardwireed your thinking to the us idiot
canada,removed,because turnabout is fair play
canada,removed,the canadian sterotype isnt really true at all though canadians are generally incredibly nationalistic and assholes
canada,removed,cognitive dissonance is a lack of consistency in ones reasoning yes i taught you that after you used the term like you saying the residential school system wasnt a mistake okay so there is one thought or belief of mine now lets see where i had a contradictory type of belief you think its ok to try and eradicate another culture simply because it doesnt line up with what you presume to be correct awww you sniveling little intellectual worm hahah instead of walking away with your head held down you tried to urinate on my shoes lol nope didnt say that but see that still wouldnt be cognitive dissonance lol you dummy you screwed that up even hahahha wow ok go away now you dingbat lol
canada,removed,
canada,removed,ill admit it i dont like muslims mostly because just like this white land whale they shot on womens clothes based on their arbitrary value system im cool with muslims and people in general that are respectful to others
canada,removed,holy shit ahit for brains i dont like the majority of islam and the majority of muslims in the world follow islam thats what makes them muslim they then try to force their bullshit ideas on others i dont lime the majority that does this im ok with the minority that respects other opinions i still dont like islam though even if im cool or ok with it do you understand now
canada,removed,quick take the day off and protest not getting enough free stuff
canada,removed,he should have worn a hijab
canada,removed,hey rcanada can someone clarify something for me what religion do alawites sunnies and shias belong to also what are the most populous ethnicities that make up syria also could someone clarify if theres a war in syria and who it was caused by i dont agree with what this white woman did i just want to know if im insane or muslims like to start a lot of wars and discriminate against people
canada,removed,people can post to multiple subreddits and be canadian but this isnt about people posting to multiple subreddits but about how those users who often have virtually no posting history in rcanada are turning rcanada into a subreddit full of trans circlejerk threads and posting quality content showcasing diversity of opinion such as i said people who pump themselves full of hormones chop their dicks off and dress up like a lunatic are degenerates people who are gay are fine i really dont care i just dont want to normalize people who are seriously sick in the head because far left demagogues demand people live in their delusion this is just tolerance going off the rails voted up of course by their fellow brigaders and other people are also clearly getting tired of it but freezeypeachers here show their true belief in free speech even talking about brigading is intolerable to them and of course the usual trite angry statements about being oppressed follow is this how you act when you cant force people to agree with you shut it down amirite you forgot to add something about sjws
canada,removed,caaaaaalm down there girlie
canada,removed,if i cite any other human rights rulings youre going to dismiss them anyways as provincial human rights tribunals are going to be viewed as equally illegitimate by you its bullshit of course refuse to pay the fines and youll be found in contempt approach another court asking them to ignore a judgment made against you by a human rights tribunal and theyll tell you probably slowly that no you cant just ignore them and your whole position is so dishonest that its the equivalent of demanding that someone prove a keystone of child custody law in a real court its absurd and i suppose that comparison only makes sense if you dont think family courts are illegitimate bullshit which you probably do anyways
canada,removed,you have no proof anyone is brigading yeah totally thats why of the posts in this sub is on this issue and if we examined the number of comments per thread im sure it would be much higher than stay in your lane you arent a mod let them sort it out thanks for showing us all that freezypeachers arent actually interested in free speech but protectionism for theirs and theirs alone
canada,removed,ok i read his whiny post and all i have to say to him is tough tits the fact of your situation is that you are a sexually reproducing animal and as such if you are a normal human being you are one of two sexes if you cant handle the expectations placed on males and you cant handle the expectations placed on females what can i assume other than the fact that youre a weak pathetic human being who refuses to live up to any of the expectations society places on its members male or female ustarbuckbeak
canada,removed,go home sjw
canada,removed,ubendtnerlikebeckham ubendtnerlikebeckham ubendtnerlikebeckham

canada,removed,if you care about freedom you need to push back at the nazis
canada,removed,because youre a drama queen
canada,removed,its just you
canada,removed,he is right anyone who disagrees with him is basically a cuckold what this clickbait story doesnt mention is that vice versa is also true husbands cant deny their wives sex it is almost as if sex is important in a relationship here is a protip for some of you virgins if a wife is denying a man sex chances of him cheating skyrocket enjoying your divorce rates if a wife is denying her husband sex chances are she is cheating best case scenario she is just manipulating the husband by withholding sex dont marry if you are going to refuse sex to your partner that simple
canada,removed,well hey ive been saying all along that to be trans is to possess a mental disorder its not unusual for the ill to lash out when confronted about their delusions
canada,removed,its almost like i was trying to make the point that labour issues were being thrown aside to make room for bullshit identity politics which in turn drives people away from the left because they dont have time for it im sure i mightve seen that written somewhere but you couldnt be bothered to read could you
canada,removed,you are an idiot plain and simple you pay a connection fee because no matter how much electricity you use the lines to your hours must still be maintained if you did not pay this fee then all of your neighbours would be subsidizing your connection through there monthly bills
canada,removed,i think that was an entire straw family but i agree with you poor peoplethe working class generally care more about eating then identity politics seeing how they have behaved since november i think the us might remain republican controlled for quite some time
canada,removed,if your down to calling people who disagree with you on politics bigot i dont think your standing on the moral high ground
canada,removed,so youre saying if rogers showed porn on a cbc broadcast the cbc would be exempt from any blame like rogers just takes over the channel to show games come on now
canada,removed,and this is how trump got elected ladies and gentlemen
canada,removed,its their money too moron its the people in bcs money and saskatchewan ect its all our money collected and then divided up based on need so we get a level quality of life across canada in case you didnt notice every province gets equalization payments thats right we do too httpswwwfingccafedprovmtpengaspalberta

canada,removed,you sweet sweet child your first point is so rich its diabetesinducing please tell me the ratio of pro to anti justin articles and posts on the front page of this sub the majority of this sub is so up justins ass that they are probably holding hands with butts i understand youre way in too deep and seeing all this projustin shit like hes a fucking rock star idol has made you completely oblivious to the circle jerking in this sub but open your eyes this is called rcanada not the rtrudeausploogexchange
canada,removed,lol canadian logic everyone should just start an etsy page boy is this country fucked
canada,removed,youre delusional many companies have made investments in america such as ford and toyota because of his tax policies obamacare is bankrupting people and causing employers not to be able to afford their employees so getting rid of it is no gift to the rich i cant wait to hear youre empty echos for the next years as trump makes america great and you keep whining that he didnt do anything right hey look theres history over there whats that with it oh its your world view
canada,removed,as someone who used to work in a call centre for a major telecom fuck you this shit gets people fired all the time odds are youve cost someone their job calls like this decrease employee conversion scores so a staff member having a rough month will probably lose their job over these kinds of calls because theyre not meeting the requirements of the position selling additional lines do this shit over the webchat or in a store dont call a cis line most of the people working these jobs are new immigrants and people who have trouble holding a regular job often times call centre work is the only thing they can do a lot of people with physical disabilities too remember even if youre talking to customer care or tech support they still have a conversion to maintain and major companies fire people all the time for not converting
canada,removed,boo hoo hoo harpers gone and im ever so butthurt waaaah
canada,removed,nice once you have him in either the racist or homophobe category you have this won my good friend
canada,removed,im saying talk to the right people use the web service like it says on every fucking website dont be an asshole and call the sales line and ask about this shit you get people fired on a floor of about people we saw about a week go
canada,removed,an aside to this article perhaps its just me but i dont read wente columns anymore for the reasons that one im never sure that shes not plagiarizing someone two that shes a lazy columnist who often just cribs some outlier research and claims it is the truth about something three shes meanspirited and pompous which means her views cannot account for most aspects of an issue and four shes a very dull and unoriginal writer and thinker but the globe mail keeps her on so i suppose many people dont share my dim view of her anyone i cant comment on this particular article because i didnt read it and i have no respect or confidence in anything wente writes anymore
canada,removed,here you go make sure you actually look into the studies mentioned o
canada,removed,no no i totally agree that it is your mental health not the size of the apartment
canada,removed,yeah thats what they meant dont be an idiot
canada,removed,fuck you just because your provincial government fucked you doesnt mean the rest of us want the shaft too im not a high earning employee gross had my pay frozen last year and am mostly paying out of pocket for my mental healthcare per session down to once month thanks to only being covered for i dont need to be taxed on anything else
canada,removed,lol man youre just fucking with me right like you cant have such low self awareness you assume an entire justice system is corrupt based on a few news stories assume a man is guilty of murder despite evidence but then go around saying not to assume things holy fuck this is too good
canada,removed,lol holy shit you know nothing about that case at all i knew his family and followed it intently youre so clearly ignorant it hurts
canada,removed,america takes a million immigrants a year we take a year lol you crack me up you really do did you ever stop to think things through before you absolutely embarrassed yourself reread what i wrote we take in immigrants at the rate that the us does you need to learn what a ratio is they take in million a year but they are a nation of million we take in but we are a nation of million thus if you knew what a ratio was you would understand that they take in immigrants at about the rate that we do comprende did you seriously not think to compensate for population difference
canada,removed,if canada mimicked us immigration we would take in per year you really dont understand the population difference between the countries do you its hilarious that you wrote out a whole long anecdote about how there is far less need for labour now than in the and yet youre ranting and raving about how canada needs million immigrants no selfawareness whatsoever
canada,removed,america takes a million immigrants a year we take a year now you dont even know what present tense is sad
canada,removed,well arent you a horrible asshole
canada,removed,you sound like a career student who is upset that some people have worked years at the same company to finally receive benefits that they need for their family only someone that sheltered could be this stupid
canada,removed,sigh one does not negate the other
canada,removed,now whos being the smartass
canada,removed,why is everything directed back to trump to you you get hes not even president yet and all your fear mongering is just that until he actually does it right
canada,removed,no dumbshit if i walk by a bum and dont give him money its not the same as walking by and taking his money from his collection box
canada,removed,actually it has asshole ive spent the last almost fucking years trying to bring light to the fact that aboriginal men are murdered at an astounding rate and it has changed things here on reddit ive gone from people constantly asking me for sources because they were too god damn fucking lazy to read a newspaper to people using my links and sources to shut fucktards like you up the only reason there is going to be yet another inquiry into missing and murdered women is because their families have been so vocal the reason why men are being denied is because no one cares that men are dying cbc indigenous left it off their top stories of the year but it has nothing to do with the fact that cbc buries every story about missing and murdered indigenous men and goes out of their way to promote that only indigenous women are victims right rosanna deerchild you sexist bitch this anger is in regards to a story she ran about the murders in winnipeg since tina fontaine had been killed by first nations men which cbc also tried to bury the facts of women were murdered of them were indigenous yet men had been murdered during the same time and more than of them were indigenous then there is also her questioning why indigenous men should be included in the inquiry she feels since their families didnt ask for it they dont deserve to be included she works for the very news agency that has been burying stories of indigenous male murders for decades good old cbc where if you were a racist rapper who calls whitey and women all sorts of names you can just blame it on residential school influence and sweep it all under the rug and become a pillar of society
canada,removed,muslims especially love to kill other muslims killing is in their nature
canada,removed,in other words you are a complete pussy

indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds and we rained down on them a shower of brimstone death by stoning for sex outside marriage if you are or ever were married bukhari muhammad orders two people guilty of illegal intercourse stoned to death death to anyone who insults muhammad in any country whether or not he was ever muslim quran accursed they will be seized wherever found and slain with a fierce slaughter bukhari this recounts the murder of kab bin alashraf a jewish poet who wrote verses about muslims that muhammad found insulting he asked his followers who will rid me of this man and several volunteered alashraf was stabbed to death while fighting for his life the right of a husband to beat his wife quran men are the maintainers of women because allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property the good women are therefore obedient guarding the unseen as allah has guarded and as to those on whose part you fear desertion admonish them and leave them alone in the sleepingplaces and beat them then if they obey you do not seek a way against them surely allah is high great the right of a husband to have sex with his wife whenever

canada,removed,because the queen is the head of state you just compared a commoner to the royalty and the queen of england to someone that at years old is still working doing her job for the commonwealth fucking idiot
canada,removed,i found a source where they did a meta study of several studies available on the subject matter that proved exactly that immigration improves wages for all and drives down prices across the board for consumables see the quoted part in my above post if you had actually read the study you would see that it says that
canada,removed,you post in rthedonald trump is the altright poster child you are clearly part of the altright so my point stands
canada,removed,immigration improves the economy by lowering wages wrong immigration increases wages according to the many studies included in the meta study i provided why are you not understanding this the cost of living does not go up when house prices go up cost of living is calculated on the basis of cost to rent owning is a choice
canada,removed,that thick skull of yours no its just not worth the risk doesnt make any economical sense either its just easier to not accept their blood
canada,removed,i feel that this had been explained ad nausea evidently not fuck off mate
canada,removed,so lets just cut child services and education thatll fix it right up hey fucking moron
canada,removed,let me tell you a story about justins new clothes one day justin trudeau came to work wearing a piece of shit his cabinet saw the shit but not willing to embarrass him in front of all colleagues they complimented what beautiful clothes hes got then he met with the scientists they also saw the piece of shit but because justin is paying their research funding they also complimented his beautiful clothes later that evening he announced at a press conference that based on scientific evidence and consultation with his cabinet there was unanimous agreement that the shit hes wearing is the best solution for canadians consequently his govt is announcing a program to ensure that every taxpayer gets a piece of this shit
canada,removed,why are you following them around with this shit cant you keep your idiot arguments where they belong
canada,removed,sure thing keyboard warrior im sure that you would totally have the spine to do anything besides run your mouth on the internet
canada,removed,thats not the issue keep your asshole arguments in the threads they started in nobody aside from the idiots jerking themselves off wants to see it go hate fuck each other in private loser

canada,removed,keep digging that hole biggot they claimed succeasful asians you claimed no asians in cabinet currently not ever which makes your claim even more specific and selfserving which is blatantly false and niw yourr trying to claim that you only though of a specific group when discussing billion people and of the earths landmass maybe you should just use some racist slurs to really narrow down who you think of when you hear asian
canada,removed,okay so youre an idiot i guess the only question i have for you is did you have to practice being that stupid or did it just come naturally to you it would be really cool to hear from such a prodigy in the field
canada,removed,yes because youre the kind of worthless sack of garbage who would scream the technical from the highest mountain top if it suited your argument and thats the problem with people like you you have no integrity intellectual or otherwise you are garbage
canada,removed,i think that they are more likely to repeat what they said in public than you are to actually act on your words in the end youre still a coward if you take comfort in knowing that someone is as much a coward as you then good for you i guess way to shoot for the moon champ
canada,removed,its not an insult to call you a biggot when you are in fact expressing biggoted and intellectually dishonest statements to serve your own preconceived notions further when this is pointed out you double down and really commit to your ignorant assumptions you claim to be honest and racially unbiased when in reality youre ready to assign culture and geopolitical identifiers of success or lack thereof to others based upon their skin tone abd when this is ooited out to you you attempt to assing the cabinet mjnisters you claimed didnt exist into a different arbitrary racial category of your choosing tell me if thats not being a biggot what is
canada,removed,if rcanada says hes a douche he must be saying something good

canada,removed,i dont characterize it as pc because honestly political correctness is just a term with loaded connotations which everyone just bends to serve their own purpose since the term actually has no agreed upon definition essentially anyone can use political correctness to justify whatever they say as a counteraction against whatever else they assume is oppressing them there is also no law against political correctness but i assume there is a law against religious influence on educational institutions which is why im saying this is beyond political correctness which can be anything from a gut feeling to a political term to whatever else someone wants it to be what im saying is that what the op just described is illegal it is illegal if it is not it should be

canada,removed,yeah that guy is probullying as long as its something he disagrees with dont waste your time on him he tells people rich black people would give it all up to be poor white people while boasting about being a privileged white male and then proceeds to mock and bully poor people on this very website really classy
canada,removed,if youre being serious you must be misandrist man hater thinking male suicide being over greater than female is acceptable and so acceptable that you even want to deny men the right to express there is an epidemic this is an extraordinarily sexist attitude in which you are valuing the life of one woman as greater than men
canada,removed,the point is to downbreed whites so intensely raceconscious jewish oligarchs can rule over iq brown people
canada,removed,oh look its in bc guess the sun is shining through your parents basement window and you decided to get up for the day and start removing comments that you dont agree with to fulfill the emptiness and hatred that you have for yourself i guess my comments are rabble rousing and trolling but white nationalist comments are just fine and certainly not trolling people like you are so far removed from reality
canada,removed,feminazism at its finest
canada,removed,i know the redpill forum i post there good people nothing wrong with manipulating women and objectifying them women manipulate men all the time and they objectify us too dont be a hypocrite redpill is just a euphemism for being woken up so its like waking up to the rights men do not have there are tons of legitimate issues surrounding mens rights such as paternity rape laws and doublestandards on domestic abuse that need lots of attention however if this is another aggressive asshole subculture appropriating the concept of rights when really its just about not being able to handle losing their historical privilege then we need to separate the two and attack one the assholes while defending the other actual mens rights historical privilege lololol so it was a privilege to work in a coal mine get black lung while the women stays at home all comfortable sorry ill take the stay at home not work a dangerous job have all my needs met while doing nothing privilege over the historical male privilege i think mras are idiots and the only think i believe in is circumcision on babies should be banned

canada,removed,this is reddit where people always talk about their belife in the freedom of choice and speech but your a god damn idiot if you belive in something different than them can probably barley wipe his ass but it wont stop them from calling everyone an idiot who voted to leave or supports it because they probably read an article somewhere saying leaving the eu was bad
canada,removed,no youre the fool who feels by not votingis actually making a difference when in reality youre part of the problem but hey if one believes fully in the lie they are telling clearly it must be truth truth hurts doesnt it
canada,removed,what the fuck are you blathering about according to you dimwits there is no difference between one islamic and another theyre just a gigantic multinational multiethnic group of locksteppers
canada,removed,i think its also a great idea the rest of canada will adopt the same policies curfew for natives and a ban from non reserves for those we feel are causing a problem why wouldnt we want to ban drunk natives even if they haved mixed relations wait that sounds bad hmmmm
canada,removed,the religion of islam belongs in the trash

canada,removed,well yes im aware youre a proud racist
canada,removed,man you love that nhs link typical of the antiimmigrant fanatics you should see the rmcc class of it would melt your mind all those minorities integrating into even the most old stock of institutions what might come of it dont they know some rando on reddit thinks they should be impoverished and ghettoed
canada,removed,racism is still a fallacious world view so if youre interested in being right you may want to avoid being racist if you take pride in ignorance though carry on
canada,removed,anyone that voted liberal supported this during the election trudeau made it clear flooding canada with immigrants was cool and doubling the conservatives refugees numbers was even better i would get your anger if trudeau didnt legalize weed you would have every right to be pissed off but you stupid liberal supporters wanted to welcome more people into canada to distance yourself from the bigotry of old stock canadians you told us conservatives that immigration created billions for the economy and we were close minded now trudeau does increase immigrants and you are pissed off wtf are you really that much of a pot heads to be blinded by free the weed
canada,removed,young canadians can own their own home one day once canada becomes such a shithole because we let in so many third world people we join the third world we can be refugees and move to another country that gives free housing to refugees
canada,removed,thats not racist its common sense canada was built off these people who share the same values and would integrate much easier than people who dont share or even want to share our values the only person making it about race is you and that makes you the racist
canada,removed,on a more positive note we legalized assisted suicide at the right moment in history if we dont want to pay to keep our parents alive weve got options
canada,removed,just so over the top you sound ridiculous even if you dislike the pm how can someone with a fully functional brain think theyre trying to harm canadians it may not be your kind of decision and its perfectly fine to disagree with them but to start to point at conspiracy theories and whatever other braindead shit you have in this post is hilarious i mean just read it again i disagree with their decisions on this but i dont think that trudeau is trying to destroy my way of life or harm my children or some silly fucking thing
canada,removed,you just described yourself
canada,removed,no are you really incapable of seeing any nuance or context in situations these are the thought patterns of a six year old
canada,removed,i am referring to this httpsenwikipediaorgwikijewishpopulation
canada,removed,harms society by rejecting intellectual diversity that is codeword for stupid ideas such as chemtrail theories and antivaxxer propaganda he also says he supports cultural appropriation in halloween costume but i wonder how he would react if i dressed as a big nosed jew this halloween
canada,removed,not hatred just existential worry that our media has come to be collective bloc pushing a very definite agenda and owned by a very small ethnic subset of the population one which has an extensive historical record of manipulating national governments and people through banking practices and misinformation
canada,removed,if you bitch about political correctness theres a chance youre the product of incest
canada,removed,having read sufficient objective scientific evidence yes i am of the opinion there is sufficient argument for this notice any clear patterns also intelligence is genetic and heritable differences in intelligence between ethnic groups are due to genetics alone better education will not change differences in group intelligence theyll always remain human intelligence up to inheritible human intelligence is highly heritable scientific consensus is that iq tests are not racially biased very poor whites are comparably intelligent to very wealthy blacks black children raised in white households have similar iqs to black children in black households the average african iq is estimated at the average africanamerican iq is compared to the average white iq of the whiteblack gap in sat scores a proxy for iq is increasing genes for large brains linked to high iq are common everywhere except africa intelligence has at least a genetic basis iq scores are the best predictor of success in western society iq is heritable among whites frances iq drops points per decade because of african immigration

canada,removed,ya great lets allow religious fanatics to live in cults and breed like rabbits then abuse and shun all of there own children for no fault of there own because they refuse to believe the crazy crap there parents believe about human sexuality because they are gay then lets pass the cost of taking care of said person who now has abandonment issues not to mention the shame they feel for being gay or whatever else that got them booted from the cult lets send now a depressed and confused person with little to know education or the knowledge and skills to survive in the normal society not to mention the mental health issues the survivors of such cults have to deal with with little or no support there most likely to put a strain on our under funded social support systems why allow the cancer to even spread to begin with these people have every right to believe the crazy crap they do sure but when they abuse they children they should loose there rights these people have no logic or reasonings behind there beliefs you cant pray the gay away people are just born the way they are and feel the way they do these fanatics arent born believing the crap they do they are taught these lies and allowed to spew shit that isnt true and abuse others because of that and that has no place in a society science and facts and evidence should rule the law of the land and im done arguing with you youre a sick fuck defending abusers talking about sexual thoughts of babies and shit

canada,removed,refuting your illproven points is not deflecting anything i truly dont give a fuck if you reply to me umauifiveo im sick of your bullshit anyway
canada,removed,ive said it before and ill say it again cabinet positions have always been symbolism leading qualifications traditionally its been symbolic of regionalism or sometimes religion catholicprotestant stuff gender is just another symbolizing factor i dislike the gender thing in the first place but trudeaus sin isnt in breaking tradition its in continuing the same stupid one that previous administrations also employed
canada,removed,this better not be passed the funny thing is that by criminalizing it they will only make people hate it more we are not a muslim country and if they want to practice sharia law they are welcome to go back to one of the muslim countries with their barbaric laws
canada,removed,trudeau does not speak for me and the millions of us who do not want muslim immigrants here
canada,removed,trump and the us have only increased the number of enemies they have in the world and made it a more dangerous place for everyone well maybe the entire world shouldnt be hanging off everything the us does and then complaining about everything they do we dont complain about your politics because we dont even think about you

canada,removed,at least take in the most persecuted aka the christians and yazidis muslims are cancer if the arabs ditch that shitty genocidal ideology we can start considering them
canada,removed,as a trump supporter i think this is a winwinwin canada loves to virtue signal and we in the us dont really want refugees so we can send them all up there and we can take in the conservative christian refugees from canada when it becomes an atheistmuslimgayliberal orgy

canada,removed,the government wants it because its easier to bring adult livestock into the country than raise and educate new livestock almost immediate payoff vs payoff after years the banks want it because modern monetary system requires infinite growth lest it collapse this has happened in japan already white birth rates were declining and rather than take the zombie bank route the banking elites sided with the government all the businesses want it because more people equals more competition for wages and more consumers
canada,removed,and turned it into a billion deficit within years you seem to have forgotten what happened in to force that deficit to claim that was harpers fault is just as retarded as saying the crash in oil was the canadian governments fault that deficit came from stimulus into the economy something that was needed at that time and look what happened a few years later on the graph from the cbc revenue came back up to what it was prior to the crash in a couple of years then all what was left was to cut spending and then he kind of started to do that but then didnt probably the war in afghanistan had something to do with it and those jets but thats not really the point the only problem with our current situation of deficits is that justin doesnt seem to want to stimulate anything not even that but instead hed rather spend loads of money virtue signaling about how great of a nation we are for taking refugees that are just going to be welfare hounds in the short term and potentially a net positive gain in the long term but thats best case scenario and will take a while to materialize pair that with the fact that the uk is running into problem where some note how i say some refugee women from muslim countries arent learning english or getting jobs because of their hierarchical culture and that net gain in tax revenue is harder to obtain what is billion times four gosh thats billion or pretty close to what our projected revenues will be for referencing that wsj article with tax revenue falling yeahno increasing spending on this to become heroes while not lobbying other countries to also help isnt going to reduce a deficit the correct response to this is to stimulate the economy short term with that infrastructure spending and actually get shit done with the unemployed labor rather than paying out ei plus you sound like a dipshit

canada,removed,are we all sitting here pretending that this person isnt fucking correct do none of you have female friends when we go to clubs men grind up on them and grab their asses not occasionally but every single time but sure lets all sit on reddit a bunch of fucking redditors who have decided feminism is garbage and rape culture is a buzz word just because youre too fucking neckbeardawkward to leave your house and talk to women doesnt mean women arent getting assaulted in public at a rate that blows my fucking mind i really think thats the problem youre all too disgusting to participate in any of the culture that includes attractive women and dont realize how fucking crazy common it is to get felt up without permission just because the only woman you encounter your mother isnt assaulted regularly while delivering chicken tenders to your basement lair doesnt mean you can sit there and pretend like this isnt an issue goddamn neckbeard reddit slobs will be the death of society

canada,removed,one year on what has emerged is a government that seems to go against the political tide around the world open to trade immigration and diversity and led by a social media star whose views on feminism syrian refugees and lgbt rights have provoked delight among progressives yeah its almost like those are all stupid wedge issues that dont really matter hopefully our lesbian communist in chief doesnt figure it out before and the libs go the way of the democrats
canada,removed,tell me that after they decide that profit is king profit is what ultimately decides if they will do something or not always has been and always will be public safety is a huge part of the legalization effort have you seriously forgotten that the government spent heaps of money to get people to stop smoking cigarettes and in what way will additives help them profit additives dude meaning not part of the plant originally in any way shape or form and yet what i said is still true most of the harmful chemicals are from the tobacco its self do you mean weed doesnt need to be cured if so you would be wrong it can be but it certainly doesnt need to be like tobacco does for its purpose nor is the process all that similar for weed and tobacco so youve actually managed to reply with an incredibly deficient knowledge and the core of your argument remains a paranoid fantasy that the government will add harmful chemicals to marijuana a plant theyve outlawed for decades because they considered it a harmful chemical because money i hope you dont mind me asking but are you years old
canada,removed,joke

canada,removed,your great grandfather was an idiot there are many reasons only a maximum of of males are willing to defend their own countries in the west one of which is that they dont feel like this place respects them many of the immigrants consider this a home away from home also the refugees that fled their land to come here sure as hell arent going to fight for this country

canada,removed,why do you think im upset
canada,removed,whos triggered theres a big difference between encouraging an environment in which people are respectful enough of one another to refer to them by identifiers of their choice and changing the criminal code so that people who dont want to talk the way you think they should are sanctioned and potentially jailed seems like the only one triggered here is you im sorry your mental disorder doesnt enable you to control others speech but im more sorry youre so ignorant that you think such action is both necessary and appropriate
canada,removed,i know where you are coming from i was just as desperate out of inceldom heck i even considered having sex with a dog cadaver that died outside my window but sadly the janitor threw it away before i could go out and get it at night anyway get a female dog that is at heat they become sexually mature after months depending on the breed before her first heat i would recommend a minimum of sexual activity you will notice that the entrance to her vagina is a y shape the tail of the y points toward her front and that is where her clitoris is the lips are coated with a fine velvety fur dont stimulate her clit yet once her heat starts lock her up and dont let her get away so she isnt mated by other dogs comfort her and be a friend to her during the early stages of her first heat the dogs may become depressed or even frightened by the sudden changes in her after the first bleeding stops her vagina entrance will have enlarged quite significantly she may actively invite you to sex by turning her rump toward you and flicking her tail aside every time you catch her eye in other words she is now horny and it is up to you to relieve her get naked all the better to use you whole body in the act work with her as though she were human that is spend time caressing her hugging her play with her nipples which will have become larger and more sensitive with her heat arouse her as much as you can when she is really turned on her vagina will be well lubricated and she will almost be begging you to make her cum the best way to do this is to use one or two fingers if you are a male do not try inserting your dick into her unless she is one of the giant breeds or you have an exceptionally small dick if you hurt her she may become frightened of you and will not enjoy the sex move around behind her and insert one finger gently into her slowly if she isnt wet enough use saliva or ky jelly dont use mineral oils or anything that isnt used for human sex as your knuckle brushes past her clitoris it is likely she will sharply hump her hips downward this is normal slowly withdraw your finger and repeat she should start humping up and down on your finger quite strongly keep in time to her movements pushing up as she humps down use your other hand to caress her nipples and stomach she will cum fairly quickly and easily you can tell when she is as you will feel her vaginal muscles squeezing on your finger and she will start convulsively licking her lips try to sustain her pleasure for as long as you can play with her clitoris generally treat her as you would a lover if your dog is one of the giant breeds and you are male by all means screw her highly recommended in fact she will hump your dick as readily as she will hump your finger crouch behind her or have her stand on a slightly raised platform and guide your dick into her with one hand her tail will probably get in the way so you will probably have to drape it over one of your legs use your other hand on her hip to steady yourself when you have your dick firmly in her you can grasp her hips with both hands and thrust into her savor that warm tight pussy i advise to bring her to orgasm by hand first and then screw her afterwards otherwise they tend to hump on your dick and you will often fall out of her feel free to cum inside her you will enjoy it immensely and it is impossible to get her pregnant on human semen dont feel constrained to wait for her next season for sex between heats she will still be receptive to sex but you may find she is a bit tighter you will probably have difficulty inserting your penis fully into her dont force it you dont ever want to hurt her betraying her trust in you dogs arent built for missionary style if you try that be prepared for frustration it is hard from what i heard to enter them from that angle
canada,removed,k
canada,removed,lets not pretend youre interested in facts you extremists are not messengers you are not spreading a message divined by anyone worth listening to you acknowledge conspiracy theories and russian propaganda then try to use internet buzzwords like strawman or ad hominem to dismiss criticism delete your account

canada,removed,sure thing you sound like every other antiimmigrant blowhard who wants to blame their own shortcomings on immigrants

canada,removed,no it isnt you spoiled little shit lol
canada,removed,do whatever you need to do shitting on immigrants isnt going to magically make work appear if we were to close our borders those same shitty jobs would exist and you want to know why its because canadians still want to pay for their cent cheeseburgers and dollar tshirts we want the cheapest shit possible yet still expect the retailers for said cheap goods to also pay great wages fucking babies all of you

canada,removed,for clothing i usually shop at a few select retailers because i like the style and fit of the clothes zara and top man are my two favorites but they are quite expensive the trick is to wait for clear out sale recently zara and top man both had a clear out sale and i was able to buy dress pants for from top man dress shirts from zara etc another option is signing up for email subscriptions from clothing retailers and waiting for special coupons banana republic for example sends out off coupons quite often if you somehow think this is a life hack youre fucking stupid

canada,removed,i wish the british had done a proper job of genociding you
canada,removed,you mean asking people to question multiculturalism in majoritarily european countries there is nothing inherently hateful about wanting to live in a society surrounded by people you strongly identify with
canada,removed,nothing hate speech as defined by the canadian criminal code must identify a group of people and incite or promote violence against them theres nothing on that flyer that meets the definition as per usual a person who questions things like immigration multiculturalism etc is branded a hateful racist by the sjw of the world and apparently freedom of speach only goes one way

canada,removed,uh really youre posting on rcanada which has literally been taken over by white nationalists and you dont see how it could happen
canada,removed,its common sense that a judge shouldnt do this i agree which is why i said he should apologize and some sort of formal censure may be appropriate it also isnt that egregious an offense and shouldnt end his career youre just a fucking butthurt renoughtrumpspam regular and thats the only reason you think it should consider that your attitude of petty vindictiveness an attitude shared by many is why you lost
canada,removed,what the fuck are you talking about we cant normalize that old guys behaviour and for you to suggest she is racist i mean thats straight up backwards and illustrates very well the type of person you are on this anonymous message board a coward
canada,removed,thats what happens when metacaba brigades us mercilessly
canada,removed,that interpretation would only be clear to morons and just because most people are morons doesnt mean we should implement moron policies or make moron decisions
canada,removed,you should just cross the canadianamerican border and once youre in the us theyll deport you for free to mexico thatll be much cheaper for you

canada,removed,lol godamnit this country sucks
canada,removed,lmfao you literally just put your fingers in your ears and yelled lalalalala because buddy pointdd out your hypocrisy youre so weak and your argument is so weak you cant even follow through defending yourselfsad
canada,removed,its a disservice to the child their self identity is destroyed and iq is a huge predictor for success in life even a variance of points is enough to fuck this up what do you think happens when a iq person has a kid with a iq person its irresponsible
canada,removed,ok keep fucking your kids up remember the opposite of eugenics is dysgenics

canada,removed,no but its sketchy
canada,removed,
canada,removed,op reeks of the usual snivelling self righteous sanctimonious odour that has spread all throughout the left since they abandoned the ideas of the civil rights movement and the enlightenment post cold war end the left had the high ground socially mandela mlk etc and had it all wrong economically after the soviets went belly up and their stake economic ideas were revealed to be bankrupt all they had was the social high ground so they set out to conquer more ground and it led them to the gutters labelling every criticism as racisthomophobictransphobic etc you think youre more intelligent moral and superior because of your opinions but wont countenance defending your ideas because questioning them is tantamount to racism conversely people who disagree with you are less moral and stupid you reek of this op
canada,removed,trumps already working his magic stay out spic
canada,removed,ok ill take the last word const allyson douglascook said there was a physical altercation between the two men that included some shoving but no punches were thrown according to witnesses there was an altercation that much is certain whether or not punches were thrown in that altercation is only known by witness testimony which is unreliable you claimed that this person is an idiot not that they were behaving idiotically in the instance recorded on video but simply that they are an idiot how do you justify that but no instead im a pigeon fuck off im done with your bullshit
canada,removed,i love having these american altright trolls around to put us in our place
canada,removed,lol if this article was about too many jews in hollywood north and someone made the same request as you itt would be all about freedom of speech and shit how about you guys stop acting like the leftwing activists you seem to hate
canada,removed,i think the plan was to get people like you all worked up and it appears that they succeeded this is click bait for the right
canada,removed,virtue signalling irate confirmed
canada,removed,no this article is literally just pointing out that a board of directors of a crown corporation can probably benefit from having a board that isnt white men what they mean by women are women get your mra bullshit out of here
canada,removed,sure do this article is click bait to set off white men who think that they face the same obstacles as women and minorities they then share this on social media in order to get the echo chamber going
canada,removed,youre a racist so theres no point in this dialog good luck seeing past your smugness
canada,removed,how brave
canada,removed,is that so its easier to round them up later
canada,removed,i cant help but notice your writing pattern repeatedly in this thread and that your account despite your seeming familiarity with this sub is only fourteen days old im also noticing that several of the accounts with your similar writing patterns are also relatively new accounts
canada,removed,given that medym is actively reporting in this thread that the mods are presently investigating the possibility that people are using sockpuppet accounts im fine with your reporting things im not being creepy we have to do due dilligance with our online communication as canadians theres been a lot to suggest that people are manipulating people online for sake of encouraging a social movement in the us given as advocated by john a macdonald that we as canadians should be both learning from american politicking both their successes and failures its easy to spot someone like you and we have a responsibility to each other to make sure only ethical conversations are happening without misrepresentation
canada,removed,shekels a jew was behind this
canada,removed,probably a false flag jews pull this type of shit all the time
canada,removed,burden of proof is on the one making the claim nice try shlomo
canada,removed,so we should be ok with child rapists then

canada,removed,your intentions are blatantly obvious from your posts you are asking how you can bring your inlaws nonus citizens into the us and ensure that they get medical coverage from canada
canada,removed,kid you specifically stated that the martian sky would be blue if it were not for dust that is why i know that youve been lying since you dont know about the scattering of light by molecules and that each scatters different bandwidths the rest of this crap youre presenting is just your way of trying to alter the point in order to save face youve been lying to me your agw pals and probably people on the askphysics sub
canada,removed,and you broke your mothers vagina
canada,removed,she was right
canada,removed,racist pieces of shit like you really ought to die off
canada,removed,i would spit in your face were we eyetoeye right now
canada,removed,if your intentionally understated explanation was even remotely close to reality then the majority wouldnt have a problem with it do us all a favor and read the article it blows my fucking mind how heinously offended some canadians are by this shit were not offended were annoyed theres a huge difference what kind of sheltered life have you led to be so distraught that someone could you know whatif you have nothing intelligent to say then just shut up everyone is so tired of being talked down to by people like you our opinions are valid and we vote too much to your displeasure i am sure anyhoo when youre ready to join us all at the adult table we are ready to welvome you in to have a real discussion
canada,removed,he went so you didnt have to if people werent willing to volunteer for the military they would start conscription back up again if your so much of a pussy that you cant even imagine a good reason for them being over there i cant imagine youd fair well being conscripted too
canada,removed,yeah go fuck yourself im at the point now where im so sick of people like you im actually pushed to the other side whenever you open your mouths
canada,removed,fuck off if money is more important to you then the environment then you are whats wrong with the world
canada,removed,spoken like a true left wing shitlord s
canada,removed,ok and your special how welcome to life in western canada where this is a weekly thing
canada,removed,go fuck yourself
canada,removed,heres the point you are a weakminded and sensitive little baby to actually care so much that there is a little confusing at service ontario because a group of historically oppressed people want to write something different in the gender section of their passport you are a smallminded and heinously bigoted person to be so concerned by that and come up with grievances as to why its a bad idea it makes you an awful person to be this way i pay a year in taxes to this country and i have no problem with this kind of expense all of you whining ultra white conservative college students and loser dropouts on rcanada go mental over this shit
canada,removed,idiot
canada,removed,you just dont agree with it pot kettle black or brown or pink or red or blue or whatever you want to be because it doesnt affect me or my happiness because im not an edgelord living in a fantasy world in which evil feminists march on the street arm in arm with spooky trans people who just wanna fucking live their fucking life s
canada,removed,why would i give a shit post doesnt relate to rcanada
canada,removed,fuck off no one is saying that you want your concerns to be taken seriously dont rant like that
canada,removed,you do know this arguement holds less water when it comes from someone with a white supremacist user name who once said on this very site that if given the choice between living in a nazi state or losing his home hed choose nazis
canada,removed,they chose to move to canada of course they should try to fit in more in their adopted homeland choose is a relative word for some if you need to gtfo of where you live and canada is relatively easy to apply to then sure maybe you can call that a choice but to pick the path of least resistance when your whole life is a shit show of opression doesnt really seem like theyre sitting around at home with a globe just mulling over what place to live in more like what safe place can we live in and soon but apparently sometime around the somehow many immigrants seem to have gotten the notion that multiculturalism meant not trying to fit in at all fitting in and giving up your own culture are two different things im sure on the streets of toronto many of the people you think dont belong would fit in just fine which meant ethnic ghettos got slapped up faster than you could even say the phrase lol yup if theres one thing we know about ghettos its that the people who live there dont want to leave they just fucking love it there happy as clams ive got nothing against immigrants yes you do
canada,removed,tolerant of letting other ppl speak their languages yea we are if an immigrant does not know english or french that is their burden i dont understand canadians who are so affected by immigrants they rarely to never come into contact with you are ignorant why do you worry about other peoples lives so much r canada needs to figure out this casual racist bullshit its like everyday now i gotta sift through the ramblings of uneducated mouthbreathers who have never even understood the meaning of empathy much less articulate a nuanced response to issues concerning cohabitating a multicultural society
canada,removed,man i cant wait til mainland chinese culture because part of canadian culture so when i get my trademark gastric distress in public i can just whip my pants off in public and blast diarrhea all over the sidewalk before shoving my way onto a bus through a crowd of people like nothing happened im actually not trying to make some derogatory point about mainland chinese i genuinely look forward to this
canada,removed,you cant be serious
canada,removed,nah they should be as petty and angry like you youre just as bad as the petroconservatives fueling western alienation you hate albertans because you had bad experiences living there and you need the internet to vent because your life is so fucking limited and sad just accept that you like a good angry rant and youre the nonalbertan equivalent of utexasnorth you fucking sad people wallowing in your anger because of shit like yours i worry about the overall health and integrity of this country
canada,removed,makes sense enjoying your welfare on my tax dollars
canada,removed,liar your post track record suggest otherwise
canada,removed,lol leftytard social media addicts are now upset that now everyone is squawking prorefugee sentiment they now longer have a moral pedestal on which to tower over everyone else
canada,removed,riamverysmart
canada,removed,are these new opportunities to the benefit of canada and canadians as a whole or is new opportunities a dollied up way of saying and now you can experience poverty new opportunities like how my immigrant roommates in college started a healthcare data company in malaysia that is now thriving and helping million people accessing medical products that would have never otherwise reached them your poverty derives from your inability to actually produce anything of value that despite enjoying one of the best education system on earth one of the safest environments amongst existing governments one of the best social support systems you continue to fail and not do shit to what extent should you be responsible for the cumulation of bad choices you made all your life its not exactly like the refugees were pulling in are all doctors engineers scientists or philanthropists they are refugees plenty of which have fewer fucking employable skills than i do why are we bringing in temporary foreign workers to staff tim hortons we dont need all doctors i believe that even sorry ass failures such as yourself can achieve great things if you choose to do something with your life
canada,removed,okay so now youre just straightup being an argumentative jerk i just made it extremely clear that im not trying to argue with you i just asked you a question so were done here hope you have a nice day
canada,removed,theyre good people join them
canada,removed,whats wrong with white power ive heard countless black folks say black power without any issues every other race is permitted to be proud of their race its time to white to end the guilt of their great grandfathers white power white pride all lives matter
canada,removed,no my european ancestors came here before canada was a county manifest destiny took care of the rest
canada,removed,it was their destiny to be conquered by the white man our destiny is that of greatness we will not be conquered by lesser cultural imports i am a native canadian my people were here before canada was a county
canada,removed,shitposting
canada,removed,incorrect
canada,removed,i am sure it will be discussed at your next clan meeting
canada,removed,i started reading your post then i looked up and read your username the well is poisoned no one takes you seriously
canada,removed,i read farley mowats memoire from his war days he has a lot of interesting observations of lazy shits who in the middle of wwii didnt want to fight the nazis didnt want to have to be in the military and thought canada was doing too much for the war
canada,removed,so you think trudeau is a genius because he picked up a phone and is going through the motions christ you people are ridiculous
canada,removed,httpimgurcomacxllk lol
canada,removed,part of the problem is that most people on the antisjw side of things dont actually want a discussion they just want a chance to verbally abuse someone and play it off like theyre just asking questions and to someone who legitimately believes that to be the case in any given attempt shutting it down quickly is winning now that said some of the younger sociallyminded folk can get a bit annoying too even for a hardline leftist like me and hell even i can say some very unkind things when my dander is up just ask trump supporters but you have to remember for a lot of these people asking for example why do women want special treatment comes out sounding like why arent you in the kitchen making me a sandwich whether its meant that way or not and its not their job to automatically trust people they have no earthly reason to trust hahahahaha are you fucking serious your dander is always up you pompous sack of shit heres why no one will ever trust you and i totally understand why mods will ban me for this but i dont fucking care fuck you seriously what the fuck is wrong with you httparchiveiswxbqs grown ass man grow the fuck up and then people will have civil discourse you with you just push people further to the fucking edge and you know it
canada,removed,i dont fucking care im tired of racists arguing that they arent racists words matter in civilized societies ezra is an antiziganist and thats a fact his website lies and caters to dummies thats the fucking truth it isnt journalism its garbage
canada,removed,yeah that makes you look worse than it does me are you so full of yourself if the police showed a list of offenses i wouldnt call them stalkers id say thank you for showing me this guy is a lunatic same thing with you someone showing me messages of you saying its moral to tell trump supporters to kill themselves just shows me how much of a twisted sick man you are
canada,removed,whatever you cant even sort basic facts youve been called out over and over again youre exactly the type of person that the rebel relies upon
canada,removed,absolutely the same people theyre trolls enough is enough im sick of their shit
canada,removed,nope the rebel is a rag and isnt credible relying on identity politics to get his followers all frothy people who point to this as fact give away that they lack intelligence
canada,removed,youre ignorant that was a bunch of racist shit that was once used to describe jews and nobody is equating the roma with romanians holy fucking hell
canada,removed,we dont need people like you who are looking to place your inadequacies on others you are the divisive ones not immigrants id much rather you leave than them not come
canada,removed,go fuck yourself in hell
canada,removed,i dont want to engage with you youre beneath me and i dont really give two shits if you interact with me or not i dont fucking care im not being antagonistic im just not willing to deal with uninformed and veiled racism anymore those views are dangerous and we are seeing it played out in the us i wont put up with it anymore and someone has to stand up to this shit
canada,removed,well i guess thats a problem then isnt it i look forward to you guys having the nuts to say this shit in public instead of hiding on the internet
canada,removed,harper also hates women minorities and the environment this isnt shocking at all i want to know why fuck her in the pussy is bad but grab her by the pussy is good
canada,removed,youre high let me break it down for you you dont need an source to prove math canadian economy adds jobs but adds immigrants that means the economy has bodies looking for work if we already have even canadian looking for work we have a deficit of job and youre an idiot you cant just pull numbers out of your ass and assume that there is a correlation when it could just as well be causation please show me the studies and economists who support your theories evidence please go to the top of your screen and type immigration is bad for economy study journal here ill do it for you do some reading please no more pulling numbers out of your ass because youve managed to work this out in your brain you are unqualified and most likely uninformededucated on the issue of canadian immigration and economics just read what the experts and academics have written on the issue the economic experts please
canada,removed,you have what we call cognitive dissonance an economy has jobs you add more people jobs may be created eventually to feed these people house them and such it will take time in the time it takes they need to live also the existing population including newly immigrated need to get jobs if you dont add more or at least comparable amounts of employment to your economy with immigration you can only hope and pray they will not require subsidy to survive more over we are selectively bringing in the best that means less high wage jobs for canadians if there where a decent sized pie no one would mind sharing if theirs only one slice left people get pissy

canada,removed,wow that sure is an argument the western provinces are filled with positive stereotypes like working on oil and lumberjacks the middle provinces are filled with fields and crops the easter provinces are vibrant fishing villages with equally vibrant people ontario and quebec are filled with almost stereotypical americans and are full of nasty polluting industry and lazy people ontario has little in the ways of natural resources except perhaps maple syrup while the territories are mineral rich and filled with some of the most hardworking people ontario just isnt special
canada,removed,gwen landolt of real women told lifesitenewscom in august that if the government repeals section it will mean theres no age of consent for anal sex if you wipe out without any amendments you can have access to anal intercourse with anyone at any age she is quoted telling the website that is extremely alarming she said as usual social conservatives have to resort to lies

canada,removed,is not the problem here that is a distraction clearly lucky is the problem
canada,removed,is not the problem here yes hes inactive hes also not the one who is always removing submissions that would be lucky
canada,removed,if he was the one behind the mod action then he would have at least said something about it you do realize thats not much of a defense right lucky is the one that removed that thread i guarantee it the mods know who removed it its in the modlog none of them will say it was lucky because he outranks them we could have the information in seconds theres no need for an investigation show the modlog simple
canada,removed,wow the bigotry is strong with this one ive only over heard americans spout such offensive closed minded rhetoric guess we have that up here now
canada,removed,the fact you continue for months at a time is disturbing please leave this up i cant stop laughing
canada,removed,a worrying trend of people having a different opinion if theyre wrong as you say then talk to them like an adult banning is just one group of people exercising their power over people they disagree with

canada,removed,
canada,removed,umustwarnothers ukitestramuort uraerth uskuld ujbuk uivashkin udclauzel usaltysolomon and all the other regressive andor fascist geo mods should take a moment and learn from this response and the whole debacle if we had more mods like op and fewer power hungry scumbags reddit would be a much much better place
canada,removed,yawn i selfidentify as a pineapple wheres my legislation
canada,removed,when the head mod of metacanada is against adding more moderators to rcanada as you have been for years thats a pretty clear sign this sub needs more moderators
canada,removed,we know it was xlii if you guys dont want us to burn this subreddit down i suggest you remove him as moderator immediately
canada,removed,i care about this sub staying open and free no you care about metacanada being able to manipulate and brigade rcanada you got a big scare the last time the rcanada mods did something about your rule breaking sub and you dont want to see that happen again for christ sake your own little neckbeard haven has twice as many active moderators as rcanada and its the size you contradict your own bullshit
canada,removed,your opinion here means a lot less considering you have nothing to hide im sure you wouldnt mind your subs modmail being linked here so that people can see that you admit to being a vote brigade and that you helped overthrow the previous rcanada mods that were actually doing something about your disgusting little subreddit for christ sake your own little neckbeard haven has twice as many active moderators as rcanada and its the size you contradict your own bullshit just keep ignoring this fact
canada,removed,looks like someone who made this played watchdogs
canada,removed,hehe cest toncouver lau lau
canada,removed,you are a failure as a moderator and a human being
canada,removed,canada mods have been a joke for awhile but the big change recently was one promoted their buddy under the guise of mannosimmins consider that most of the senior mods of the sub are inactive placeholders which means the sub is ruled from the bottom up hes got a weird fetish with deleting things regardless of reason then abusing the mod functions to try and suppress any response or accountability for his mistakes one example of many he slapped me with an day ban because he couldnt properly understand the rules regarding thread titles not saying hes the one that pulled this specific boner but i noticed after he started abusing his authority some other mods started modeling his behavior one finally told me that essentially that they know hes a loose cannon but hes their loose cannon they can dump him later whenever they like but for now hes so active in deleting threads both with or without merit that hes useful as a cleanup tool
canada,removed,thanks for everything you did today uperma i truly mean that i look forward to hearing from and hope he will be announcing his swift resignation

canada,removed,i dont know what youre talking about sounds like a crazy rant and an attempt at a deflection i made him an incredible offer i dont see how he can turn it down if what he just said is true then hes about to gain
canada,removed,i think your point is worth making unfortunately you seem to have gotten caught up in conversations with liberal media shills just ignore it some advice though your post is difficult to read with all those links make your point use quotes from the relevant articles maybe put two or so links at most at the end no one is likely to read all that otherwise

canada,removed,i was never banned from here youre a liar and i will continue to point it out if you were me then youd have a job not be freeloading off the canadian taxpayer and spend way less time on rcanada

canada,removed,you might want to learn what the appeal to person phallacy is you might want to learn how to argue with people informally where appealing to informal fallacies is lame and doesnt have anything to do with good faith discussion or talking like adults do because only a jackass starts bringing up fallacies in conversation but lets do this anyway totheman appeals only apply in formal discussion thats the deal with informal fallacies is that they dont demonstrate factual inconsistency because the arguments made can sometimes apply to the conversation in this case if the discussion is literally about moral character then moral character is on the table and its not indicative of a fallacy overall and since its directly targetting the moral character discussion its not leading away from the conversation so red herring doesnt apply my comment isnt moot and its also true you are an ant beside bell and they are better than you in context an actual cause of mental health problems jesus christ you are sensitive no your phone bill is not giving you mental health issues

canada,removed,let me translate your comment into english maybe it is i dont know but i dont want to admit im wrong so meh fuck it nobody said that im trying to rebolster my position so im going to point out the nuances in an attempt to make myself sound knowledgeable says who ive given up at this point also having previously been a walmart employee isnt in any way proof that you know how any of it works ive worked at places with gift cards before as well most people have back to trying to put myself above you i worked at a for like months when i was so i know just as much about the industry please recognise my importance
canada,removed,no wonder most of you down there are obese piles of shit also shits just more expensive here suck it up buttercup
canada,removed,im not going to be goaded into another downward spiraling antagonistic conversation with you no youre just going to obfuscate when you were called out for posting incorrect information the last time saw you receive a vacation from the sub ah yes the good old days when you were stalking my profile on a daily basis and banned me for a comment that was in a thread that was dead for a week with hundreds of comments was not in reply to you did not tag you did not use your username predicted that a ban would be issued over it despite the fact that it consisted of a quote of your previous posts and the infinitesimally small possibility that you would see it if you werent actively stalking my profile this post to be exact mirror its weird how you saw it velvetjustice because there is no reasonable explanation for how this could occur without you a moderator stalking my posting history moderation logs of course reveal the truth you saw the post which merely quoted a previous post of yours that shows your true beliefs on this topic got angry downvoted it removed it for trolling and immediately banned me the order of these actions is clearly seen here my post that disputes your lie of i have never said either of those things is removed first as seen in this screenshot note the url on the lower right ending in which is the same post i linked above and almost immediately thereafter the moderating team received notification of someone trying to get help to dox me in some srs chat room presumably you have no citation for this as well and presumably there was no police report made to put it as politely as possible i have zero interest in any discussion with you on this subject or on any other for that matter thats odd you seemed quite eager to engage before i called you out for posting factually incorrect information its interesting how quickly youve switched to making false accusations that i was attempting to doxx you once that was pointed out
canada,removed,who wouldve thought that being burdened parasitic womb turds and no female to care for them would suck out ones will to live seriously though this is why i find it funny when i hear stories about men paying surrogates in india or somewhere to have babies so they can be single dads im sure this is pretty rare but it doesnt make sense to me why would i spend to go to a foreign country and get a woman to get inseminated with a turkey baster by a guy in a lab coat for a fraction of the price i could probably go to a foreign country and find a woman to have a baby with the old fashioned way the insemination process would be way more fun cheaper and id have a woman to take care of the baby instead of doing that shit by myself
canada,removed,continue to suffer genocide lol
canada,removed,constantly attacking people you disagree with says a lot about you too

canada,removed,on the topic of correct terminology heres a tip — avoid using the possessive phrase canadas indigenous peoples or first nationsinuitmétis as that implies ownership of indigenous peoples a better approach would be indigenous peoples in canada fuck off seriously fuck right the fuck off saying canadas ukrainian people doesnt imply ownership and neither does saying canadas indigenous people implies ownership eyeroll

canada,removed,you have an interesting ip address which government department do you work in dnd
canada,removed,he is a refugee and been through civil war having seen the horrors of civil war youd think hes sympathize with other refugees especially the syrian ones who have had a much worse experience on all levels yet all what this guy is doing is leading a crusade against what he calls a threat to canada and claims every refugee is out there to get him clinically this would be categorized as paranoia a mental illness but because he seems to get support from fucktards like you who are easily swayed by anyone he now has a voice and will probably sell books and other shit
canada,removed,i read my comments i asked a question it was answered and i accepted it shut the fuck up
canada,removed,anyone who has as much free time as you to spend all day on rcanada making snarky comments to every conservative opinion all day every day yeah youre a government employee

canada,removed,good one
canada,removed,you really need to stop throwing around the word racist so much wanting people to follow the rules is not racist also stop assuming that the people that disagree with you are white you have no way of knowing if someone is white from their comments you should know that your arguments sound ridiculous and i think its time for you to take a little break from reddit i agree that people entering canada illegally from the us should be sent right back to the us i work with a lot of refugees and many that i have spoken to also do not believe that these people should be allowed to stay it is insulting to them that those who enter the country like this are allowed to stay because they went the proper channels and know many who are still waiting to get in through legal means if we allow the people who sneak in from the states to stay then they take the resources away from those who are waiting to enter legally
canada,removed,why do you want people who break the law into our country most people want the cheap labor apparently take in people who will work for half of what a canadian is willing to and then suddenly youre on every thread pretending to care about refugees as people going on about white people when you are one yourself but youre really just thinking about all the fat cash youll make exploiting them
canada,removed,of course s

canada,removed,ugh i get really tired of all the basement dwellers on reddit who have zero experience with drunk girls or sex and think that rulings like this are a bad thing its pretty fucking simple fellows a girl can get completely fucking trashed and still be involved in non consensual sex a guy cant you wont get hard if you are completely fucking unconscious further more your dick might feel a little off but all in all it doesnt compare to what nonconsensual sex feels like for a girl and really its very simple if youve never fucked the girl before and shes really drunk then dont do it establish some sort of sexual relationship before having sex black out drunk or offer her some sort of stimulant to sober up cokes a good choice either way dont fuck a girl if shes wasted and youve never fucked before because you have zero idea if she wants it and it doesnt make sense to just go ahead anyways
canada,removed,duhflouride has been officially designated as a neorotoxin thats why people dont go near it fluoride classified along with mercury lead and others as noted in the summary of the report a systematic review identified five different similar industrial chemicals as developmental neurotoxicants lead methylmercury polychlorinated biphenyls arsenic and toluene the summary goes on to state that six additional developmental neurotoxicants have also now been identified manganese fluoride chlorpyrifos dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane tetrachloroethylene and the polybrominated diphenyl ethers the authors added that even more of these neurotoxicants remain undiscovered also in the report they note that neurodevelopmental disabilities including attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder dyslexia and other cognitive impairments are now affecting millions of children worldwide in what they call a pandemic of developmental neurotoxicity because of the documented health risks of fluoride many people have launched campaigns to remove the chemical from their water supplies to varying degrees of success such initiatives usually begin through the are often controversial and emotionally charged because of the reputation fluoride still enjoys among mainstream dentistry practitioners

canada,removed,please provide a list of all of your past accounts in days there is no reason you would have to express concern we however have every reason to believe that you are a known trouble maker using yet another alt account to circumvent a ban
canada,removed,no reason for anyone to change the way rcanada operates to appease a day old alt account list your previous accounts or there is no reason to take you seriously at all
canada,removed,with a day old account you really shouldnt be complaining
canada,removed,there is absolutely no reason a sub should change to appease a new user however there is most definitely a rule against using alt accounts to circumvent a ban which is the likely case
canada,removed,you are likely a banned user using an alt account to circumvent a ban and thus should be deleted not appeased to at all
canada,removed,you earn more than as was established with your disapproval of not receiving social services like a low income family does forcing you to pay for your own childcare
canada,removed,well hes not wrong there are a number of gypsies gyping their way into canada if you wanna talk vile and disgusting i use to deal with a number of kosovo gypsy refugees back in the days
canada,removed,his link in this post links back to an item that is years old in a subreddit he appears to have never posted in hos post history shows only a single post prior to hours ago there is every reason to suspect that this is an alt to avoid a ban and no reason to believe that this is simply a new user

canada,removed,fuck off
canada,removed,oh fuck off they arent frail old people they were putting up a pretty good fight and from the one sided story they were even starting to fight with others there before the cops arrived the kid screaming makes it seem more dramatic than it is and thats clearly on purpose as there are several people there who know the kid and speak the language and just deliberately let her continue to get over exited while egging her on until near the end if those people really cared about the kid they could have easily calmed her down and made it a hell of a lot less stressful finally the old people didnt need to fight and resist like they were whine all you want about oh they no speak english good so telling them to stop resisting is useless they got the message they just chose to fight its not a complicated situation and the old guy wasnt dragged down the stairs you can see it just barely before it goes out of screen that the officer stumbles down the stairs while dealing with him when the old guy lets go with one hand and thats what causes them to go down like they did all in all though it was pretty tame as far as going down stairs while resisting and they were carpeted to boot im sorry but if you want sympathy then youre going to need to do better than being old and using a kid like some middle eastern terrorist to goad sympathy
canada,removed,no you point specifically at the information we should not have to wade through tons of information simply to inevitably prove you wrong there is no doubt in my mind that you are lying about any statistical analysis you claim to have done so point out the information show me the data sets you performed your analysis on what kinds of statistical analysis did you perform
canada,removed,then provide the data and what methods of analysis you performed i will simply do the same thing its how current science works its called peer review you have heard of it right i have only talked about it with you multiple times you provide the data you talk about your methods like what math you used and i recreate it and we compare our results
canada,removed,which disease mmr isnt a single disease its different ones plus you havent described what statistical analysis you have done on this mysterious data that doesnt actually seem to exist because you cant link to that data you are sounding more and more like a crackpot through out ambiguous and vague statements that dont really mean anything
canada,removed,lol i dont know where you useless fucks get off being so arrogant literally every facet of your existence as a country is inextricably tied to the united states it must suck to know that youre stuck being the little bitches of a country you despise doubly so considering that theres literally nothing you can do about it either
canada,removed,lmao discount my argument as a straw man because you literally have no rebuttle the idea of privilege blinding people is total horse shit you have no ground to stand on go back to your safe space pls reddits not agreeing with you tonight

canada,removed,first i must confess that over the last few years i have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate i have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the negros great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the white citizens counciler or the ku klux klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice who constantly says i agree with you in the goal you seek but i cant agree with your methods of direct action who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another mans freedom who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the negro to wait until a more convenient season

canada,removed,the fact is the conservative party supports free votes conservative mps are allowed to vote their conscience their constituents wishes their own personal opinion the party line or any combination of these things thats a fact the fact that most conservative mps happen to agree with each other and the party most of the time is irrelevant to the fact that they have a free vote in the liberal party and the ndp mps do not have this privilege why you cant get this simple fact through your thick head i have no idea im done with you
canada,removed,from the article thats too high anything above zero is too high snip i think we still have this invincibility complex we think oh its just a grid road we can make it said griffin whose family friend died last year driving drunk on a quiet rural road says guy who knew someone who died and is therefore an expert s i think some people need to get over their loss and stop pretending the rest of society is representative or related to the specific case that happened to them we dont know how wasted the family friend was or the person who hit them or whatever happened the detailed circumstances actually matter are what actually caused the death generalizing a tragedy and turning it into this typical zero tolerance nonsense actually fails to teach real people the real lessons that make the real differences in real cases for example were talking about saskatchewan here a province where huge numbers of people live hours away from anywhere calling a taxi is flat out impossible meanwhile what actually is sometimes possible is having a few drinks at a friends house plainly past the legal limit and safely driving home that depends on real and salient details if you drink enough that you get wasted then no you cant even begin to entertain it if you are walking funny then go sleep in the barn before you go kill yourself or someone else you have to have enough personal experience and mental skill to force yourself to operate a large metal death bullet in a completely competent manner the same is actually true even about just driving tired you must concentrate lives are on the line this is possible for some people in spite of some alcohol consumption some of the time it is not possible for some other people even when they havent been drinking but some of them still have licenses and nobody is campaigning against them there are simply no black and white cases here the only way to make this a black and white case is to expect everyone else to take it on principle in spite of their own interests and knowledge to the contrary you can go around preaching that if only everyone would never drive with any alcohol there would never be any mistakes made such pleadings are idealistic utopian nonsense just because you can formulate an idea doesnt mean its rational we live in a world where people are going to drink going to drive going to live in remote places going to drive home drunk sometimes going to usually do it responsibly and going to cause no problems as a result so much that other things in life are going to be obviously more dangerous as far as they are concerned there is no way to police this problem into nonexistence no law will ever stop it if you want to say something useful tell us the detailed story about how your buddy was actually too drunk so we can learn to not be embarrassed about double checking our own friends before they leave with a few beers in them a culture of zero tolerance is not going to happen we need real coping mechanisms not idealistic preaching ps if we were talking about cities and young people then i would agree but there are mature people and roads where its an honest shock if you ever see another vehicle and they are factually a very much less dangerous place to drive with some alcohol in you

canada,removed,
canada,removed,how do you even survive being so stupid without regard to the seriousness of the offences it would be impossible to predict every possible offence that could get you on the sor that is not serious so the judge alludes to all nonserious offenses in general this is a simple function of the english language that my neighbours parrot can grasp
canada,removed,so heres the thing when you join a discussion especially an academic one youre joining a discussion with already defined terms the word for that is nomenclature if im having a discussion in mathematics where we have defined the word apple to refer to a specific set of conditions in our problem space and all the members of that discussion all know and accept that as part of the problem definition it doesnt matter that they all know apple more generally refers to a fruit or if they had no concept of apple before hand in this discussion apple refers to only this concept in this problem space for this problem definition now if you wander into our discussion and start calling us all fucking morons because apples are fruit and you cant represent a piece of fruit in the frequency domain and it definitely cant be applied to a system of differential equations were going to tell you shut the fuck up donny youre out your element because youre effectively a child who has wandered into a conversation that you have no concept of the nomenclature to be a contributor to so when you say things about what the word gender means to you youre missing the entire point and have effectively told everyone who was paying attention to how the speaker defined their arguments that youre kind of a jackass it doesnt matter what the word meant to you before the speaker is using these words in the context of a larger academic conversation that has specific nomenclature that means to contribute anything useful you need to know what the words he is using actually define in this discussion so for you the word of the day is nomenclature

canada,removed,are you being sarcastic why would you bother asking that you know im not being sarcastic a great many canadians think homosexuality is disgusting a vile sin an abomination against god and nature a great many more maybe most canadians think its something vulgar or weird but whatever it is the people should keep that to themselves and not show it in public even more would rather have a version of that law simply to keep the peace and winwin for everyone i suggest to you that in a binding anonymous referendum a canadian version passes by all it does is basically treat homosexuality the same as any sexual pornography oh you can go nuts in your own home a nightclub a group an adult club but you cant put it in public places where especially kids and families can see it promoted condoned tolerated etc
canada,removed,peoples romantic relationships are not pornography there is no point or purpose in you stating your beliefs we are past that yes i know that is what you have determined will be the case what you want everyone to do and accept and believe we are past that yes likewise a great many disagree and find it a perversion of love unloving certain far from romantic its antiromance and their marriages a vile abomination of the sacraments so there you go sicko now its going to come to a vote and a social division you can vote your bigoted antichristian ways and hope you win and take us back to years and every one who loves homosexuals will vote to make public displays or promotions of homosexuality illegal in the public square but either way just stating your goal over and over isnt working or helpful to anyone involved
canada,removed,you dont think im trolling you are doing this progay sjw gimmick where you pretend to be totally shocked actually its so unbelievable anyone in the current year doesnt totally accept homosexuality as perfectly normal i mean are you jokinggggg which is a funny thing since a great amount of the agenda relies on being persecuted victims unaccepted by society claims of bigotry gaybashing discrimination kind of contradictory isnt it

canada,removed,i dont have to explain anything you havent provided any evidence just because you dont like the idea and make shit up in your head to try and discredit it doesnt mean you are an adult
canada,removed,sometimes i wonder are you really just a bigotry filled miserable prick or you really lack basic intellectual ability to analyze and deconstruct issues diagnose them properly and place them in a wider causeandeffect context they happen in seriously give your head a shake
canada,removed,short study it was years and of course no study is going to show that no one would ever under any circumstances quit their job for a free lunch you just keep saying stupid things

canada,removed,let me give you an example of how the human mind can entertain an idea negatively attack said idea whilst still positively supporting said idea you know the rapper eminem his persona of slim shady is unabashedly homophobic and is genuinely an unlikable person marhsal mathers eminem is rather supportive of the lgbt and their right to live their lives however they please the same man who goes out of his way to write lyrics that were bashed rather heatedly by the lgbt community sang on stage with elton john and later sent him and his then husband a pair of diamond encrusted gold cock rings as a wedding gift a man who was genuinely homophobic wouldnt be both willing to sing on stage with someone like elton and offer his and his husband a rather extravagant gift for something he doesnt believe in the mindset you have is repugnant to me because its one that assumes a moral high ground that can never be relinquished it demands that one cannot deprecate others in a humorous fashion be it crass in nature or otherwise the biggest issue i have with that mindset especially when it applies to other people is the dehumanizing aspect of it you take offense for others you proselytize for them on their behalfor perhaps your own who am i to say but then take it a step further and dehumanize them by stating oh you cant say that about such and such group who are you to be the arbiter of what can and cannot be said in jest who are you to determine what does and does not ally someone with a given cause where exactly do you pull such authority
canada,removed,great job now make a play by play for what your comment adds you fucking keyboard superhero
canada,removed,and thats why you look like an asshole its their right to identify however they want broken or not that doesnt effect or concern you at least not until theres a law thats forcing it on you
canada,removed,alright bud tell us more about your victimhood
canada,removed,lol cool story go fuck a sock
canada,removed,no you voted to elect a government that said it was in favour of legalizing and strictly regulating marijuana for recreational use if you had even a basic understanding of how governance worked in this country youd know that to change a law a new piece of legislation has to pass through the house and senate repealing all or some of a previously passed law then because repealing things has ripple effects new regulations get written to reexplain to the entire country and importantly the courts and justice system how the remaining laws should be interpreted and enforced further if we just removed marijuana from the criminal code it would still be illegal six ways from sunday under the controlled drugs and substances act among many others but hey lets just strike it from the criminal code and everything will be ok grow a fucking brain understand that legislative changes take time and further understand that if this actually gets done by sometime in itll have been accomplished damned near miraculously quick
canada,removed,this is quite literally insanity it is a bill that forces anyone in a position of authority whether in a public or private entity to accept as real the delusions of the mentally ill we have officially lost our minds

canada,removed,it didnt use to be that way the conservatives under prime minister brian mulroney were at the forefront of environmentalism and social change it wasnt until harper came along that the conservatives went back to the middleages and thats really why i hate harper he is a regressive ideologue in the same hollow mold as ronald reagan harper will never have an original thought in his life he is amoral he has nothing to offer all he will ever do is try to exploit what already exists there is no doubt that he will be working at kinder morgan or trans canada by the end of the year because that was who he was working for all along and anyone who voted for him is an idiot why would you vote for a man who lambasted prime minister jean chretien in for not invading iraq and then later admitted he was wrong why would you vote for someone whose judgement is so fundamentally wrong and demonstrably stupid someone who still has a desire to deregulate the financial system after a global financial crisis why would you vote for someone who if he had been prime minister before would have been disastrous to this country because youre lazy youre ignorant and youre stupid for ten years harper played you like the fools you are and the conservatives will continue to play you enjoy your tim hortons ice capps losers

canada,removed,youre even dummer than her if you felt the need to point that out stoopid
canada,removed,no its not racism sexism and bigotry of all kinds is alive and well its approaching equality and thats why mras are freaking out they cannot handle it but its not equal and has been for decades like you claim get out of your echo chamber
canada,removed,so youre just an asshole then glad we got that cleared up you are reminded of the moons existence every day people who take the basic math required for a high school diploma and then move into a liberal arts program or trades have absolutely no reason to know what the symbol is and have far more important things on their mind to them youre on reddit so there is a good chance that if you are out of high school youre doing something stem related so these are things important to you i but not to everyone else do you honestly think youve remembered absolutely everything youve taken in school or just what is useful and interesting to you i sure as shit know ive forgotten nearly all of the math other than the basics and what i needed for finance and statistics courses in college even those ive come to rely on excel to actually do now i couldnt balance a chemical reaction if my life depended on it or the atomic weight of cesium i cant even remember what a logarithm is or the organelles of a cell i couldnt tell you much from the psych or legal stuff i took in highschool either would that make me dumb and intelligible to vote in your opinion
canada,removed,so hard to keep a house clean and dinner ready the other stuff you mention there are many ways around it if youre creative enough but then again the women probably chose her man so if she picked an abusive controlling person thats her problem
canada,removed,thats a lot of words wow
canada,removed,with all due respect nothing you said here is true have a fucking look and try to keep in mind that inflation exists jesus harpers deficit at its highest was billion however just of gdp trudeau srs worst deficit came in as he left office at billion yet gdp do conservatives understand math or just pretend to are you fucking serious thats a bit rich coming from someone whos clearly stupid
canada,removed,i think you need to go seek out some professional help
canada,removed,you should be whitey
canada,removed,take your feminist garbage elsewhere thats all you crybabies do whine whine whine
canada,removed,no i read it on the internet the govment takes half of my pay cheque and gives it to some unemployed lazy frenchie
canada,removed,fuck feminism
canada,removed,nothing of what im doing here is enjoyable i am genuinely concerned for your mental health and well being perhaps a visit to the local hospital im sure there is a hotline you can call that can connect you to someone in your local area you do have options
canada,removed,thanks guy the sentiment is always appreciated when its sincere many people say whiny baby but im actually just desperate for people to give a shit about future generations that will be subjected to the bullshit i know for a fact exists and is ignored for the most fucked up reasons muh feminism i like to think i have over come a lot of it but what infuriates me is that there are still kids out there dealing with the same shit i had to and the same shit that fucked me up and yet talking about it just seems to get more confirmation on what i already know of a lot of people they just do not give a fuck you can talk and explain and try to be patient but people are absolutely dead set on pretending its not a problem if its not their fucking problem
canada,removed,we could also tell you to fuck off and choke on your pipeline
canada,removed,ive seen some amazing dads growing up they were not mine my heart honestly breaks in how much courts favor the mother in every fucking case unless the mother is a total sack of shit and they can prove it on the fathers side there are some dads out there that would provide so much more than the narcissistic selfie moms do but no one bats an eye over it and there are several reasons why mostly no one gives a shit about what is actually best for kids more about image
canada,removed,boy feminists love to complain about everything
canada,removed,who do you think payed for your shithole of a province back when oil wasnt being pumped out who paid for you to have a fucking railway yeah that was us so suck it up princess
canada,removed,what a load of shit all the social programs here are paid by us for us we have our own revenue agency we dont need the cash from inbred hillbillies to live a decent life
canada,removed,both of them are dirty whores who spend too much time and money on their hair and make up
canada,removed,if the altright loves their culture so much they can go back to the european shitholes their grubby ancestors fled id love to except this multicultural virus spread there too and now they wont have their own culture soon either asia for the asians africa for the africans india for the indians white nations for everybody hurray isnt ethnic cleansing fun
canada,removed,ethnic cleansing is wrong immigration in massive amounts is wrong bringing my ancestors here was wrong fixing the mistakes of our past is right not inflating housing markets and enabling chinese money launderers with the investment citizenship program is right not destabilizing countries who sorely need leadership from the highly educated among them is right not subsidizing cheap donuts and fast food with tfws is right i never said whites were better in any way we do a lot terrible shit and have a lot of social ills people should live in societies that are culturally homogenous so people feel a sense of identity and have peaceful communities that goes for all cultures not just white cultures i cant believe youre trying to suggest that my arguing against modern forms of slavery and ethnic cleansing is somehow racist there is nothing dangerous about my ideas whats dangerous is the idea that you can nonchalantly move millions of people around the world willy nilly and everybody will live happily ever after whats dangerous is happily conspiring with western allies to destabilize a sovereign nationsyria so europe can build a pipeline and that we can just take their highly educated people and fuck the consequences pull your head out of your ass and look at the world around you go ahead try and censor me youll only accelerate the backlash you cant argue on a level playing field and have to resort to childish adhominems and pointless attempts at public shaming some sensible people are sick of your tactics go ahead call me racist some more see if i give a damn about your labels the difference between people like you and me is i can back my arguments with facts you only have emotion and vague sense of virtue signalling keep pretending like you arent the actual bigot you really are
canada,removed,please point me towards these large swaths of canadians who care about what some professor at u of t has to say about anything are the over news articles millions of youtube views and interviews with joe rogan and dave rubin not enough for you this issue is clearly landing for a lot of people thats indisputable when i make reference to main street it is a political euphemism for the average canadian voter who cannot be bothered with what one redittor has described as a nerd battle one redditor whos being downvoted and for the average person under this is a pretty big story which is why there has been so much national and international coverage of it as well as millions of views and reposts on youtube how much more outside of the academic nerd world does it need to be before you accept that i dismiss positions that arent based in any fact or reason without the slightest hint of informed opinion based on academic accomplishment or decency well you certainly use a lot of words to say things i disagree with youre practically a troll in this sub and youre routinely dismissive and make wild assertions that you dont substantiate in any way shape or form or seem to feel the need to in short many people who have the positions i argue against have clearly never sat in a postsecondary classroom and earned an education because anyone with that type of experience would see the flaws in these arguments especially a poli sci major ahh yes wonderful appeal to authority im sure everyone you disagree with is just dumber thats the problem s im looking forward to you telling me that you aint needen no deegree to havin an upinion i dont believe you do and its incredibly arrogant to think that a ba is proof of intelligence considering of the country has a post secondary education not a real high bar furthermore it doesnt take a great deal of effort to find a highly education person that holds completely indefensible positions people like nicholas matte who believe biological sex is a social construction because hes so educated he learned how to make rhetorical arguments for things that are demonstrably false and contradicted by truckloads of hard data
canada,removed,there must be sumthing rong with you
canada,removed,i see the written on the wall when we finally get to reforming our immigration laws and strengthening our country it will be people like you that will try to instigate ratial and ethnic conflicts for your own personal gratification and validation it is peoe with your attitudes that are a danger to the social fabric of canada
canada,removed,nice of you to state that so eloquently being anti immigration isnt racist at all people really need to stop jumping to that conclusion its an anti intellectual point of view i find it funny how you revert to name calling and protest that a certain point of view is wrong and go as far as calling a group of people bigots take a look in the mirror keep in mine im pro immigration i just have the mental capacity to consider more than one point of view
canada,removed,they will decide to erase all white history and leave all others completely intact for some reason well yes because only whites are evil racist sexist homophobic slaveowning raping genociding invaders whites invented these things they own these things and they are synonymous with these things evil evil evil evil evil evil evil oppressors must be overthrown must be eradicated must be eliminated must be righteously made extinct fucking whites fucking whites whites are holding back humanity whites are holding back progress whites are a problem thats waiting to be solved and the minorities will parade in the streets tear down statues erase history in the name of overthrowing the evil oppressor race even once every single one of them is already dead forever and ever for all time and theyd have deserved it for being so uniquely evil

canada,removed,just as there is lots of good advice to be gleaned from rtheredpill i am sure rmenslib has some useful truths as well but any male support ideology that couches itself in the language of feminismtm is an inherently hypocritical halfmeasure any true mens liberation must not require the blessing of feminismtm
canada,removed,if you had any idea what youre talking about ahh so youre an asshole so much easier when you dont have to be polite isnt it how much time and money have you donated towards mens help services none and thats exactly how much ive benefited from them none so that makes me a hypocrite and you right then who do i donate to btw

canada,removed,attack oh come now you think thats an attack thicken your skin grow a spine and pull the stick from your ass by the by the point stands its clear youve got it in for the trannies and regarding the abstract you linked to but didnt elect to read our results show that the white matter microstructure pattern in untreated ftm transsexuals is closer to the pattern of subjects who share their gender identity males than those who share their biological sex females our results provide evidence for an inherent difference in the brain structure of ftm transsexuals so yeah your move

canada,removed,would love to have a discussion here but the rcanada mod team just went on a crusade over the last several days to ban anyone who has anti trudeau or any sort of pro trump posts so i would hate to be banned as well and as a result i cant comment enjoy your echo chamber folks
canada,removed,this sub reddit is a echo chamber at this point the mod team just did a purge of everyone with any sort of views that may have supported trump or were anti trudeau or tried to discuss immigration policy just because of my name i will probably be next
canada,removed,if you arent willing to kill to stop trump you need to die yourselves we need to rebuild humanity and all you fake canadians need to die painfully
canada,removed,maybe they should also study the phenomenon where you go on rant in every single thread whether its related to immigrants or not what appalls me is that this xenophobic behavior is not only tolerated but youre always upvoted for your racist views immigrants made this country deal with it
canada,removed,ohhh millenials i feel bad for your love in for trudeau you will soon sound like your grumpy conservative minded parents
canada,removed,well you might want to edit your comment then with whatever your actual argument is as of right now your argument stands at a third grade level
canada,removed,you have no brain
canada,removed,your grandma sounds like an asshole
canada,removed,i pointed out the no you didnt you tried to make the process sound scary because of some hokum you read on a website that was trying to sell you survival seeds and crystals or some other woo and while the personnel at the plant dont know exactly how much water youre going to drink in a day theyre pretty sure youre not down enough to hit the of for sodium flouride which at a maximum of would require you do drink over litres of water at once if we used the minimum and the suggested maximum for municipal fluoridation the amount of water needed to deliver a potentially lethal dose of fluoride would kill you times over via water intoxication first but dont let that stand in the way of some scaremongering for interweb points
canada,removed,what does canada produce culturally as a nation this why once you have lost all group identity the last thing to do is turn on each other yer done bud
canada,removed,well if someone says they are japanese what do you picture in their mind for them to look like well if someone says they are indian what do you picture in their mind for them to look like well if someone says they are nigerian what do you picture in their mind for them to look like accusing me of being full of hatred is silly what you can accuse me of is wondering if a national identity of sorts leads to more you know nationalism the type of nationalism that wont put up with globalization leading to job churning and real estate that prices out locals among other things canada was founded by the british and french so yes it is a white majority this is why it is such a nice place to live replace the white majority and chances are the standard of living is going to plummet were already seeing it want to know what our standard of living will be in years if we bring in of immigrants per year i wonder too
canada,removed,it isnt for the whites only not at all we just have to maintain a white majority so western culture can maintain dominance canada is already turning into a cultural battleground where outsiders drastically influence westerners rather than westerners influencing immigrants our nation doesnt accomplish anything great our people dont accomplish anything timeless canadas people are fighting amongst each other for their own little tribes and not any national good
canada,removed,im pretty sure culturally homogeneous places dont have these types of vigilantes other than of course policing what women wear
canada,removed,how did they not catch the muslims behind the rapes in rotherham
canada,removed,im just saying that the superior cultures that formed this country are now eroded to the point where we have become culturally diluted we will continue on this path until the only old stock canadian culture remaining will be the mantra we are a nation of immigrants tolerant and inclusive when the worst of us bleeds it is because they are culturally dissimilar people living in mooses ass nunavut
canada,removed,mentally ill
canada,removed,what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch
canada,removed,someone should go to one of their meetings and shoot the place up im advocating violence against any vigilante group they want to give up on the rule of law then they deserve no protection that the law would normally afford kill them wherever you find them
canada,removed,are you fucking kidding me you replied to my comment with your shit about not shaming people with police footage

canada,removed,you are making a swath of generalizations and i can tell you as a property owner all it takes is one shitty tenant to remove years worth of profits there are just as many shitty tenants as there are shitty landlords and the landlord tenant act allows for squatting fyi in case you didnt already know most people who rent rather than own dont have a lot of money most people who own properties and rent them out typically have a lot more money than they deserve fyi thats a load of spoiled baby bullshit many working canadians own income properties myself included as a means to build equity and have a safe investment during a time of economic uncertainty when you become an adult you may think differently
canada,removed,i really hope somebody beats this person up puts them in the hospital and gets away with it i always look at dictatorships and wonder whether or not i would stand up for my rights in such a country i guess the answer is no because im not willing to do so here
canada,removed,still much better than before with no plan and no intentions or even goal under harper just because you are ill informed doesnt make your uninformed opinion true remember when harper did the same thing trudeau just did in signed non binding targets for guess they are cut from the same cloth now you are informed right literally almost the exact same accord harper signed cop with a target of reduction from and trudeaus paris is from welcome to reality maybe you will grow up someday and research before you post such nonsense
canada,removed,marine le pen said muslim immigrants are invading france in the same way the nazis occupied france she is stoking the xenophobia fire that burns in those looking to explain their personal failures and hardships on the other she attracts many racist followers and is overall a morally horrible human being if you think she is a saviour you should look at yourself and why you think being xenophobic is an acceptable modern belief

canada,removed,you dont really have a point as it turns out you dont need a medallion to drive people around and make money you can just work for uber so what youre saying doesnt make any sense as to insurance agents whats your point there im not sure if youre aware of this or not stupid but they need licenses too sounds like youre probably one or two steps above slum lord and you like it that way god forbid someone actually make you properly tend to your properties right

canada,removed,lynching has nothing to do with racial segregation it was the swift and practical version of the death penalty back in the day in rural counties far from courthouses most people lynched were whites who stole cattle blacks werent even overrepresented as lynching victims that distorted vision of the south is just something popularized by new york wasps and jews
canada,removed,the world has woken up from the nightmare of your people ravaging the planet with colonialism genocide and enslavement you are the hatred you have a legal right to whine in your delusion but no practical means to do diddly squat about the fact your own populations shrink every year without fail and have no desire to carry on you wallow in nihilism as your own societies espouse immoralities you cant maintain your own social services without importing us from the rest of the world to carry you afloat and care for your old how useless must your youth be to not house and nurture your elders talk about values indeed the rest of the world catches up fast all the while you sputter about with phrases to deflect your peoples crimes

canada,removed,its not a woman can you modern marxist degenerate strains of cancer fucking neck yourselves and stop telling me what year we are currently in as if its some form of argument
canada,removed,this is despicable behaviour cant believe im seeing this level of transphobia in it probably has to due with the nature of gendered pronouns in the french language it sexualizes objects i mean la table come on why is femininity always already inextricably tied to inanimate objects in the french language and the fact that there has been little to no legislation passed in the province of quebec to address these issues which would have a trickle down effect changing everyones perceptions towards transpeople and solving all our problems kathleen wynne should annex quebec for its own good
canada,removed,here we go again where we let subversive foreigners infiltrate our institutions and peddle their century goatfucker ideals i bet trudeau gives him a medal

canada,removed,holy fuck man rcanada has become a cesspit if you have an opinion fine but the hate and complete lack of empathy here is fucking gross
canada,removed,lol sorry im not going to play along in a demented persons fantasy where they can throw on a wig and call himself a she
canada,removed,unless your a little girl and some delusion man with a beard and a wig struts into the bathroom or changeroom with you these people are mentally ill to say the least and very degenerates
canada,removed,your retort was perfect until you became a condescending asshole
canada,removed,my argument is the article are you dumb
canada,removed,list of people that rcanada hates trans muslims natives chinese women rcanada is full of the most deeply brogressive people i have ever seen its easy to be progressive until it starts to effect you
canada,removed,so you are a bigot good to know bitching about canadian values when you cant even follow them yourself you fucking hypocrite
canada,removed,i said people who pump themselves full of hormones chop their dicks off and dress up like a lunatic are degenerates people who are gay are fine i really dont care i just dont want to normalize people who are seriously sick in the head because far left demagogues demand people live in their delusion this is just tolerance going off the rails
canada,removed,aww isnt this nice the person who makes claims but never posts citations is criticizing me for mine today i learned that trans people existing was a canadian issue as opposed to an issue that affects people worldwide i guess the fact that these organizations are bigger than the canadian counterparts really doesnt matter but hey why not lets put a few down the canadian medical association calls for accessible comprehensive and highquality care for transgender patients cma policy resolution accessible comprehensive and highquality care for transgender patients the canadian medical association supports the position that all adolescent and adult persons have the right to define their own gender identity cma policy resolution gender identity id go on but if youre pretending that a medical condition somehow magically changes once it hits a national boundary youre not going to actually be receptive to sources perhaps you should look up how many people kill themselves after medically transitioning yeah lets actually talk about when trans people kill themselves heres a bit from a study that specifically targeted suicide and suicidal ideation in trans people which youll immediately dismiss because its from the uk and trans people are a canadian issue the study revealed high rates of suicidal ideation lifetime prevalence and attempted suicide lifetime prevalence within this sample a supportive environment for social transition and timely access to gender reassignment for those who required it emerged as key protective factors subsequently gender dysphoria confusiondenial about gender fears around transitioning gender reassignment treatment delays and refusals and social stigma increased suicide risk within this sample one wonders if people such as yourself calling trans people delusional in comment threads and calling for them to be denied medical care have an effect on fears around transition and social stigma the study found that trans people are most at risk prior to social andor medical transition and that trans people who require access to hormones and surgery can be left in many cases unsupported for dangerously long periods of time the article highlights the devastating impact that delaying or denying gender reassignment treatment can have and urges commissioners and practitioners to prioritise timely intervention and support suicide rates are higher before transitioning and its weird how you didnt happen to even mention the name an alternative treatment i mean weve established that youre not going to provide citations but not even a name we could further examine studies discussing what makes trans people more likely to kill themselves in two studies examining correlates of having ever experienced suicidal thoughts or attempts current or past suicidality was found to correlate to a younger age clementsnolle marx et katz lack of familialparental support grant et al experiences of transphobic discrimination clementsnolle et al precarious employment or unemployment grant et al and experiences of physical or sexual violence clementsnolle et al grant et al oddly enough suicide rates also increase for non trans people with precarious employment suicide rates also increase for non trans people who were sexually assaulted or perhaps link to a video of a survivor who regrets having done so at the urging of transgender activists perhaps people should take personal responsibility and not blame others when they spent years years doing something but nah its easier to say you found god and start selling books to suckers never mind the whole trans people kill themselves before transition but i suppose those are acceptable losses since you mentioned regret from the apa report i know its not relevant since trans people are a canadian issue regrets and reversal to the original gender role were rare—in fact less than among femaletomale transsexuals and less than maletofemale transsexuals pfäfflinjunge regrets were associated with poor differential psychiatric diagnosis failure to carry out the reallife experience and unsatisfactory surgical results pfäfflin sex reassignment resulted in improved mental health socioeconomic status relationships and sexual satisfaction fleming cohen salt jones jenkins matekole et al pfäfflinjunge virtually every modern study puts it below percent and most estimate it to be between and percent cohenkettenis pfafflin kuiper cohenkettenis pfafflin junge smith dhejne in some other recent longitudinal studies none of the subjects expressed regret over medically transitioning krege et al de cuypere et al these findings make sense given the consistent findings that access to medical care improves quality of life along many axes including sexual functioning selfesteem body image socioeconomic adjustment family life relationships psychological status and general life satisfaction this is supported by the numerous studies murad de cuypere kuiper gorton clementsnolle that also consistently show that access to gcs reduces suicidality by a factor of three to six between percent and percent but hey some dude who found god and is selling books is totes more authoritative
canada,removed,one of the mods has repeatedly stated that trans people are delusional and should be denied medical care the animus here is well established and well protected by the mod team
canada,removed,velvetjustice believes that all trans people are delusional and that they should be denied medical assistance for transition their posting history on the recent daily trans threads is enlightening
canada,removed,people brigading this thread from rkotakuinaction check his posting history
canada,removed,reasonable people answer basic questions calling me unreasonable when ive been nothing but forthcoming and understanding suggests you have a different definition than most people have my reading comprehension is accurate perhaps you should double check the context again if you want to be taken seriously in the future i suggest you participate by answering basic questions and provide an opposing view that doesnt consist of logical fallacies
canada,removed,well hes one of those brigading this thread from rkotakuinaction so that goes without saying
canada,removed,you obviously are not skilled and experienced if youve been unemployed for yearsi cant believe you actually believe that if you havent been employed in years its time you accept reality that you are neither skilled or experienced in areas employers want
canada,removed,lol nobody cares fuck off
canada,removed,yeah they are but this wasnt about autogenephilia and people being silenced but someone calling lgbtq people degenerates thanks for playing but dishonesty doesnt get far with me
canada,removed,it was a case brought before the bc human rights tribunal which is not a court of law by any stretch of the imagination do you also believe that court rulings dont mean anything if the flag in the courtroom doesnt have gold fringe and you are immune to the law if you type your name in capital letters thats nice but the law doesnt care about your beliefs

canada,removed,the ontario hrc has published documentation explaining that pronouns are part of gender identity and expression sure but that could easily be as interpreted as dont call people by pronouns you know are wrong and neutral ones are acceptable when in doubt the faith that you people seem to have that the tribunals will correctly interpret seems very optimistic to say the least id say youre pessimistic if you think well soon be living in a country where people are jailed and fined for not saying xe i mean those insisting that is totally cool i think the idea of extending the same protections to gender fluidconfuseddysmporphicwhatever folk that are currently enjoyed by people of differing racereligionsexual orientation etc is cool i dont like the idea of being legally able to discriminate against someone who truly feels female but nature happened give them a penis i see a wide variety of gendered people even amoung my close friends ive got the uber masculine jock friend thats hyper masculine im probably in the middle i like sports and aggression but also enjoy personal fashion etc and then ive got a friend whos real artsyfartsy never been to a gym in his life and loves fashion organizing and decorating his place etc hes straight just is interested in things that are typically feminine so i get that gender is a scale not a binary condition and understand how in rare cases some people could wind up somewhere on the scale that their born sex doesnt match i bet thats hard and im totally cool with them being protected so at a high level i think the bill is cool and that no one would ever be punished whatsoever for refusing to use xir xem ze etc like i said i think this is highly unlikely the rulings will likely allow for gender neutrality but thats not language that goes in the charter that is up to human rights commissions so lets home they do the right thing and if they dont lets take it to the supreme court who will likely rule that you cant force people to say some make believe word like xim while of course ignoring the fact that peterson has already been threatened by the university for expressing precisely that position his first letter said this depending on the context if personal pronouns are being used the refusal by a teacher or colleague to use the personal pronoun that is an expression of the persons gender identity can constitute discrimination it says right there depending on the context eg if someone says please some calling me her i dont feel like a woman despite having long hair and tits and you say fuck you youre a woman and if you feel otherwise its because you have a mental disaease youre a her thats discrimination so yeah context matters the letter continues in many situations it is not necessary to use personal pronouns at all exactly when in doubt neutral but where it is the personal pronoun that is chosen as the persons gender identityrelated and gender expressionrelated identifier should be used i dont know why youd have to use a personal one i suppose addressing a letter mr ms etc but thats about it hes only been threatened for using the first example the context where malicious use is meant to cause harm thats fair to me thats like saying please dont call jewish students kikes

canada,removed,fuck off to rtheredpill
canada,removed,canadian prime minister justin trudeau has been accused of manhandling opposition whip gord brown and elbowing ndp mp ruth ellen brosseau in the house of commons in news politics views since may httpwwwredditcomryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
canada,removed,firstly one cannot bite imagination you dickless wonder youre the one who started this by accusing me of being a partisan and i didnt vote liberal in the last election and i also didnt vote conservative either who i voted for is none of your business anyhow you veritable creep although ive voted for all parties at both provincial and federal levels its your biased fawning of trudeau that you think makes you right and everybody else wrong too bad your mother didnt realise that there are other uses for coat hangers other than hanging coats on you waste of skin
canada,removed,just because you find it hard to think with trudeaus cock in your mouth doesnt mean the comparison is valid
canada,removed,httpwwwtumbleweedhousescom is a good starting point for explaining the appeal and convenience of renting them
canada,removed,thanks for the heads up on a new subreddit news to me and while at it go fuck yourself i am anything but a conservative prime minister zoolander die hard liberal sjw i see you pulled various terms from my previous post lets address these one at a time i am anything but a conservative means exactly that prime minister zoolander first order of business upon being elected was not to focus on the economy or easing peoples lives from a devastating economic downturn but to pose for a photo shoot in vogue magazine plus his love of selfies more than appropriate considering his unabashed narcissism die hard liberal sjw condemning someone elses viewpoint since it doesnt align with their own views but claims to be for free speech as long as it validates their own position you politically correct assholes are really tiresome since you think canada should be what you alone think it should be and anyones else opinion is wrong go eat shit fuckface
canada,removed,if she doesnt like it she can resign and become a private citizen she could also hang herself and become a martyr that could totally work i think she should try it p
canada,removed,look troll boy youre the one familiar with rmetacanada not me which means that you are indeed the troll as for you wanting me to go back theres about as much chance of that as there is of you growing a penis and fucking yourself repeatedly with it as for my use of zoolander when referring to trudeau i thought it was quite appropriate since he is about as intelligent as the zoolander character and because of his penchant for attention seeking self promoting narcissism i was referring to trudeau as zoolander long before the media picked up on it and if you dont like too bad you petulant piece of shit
canada,removed,now you leave this comment up or my gringo husband umrflagg will be upset ulowshitsystem wont be happy neither you better watch your tone mannoslimmins what does that name even mean anyways ive created over a dozen alt accounts in reference to your stupid name but i still dont get it

canada,removed,could it be that identifying th ethnicity or faith of criminals is used by bigots to justify their bigotry against minority groups and that identifying them in this case combats such efforts of bigotry youre an idiot
canada,removed,you got real issues neck beard took a look through your history and you are the epitome of weird basement dwelling loser you probably have some sort of disability based on the way you speak either that or youre just an uneducated hick from sudbury hows calgary working out for you i can only imagine that your virgin cock suckling ass is just wondering why oh why does no one like me pro tip its because youre repulsive and downright disgusting i bet you smell like a bag of dorritos left in the sun for days your mom ever come out and visit you i know sturgeon falls is a long way from calgary she probably doesnt becuase youre an embarrassment and when she sees you she gags a bit and pukes in her mouth you strike me as the kind of asshole who talks a lot but inside youre coward becuase you were picked on and abused as a child now you spew garbage online and probably irl people like you need to just kill themselves so that everyone around you can actually enjoy their lives someone needs to correct your attitude because obviously your father never did the closest you ever got to meeting your dad was when he was raping your mother have a great day you piece of human filth

canada,removed,i dont know i found them to be pretty funny it is not like anybody takes comments on the internet seriously
canada,removed,autopilot isnt anywhere remotely close to removing the driver googles more advanced driverless car isnt even close to removing the driver according to googles self driving car report released earlier this year they are still in level level is what is required to remove the driver from the vehicle we are a long long long long long way away from not needing drivers
canada,removed,a house isnt like other investments you always need a place to live what about food investments yes thats really a thing you always need something to eat
canada,removed,does your food appreciate in value when you consume it no that doesnt sound like an investment to me so its not an investment unless youre talking about buying a dairy farm are you familiar with the chicago board of trade but the agriculture market isnt really driven by speculation thats cute i take it that you missed the agriculture boom of when everyone fleeing their crashing us homes put their money into agriculture commodities the million dollars of equity in your shitty rundown bungalow doesnt do you any good because its stuck there a single large grain bin can store million dollars worth of soybeans at the current market price its quite easy if you have money to invest to sit on food and wait until someone is willing to pay you more for it in vancouver this money moves from one house to another house and thats it sounds like food to me someday you the average guy might get to consume it but someday you might get to have a house in vancouver too
canada,removed,im slightly confused we are only trying to figure out how housing investments are unique to other investments because they are a necessity it seems to me that food investments fall in the same category but you seem to disagree
canada,removed,or what if i actually live in a condo but im out on business trips of the year you pay the tax the article says that snowbirds would be taxed
canada,removed,agriculture investment is not a necessity to the person putting his money in it eating is a necessity of the person putting his money in it they can only sell their house to buy another house they can own multiple houses and sell some of them they can sell a house and start renting a house they can sell a house in vancouver and move to another location where houses are being given away for a dime a dozen the world isnt nearly as black and white as you are trying to paint it
canada,removed,ez its duhh
canada,removed,considering that all comments on the internet are sarcastic by default does s indicate that you were trying to be serious
canada,removed,however something obviously has to be implemented because of automation that will be for the robot overloads to decide

canada,removed,haha dae anything from a can is garbage why didnt you just donate a crisp instead posted from my iphone
canada,removed,or we dont go back to record low turnouts in which case conservatives dont stand a chance or elections are independent of one another and you are committing a gamblers fallacy ding ding ding its the last one wow that was a waste of moneyhopefully you didnt take out loans you cant have done very well if you didnt learn that a percentage without sample size is meaningless you might as well have given a meaningless pie chart with colours but no data on percentages of what more likely you dropped out of math i was not saying the sample size was not valid i doubt you actually understand what that means those percentages are not rationally comparable in the way you suggested they exist to compare parties within elections they cannot be used logically to compare between elections without including the turnouts what are they percentages of of is not larger than of like i said you likely didnt do very well in math
canada,removed,antiintellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge isaac asimov stupid people pretending their sky wizard bullshit is real while the mountain of evidence supporting climate change not to mention purely observable changes is ignored then the lowest of the low politicians playing them like a fiddle boastful of their ignorance the science is incontrovertible and yet somehow society allows this noisome idiotic ichor to spread generation after generation

canada,removed,if you have faith you have religion faith and religion arent the same thing they are correlative at best and in only one direction i have faith that the sun will rise tomorrow doesnt mean i follow a sun religion you need faith for religion but you do not need religion to have faith belief in a deity isnt required to be a religion buddhists dont believe in a deity for instance and they are most certainly a religion like all religions they claim to have knowledge of the divine what happens after death you should read up on buddhism then they most definitely believe in gods good called devas as well as demigods bad and demons bad called asuras i believe but dont quote me on it that it is possible to become any of these entities atheists simply have a faith that believes in nonexistence after death that isnt true either you are in err when you lump atheists together think of them like anonymous with its single unifying message of we can be anyone there is no central message in atheism other than deities dont exist beyond that everyone has their own set of beliefs some do believe in existence after death some dont they still claim to know the unknowable that doesnt mean they are a religion its ludicrous to make that sort of logical jump claiming to have answers to the unknowable or the divine is the basis of all religion not theism again i will have to disagree the basis of all religions seems to be a belief in some sort of deity a supernatural entity that is beyond mere humans that this entity either created or has supreme knowledge of the everything the universe time space etc essentially theism uadaminc

canada,removed,i know jokes like this are probably a hit around the bonfire with your likeminded friends but in the real world you come off as a simpleton im guessing youre inadequate in more ways than one so rather than posting irrelevant comments to reddit just trim your pubes and it will provide the same sensation of your dick getting bigger in turn it saves people from having to waste their time reading comments like the one above and you also end up feeling a bit better about yourself which i think is the end goal for you anyways

canada,removed,as a completely nonviolent canadian i wish i could backhand your mother for raising such an ignorant child
canada,removed,oppressing them are you high those savage fucks are rolling in handouts
canada,removed,one atmosphere of pressure for a vacuum system versus more than one hundred atmospheres of pressure for a system which one is going to cause the greater amount of injury and damage when it fails do the math absence of air versus a large quantity of greenhouse gas which one is going to cause the greatest amount of environmental damage when its released again do the math use your brain kid if you even have one
canada,removed,i love the fact that i pay taxes for your chronic illness
canada,removed,i can be mad at both just because i forget to lock my door doesnt grant you permission to rob me
canada,removed,ordinary canadians are sick and tired of the money and resources thrown at those who cant take care of themselves refuse to respect authority and the fact they lost wars to their superiors hundreds of years ago and the land is no longer theirs
canada,removed,but ordinary hard working tax paying canadians of all other races ethnicities and faiths dont give a shit about a bunch of people who the majority see as lazy welfare collectors that refuse to help themselves nor does not respect authority
canada,removed,seriously your not adding to any conversation here your just behaving like a kid your comparing northern hostile environment to the temperate martimes you are either incredibly ignorant or just a kid shooting their mouth off i hope for your sake your a kid that can still learn the errors of what your doing if your an adult your pretty fucking sheltered and probably an entitled piece of shit on top of it

canada,removed,little jihad in the radical mosque
canada,removed,scream and call people names nobody is screaming and im just labeling your behavior for what it is its funny how you claim to of edited the comment before i responded no you didnt and your only saying that to try and spare some down votes you tried real hard but its obvious you are one manipulative fuck
canada,removed,ps
canada,removed,you started rambling on randomly about down votes and internet points im not sure which way your tangents are going to go next ill pray for you to find peace and not be so bitter towards life enjoy life more
canada,removed,straw man at best actively misleading at worst no its not a wellknown consequence thats moronic reasoning you think canada is in danger of outgrowing its resources more to the point technological advancement has lead to increased efficiency in every field there no reason to believe this cant keep up with growth next we have off planet resources and recycling of old resources we will be fine so again looking at canada our population problem is our biggest problem i dont believe immigration is the solution and politically its the only one we are attempting and this isnt even diving into the demographics of who is not reproducing with regard to culture growth does not have to end
canada,removed,well he never said that you much like many of the commentators in rcanada seem to have a learning disability where you read what someone types but then see something completely different that supports your narrative the benefits are clear increased tax base no one is debating that our social welfare system cannot continue untrimmed without that for politicians it is politically unpalatable to strip social programs so you must increase tax base and it takes years lead time to get a new old stock canadian takes months a consultation and a pr campaign to get more tfws and landed immigrants so for the sake of our future as a nation learn to read and debate or we can make the europeans and fuck this place up
canada,removed,they are civilizations you fucking idiot
canada,removed,first of all your comments were meant to marginalize the struggle of northern communities and tried to over state the cry for drs as if they are on the same level of tragedy your obviously ignorant to how terribly self centred that is or you wouldnt go this far to try and justify that unbelievably ignorant statement rational adults know the difference you realize that its clear by saying there is no need to be hostile and defensive you are trying to irritate and annoy people right btw race has nothing to do with this nice try race baiting good choice very revealing condescending religious beliefs check race baiting check childish deflecting of the real discussion check im not saying your a stereo type but you seem to fit the archetype of sheltered middle class kid very well maybe not a kid anymore but you still share your misguided opinions like one which makes this all the worse
canada,removed,get therapy that is my opinion
canada,removed,you and the other asshole shitting all over a historical achievement of a female athlete that is only years old and you have a gall to speak of canadians treat each other like you know this is a sickness that i described once on reddit and it has to do with a psychological effect of someone being brought up in a heavily bigoted and misogynistic environment and then when they grow up all lazy with no skills to speak of and noter the world that actually works perfectly fine they get a shock of their lifetime because they think just by being in a certain demographics shit falls into your lap theres no cure for that just a sad trail of salt
canada,removed,some one needs to fucking assassinate the head of nestle fuck this comapany

canada,removed,wtf is going on in quebec that you need the highest sales tax in the country as well as getting over half the transfer payments
canada,removed,first of all its called a labor market impact assesment lmia second its easy to bullshit a lmia and bring in a temp by posting jobs no one can do for unskilled work massively inflated credentials low compensation there is a reason most of the employers approved to bring in temps on this list are fast food car washes pubs etc these were months from to local workers are commonly fired by their employers and replaced by cheaper temps workers have very little recourse under the law unless it is overt you fire your worker for restructuring and this isnt a problem any bit employment lawyer would tell their client this my mother was recently fired from her job and replaced by temps from ireland the protections you assume labor have dont actually exist at least in bc ontario is worse i cant speak to other provinces but those are our two major population centers right there the last comment about people being an exception is complete garbage its the norm its happening tldr youre a useful idiot
canada,removed,wow youre a real piece of shit
canada,removed,i love how you either spent the time to dig up a series of fluff pieces or you have all of these bookmarked for some bizarre reason my preferred explanation youre so pathetic its hilarious

canada,removed,this is what op originally wrote hi rcanada im a recent teenager who is still not sure what that little prickly thing below my tummy is for so i developed quite a knack for looking at the world around me and then figuring how to say things that are degrees opposite i see people like stuff and since i have no clue why or how i try to get their attention by shitting in the most cringyest of ways just the other day i told the girl her shit smells worse than mine and omg she was so upset i had no idea of telling if it really is i just thought saying this would make her upset and it worked so as a newly minted dumbass let me try same trick on these naive rcanada redactors that seem so fully engaged in something i have no clue about have no idea why and have no basic skills to even comprehend hahaha ill be so big when i grow up sincerely pimply shithead

canada,removed,fuck off you racist we werent even talking about natives
canada,removed,hahaha oh the mental gymnastics from a lefty no where do i state any profit please cite me you sure have a lot of bias towards conservatism you do realize that a conservative can differing beliefs on social and economic tangents yes you can have a right leaning social conservative and have a left or centrist leaning economic beliefs unfortunately i find most liberals to always paint a black and white picture of all conservatives fyi marriage is a contract httpswwwlawcornelleduwexmarriage my problem with marriage is that its not a contract between mutually consenting individuals its has become a contract between two individual contract and the state the state should have no power in private contract between consenting adults the state should have no say whether who can get married every type of consenting adult should have the right to form such a contract gay lesbian transexual etc heck i dont care if its a bigamy polyamory type relationship if its between consenting adults in their private lives the state has no right to interfere judge or discriminate in the personal matters of consenting adults this is ok because marriage is failing and will die out as a social norm far quick before the state will get the fuck peoples personal lives

canada,removed,if you cant address the substance of the argument instead of whining about the word crap which is fucking laughable since it barely rates as an expletive nowadays dont post at all
canada,removed,good to know rcanadas mods arent above accusing people of pedophilia
canada,removed,going to reply to myself since im sure velvet will ban me for this post firstly i have never said either of those things this post in your comment history disagrees theres no valid medical science behind transgenderism its all based on feelings or more accurately the delusions of individuals who are mentally ill just like we dont offer liposuction to anorexics we shouldnt be offering medical transition to the transgendered based on feelings alone and needless to say we shouldnt be forced to encourage these individuals delusions by catering to them mirror

canada,removed,who are you going to vote for that wants to reduce canadas immigration numbers hell one of the architects of the famous barbaric practices hotline just threw his hat in the ring and wants to bring people in face it chum you xenophobes are fucked
canada,removed,if this scumbag mccallum refuses to listen to the majority than what will he listen to violence i hope these liberal scumbags are prepared for the consequences
canada,removed,actually if youre against immigration which will save our economy then its because you are purposefully ignoring every expert opinion on the subject which makes you ignorant by definition its either that or you hate immigrants which makes you a xenophobe so you can either be ignorant or a xenophobe those are your options unless you want to join those of us who live in the real world and accept that we cant have a negative birthrate simply put canada isnt growing fast enough to make it possible to ensure there will be enough workers to fill the jobs of the future and to spark innovation and investment our birth rate is extremely low and within a few decades we could be suffering negative population growth unless immigration levels are raised
canada,removed,found the pedo

canada,removed,so is calling someone an aussie brit scot racist fuck off
canada,removed,have you ever thought that the issue isnt how they pray to god but that they are simply terrible people
canada,removed,it doesnt bother you that this guy fucked a child and is now being praised without even acknowledging that fact
canada,removed,they are christians woops and regardless of the law hes a grown ass man who fucked a child he was double her age had he been a white guy from saskatchewan you wouldnt be saying its cool to fuck a child because the law says so
canada,removed,nope but apparently this one fucked a child it blows my mind that you are so desperate to protect a child fucker that you feel the need to mock me
canada,removed,did he fuck a child yes his wife was when she became pregnant how is that slander why are you so desperate to defend them that you are overlooking that he fucked a child
canada,removed,this is my country and the people we bring here and the values and baggage that follow are my business they can keep their child fucking to their own country nice deflection though its not the age gap so much as that he fucked a child i want you to acknowledge that she was a child and that he was a grown man twice her age when he got her pregnant
canada,removed,just remember you are defending a grown man who fucked a child
canada,removed,okay chicken little have a good life
canada,removed,of course people are accountable the people are accountable to themselves the people made a decision about the country they live in its the opposite of bureaucratic political bullshit its good because there is nobody to blame you cant pass the buck you cant make yourself feel better by blaming some figurehead that you think duped you the people made a decision and the people are accountable what is so scary about that

canada,removed,they refuse to even celebrate canada day lol only quebec day can you believe that shit the nerve of these fucking frogs
canada,removed,i dont even know what to say to you anymore all i see is someone trying to paint me as a monster for saying things that apply to real life no matter how much you hate it i dont want any kids to die that would be horrible i do however sincerely doubt that the railing is as big of an issue as the rest of you especially you think it is chalk it up to life experience i guess because i have never heard of anyones kids dying from playing in a treehouse hurt yes it sucks when that happens in some occasions but if you are going to try and tell me that the parents should be held responsible at all times even when the kids are out of the parents view which is completely normal then you are being daft i hope you are never ever ever responsible for the care of a small child clearly you have no understanding of the cognitive ability or physical resilience of toddlers i think i have the right to say fuck you at this point
canada,removed,wow these are some pretty selfish intolerant bigots blacks are statistically way way more likely to murder rape assault steal and lie but we should all feel guilty that theyre targeted more by the judicial system
canada,removed,keep reporting me no worries youre an embarrassment to this country and have instead proved my point stop talking politics unless you actually vote truth huts and you know it chump
canada,removed,i do appreciate it thanks a bunch though you doing good
canada,removed,the shooter was described as a black maleshocking

canada,removed,youre such a fucking moron and you know it to you didnt know what youre talking about and you got caught out just own up to it
canada,removed,well when youre mostly focused on catching pokemon youre probably not focused on catching money in real life assclown
canada,removed,as a parent go fuck yourself if you had half a clue youd realize that horrible situation this woman is in i hope you never have kids of your own
canada,removed,well id say thats a pretty good guess before and after the had points more returns the only difference that time around was it wasnt mandatory can you think of anything else that might have been different that year jupiter in retrograde perhaps the mole people were keeping folks busy oh i know reverse vampires
canada,removed,shit post
canada,removed,yes because in canada we have such an oberabundance of doctors and quick access oh wait no we dont you are the dumbest person ive met on reddit
canada,removed,how much tinfoil do you go through in a month
canada,removed,im saying its a stupid law we arent in the where people have to go to a neighbours down the road to use a phone on top of that there is no referral law there is a line in the cmas code of ethics that says respect your patients reasonable request for a second opinion from a physician of the patients choice reasonable leaves it up to the doctors best judgement if their policy states triplets or above then they are meeting that criteria it is only when the reason for them not wanting to give an abortion is their personal beliefs not the hospitals policy as it is in this case that they not only have to tell the person why they are refusing the abortion but that they have to then further refer them
canada,removed,its not being blind when you choose to not leap to conclusions you can justify it however you like youre still leaping to conclusions and acting like an asshole its not leaping to conclusions that when you hear hoof beats you think horses and not zebras
canada,removed,do you need to be told that stop signs are red yields are yellow welcome to reality you have a middle eastern guy driving a cab in halifax what do you think he is its absolutely ridiculous to say this is the one guy whos not a muslim just because you dont want to hurt anyones feelings
canada,removed,absolutely ridiculous blm is akin to blaming all arabs for the actions of a few no one is looking to curtail blms ability to speak either but they certainly seem willing to curtail everyone else
canada,removed,i see them exercising their rights is an inconvenience to you therefore it must be rejected have you ever reread any of your posts on this sub you do the same thing except in an online capacity where did you get that from my post in fact i specifically said that no one is looking to curtail blms ability to speak either blm is simply a racist organization they see thugs and perverts who happen to share their skin tone get killed when they refuse to submit peacefully and then cry racist when the inevitable happens then what do they do they demand white folks stay at the back of the proverbial bus label all cops because they share that race as racist and ultimately make things worse blm arent getting blasted because they are exercising their rights they are getting blasted because they are doing so in a racist and bigoted manner
canada,removed,yes so that justifies a genocide in your notsobright mind

canada,removed,one of the reasons you notice this type of stuff especially as it related to muslims immigrants etc is that your posts and specifically individuals who post on rcanada will be xposted on rmetacanada your posts and comments will be targeted by them by direclty linking to it on rmetacanada and a mod of rcanada uumedym will actively participate on posts that singling out individualist on rmetacanada just two recent examples this comment was recently targeted i encourage everyone to look at the cross posts on rmetacanada that directly link to posts and comments on rcanada and umedym participation when ever this comes up the comments and post get locked or deleted by umedym heshe makes it impossible to have an open discussion on this topic

canada,removed,i think that ops rant is a bit a troll post i really dont see what there is to be upset over if a lot of people from china ie chinese people are buying houses here its not racist to say that by any definition of the word racism end of story
canada,removed,pit bulls are not dangerous animals heres some of the relevant stuff from the wikipedia im going to put this in the comment below you as well so she gets it as well the term pit bull is often used loosely to describe dogs with similar physical characteristics and the morphological physical variation amongst bully breed dogs makes it difficult for anyone even experts to visually identify them as distinct from nonpit bulls pit bulls successfully fill the role of companion dogs police dogs and therapy dogs violent interactions between humans and canines have been studied by the us government notably the center for disease control and prevention as well as academic veterinary researchers the interpretation of these studies breed identification and relevance issues and variable circumstances have given rise to intense controversy in a literature review of dog bite studies the american veterinary medical association states that breed is a poor sole predictor of dog bites and that controlled studies show no increased risk in pit bulls and has previously noted fundamental problems with tracking breed in dog bite related fatalities in a study of fatalities in the united states from – the avma determined that valid breed determination was possible for only of cases the center for disease control and prevention notes that studies on dog bite related fatalities which collect information by surveying news reports employ a methodology subject to potential errors as some fatal attacks may not have been reported a study might not find all relevant news reports and the dog breed might be misidentified contrary to popular myth pit bulls do not have locking jaws there is no physiological locking mechanism in the jaw muscle and bone structure of pit bulls or other dogs breedspecific legislation has been largely found to be ineffective at reducing the number of dog attacks research has indicated that there is resistance by those who work in the adoption industry applying a sharper distinction before allowing a dog to be labelled as a pit bull as well as objections from veterinarians httpsenmwikipediaorgwikipitbull the essential characteristics of the american pit bull terrier are strength confidence and zest for life this breed is eager to please and brimming over with enthusiasm apbts make excellent family companions and have always been noted for their love of children because most apbts exhibit some level of dog aggression and because of its powerful physique the apbt requires an owner who will carefully socialize and obedience train the dog the breeds natural agility makes it one of the most capable canine climbers so good fencing is a must for this breed the apbt is not the best choice for a guard dog since they are extremely friendly even with strangers aggressive behavior toward humans is uncharacteristic of the breed and highly undesirable this breed does very well in performance events because of its high level of intelligence and its willingness to work in new statistical evidence emerged regarding the provincewide ban on pit bulls more specifically the american pit bull terrier and staffordshire terrier in the canadian province of ontario it was reported to show that since the ban had been implemented dog bites involving the two breeds and dogs of their likeness had dropped considerably in the provinces largest city toronto yet overall dog bites hit their highest levels this century in and httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiamericanpitbullterrier the charts that break that down are here our system is the best and is being looked at around the globe as a great way to understand dog breeds by scientists and politicians
canada,removed,that wealthy chinese nationals are fucking up the housing market fuckoff
canada,removed,youre dismissing the outrage about this all lives matter statement as a first world problem are you denying the racist aspects of all lives matter or are you just completely and utterly ignorant
canada,removed,the cop shootings the shootings of cops and the shootings by cops are both a product of the unacknowledged and deeply systemic racism that still plagues the usa all lives matter is an attempt to deny that this is the case come now you cant be so out to lunch that you didnt get that well maybe you can and that means youre exactly the kind of tool that the all lives matter group needs nice to be wanted i guess gives one a smug sense of selfsatisfaction im sure

canada,removed,upvoted
canada,removed,one life was altered permanently his can be altered permanently cuz eye for an eye works so well general population doesnt mean hell die but i certainly dont think taxes should pay for the more costly segregation just to keep him safe and i dont think taxes should be spent keeping people as monstrous as you safe how ever canadian citizens have a right to safety its a strange position to take advocating for protecting pedophiles over and above typical incarceration nice attempt at charter assassination but i believe anyone who isnt safe in gen pop should be moved to an area where they are safe prison is supposed to be a deterrent if youre stupid it works far better at rehabilitation that it does as a deterrent if you know youll go into the main population as a convicted pedophile then maybe you seek professional help or you avoid acting on your desires or maybe youll murder all the child you rape to avoid dying yourself regardless either option is likely safer for him than dealing with the girls parents so this has nothing to do with the topic at hand

canada,removed,thank heavens you imbeciles are a dying breed
canada,removed,the issue is that if they successfully negotiate a better collective agreement everyone benefits and if i convince my boss to give everyone in the company a raise then i dont magically get the right to demand a portion of their wage for the next ten years no child labor weekends safety regulations better worker coverage this was all due more to the rising economic conditions rather than unions most people arent part of a union and they still get all this stuff its a great marketing campaign by the unions to make people think they did all this stuff but it doesnt hold up if youre not happy with how your government deals with unions dont blame the unions blame your elected officials i do it doesnt help in ontario if you add up the number of government workers and the number of people on government welfare and other forms of social assistance its a population large enough to guarantee that the party who promises the most spending for union and welfare will win the politicians have zero incentive to go against the unions so they just give the unions whatever they want and the unions return the favour by donating to the party and by running attacks ads on the opposition parties during the last election unions spent more on election ads then any of the political parties and it was mostly against the opc to help the liberals win

canada,removed,the pot smokers were part of the adoring masses who voted for him
canada,removed,nice generalization you sound like a douche
canada,removed,theres another option we can choose to agree to disagree in a rational and polite fashion and go our separate ways and then you come back and go on the attack again while claiming to have sympathy and youre a moderator here shame
canada,removed,and you honestly think that judges are in on some big conspiracy against us fathers no he did not say that nothing about his argument connotes conspiracy you are using this terminology illegitimately to insult an argument you disagree with this is uncivil rulebreaking behaviour coming from a moderator you should be ashamed and you should step down
canada,removed,reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
canada,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdzyzgxzswww
canada,removed,the moderating team cites this category when we remove posts just like the ones cited above sure you also cited it when you removed my comment calling out your own behaviour when you falsely accused another user of engaging in conspiracy theory
canada,removed,the part where you insinuated that the lawyers and even judges are heavily biased and discriminate against fathers that is objectively not a conspiracy theory you are objectively lying and insulting the other party to the discussion and this isnt the only person youve behaved badly towards in this thread you should step down as a moderator
canada,removed,and you honestly think that judges are in on some big conspiracy against us fathers no he did not say that nothing about his argument connotes conspiracy you are using this terminology illegitimately to insult an argument you disagree with this is uncivil rulebreaking behaviour coming from a moderator you should be ashamed and you should step down i will keep removing and reposting this until you stop downvoting it you have no legitimate basis for downvoting and as a moderator you should hold yourself to a high standard and accept criticism graciously
canada,removed,theres a difference between outlawing words and outlawing ways of using those words nice now youre instadownvoting my comments even when i just raise a minor point just because you dont like me this kind of behaviour should not be accepted from mods
canada,removed,i am doing nothing of the sort my other comments do not contain any insults whatsoever let alone baseless ones i have called you out for unbecoming conduct including lying by saying someone else was engaging in conspiracy theory when that was objectively and obviously not the case there is nothing antagonistic about the use of satire to point out that your argument is sexist i will keep removing and reposting this until you stop downvoting it you have no legitimate basis for downvoting and as a moderator you should hold yourself to a high standard and accept criticism graciously
canada,removed,which serve no purpose but to antagonize and harass this is a lie my comment serves the very obvious purpose of pointing out that your behaviour was objectionable and unbecoming of a moderator you understand this purpose and choose to ignore it blatant trolling it is nothing of the sort calling you out is not trolling
canada,removed,agreed i reported it but given our mods are basically the stasi helyl probably be gilded and stickied
canada,removed,you are a sad little person
canada,removed,why not get your head out of your ass and realize that our country is in the shitter and weedman isnt going to save us

canada,removed,your last point rude to come up to speak without asking if you speak the language is the dumbest thing i have ever heard no wonder francophones in quebec seem so stupid
canada,removed,not if you dont know its stolen holy fuck some of you people are stupid no one has ever been convicted or punished for unwittingly buying stolen property the worst that will happen is losing the item and the money you spent to buy it find me a single case one in the last thirty years where someone unwittingly purchased or found an item that turned out to be stolen and was prosecuted beyond being forced to relinquish the stolen property ill donate to the charity of your choice go
canada,removed,taxpayers who pay more then what they receive is called theft ah so your logic is actually a rant against what you perceive as socialism every man woman and child for themselves right they can pay it for themselves therefore cuts are fine ok lets see you regulate the oil industry yourself so oil tankers dont destroy the coastal fishery lets see you prevent local factories from polluting your water supply lets see you inspect your food source to ensure your kids arent killed by contamination lets see you regulate ghg emissions to prevent the arctic from thawing out releasing massive amounts of methane causing further accelerated warming and sealevel rise resulting in massive amounts of climate refugees and global unrest which will increase your taxes to deal with it no man is an island your concept of the government stealing from you if you dont receive an immediate tangible benefit back is incredibly infantile and selfcentered but hey you might become prime minister some day the way things are going
canada,removed,le smug liberal face

canada,removed,these protestors aka shit disturbers need to be put down they are overreacting for nothing
canada,removed,imagine if this many people could turn out for the mostly white mostly male overdose victims in bc last year we all know if the victims of the fentanyl crisis were mostly women it would be protested but how many signs in this crowd do you think tried to raise awareness of the overdose crisis fucking zero feminism is a sick twisted virtuesignalling movement

canada,removed,if youre not willing to help yourself then get lost i hate twitter too but if i ever have a problem like this you better believe that ill be creating an account to try and direct some internet outrage their way tldr who cares if you hate twitter get it done

canada,removed,although it looks like we can already cross off a few boxes
canada,removed,meta discussions ici sil vous plaît meta discussions here please
canada,removed,i didnt think there was an airport in north york good for them for following their religious convictions
canada,removed,that is a strawman and a completely different discussion we have speed limits so that we are all going the same speed above the speed limit is very much excessively speeding and here we have people complaining that it is to little over the speed limit if that is the case we are talking about egregiously and excessively exceeding the speed limits slow down you arent making a social statement by speeding that much you are just endangering everyone on the road i think speed limits should be raised as well but until then please obey the damn limit it is there for a reason you are not the only one on the road and your car and what it is capable of is not the limiting factor
canada,removed,well then slow the fuck down dont be a dangerous asshole
canada,removed,sorry that youre an idiot downvoting into the negatives only serves to hide the truth that you cannot handle maybe we should sterilize you and the mentally disabled since your existence harms the rest of us and weakens the gene pool the one that is delusional is you if i am in perfect health i have no effect on you your stupidity stops when it infringes my freedom you would like to hide behind a government mandate because if you try to stick me with a needle i have a right to bash your skull in
canada,removed,refusing the move into the right lane and let people pass is breaking the law congratulations everyone in this situation is breaking the law and youre both mega assholes
canada,removed,of course i know what the law says dummy you think this is some kinda gotcha weed is illegal you think thats a good law the government says weed is as illegal as heroin im gonna go ahead an assume the law isnt the best guide for morals
canada,removed,the problem is that people complaining about this are almost all pretty much universally bitching they cant speed as much as they want these people need to be removed from the road it is far to easy to have and maintain a licence and it is very obvious that there are quite a number of drivers many represented in this thread who should not be allowed to operate a motor vehicle as they are unable to comply with the road laws we arent talking about vigilante justice or aggressively blocking anyone i am simply saying that the left lane is not for speeding and look at the vitriolic response that right there should tell you exactly what this is really about sorry but i am not buying the smoke screen trying to make aggressive douchbags speeding and making everyone else unsafe somehow the fault of the people obeying the rules of the road
canada,removed,not everyone travels at uniform speeds exactly at the posted limit then you are a demonstrated danger to other road users if you are unable to follow the simple rules of the road then you are not competent to operate a motor vehicle
canada,removed,perhaps you should go back and read what i said in the very first fucking post in the thread you are responding to the left lane is the passing lane not the speeding lane doing is excessively speeding period if you think that is okay you dont need to be tested you need to be removed from the road and your vehicle impounded
canada,removed,how many accidents have you been in kid i can imagine quite a number from your attitude your insurance company must love you
canada,removed,i think this thread has proven well and truly that the people bitching are bitching because they are scofflaws who want to speed and are pissed off that other people exist on the roads sorry but no one has to enable the douchbags who are excessively speeding on the roads
canada,removed,theyve knocked down my yearly rate twice in the last two years so what got your rate that high in the first place there kiddo
canada,removed,npdr
canada,removed,the boreal forest is beyond repair caribou habitat is scarce ill tell you what bud stay in la because la is where you fucking belong you obviously dont have a fucking shred of a clue as to how much impact the oil industry has in this country the times arent changing the people are people used to be informed about certain matters before shooting their mouths off or giving any advice thats obviously gone by the wayside here over the last few decades now feelings and emotion have replaced fact and reason and logic and fact reason and logic are losing badly i dont care what the ozone levels are in california nobody in canada does nobody cares what some big city thinking ontarian that moved to la thinks your state is a fucking economic and environmental mess beyond any mess that currently exists in canada period thats not a theory or my opinion its a fact the fucking poor caribou dont have any habitat because the boreal forest is destroyed onoz fuck me ive fucking heard it all now i swear on my god damn life
canada,removed,the fuck is wrong with you you refuse any nuance of any nature its short sighted and backwards inching towards how saudi arabia uae treats anyone who isnt born in saudi

canada,removed,since you cant reply like an adult i wont your story about your daughter is probably a lie anyways but if its true then shes lucky of being born in the most awesome place in na and i hope shell be more openminded than her parents but you already know that and thats why youll never leave bonne soirée et bonne vie
canada,removed,stay in your cbc safe room with the blankies and playdoh
canada,removed,no mostly because i am amused by watching overly entitled spoiled little canadian born shits who have grown up with all of the trappings and advantages of living in canada world class education university health care welfare state infrastructure justice etc but still feel threatened by people who cant read and have never owned shoes if you lose your job to a tfw honduran you bloody deserve it because youve wasted your opportunities made bad decisions and dont deserve any more breaks the honduran on the other hand does and good luck to him
canada,removed,i say we rape you violently then wait a year then have a woman falsely accuse you of rape afterwards lets find out which fucks your life up more

canada,removed,you do realize that the entire country is going to realize what the arithmetic of high provincial service costs will be right because albertas costs have been cushioning the budgets of the rest of the country for a decade
canada,removed,uhhh do you have a learning disability unemployed means you have no job whether or not youve been looking or not isnt relevant maybe you have it confused with unemployable which is different she is technically unemployed because she has no actual job she is just married to someone who has an important job
canada,removed,unless you take the piss out of barosa then you get shadowbanned
canada,removed,oil spills are bad mmkay but holding up a rock with a small spot of oil on it and pretending its the exxon valdez seems to diminish any legitimacy ones argument might otherwise have

canada,removed,vancouver is a resort city divided along racial lines these days everyone keeps to their own kind so to speak everyone prides themselves on how multicultural and accepting they are but its a lie they tell themselves to assuage the fact that that the foreign money is destroying their city
canada,removed,god damn your an idiot logic over sjw dude
canada,removed,such an ignorant thing to say you are just falling for the fearmongering of right wing media online im guessing you are a loser in real life and project your personal failures through xenophobia sad really
canada,removed,im not quite sure ill have to look at my drug card when i get it this week we get our moneyrent paid by odsp but i cant remember if the damn thing says ohip or odsp i think its the latter but like i said have to double check to be sure
canada,removed,i was actually wondering what odsp stood for earlier today didnt feel like it was a big enough deal to google so i remained ignorant until now thanks for the reminder
canada,removed,it only takes an ounce of critical thinking to know a steaming turd when i see one no need to bend in close for a taste have at it though if thats your cup of tea moron
canada,removed,white male
canada,removed,oh please this is probably the most misused quote ive seen to paint someone as a racist ethnic minorities voted massively to stay in canada and their voting pattern significantly deferred from the majority if their voting pattern somehow matched the rest of the population the yes might have won does this make me a racist saying it no fuck off how can you work toward your life goal if you refuse to recognize facts in the name of we political correctness was needed i find it funny that people here whine about politicians being too politically correct but bitch about a politician not doing it jacques parizeau always advocated for quebec to be open to the world and learn a second language
canada,removed,lets put all the refugees with all the weapons hay wut culd go rong

canada,removed,false you have to be capable of rational thought first
canada,removed,country didnt go nowhere you just dont like seeing the brown man making money while yo bitch ass complains and collects welfare
canada,removed,then hang the politicians i no longer care theyre all fucking up our society they have zero accountability and they fucking destroy peoples lives they need to be held to account for their sins
canada,removed,go fuck yourself i havent been blocking shit maybe try saying other than racist shit and maybe people wont call you that
canada,removed,its the same fear mongering smear campaigning and hypocrisy we saw for almost years you mean reporting his actions and beliefs and after the election reporting on the horrific choices for his cabinent is just fear mongering and smear campaigns you fragile little snowflake
canada,removed,lmao yall are shitty people enjoy your white bread towns living off the dole while im here paying for it and hanging out with my multi ethnic family and friends yall should be ashamed of yourselves
canada,removed,hes bitching about the media and people reacting in horror to trump and the worst thing you find is that i called the idiot a special snowflake
canada,removed,the problem is that little snowflakes like you think everyone and everything is racist homophobic selfish and assholish
canada,removed,ive had no trouble with them in over a decade
canada,removed,pretry sure
canada,removed,maybe you shouls have thought about that before having children with a foreign national especially one from a country that doesnt recognise foreign citizenship or even allow foreigners to own land in china though that doesnt stop them from buying up and colonizing vast tracts of land and here you are assisting that my sympathies are limited good luck with your hapa baby and all the
canada,removed,rather they get rid of people like you tbh

canada,removed,yes yes the world jewish banking conspiracy or whatever you hateful people like to call it i bet you believe that the rothschilds are at the top of it as well right its pretty obvious now that you hate israel simply because jews love there and you will make any case a cause célèbre to justify your hate i hope for a world without people like you so go jump off a bridge today your life isnt worth living
canada,removed,i guess i just prefer a challenging truth to a reassuring lie live your life under whatever blinders you need to
canada,removed,dont post garbage fake crap on reddit go back to facebook you scum
canada,removed,how the fuck can rcanada help them
canada,removed,yeah whatever buddy i have read your posts here far too many in fact and you are simply a virulent racist pretty much the scum of the earth if you are so experienced in all things israel can you please tell me of your experiences when you have visited there i would love to hear them oh waityouve never been and just believe what you read from very suspect sources right i still hope you die
canada,removed,dont worry people are ashamed of you too
canada,removed,we have british culture dude look at your passport ffs and lets be honest british culture over all is one of the best cultures to have they conquered the world lost it and survived ended slavery before they had to gave us the industrial revolution of which our modern lives are foundationed its better than say pashtun culture which is pederasty and goat herding or crazy shamanistic cargo cults from the pacific be proud of our heritage it could be better but there arent many lasting examples of what that would be
canada,removed,keep spinning rejection as strength on your way back to your echo chamber coward
canada,removed,i wasnt asked but now that i have been it would have been simply because they do not just a quick google of the topic indicates that is the hate speech sites that promote this idea there is no fact behind it you do know about fake news right or are you trying to project support for antiassad forces as being something else dont be stupid but please stfu
canada,removed,what goes around comes around how does it feel
canada,removed,if you dig in other religious textbooks youll see a recurring theme and it isnt limited to islam but go ahead be a moron
canada,removed,the chinese immigrants only made sense when they were needed to build the rail roads this is just karmic retribution when canadians abused the chinese immigrants paid them pennies on the dollar and separated families for generations to come i am glad the chinese is pricing canadians out of their homes
canada,removed,other religions do it too yet you give them a free pass you dont condone the whole religion for the actions of a few yet that is exactly what you do to islam that is what makes you a hypocritical moron
canada,removed,just because youre a cultureless globalist mutt doesnt mean everyone else is or wants to be
canada,removed,you got a head start on life by virtue of your race and your ancestors plunders if they didnt canada would be a third world country so yes you do benefit from your ancestors actions but you also pay the price
canada,removed,like i said in an earlier comment canadians benefitted from their ancestors actions else canada would have been a third world country if you reap the rewards of your ancestors you also pay the price classic entitlement if your forefathers didnt rape and massacre the natives your life today would have been very different karmic justice at play and entitled canadians are obviously butthurt
canada,removed,i watched pipefitters carpenters and construction workers get laid off and replaced with tfw so you know get fucked
canada,removed,ive had the same experience canadians have been brutishly cruel towards me especially in newfoundland and ontario when youre poor youre treated even more like shit even as a young kid people in canada constantly bash the usa and they did that like it was part of the culture anyway i left nearly a decade ago and people all across the usa have been kinder warmer except in really diverse areas where i experience actual racism and alienation from being a minority all in all though my experiences with americans have been more pleasant than almost every canadian ive ever met theres also a certain kind of smugness canada has like people think its better than other countries when they dont know a thing about it there are good and bad people everywhere but canadians have an especially confusing reputation as i think we really lie to people by claiming to be the kindest most generous people when its extremely false canada is all about who you know thats the difference between people who gloat and flaunt the country and those who feel ashamed the former cant see why the latter feels the way they do and they keep shaming them for having different experiences and if you think any of the places you listed are wastelands you should see the disgusting stagnation in newfoundland the kids dont stand a chance in some spots and whats worse is no one is fighting for them
canada,removed,if you are white chances are your lineage can be traced to some group that colonized some nation at one point in history apparently colonization is okay and the wealth amassed is also justifiable because so much time has passed classic white privilege talking here
canada,removed,what goes around comes around
canada,removed,i wish you rcanada cancers would shut up or have someone shut you up for baiting people with long dead issues
canada,removed,well la dee fucking da go start another fight over it or something
canada,removed,québec and québec alone shall be bilingual i wonder why thats because the english are too stupid to learn french
canada,removed,im not allowed to say what we should do to people like you moderators frown upon it lets just say it involved a tree rope and a whole lot of pain
canada,removed,maybe i wasnt clear i dont want you spreading descent among my people if you want to shit up your own country im not going to stop you there but i am not going let you spread that same hate here in canada it doesnt matter what nationality you have youre clearly just a shitty person from your attitude incredibly xenophobic and nationalistic if the smartest thing you can do is take something out of context and turn it around as an attack of character then we can make a determination of why you are such a shitty person youre just volume without substance

canada,removed,fantastic i can imagine no better person for the job of increasing diversity in canada and diluting the disgusting and overbearing whiteness that we shouldve frankly done away with a long time ago i am confident that mr hussen will be able to exercise a considerable and much needed bias towards diverse immigrants in his policies and that he will act by required diversity quotas instead of the outdated and racist notion of merit for example there are still million somalians avaiable in somalia and ethiopia all legitimate refugees and highly skilled professionals and i am sure most of them will make better canadians than most of the current canadians

canada,removed,if you connect them with an underground tunnel which absolutely exists youll see that the tunnel would go under the national arts centre and the rideau centre in pedo parlance centre is a term that refers to a place where children are abused so obviously some serious questions need to be asked why do shawarma places need to have underground tunnels why do the underground tunnels that weve already established definitely exist pass directly under places named after child abuse venues why has justin trudeau visited these shawarma places on multiple occasions proof forthcoming also if you search for shawarma and then drag that tab to the left edge of your screen open a new tab search for crying child and drag that tab to the right edge of your screen you will notice that shawarma and crying children are both on your screen at the same time why are these two things associated if not to be a secret signal for pedophiles

canada,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
canada,removed,i can tell youre probably a pretty insufferable person to spend time with

canada,removed,youre attempting an appeal to hypocrisy no im calling you a moron because your blase attitude about geopolitics and our foreign relations are just idiotic one liners devoid of any good arguments i am not interested in what the russian government has to say about how we should be conducting ourselves on foreign policy nor am i the russian government is corrupt criminal and not to be trusted i dont care what they have to say about us so fuck russia there it is again you dont even attempt to address their argument in an intelligent way on second thought why am i bothering with thisyou sound like a grader whose teacher just told him about logical fallacies and you think that you unlocked the key to auto winning arguments i dont care what theyyou have to say about usthis so fuck russiayou
canada,removed,thats fine i look forward to facing you on the field one day once your kind are gone humanity can move forward together in peace unique and diverse not a grey cultureless mob ruled by a single world union

canada,removed,people who whine about a pitbull ban are nothing but absolute trash
canada,removed,my first sentence makes sense yes few yappy dogs have killed people my dog is relatively large and is just a random mix of breeds hes friendly as hell but if he werent friendly hed be very dangerous some people also think he looks scary im not sure why he always has a big dopey smile on his face just because your scared of dogs isnt an excuse to euthanize peoples pets why not let the owners pay and have a behavior test of their dog rather than force them to euthanize it then theres a better solution then sorry your beloved family pet is the wrong race kill it
canada,removed,as usual rcanadas resident terrorist sympathizers are the first to comment

canada,removed,put a basket full of fentanyl pills out on the east side somewhere and watch the problem selfcorrect people who dont use fentanyl wont take any and wont die and people who do take fentanyl will take some and probably will die
canada,removed,i think hes complaining about the title of the article being sensationalised similar to how the rcanada mods removed this post for the same reason headlines and editorializing note how the post heading is the exact same as the title of the article yet it was removed because rcanada mods deemed it sensationalised removal notice had this to say about that im going to assume it was removed because it was sensationalized by the website not because it was editorialized it does seem to be a bit questionable as a news source im not sure whether wants you to remove the post or not his comment i never said it was or i would have reported it however given the articles content the title is clearly sensationalized seems ambiguous however his comment at the top here seems to be correct ie that it is sensationalised and not trolling as you accuse him of rightly or wrongly
canada,removed,very astute clarence now fuck off
canada,removed,wtf is wrong with you first of all i never said i was liberal second of all i can tell you that you do not know how addiction works do yourself a favour and read some good peer reviewed studies and third of all get that stick out of your ass and relax

canada,removed,doesnt look white is he mexican hes from croatia so not mexico and definitely white
canada,removed,yes apparently by other white people such as yourself radical thought not everyone wants immigrants in their country sounds like a race card thing to me doesnt look white is he mexican look if you come to canada with a chip on your shoulder and dont integrate anything bad that happens you is perceived to be related to your country of origin or something im not so sure atlantic canadians have some kind of grudge or prejudiced stereotype against people from croatia but if you insist
canada,removed,love sikhs honorary aryans lol
canada,removed,multiple posts
canada,removed,so men shouldnt be included because the chiefs calling for it are members of a male rights group fuck off you sexist bitch cbc has done so little to show balance to this issue from running maybe fucking stories about missing and murdered aboriginal men in the last years to plastering missing and murdered aboriginal women stories every single fucking day if you dont include the men in the inquiry then it will further confirm that men dont mean anything in society and that society is sexist towards men the fact that women are called the victims of war because they lose their husbands their sons and their brothers and fathers but not the men who die are the victims shows just how fucking sexist it is im angry and upset that once again cbc is allowing such fucking garbage to be posted and call it journalism
canada,removed,what kind of an asshole posts articles about a tragedy just so they can make smarmy comments have some class man
canada,removed,its another crappy edgy altright tabloid site in the vein of the blaze or breitbart
canada,removed,youre a moron
canada,removed,or maybe thats just your confirmation bias talking should we just not report on muslim people or the muslim world
canada,removed,im an atheist and you are a fucking moron that is butthurt your facts were disproven
canada,removed,i guess no barrel bottom is too deep to scrape for some
canada,removed,do you know what a majority government is i assume you havent taken grade civics yet
canada,removed,why are you searching for pedophiles so much
canada,removed,poverty ill health educational failure family violence and other problems reinforce one another all that shit is selfinflicted
canada,removed,have you got a single shred of evidence that suggests the pm knew at all – a single shred – that this person or ben levin was a pedophile no didnt think so youre trolling end of fucking story and youre pretty bad at it considering i found your plan to troll about comments down your history
canada,removed,as i wrote i was interested in his postsecondary education related to graduate school please try to bring more substance and stop devaluing this thread
canada,removed,for anyone interested where op actually decides to shitpost in rcanada for the lulz of trolling at the suggestion of a wellknown rcanada shitposter
canada,removed,grade civics would have been about years ago for me friend its a shame you failed the class ive been a bit busy paying income taxes for most of the time since then so you can go on the internet i can assure you your taxes dont pay for my internet however id be more than happy to forward you my teksavvy bill since you seem to be under the impression that youre paying for it you can make your delusion a reality
canada,removed,
canada,removed,lol pull the other one it has bells on if it werent trolling youd have posted it to rcanada instead of running it by metacanada first
canada,removed,protect the altright protect rmetacanada same shit to me
canada,removed,except you know the bit where hammy tells him to post it for the amusing shitstorm op says good idea and then asks advice as to whether itll pass muster
canada,removed,it just puts lie to your claim that you didnt do this to troll you sure are camping this thread man you are way heavily invested in responding to anything anyone ever says
canada,removed,of course you have broken the rules no i have not
canada,removed,id ban catholics if it meant we could ban muslims in a heartbeat
canada,removed,why dont you fruit cakes get off the roads that were built for automobiles find a bike path or parking lot if you and your buddies want to pretend to be forever the rest of us have places to go
canada,removed,you seem outraged tho you seem thick headed where does willful misinterpretation of what people say lead us
canada,removed,freedom of speech for example some canadians even on university campuses seem to believe people need protection from speech not the other way around canada outlaws hate speech and the provinces have human rights commissions with quasijudicial power that can pursue individuals for offensive statements follow that logic though and only inoffensive speech is deserving of protection and there are plenty of people in this country who do not believe in freedom of assembly or even association for those whose views they regard as hateful the god hates fags bunch who haunt military funerals in the us would likely be arrested here i think neil could have been more specific here the left are the ones who try to limit freedom of speech and assembly to only the areas they support when they get their way we can only say what they want us to say how free
canada,removed,for who the that stand to make themselves richer for it
canada,removed,fuck this shitty traitor pm i guess we have to have our obama before we have our trump

canada,removed,sure id have no problem starting every post with adammarx is a proud racist if you want me to
canada,removed,beer was involved ok witness says it was a muslim vs nonmuslim argument over religion ok article completely fails to mention which person did the stabbing which immediately leads to the assumption theyre trying to prevent that the muslim guy religionofpeaced the other one to death
canada,removed,so not a buddhist involved here
canada,removed,frutopia is in the same league as fruité and tang most people who drink it are poor andor stupid enough to think its a healthy alternative to pop
canada,removed,talking to you guys is always the same you want everyone to fire through all of your fundamentally wrong preconceived notions and somehow disprove them its not my fault youre ignorant
canada,removed,pc mod thought my comment was bigoted because it had a religion of peace joke in it wanna take odds on whether youll get to see this post before its also removed i told the mod velvetjustice they were mistaking humour for bigotry because their head was too far up their own ass
canada,removed,want to hear a middle eastern knock knock joke knock knock no it is you who is wrong

canada,removed,not until those fogbreathers learn how to speak english
canada,removed,no its more like youre an inconsiderate asshole who lives a thousand miles away from me and what you say or do has no bearing on my life it doesnt matter if you think you won or not because at the end of the day i take solace in the fact that you live in a city you cant afford that is spiraling downhill faster than a downhill cyclist on meth and it is due precisely to attitudes like yours good day sir
canada,removed,see this is why people are talking about canadian values™ you see actual canadians can discuss things without murdering each other
canada,removed,were getting the usual muslim deflection tactics
canada,removed,no thanks
canada,removed,maybe they were calling him benjewmin and he couldnt take it
canada,removed,youve learned nothing and you are an entitled asshole and thats what everybody on the road think of you when you disobey the law you set back cycling decades with your hypocritical and ham fisted actions you are why people hate cyclists vancouver is declining because anti social attitudes like yours make it stressful and frustrating to live there as far as victories are concerned i won before we even started talking when i leave my computer today i will leave my house to do some good in this world but you will still be a hypocritical law flouting entitled prick being a colossal asshole to anyone on the road who doesnt drive a vehicle without an engine
canada,removed,uh right if you think two individuals who work full time jobs one as a chemical engineer the other as a nurse in the trauma unit are capable of documenting every single belonging in a square foot house then youre not a realistic individual they also had kids to look after and we were active kidsteens i played travelling hockey and baseball and my sister did ballet my dad also played hockey and my mom sang in a choir my dads insurance policy was through his work from esso or parent company exon mobile literally the best insurance policy money can buy no insurance company is going to pay the total amount that someone lost and the reason people down voted me is because i told them so and they didnt want to hear that life isnt about what you want to hear its about what is happening in reality
canada,removed,shes probably had so many youknowwhats stroking in and out of her that it would add up to about miles of sausage
canada,removed,yeah theres also this fashionable sjw trend called asexual apparently they want their own parade too
canada,removed,mccallum will now be executed for attempted genocide of the canadian people since it is a traitor to the nation selling out the people to globalist corporations who prefer slave labor of alien races to fair labor or homogenous races that can organize against them mccallum deserves nothing less than a traitors death
canada,removed,humanity needs to band together and agree that no one will ever fuck this woman ever

canada,removed,they started drinking and having the same religious argument that theyd had three or four times in the past week middle east in a nutshell or nutshell
canada,removed,stupid people you can just say liberals they mean the same thing
canada,removed,therebel lol
canada,removed,all demographics that tend to not vote but ezra wont let that get in the way from this garbage shit post is shit
canada,removed,im just going by what the study reported maybe you should read what their findings are and criticize their methods what you just posted encapsulates this sub opinionated jerkoffs who cant be bothered to even read the most basic of information to the point that they disagree with controlled studies because they simply dont believe in the results read the fucking study check the methods
canada,removed,this sub is intellectually painful
canada,removed,herion addicts belong in jail where they can be restrained from using heroin gimmie them downvotes
canada,removed,pretty bad when somebody as young as cant find work
canada,removed,im sorry that canada is so fucktarded the bottom line is that were a fucktarded country full of fucktarded liberals with fucktarded ideas even our conservatives are mostly fucktarded closet liberal idiots it has almost always been like this and were not going to ever change heres my advice for you make canada pay for our mistake people like you and ugrandyzer should go out there and work your fucking asses off and have the ultimate goal of living a better life or much better life than the one you otherwise would have lead in canada make us pay for our mistake by working your ass off and becoming the worlds first triillionaire and then not investing a single god damn dollar back into the canadian economy and when it happens make sure that canada and canadians know all about how you wanted to stay here but couldnt because we were too busy importing a bunch of uneducated muslim thirdworlders because the fucktarded liberals that live here wanted to feel good about themselves for an afternoon i hope you rub our faces in it when you build that next big thing or have that next amazing idea because thats what we deserve
canada,removed,its a study i get it when the results dont fit your narrow world view and limited education its speculation when the study supports your narrow world view and limited education its gospel that study showed that immigrants to canada earned less than canadians potentially due to gaps in literacy frenchenglish nothing about immigration levels or any other shit you want to interject in there nothing was mentioned about immigration levels or labour market saturation you have no idea what you are talking about go to school and get an education at the very least learn to analyze information that is plainly stated understand research methods and gain a grasp as to what is meant by scope the next time you want to drop studies as some sort of irrefutable defence of your position it would help if the evidence actually supported the position your trying to stake i wouldnt blame you if you deleted your posts kind of embarrassing
canada,removed,altright shit post gtfo
canada,removed,too scared to use your regular account hey ezra a little self promotion never hurts on a side note why are your production values so shitty
canada,removed,oh look another dummy who doesnt understand that the savings from unemployment combine with the payroll taxes and the sales taxes from the economic activity generated by those jobs will easily eclipse the tax breaks theyre getting which are actually just per year for the next years you seem like the sort of idiot who would choose an item on sale for off over the same item elsewhere that only has a discount even though the second items msrp is less than the firsts that figure measly o in in tax breaks
canada,removed,dude why do you exist you took all the education money canadians entrusted in you but continue to act retarded what more can canada do to help you

canada,removed,you are a bitter racist person who constantly bitches about living in one of the best countries in the world do this sub a favor by disconnecting your internet seeing a therapist and getting yourself on meds you need major psychological help seriously

canada,removed,the video never says it was junkies throwing things at paramedics it said people in the neighborhood were throwing things at people in uniform get a fucking grip already you think it was a group of accountants and psychologists who were throwing shit at the paramedics is that what im left to assume a bunch of gainfully employed whitecollar workers just happened to be standing around on a sidewalk and said to themselves hey you know what fuck these paramedics lets start throwing shit at them calling people junkies doesnt help or add to the conversation trying to imply that this wasnt perpetrated by a bunch of lifelong loser degenerate junkies who have made poor life decisions or saying bullshit like we dont know who it was and therefore we cant judge sure as fuck doesnt add to the conversation either
canada,removed,that in every election the vast majority of the country didnt vote for the winner by extension the american people arent responsible for any policy my point was that your comment was dumb and you are dumb for typing it
canada,removed,how will western culture survive without the glorious input from the progressive citizens of those islamic countries they have some incredible progressive cultural qualities to contribute like female segregation the traditional role of women being housewives and nothing more intolerance to anyone that disagrees with their religion fgm sjws will be outraged that such a progressive culture is not allowed in their country
canada,removed,dead lifelong loser junkies isnt a crisis its a good start you enlightened progressives types love to shoot your god damn mouths off about personal freedom all the time but what you consistently forget to mention is that along with personal freedom must always come personal responsibility get some
canada,removed,yeah but youre an asshole so its not surprising
canada,removed,youre right wahhabism is completely misunderstood and is extremely comparable to the plight of the italians irish etc s

canada,removed,are you telling me how to use reddit and what subreddits im allowed and not allowed to go to the holocaust didnt happen so theres nothing to deny im denying to accept the evidence and testimonies of it but the evidence that it didnt happen far outweighs the other side also to call this just a law against mass immigration is an insane oversimplification considering hillary was going to up the quota to immigrants per year i dont think im oversimplifying anything mixing different cultures doesnt create diversity it creates diversion why dont you give mexico shit for their laws its literally written mexico welcomes only foreigners who will be useful to mexican society foreigners are admitted into mexico according to their possibilities of contributing to national progress article immigration officials must ensure that immigrants will be useful elements for the country and that they have the necessary funds for their sustenance and for their dependents article foreigners may be barred from the country if their presence upsets the equilibrium of the national demographics when foreigners are deemed detrimental to economic or national interests when they do not behave like good citizens in their own country when they have broken mexican laws and when they are not found to be physically or mentally healthy article the secretary of governance may suspend or prohibit the admission of foreigners when he determines it to be in the national interest article but nooooooo if america wants to do this then were evil racist bigot homophobe islamophobe xenophobe sexist patriarchal oppressors

canada,removed,turns out the state has been infantilizing our populace with restrictions on free choice monitoring our communications criminalizing human behaviour rather than blaming universities students with no power for the nanny state we should be aware of the calculated constrictions canada has been cashing in under the cuckservatives liberal governments white politicians in power have been padding every edge of society in an attempt to profit from human error bad judgement one need only look at the police state to realize safe spaces were created for those in power young adults mobilized for change although beaten arrested are motivated by freedom whereas politicians police lock themselves away behind closed doors they communicate via double speak are triggered by the slightest offence against their establishment

canada,removed,you are never going to get a consensus on such a loaded question lots of canadians are blatant antiamericans who think america is literally nazi germany and are they evil imperialists blah blah blah and lots of canadians wholeheartedly support america and much of what they do on the world stage i personally think america has huge problems and their despite its faults they are still our closest friends and allies i find it pretty ridiculous how antiamerican some canadians can be its so embarrassing and unfounded
canada,removed,fuck off
canada,removed,claiming that a gender mismtach makes it worse its highly sexist lol fucking spare me its not about the sexes involved its about whether the threat is actually perceivable as realistically actionable i say that as a gay guy it would cross many lines for me to go pin some straight guy im pissed off at up against walls and tell him im going to fuck him whether he likes it or not it would be incredibly bad for precisely the same reason that the alleged actions here are significantly more threatening than the offensive straight guy vs straight guy banter youre referencing its ridiculous that i needed to explain that to you
canada,removed,hes a comedian telling a joke moron

canada,removed,jesus i thought i answered it not all middle eastern people look like the class of people that people in the west visualize when they refer to middle eastern you picked two very atypical examples congrats just type into google middle eastern person and youll see what that class looks like it fits the mental model people in the west have of how a middle eastern person looks

canada,removed,not entirely sure about chappele but i know that chris rock has a lot of white supremacist fans
canada,removed,you arent even remotely picking up on the point of the article and being overly defensive of the ideas presented here is a clear indicator to me that one hasnt ever thought of it before we all contribute to a culture that allows people to shit on lgbqt people to some degree every time i sit idly by when someone calls their friend a fag i am kinda helping whats seen as acceptable behavior in our society even just a little bit but those people in this example even if theyve never so much as lifted a hand to a gay person have they smiled at a homophobic joke or overlooked mistreatment or nodded during an antigay sermon have a role in isolating marginalizing and demonizing gay people to the point where they become the target for extremist violence if we have to rank responsibility for what happened which we dont but for arguments sake youd have to start with the person committing the act without a doubt but his main influence isis gets plenty of blame as well and even the intolerance taught at mosques around the world have responsibility but while were at it so do the intolerant religious leaders of every faith and while were still at it the environment created by the religious right makes it easy for someone off their rocker to turn tough words into action and this is the result far too often this insanity is the result i understand people will find it hard to accept some level of responsibility here but we all share it this guy didnt do this in a vacuum nothing happens in a vacuum thats the point the editorial is making
canada,removed,yes yes we know you hate people from quebec because youre racist and are justifying your racism by claiming you only hate quebecois people because of transfer payments bravo
canada,removed,i dunno wtf youre rambling about but really thats to be expected from the trash that works in tech in toronto lol

canada,removed,im not saying youre blaming the internet you spaz im saying youre attributing all the yelling and anger to the existence of the internet heres what you said it makes people do yell at everything that isnt nailed down because they can and it makes them feel validated and i am saying it did not make people more angry or more shouty or make them validated any more than it did in the past you are very clearly blaming the internet for affecting people psychologically and im saying i dont think it does especially when it comes to politics spare me another paragraphs of really shitty metaphors please we all get it you dont think the internet is a hammer and people get their heads hit
canada,removed,since when has a comment with a wink emoticon ever carried any suggestion of being serious
canada,removed,im not sure that people really are moving away from religion though they are moving away from the historical dietybased religions but they are putting blind faith and effort into new avenues that mirror our traditional religions but arent labeled as such
canada,removed,shut up racist
canada,removed,yeah but the vocal majority in rcanada believe that the housing problem is only fixed when single year old can buy detached houses in canadas largest cities without trouble this does nothing to accomplish that
canada,removed,the worship of university stands out to me as a prominent example to be clear there is nothing wrong with university itself but it has become a religion in its own right most notably among the younger generations who are rejecting traditional religions you dont even have to leave rcanada to see it any time the subject of education comes you you find all kinds of comments stressing the importance of university putting the fear of god into people saying that you will fail in life you if dont get a degree etc which is incredibly odd behaviour under normal circumstances as who really gives a rats ass what a random person on reddit chooses to do with their life
canada,removed,blacks were never oppressed in canada ok
canada,removed,well last time i read reddit they told me that only foreign chinese investors who are buying homes and they were using cash if debt is exploding for canadians living in vancouver its probably because they wanted a new big screen tv or something
canada,removed,this isnt a reddit thing this has been the narrative coming from all sides business education government for the past years at least i didnt say it was a reddit thing you might want to try reading my comment again the more educated you are the greater the chance you will be better off professionallyfinancially this is the strangest part about the spread of the religion if you are willing to place faith in this being true although i will remind you that correlation does not imply causation why would you want to spread the word of god the top will always be comprised of of the population if university helps get you there it is in your best interest to keep that a secret
canada,removed,a good education actually has a lot of value and the morals taught in traditional religions also carry a lot of value we take it for granted now but our entire society as we have come to know it is based around the teachings of certain religions its easy to reject religion now only because weve reached a point where there is a general consensus of how people should interact with each other that wasnt always true it took the fear of god if you will to convince people to change their ways over the centuries so it seems what you are trying to say here is that now that religion has solved the problems that religion was meant to solve were now transitioning into a new religion that helps solve the next round of problems we face
canada,removed,ok judging from your other comments it is clear you are a fucking idiot
canada,removed,the point of university is not to give individuals an advantage over other individuals then there is no professionalfinancial benefit making the parents argument moot university doesnt magically create demand like there isnt going to be suddenly software development jobs for every single canadian if every single canadian completed a cs degree the amount of software needed to be written will remain the same and the amount of other work needed janitorial retail etc will remain the same so all you end up with is people with cs degrees working as janitors and retail clerks complaining about how they cannot find a job in their field so why would anyone put the metaphorical fear of god into someone making them feel like they will be stuck working for minimum wage at mcdonalds for the rest of their life when you admit that is not even the point
canada,removed,i think youre right that fear is not a good reason to go to university yes again we are talking about the religion of university not university itself were talking about how people worship university as if it is some magical deity that magically solves all of lifes problems like i said from the get go university is a useful tool it is the emotional attachment to university that people have that borders on being a religion there are more software engineering jobs in canada every year although it is easy to forget how tiny the industry is there are more farmers than software developers
canada,removed,they shut down people doing dental work onthecheap even when theres no health reason to do so we call it supply management in canada same reason why you will be in big legal hot water if you try to flood the market with milk without having the necessary quota
canada,removed,they do not rely upon any particular religion for that value not anymore the fact that the values were instilled via the threat of divine punishment doesnt really speak well for those religious methods of teaching but were doing it all over again the hypothetical punishment this time around is financial and professional consequences even though there is no evidence that increasing the number of people educated increases the number of people doing well if you believe rcanada things have gotten financially and professional worse for people as the rate of educational attainment has increased
canada,removed,pretty standard for that fuckwad
canada,removed,lets see median family income is median housing price is much harder to find as canada likes to use mean for some reason unfortunately the extreme prices in vancouver and toronto which only make up about of the homes are going to skew the mean in some pretty strange ways im going to assume the median price is i could not find the median family spending either but im going to assume which is about under than the mean i think thats fairly reasonable as the wealthiest families are apt to skew the numbers again if we do a quick and dirty tax calculation the family will have about after taxes and after expenses of is that means the median family can cover the down payment in under two years if my assumptions are true i welcome real values if you can find them
canada,removed,better yet dont remove them and instead educate the public and do your part in modernizing and cleaning up gun laws in canada most are good some are not and make no sense
canada,removed,im not sure i understand the relevance of your link most people dont live in vancouver and most people arent buying average houses across canada either remember mean vs median
canada,removed,up ship cant happen too soon for me
canada,removed,rock n roll man like are you kidding me
canada,removed,that doesnt explain how average canadians are not going to have a downpayment until even your own link suggests years for the most extreme cases in vancouver which only puts average people in their early
canada,removed,youve never seen anyone tell others that they must attend university or the wrath of the economy will come down harshly on them and they will be banished to work for minimum wage at mcdonalds you should get out more because that is a somewhat frequent occurrence its a tool that is to be used i dont know i like a lot of tools but ive never felt it necessary to put the fear of not having work into someone because i like that much it is incredibly odd behaviour like i explicitly said university is a useful tool were talking about the odd emotional behaviour that many people direct towards that tool
canada,removed,moron
canada,removed,there are other comments in this very discussion who have blindly stated that completing a university degree will increase your financial success which doesnt even have anything to do with education the word of god gets spread even without thinking about why they are spreading it its okay i imagine early religious people denied being religious too god also was a useful tool after all a means to an end to help explain the world and how to interact in it we only take that for granted today because the functionality of religion is so tightly ingrained in our society now that wasnt always true
canada,removed,or maybe theyve seen the studies for years and thought it to be common knowledge if it is common knowledge why are the people or rcanada so quick to state how much better the baby boomers who statistically had much less education were so much better off financially i mean you cannot have it both ways the millennial generation has more education than any other generation in canadas past which means they should be substantially better off financially why are people denying that fact if it is such common knowledge i imagine people who dont see the merit in a university education i am surprised that someone who cannot read is an advocate for university once again there is nothing wrong with university we are talking about the evangelicals who worship it surely you can understand the difference between people and universities
canada,removed,harmless lol youre already clearly wrong smokes cancerous neurotoxin dude go the fuck back to biology lmao das science an shieet already wrong fuck yall poison progress trudeau

canada,removed,if people do nothing but focus on the past they can never move on into the future do you do open mic night at yukyuks honestly though youre second city material my good man fuck i love anglophone culture all the sopping selfrighteousness of a proud history with none of the responsibilities the implicit violence of isis and more whine than all the vineyards of france hilarious you should all host yourselves at the oscars and give yourselves a million gold statuettes a generation of people so keen on focusing on the future out of a desperate desire to wash their hands clean of the past they have never had any intention of doing anything about the homeless of toronto who reek of piss are a more welcome sight than the likes of you putting on that tough shell and bravado about how strong you are and yet traversing your sensitivities and feelings is like walking through a bloody minefield they serve martinis where you perform
canada,removed,lmao le edge s
canada,removed,canada should be rightfully criticized for how we treat our native people just the other day i hit one over the head and took his house and then when he asked me for a job i took an asian person instead and paid this asian man only half of what a white man would get i charged the asian man a years salary to keep working for me
canada,removed,i am thoroughly sick and tired so go and find yourself a native healer live there for a year and report to us back your posting sound like that everything what is wrong is fault of nonnative canadians so maybe you should and i quote fuck off right now

canada,removed,personally i think that islam along with most religions is full of terrible ideas but im not about to judge all the muslims on this planet because i disagree with their beliefs or traditions this is off the topic of the fire and the donations and i kinda agree with you this is a position that ive been trying to maintain but here is my struggle say that i know that some people who belong to a certain religion or group that is full of bad ideas but i nobly decide to judge only the ideas not the people seems admirable makes me feel good but how do i not negatively judge people who choose to belong to an organization with bad ideas people who refuse to reject bad ideas ideas that arent only bad for the people in the group but are very bad for people who arent in the group people who willingly belong to even just nominally support and advocate a philosophy that has in its core doctrine ideas that would be illegal and immoral in most countries if that group were to be founded today but because its their culture or tradition we decide to give them a pass what if a seemingly nice family moved in next door to me and in chatting over the fence they told me they were active and contributing members of a new modern nazi party that is advocating resurrecting wwiiera nazi philosophies do i say they seem like nice people so i wont judge them

canada,removed,cyclist and handpicked member of gods chosen society whines about not being treated as the superior race by disgusting untermensch driving planetkilling machine more at
canada,removed,i cant decide if youre trolling or just a moron
canada,removed,thats because those in the altright dont want any sunshine around theyve been working for a while now to normalize their racist bigoted and fascist views for a time and place where the average person couldnt spot a fascist if they were staring right back at them thankfully this sub is a small and nonrepresentative segment of the canadian population lots of angry uneducated and low skilled users on this sub

canada,removed,im not harassing or abusing anyone im just trying to have a conversation with a fellow canadian utherebelistrash but you guys keep deleting our posts without notification and for no reason
canada,removed,apparently under attack is finding one person to comment on the story in new york the altright makes this a story hours ago and now it appears on the np from the article nomani said trudeau and other politicians who support gender equality should refuse invitations from gendersegregated places of worship including mosques guess trudeau shouldnt go to a rc church either him being a roman catholic id like to see the np take a stronger stance on women becoming priests since they seem to care so much about this event there is definitely a story here but whenever the np reports on an issue they do so with unclean hands plain and simple they cannot be trusted as presenting the facts and context
canada,removed,youre part of the altright
canada,removed,so is christianity and most religions around the world but that doesnt fit within your altright narrative in targeting islam pretty predictable position you guys have lacks creativity and initiative
canada,removed,hes a child dont waste any more of your time on him its much easier for him to just straw man anybody who disagrees with him
canada,removed,hes not encouraging anything he went and spoke to a congregation no different if he were going to speak to a bunch of roman catholics remember when the pope came to visit for world youth day i dont remember you altright folks complaining that canada shouldnt be hosting a religious leader who opposes samesex marriage doesnt afford women equal rights and had a history of molesting children its ok your narrative as part of the altright is to shit on islam every gets it youre like the coke commercials that shit on pepsi youre brand loyal we get it
canada,removed,neat i didnt know that i thought it was to point out that islam is an utterly insane doctrine of belief and leads to political and social upheaval where ever it is introduced i didnt realize i also had to promote european christendom indonesia is doing just fine in its pluralistic and multiethnic society you obviously have come across this point before but ignore it because the altright allows for cognitive dissonance and allows you to ignore entire facts thats what makes the movement fascist look it is great that you have a new buzzword to bitch and whine about and i congratulate you for it with you day old account but maybe just maybe you are just an asshole who keeps on getting accounts banned for being an asshole and we should instead just ignore you more amazing dialogue from the altright who get their feathers all ruffled when the sun comes out and shines a light on their nefarious ways come october none of this will matter and you guys will have to go back to the drawing board for another rebrand please post a list of your previous and current other account names for all we know you are a deliberate shit disturber i am participating in an open forum and commenting on the altright nature of repeat posters who continually push the same narrative over and over again i will not do what you ask you have no control over me
canada,removed,lets see it altright here is the nafta man himself mr free markets and fair trade the greenest pm in canadian history
canada,removed,this is a low effort low content post

canada,removed,bwahahhaaha really is that the best you can do the crusades only failed in that they didnt completely eradicate islam they were a defensive war against the islamic jihadist hordes as for the spanish inquisition the to deaths accorded to it barely compare to the millions of people murdered in the name of islam id insult you but youd cry to the mods about me being a big meanie and saying nasty things on the interwebz about you sissy

canada,removed,fucking cunt ass wynne needs to get the hell out she got bought out by large companies fucking bitch go to prison for being a company bitch
canada,removed,no youre right completely excluding women from having any role whatsoever in the leadership except you know female saints like mother theresa and the huge huge role of women in the church women are excluded from direct power but the indirect power they have is immense especially since theyre the majority of congregations general theosophical direction of a given religion you know nuns exist and are hugely influential right is way way way worse than gendersegregated seating yep glad you agree you see one puts a very very select few men in a patriarchal position of power but otherwise treats congregation membersthe overwhelming bulk of people within the religionas equals is it less than preferable absolutely but there is a gulf of distance between this and demanding even extra segregation for women when theyre menstruating for instance as opposed to rightwing misogynistic toolbags fucking hell dude can you people ever discuss anything without throwing out hyperleftist buzzwords
canada,removed,its not just chinese but they are by far the worst offenders its not indian and filipino millionaires demolishing our unregulated real estate market all while being poor on canadian paper but still able to purchase a million plus dollar home its not indian business owners trying to bully the government into bringing over indian miners because the miners need to be fluent in punjabi its not indian or filipino stratas kicking non speakers of tagalog and punjabi out the passive aggressive chinese colonization of this country is a fucking mess they are fucking locusts
canada,removed,allahu akbar
canada,removed,ok this source cant stand winteryknight is a christian antigay website who sites the family research council the mecca of antigay bias oh with a sprinkling of heritageorg the grand marshal of the we hate fags parade you literally couldnt find a more biased series of places to source then if you linked to isiss school of international diplomacy but dont worry theres two links to educational organizations real ones too thats a good sign hmm or is it well the first link to a fact sheet from the medical university of south carolina literally includes the following statement violence appears to be about as common among lesbian couples as among heterosexual couples or literally the opposite of what the author claims oh and the other link to a study on a single campus in florida that gives a id look it up but they dont cite their sources so if your statement is true itll have been actually proven which right now it isnt
canada,removed,im describing a broader phenomenon than this thread or this sub reddit as a whole is more likely to seize a false rape story than an actual rape story of course the reason is that false rape stories are super rare compared to actual rape but that fact seems to escape a lot of people on this site thats why i said leave it to reddit and not leave it to rcanada or leave it to the people in this specific thread the reason i snidely mock people is that reddit lives for snidely mocking people when in rome do a roman etc although i have observed that people generally only complain about snide mocking when a belief they hold dear is the target of the mocking another facet of that whole confirmation bias thing that this site seems to promulgate
canada,removed,slope
canada,removed,no devout muslim could be a hypocrite
canada,removed,ontario chamber of commerce wants whats good for its members not neccessarily whats good for the community at large they want to channel a lot of money to a few you know like wall street id rather we distribute that money across the employee group and the taxpayers and see some of it put back into the community

canada,removed,another example of the pussy pass in action if this had been a male lpn he would have been charged and prosecuted but the actual outcome is a white wash of the facility and their supervisors they had a legal duty to report this woman to the health ministry and the police and did not do either the get out of jail card was her promising not to work as a nurse in the future so where is she going to be working now and in what capacity id like to know jim b

canada,removed,just kick the asians out then housing prices will become affordable again not to be racist but canadians need houses more than chinese
canada,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
canada,removed,remember when people called him a conservative shill hes simply a centreright moderate and sticks to his principles
canada,removed,his name is jeff stewart source student at fraser
canada,removed,most of what she said is correct however i think its clear that shes missing some information sadly were being kept in the dark almost as much as the rest of you i know that mr stewart was fired after making a conservative comment and receiving complaints from a couple students not just one we dont know exactly what happened but we do know that he had a bunch of offenses prior to the comment this was just what the school used as an excuse to can him as far as i can tell shame to the students really liked him
canada,removed,do you think you might be a retard
canada,removed,from article for lethal injection to selfadminister
canada,removed,you understand that many muslim countries punish homosexuality with either prison or death as someone who was born and raised in a muslim country this attack isnt at all surprising expect more violence against jews and lgbtq people as we import more and more muslims take a look at the link below to see the surprising amount of support for barbaric practices stoning honor killings in muslim countries take a look at what they think about homosexuality
canada,removed,read the news moron the shooter called before the attack saying that he was doing it in the name of islam and isis isis took credit for the attack he shouted allah ackbar while he murdered the people you staying deliberately ignorant of facts doesnt change reality
canada,removed,just the other day i heard a radio commercial for a local hydroponics store and in the exact same tone of voice that the narrator initially used to describe what beautiful tomatoes you could grow in your basement he also innocently mentioned the highquality marijuana you could produce as well no sniggering no euphemisms no legal doublespeak he just threw it in there as if he were talking about literally any other plant the sheer nonchalance of it was nothing short of astounding
canada,removed,im glad you support harper the pm with the worst record in canadian history when it came to keeping our country safe from islamic terrorism our own parliament wasnt safe on harpers watch sad pathetic
canada,removed,fail harder
canada,removed,i wont downvote you midnight generally you are just saying what the stepfordfag politically correct gays refuse to face however i think you have missed the point in exonerating judeochristians by contrasting the koran with the bible the difference if there be any is that in islam the koran is supposed to be taken literally while most mainline christian and jewish groups look at the bible as being historically conditioned evangelical crazies still look at the bible as literally true and we members of the lgbt community are just as liable to death as we are in say saudi arabia or isisville so dont let your own religion off the hook i solved the problem by suddenly realising i did not want to be part of an organization that considered me perverted evil and sick for something that went to the core of my being and i walked away from religion in general i now look at organized religion as the greatest evil ever inflicted on humanity now im going to get the downvotes
canada,removed,heres a story from days ago go read the news dipshit im not going to put together a full report because youre keeping yourself intentionally ignorant nobody except you and a couple of other trudeau fanboys are denying that this was an isis operation
canada,removed,oh god the daily promuslim propoganda
canada,removed,ctrlf radickulous glad to see the child raping prophets biggest apologists out in full force in this thread
canada,removed,thats not what hes saying the parties who are hurt by fptp could support another system such as ranked ballot but they support pr because thats the one who would help them
canada,removed,the fact that conservatives actually think justin trudeau said this says a lot about conservative intelligence
canada,removed,actually i asked my grade crush to dance and was expecting to cry in the bathroom when she said no and was pleasantly surprised when she said yes and then later sought me out to ask me to dance with her again and again and again i did masturbate to pictures in sports magazines a few times but thats because internet was new back then the computer was in the family room so by the time your porn loaded your parents were back from grocery shopping and now you had to clean the history of something you didnt even get the time to enjoy thats how i grew up that might sound shitty to you but it drove me to chase real life tail and have sex with actual girls offtrail in parks and in bathroom stalls at the mall so i guess the lack of technology caused my youth to be an overall better experience than yours sorry
canada,removed,domestic therapeutics from austria or heaven sent an expert brought by government to deal with mental health disease and sundry lobbies to appease not one for unproductive talk the bold decisive dr glock techniques of his are widely known and legal application shown as blameless to the therapist once he or she has got the gist so health once more will rule the block with care from eminent dr glock regardless of psychotic hue his methods are applied in blue so if your brother or your dad is acting weird or bad or sad just call hes there around the clock the old reliable dr glock

canada,removed,could you stay off my account page i mean seriously you couldnt make it more obvious youre just sitting on my account page and removing my comments
canada,removed,maybe it started when homosexuals were being thrown from rooftops en masse by isis and other militant faith groups wait what the instructions are right there in the hadith what about the koran crap here i was all delusional thinking killing homosexually was a fringe behavior that all religions are doing relatively equally
canada,removed,youre a mass of contradictions one day if youre lucky youll understand why

canada,removed,you wont learn to read by keeping your head in your ass
canada,removed,just because you cant read or understand the article is no reason to spread garbage lady
canada,removed,youve had actual police officers telling you there arent quotas youve seen police chiefs risk their jobs saying so in print at what point will you start to believe that maybe just maybe chemtrails arent a real thing police departments are organized just like any body a typical arrangement might include traffic divisions where the employees are expected to do their job independently one way of knowing whether theyre doing the job or sleeping is whether there is tangible evidence of having worked given the fact yes fact that traffic violations are more than abundant that means that a working traffic division police officer should be producing violations one who has no violations in a shift may have to explain they were pulled into a patrol role responding to an emergency or testifying in court scenarios where an officers production is several standard deviations above or below the norm is an indicator of something
canada,removed,you falsely called me a man so i just assumed thats how you wanted the discussion to go and fyi being a woman isnt an insult but curious that youre letting your misogynist flag fly
canada,removed,solicitation isnt a black and white term and judgement can be left to the officer ill opt not to debate this do you think the undercover officer would judge that he was soliciting no it makes no difference to the driver because they dont know hes an officer and it achieves the exact same end result as evidenced by the article a driver who isnt texting in the lap wouldnt care i am not anticop and i believe distracted driving is an epidemic that needs to be stopped but the strategy used by the police here is all kinds of wrong i see an average of people distracted driving every day many more if i happen to be driving more a common infraction is how they try to hide it by doing it in their crotch below the sight line having an up close personal view of the infraction is helpful for the conviction and frankly its more fair too early in these laws police were taking the mere presence of a phone as evidence which to me is insufficient
canada,removed,your post history shows you attack first and i defended myself against you youre a mugger who tried mugging the wrong person is now salty because they hip tossed you and pushed your face on the ground the easy solution to not being held accountable for your attacks stop mugging people
canada,removed,yet again grow up and just block me your unprovoked attacks are counterproductive
canada,removed,im not doubting that you spent time in the hospital im doubting that you actually had pneumonia a lot of parents believe their kids have certain disease and threaten doctors to get the kid treatment for that imaginary condition sounds like your dad was one such pos hope he died a miserable death
canada,removed,again it doesnt matter if he was wearing his seatbelt or not it absolutely does matter and is the core issue of the complainers facebook manifesto but it is the reason were hearing about the officers strategy many more may have tried to give him money other less shoddy media have reported with clarity that the police through deed and word didnt ask for money declined money and clearly explained to any and all curious onlookers who they were and why they were and what they were doing i wasnt using throwing in the literal sense its about the credibility of the salty facebook guys complaint but either way you are avoiding the question i asked you several times youve never put a question clearly let alone several times do you or do you not consider handing money to someone outside while in a vehicle at an intersection a distracted behavior its not about what i or you think its about what the law and the police think their statement is crystal clear in saying they did not treat or cite anyone addressing them or trying to hand money or even drivers taking out their phones to photograph or video the undercover officer as distracted driving they only and deliberately confined themselves to people who were already breaking the law before approaching the intersection getting up close for a visual confirmation just makes the charge and evidence stronger and thanks to the viral attention theyre saving lives through deterrence i am willing to bet that had they posed as a regular pedestrian at the corner of the intersection instead of in the middle of it with a cardboard sign this man wouldnt have tried to give the officer would you agree this presupposes you believe a story that is otherwise not that credible now if you were to say to me could they do this same operation without a hobo cover and in plain clothes sure i hope they do i hope that distracted drivers start actually fearing getting caught because expecting them to care about their fellow humans is about as likely as expecting redditors to be civil
canada,removed,you attack people without provocation and you whine like a foul mouthed baby when someone stands up to you block me already

canada,removed,not really are you claiming there is a broadly nonpartisan movement against muslims and islam in canada rather than a conservativefocused one lol i guess you missed the whole last year in quebec complete with their attempt to pass community charters aka lets religiously persecute certain groups and the conservative push to link islam with terrorism that shit sure wasnt part of the liberal platform and it isnt part of liberalism screw you i swear you guys will try to whitewash anything including your bigotry pathetic

canada,removed,hate speech is so ambiguous of a terminology but even still who gives a fuck lets post the defenition hate speech is speech gesture or conduct writing or display which is forbidden because it incites violence or prejudicial action against or by a protected individual or group or because it disparages or intimidates a protected individual or group so if its said online and it doesnt incite violence or prejudice action its not hate speech its just a shity opinion seriously who cares if people talk shit online

canada,removed,youre on trump wins and ill send you too i dont think you understand how betting works youve insisted hillary would win despite the clinton rape controversy alleged rape controversy innocent until proven guilty etc it isnt comparable to trumps fatal gaffe because here we have a confession by trump im saying yes i could actually believe it would happen because another horrible candidate obama actually won last time except obama wasnt a horrible candidate he was a pretty good candidate the opposition to him wasnt as good even though it was still much better than the current offering if you dont believe americans are suicidal enough to vote hillary just look at the formerly sensible canadians they actually voted in pm zoolander voting for hillary isnt suicidal just like voting in trudeau wasnt suicidal either though i understand why outoftouch reactionaries would be angry about both so absolutely yes people do stupid things something you prove to everyone every time you post though not in the way you believe but i think americans know better this time and the trump movement is too strong you admitted yourself your side was losing in a recent post this kind of behaviour is exactly why no sane person believes you at this point and why your comments when they arent being automoderated are a waste of time and energy on your part so please continue wasting time by responding to everyone who calls you out on your bs at least youre not doing too much damage when you do that too powerful its rising and growing into a social revolution unstoppable at this point either you really believe that and youre delusional or you dont and are simply thumping your chest in which case i think pathetic is the correct word
canada,removed,just because were safer than ever before doesnt mean terorrism or other crime doesnt exist your logic is grade school tier
canada,removed,if they have direct communication then should use proper pronouns like your language is the agreement on words and definition between the direct communication of parties when reference their processing pronoun in objectivity matters as cues so so his her theirs it is used as validation cue so when referring in third person they must use it objectivity but in first person it doesnt matter it required address as mr miss or mrs if they want that

canada,removed,danish emigrant in ontario years serious question why not move somewhere else than vancouver there are sooo many cool people and places and jobs some many other places in canada all we here is how house prices are ridicules out west i know its not fun moving away from friendsfamily im from copenhagen and it was hard but this is the future of your life were talking about i know it doesnt compare but i bought my house for and people here commute to ottawa that has plenty of jobs time to cut off vancouver and leave it to the chinese maybe im just talking out my ass
canada,removed,unsubscribed fuck your homophobic cop loving bullshit go agitate some other minorities lest we forget indeed
canada,removed,what an interesting shade of stupid you are
canada,removed,i have an issue of them xposting directly to to things such as people comments making them a target a rule prohibiting malicious crossposting has been brought up in mod talk and is still being discussed essentially it would prohibit crossposting for the purposes of threatening harassing or bullying posters httpswwwredditcomhelpcontentpolicy for their participation here on canada violators would be banned from canada if you or anyone else supports such a rule let the moderating team know about it
canada,removed,tell me about it man i have to fly to europe to see my friends and family after years in canada i get the feeling that vancouver is too cool for the rest of the country no offence to anyone and that is also what is driving prices up with other things canada is the most amazing country in the world with so many possibilities move east my friends
canada,removed,
canada,removed,i totally know what you mean same dynamics are at works in a copenhagen where im from lots of people could never imagine themselves outside of copenhagen or maybe even a specific part of town hipsters have to grow up and our own success nothing will get handed to us like out parents generation im
canada,removed,its not my fault you dont have the same backbone our militant unionist ancestors did if we want good working conditions and real change we have to fight for it
canada,removed,fuck off troll
canada,removed,bro a lot of people in this wold including myself live thousands of kms from out families yeah its not always fun but im not anymore and im trying to make my own life and own family happen christmas is tough but im relatively happy and new friends do happen even though it is a little harder when you get older i joined a softball league and ride with the mountainbike club between those people and my former workmates i have more friends than i need also going back to visit is possible godspeed
canada,removed,get this metacanada trash out of here its a non issue and you all need to relax youre like a bunch if children
canada,removed,totally i praise myself lucky that it was relatively easy for me to make the move from urban to rural i did it at a great time in life when i was ready to settle down ie not go drinking all the time and all that we our gen are yelling at the boomers for being entitled and a lot of then are but meanwhile we still want everything coming to us from god know where
canada,removed,this is such a good point thanks
canada,removed,the coast you dummy not the middle
canada,removed,haha sounds like youre talking about copenhagen ive never been to vancouver but i have been to a lot of places and there are jobs and affordable living a lot of places maybe no jobs out east i dont know anyways itll be exciting to see what happens to out generation and the world over the next decade
canada,removed,youre an idiot
canada,removed,stop looking to whitey to solve your problems look what iceland has done enforced common sense there are enough unemployed to organize hunting trapping tracking hockey broomball badminton sewing life skills cooking whitey spends millions of hours volunteering to make their communities better parents are involved in their children s lives assuring they are in school and encouraging academic and social skills
canada,removed,hey look a butthurt bertan
canada,removed,you are so good at gaslighting look at you lil sociopath it never occurred to you that the instigating factor was the murder of an innocent black man and the answer was for police to also murder another protester i mean i get it youre a systemically racist cop fucker but this is pretty simple algebra here who dun it who shot the gun
canada,removed,all in the line of duty amirite do you jack off to this shit honestly what makes you tick like such a racist murderer
canada,removed,haha ok you got me youre a good troll no actual human being could sincerely say what youve been saying because such a human would be so stupid as to be unable to function in society
canada,removed,so why are your kids wanting to kill themselves fuck you honestly no good person opens an argument like this
canada,removed,hopefully they dont get raped
canada,removed,no you fucking dumbass even adjusting for population ratios the world has never been safer than it is today it doesnt matter if it doesnt fit the narrative youve crafted that is a fact
canada,removed,then perhaps you could elaborate on the methodology that you would you use to determine if the tech industry in canada is as large as the one in the us on a scale that is reachable by canadians your comments suggest you have some way to provide a meaningful comparison
canada,removed,why dont you fuck off and die
canada,removed,i just see our tech sector as expressed in a proportion to that of americans if you are referring to the earlier conversation i only selected the us for comparison because that was quite literally the only number i could find i dont think the analysis should stop there given readily available data i just couldnt find it it seems you ran into the same problem i did i wonder why we dont have a greater market share there are lots of reason but canadians tend to job obsessed even canadas premier tech school is most notable for its internships that lead to people getting jobs in contrast to stanford which is known for how many startups have come out of it working for someone else doesnt lead to expansion of marketshare
canada,removed,have you seen their revenues and profits here you go the trend is flat at best i would have loved to look back over decades to get a better picture but ive grown very tired of looking at financial statements
canada,removed,ill give him about as much respect as people here gave rob ford how about that
canada,removed,tuition has skyrocketed oh so youre not providing a meaningful comparison then people three decades ago didnt go to post secondary schools this also goes to show that the idea that education leads to higher income is completely false going to a post secondary school on average reduces your income by per year
canada,removed,since purolator is owned by canada post their revenues are included in those figures if that makes any difference to you the distinct drop after is most notable to me i would say the economic downturn is what has hurt them the most and since canada is apparently in even worse shape in according to reddit it will likely go lower still
canada,removed,wow thats a stretch not really the article discusses the impact of education on the lowering of earnings you cited a correlation without any mechanism correlation is not causation sounds very familiar as it relates to this topic
canada,removed,im pretty sure the value of my canadian home adjusted for inflation has gone down over the past years
canada,removed,but these are millennials they are entitled to not be poor
canada,removed,are you just referring to the fact that places like toronto have inflation that is well above the national figure and random sticks of nowhere is below the national figure that doesnt mean the numbers are nonsense it just means you are trying to apply it in the wrong way it also means that you should consider moving to where inflation isnt going to eat you alive
canada,removed,i think that would be a fair assertion
canada,removed,easy now you might give people the impression that prices are determined by the supply relative to the demand
canada,removed,i the other day for a guy who wanted to drive to milton he had to make at least per year to justify working in toronto granted you would be less on the housing costs in tweed but more on the driving costs the question is would you actually be better off also working in tweet even at minimum wage for a lot of people the answer would be a definite yes
canada,removed,well thats a useless response how about answering the question directly instead of dancing around with excuses
canada,removed,but the data does not really support you premise the median income where i live is higher than in vancouver the unemployment rate is the lowest in the country and below the threshold of what is normally considered full employment yet houses are dirt cheap the most expensive home listed for sale a large modern executive home is listed for under good luck even finding a crack shack for that much in vancouver is much more typical for normal people homes
canada,removed,it is an active choice like i mentioned in another post the area where i live has some of the cheapest houses in the country it also has the lowest unemployment rate in the country a median income that is higher than some of canadas major cities and the primary industry has the highest job vacancy rate in the country so you cant even use the job excuse
canada,removed,we had a talk and decided that we would move the age range to next year sorry
canada,removed,hence why the war is won by scarcity since everyone and their brother are highly skilled there is nothing that sets them apart if you had something unique to offer you would be the only one to make the bid
canada,removed,so people have to live where skidooer lives and drop all of their family friends and career wherever they live no do you not understand what choice means this isnt a reasonable solution solution the problem is self correcting the poor economic conditions in the city right now will recover eventually happens every time the cure for high prices is high prices after all and as soon as economic boom hits smaller communities all of this affordability goes out the window for them too happens every time oh i know all the more reason to get in on the ground floor buy low sell high as they say at the same time it will become more economically feasible to live in the city again because small town economic booms happen on big city suffering so its not a practical problem youre telling me the city is where you want to live anyway so youll be quite happy to make the move when the time comes
canada,removed,it doesnt work for anywhere near most people huh why would most people have to move to bumblefuck nowhere you dont have a good grasp of this economics thing do you
canada,removed,if everyone moved to bumblefuck it would be worse off than people in vancouver and toronto are now in reality yes i do have a grasp thank you very much if a small group of people left toronto and vancouver for bumblefuck prices would relax in those cities allowing everyone else to live comfortably again its all about balance
canada,removed,religion is what religious followers do dumbshittery is then your religion
canada,removed,hmmm how about neither go ahead and live in low cost toronto or vancouver housing then i really truly wont stop you and will even congratulate you on your new home but if you are going to complain that it is too expensive without a dictatorship thats completely your problem to solve why do you keep using your city as an example because it is where the opportunity is right now the data says so which i find hard to believe anyway well you dont have to believe the data is all publicly available for you to verify they are actually mutually exclusive why would one kickstart the other because economies function by having people spend money as people have started to leave their high cost toronto and vancouver homes to move to where i am which has low cost homes they are now spending more money in the area as more money is spent in the area more jobs need to be filled and people with businesses make more money and yes you are absolutely right that the costs here will eventually reach toronto levels if the trend continues but since that many people left toronto to come here the homes in toronto wont be as expensive anymore basic supply and demand
canada,removed,i am islamophobic fuck islam white muslims brown asian i dont care its a backwards ass religion so are most others
canada,removed,fuck islam
canada,removed,the alternative is to have some force tell you where you have to go whether you like it or not would it be more comforting if there was a gun to your back
canada,removed,every time i see you post your name makes me wanna punch you in the face
canada,removed,honestly youre a lying bitch now youre suddenly from toronto
canada,removed,i had nothing else to add to the thread and then i saw you just one clean shot to the kagangai
canada,removed,you completely misused the word discriminate in your shitty example you chose the red crayon and you picked it up you in no way discriminated the other colors httpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionarydiscriminate you are beyond ridiculous but thats okay because it just proves to everyone just how batshit crazy people who are against pitbull bans are
canada,removed,are you going to buy service and staff it too sounds about rightits around per hr plus mileage
canada,removed,its akin to banning natives because a few are problematic you are batshit insane if you think those two things are in any way similar your ridiculous reply also suggests you believe dogs have the same problem solving decision making and judgmental abilities as people do its a regressive policy based on genetics so is just about every other bylaw that pertains to wildlife so to clarify are you saying you think it is somehow regressive to not allow people to own lions because that bylaw would be based on genetics
canada,removed,again youre really shitty at conversation so ill spell it out for you im not simply replying to an argument you didnt make i requested clarification of the argument you were making you dumb shit so to clarify are you saying are you saying you think it is somehow regressive to not allow people to own lions because that bylaw is based on genetics notice the fucking question mark at the end of the sentence you complete dolt you still never answered the question
canada,removed,i found this site for you to help counsel you httpswwwdontoffendorg
canada,removed,daily fail
canada,removed,looks like muslims
canada,removed,i im im so sorry you were born with two copies of the recessive stupid gene you poor thing
canada,removed,i was in toronto a month ago and most of the streets i encountered looked you could almost mistake that photo for any small town in ontario compare that with say located a similar distance away from the main city action the difference in how the land is being used is striking so i am afraid i really have no idea what you are talking about here if toronto keeps growing it is inevitable that it will start to look more like the tokyo example and these people are betting on that happening by paying a small relatively speaking cost upfront now to be recaptured and then some when you put a gigantic highrise on that property
canada,removed,why google it and then write a careful response that details how houses in toronto arent nearly as expensive as the media likes to portray when someone on reddit will happily do it for me
canada,removed,here welcome to new jersey this is about km from times square when youre talking about km from yonge and dundas and once you do the price per unit of land area in canadian dollars based on houses for sale in the area the difference isnt all that staggering i think you could say that people in that area a placing similar bets on the properties becoming more densified in the future the manhattanization of the city is well under way are we just simply talking about different things or are you agreeing with me on the premise of the land is being purchased at what is seen as overinflated prices to the typical home buyer because it is hoped to become the next high rise building i mean if you think the manhattanization is happening then it seems that you do in fact agree with me the land on which to build those buildings has to come from somewhere
canada,removed,which isnt true in any major city in the world and by calling it a really big town to be fair you had to dig into a place that isnt even in the same state let alone the same city as nyc to find your low density housing example if you want to talk about any given major city how many kilometres do you have to get from times square to find similar low density housing within nyc unless toronto loses its place as canadas economic powerhouse i dont find it at all unreasonable to think that the entire city area will be highrises in the next say years why do you believe that toronto wont continue to grow upward toronto is not a town in any sense of the word not to detract from the core debate but since you seem to be a lover of pedantry these two formal definitions of town as provided by google definitions fit the bill quite nicely the chief city or town of a region a densely populated area especially as contrasted with the country or suburbs there are many cities bigger and denser than us and who cares we dont need to be you absolutely do need to increase the density if you want to be able to support continual growth of the city the gta is expected to grow by people in the next years where are you going to put them all however its condescending to call toronto a town absolutely thats how we know there is an uncomfortable truth to it if i said manhattan was a town because of the types of buildings there you wouldnt find it condescending at all youd think i was just being ridiculous
canada,removed,ahhhhh now i get why you dont care youre one of those protpp fascists who think free trade will solve everything when it leads to situations like these where you cant even buy from the websites you want because theyre walled off
canada,removed,i guess it was too much to expect other canadians to actually join together against yet another american company thats fucking us in the ass what a bunch of douchebags
canada,removed,fuck off how about that
canada,removed,
canada,removed,that other guy just posts and deflects for hours on these muslim stories he just tries to wear people down so that theyll go away or try to make them say something thats banworthy
canada,removed,im not sure i have written at all since leaving school maybe my signature but thats just a random scribble
canada,removed,nobodys responded because there is no viable counterargument to be made the emails that were gained through access to information tell the entire story in the words of the teachers and administrators you may disagree which is your right however your opinion doesnt really mean much in the face of the evidence the same teachers and admins involved came out to say that they were pissed the rebel had taken their quotes out of context well of course theyd say that because the situation is a shtshow they dont want to lose their jobs hahaha getting a bit sensitive now arent we i get it you thought you had something big enough to hijack the thread how did you feel when you realized it had failed
canada,removed,httpsimgurcomaaazfm
canada,removed,lol you mean the comments at the bottom of the page which are heavily downvoted sorry i interrupted the intellectual superiority circlejerk
canada,removed,syrian migrants to the front of the line though pretty sad for canadians
canada,removed,let me guess your wife is a tech or janitor
canada,removed,then i want an encryption algorithm that produces different results depending on which key is supplied
canada,removed,because its
canada,removed,software development and farming mostly although i occasionally dabble in other industries as well never saw a good reason to have just one job when i can do anything i want i eventually learned sadly later than i wish i had that simply paying attention retains way more information than taking notes if the notes are for the benefit of someone else then its back to the computer because thats how they will want to consume it
canada,removed,lol personal attack hahahaha
canada,removed,lol sure
canada,removed,well we only have the familys side of this and it sounds like his brain herniated so he probably had had the stroke for some time but no lets blame the nurses who waste away their lives caring for this ungrateful parasitic population
canada,removed,go fuck your self hitler
canada,removed,just a few weeks ago cops raided my house after false accusations of a rifle being shot out the window we dont own any guns and in fact this is the home of a cancer patient but hey it was enough for the police sergeant to lie to our faces about smelling gun powder and a corpse inside our house right although they left after their pointless search the sergeant did blatantly refuse to investigate those who accused us of such a serious thing in the first place are there no laws to protect lawabiding citizens from those who abuse police reports its bad enough getting dragged out of the house while taking a shit but it crosses the line to allow complete strangers to touch my computer
canada,removed,youre a stupid motherfucker d
canada,removed,how much smaller are we talking the only number i could find was us tech contributions to the gdp and coincidentally it was also exactly the same number given in the article mind you the figures are not directly comparable as canada was measured as economic output rather than gdp
canada,removed,i just farted sorry
canada,removed,not all of us are chronic bed wetters
canada,removed,yeah but what are the numbers no point in assuming here the gdp of the us drastically higher than canadas hence why we compare as a percentage rather than absolute figures it wouldnt be very meaningful to compare the industries in the absolute sense canada is a much smaller country
canada,removed,im sorry what relevance does this have in where our pm has expressed admiration of a brutal dictatorship trading with chinese suppliers doesnt mean you support their ideology good grief youre fucking stupid
canada,removed,proportionality is all were interested in here percentages are how that is represented percent of the us trillion gdp is a lot more than percent of canadas trillion if for arguments sake the tech industry is responsible for of the gdp in both countries then they are the same size as measured by gdp in absolute terms by your numbers the tech industry would have to grow to more than of of canadas economy to be the same size as the us tech industry that is not a meaningful way to look at it
canada,removed,there is always someone readily available to complain about anything you can think of always
canada,removed,do you have any empirical data to back up that assertion or do you live in the factfree realm like your orange overlord
canada,removed,yes its emboldening hate mongers everywhere
canada,removed,yup the idiots are blowing their load and revealing the ugly truth about trump and his fellow white supremacists
canada,removed,edit fuck the downvoters who downvote because they disagree because youre meta and donald trash
canada,removed,of the people that voted arent racists or bad people yeah its the muslims and mexicans that are the rapists right oh you said racist
canada,removed,aw is baby mad about downvotes youre pathetic
canada,removed,the popular vote simply shows who is more popular by all accounts trump is more popular he got of the votes so far is english your second language or are you a high school drop out that sentence makes no sense and you seem to have a very poor comprehension of basic math the popular vote literally means who is most popular by the singular fact that the person who gets it won by having the higher number of total votes there is not a lot of room to interpret that definition but you seem to somehow and it shows how little you put into reading your own sentences do you need someone to explain to you how or did you miss that day back in math class nbsp as of saturday november clintons total popular vote count came to with trumps total coming to meaning that the former secretary of state had increased her lead to million votes according to nonpartisan cook political report clinton now has percent of the popular vote as compared to trumps nbsp this isnt exactly linear algebra here its just basic arithmetic may i suggest taking a bigger dose of your medication its clearly not working since nothing that you say seems to make any sense and well when you do become prime minister someday it will be important

canada,removed,ya they got an apology it took one day and then they went home and they didnt ask for any real amount of money this is because they already have jobs money and self respect you dont see them drunk on the streets blaming the white man every civilization on earth for the most part has displaced another civilization at some point in history natives arent entitled to rent theyre entitled to get jobs and contribute to society i dont know why we indulge this ridiculous fiction how would you feel about indigenous britains charging their paki immigrants for their existence or race laws in literally any other context for that reason
canada,removed,that kind of attitude right there is why tump won the left is so fucking stupid they still cant understand why they lost

canada,removed,if people just started shooting the speculators and their enablers the mess would be over yes shooting speculators is illegal but only because it doesnt happen that often if it started happening a hundred times a day it would become part of a revolutionary movement and no one would be guilty of anything other than ushering in an era of change
canada,removed,its because wealthy chinese are fucking locusts nothing more they are the epitome of what is wrong with this world
canada,removed,and their employer if it happens all day everyday then a employers will be too scared to hire tfws and b people from elsewhere will be too scared to come here seems like canadians win in that scenario

canada,removed,does anybody else think that if the cost of living wasnt so astronomical there wouldnt be such a dire mental health crisis no i would rather my employer pay me a livable wage so that i could afford my own home than put money towards a psychiatrist ill bet you would i bet a good way to alleviate anxiety and general malaise towards life is giving people the ability to have one why dont you do it yourself instead of expecting some system to do it for you loser
canada,removed,ah the muslims should be put to death and their bodies picketed outside of a local mosque to remind the people the outcome of assaulting people as i know they are less evolved and less human but they can be reminded if the bodies are taken down burn the mosque

canada,removed,this is such a common and uneducated point of view if only you knew ive even mentioned it yesterday i dont see why this should matter from a perspective of a business this is an emotional appeal but the business survives on money not emotions what will you say if they decide to hire all local workers with a higher wage have to increase the price of product cant compete with other companies and in the end close down completely youd just say if a business cant operate while paying good wages for its workers it shouldnt operate like ive heard many times before right just pay ceos less surely we will have no problem retaining talent with our sub par pay raise prices people will surely keep buying meat at twice the price of the competitor and of course my favorite if a business cant function while paying the amount of money i want it shouldnt function surely people will be now making nothing and more people will be out of jobs but hey it doesnt involve me so why do i care

canada,removed,firstly these polls are not only bologna but that shitty bologna with the bits of macaroni inexplicably stuffed into its weird beige loafage the number of subjects is almost always too low to be representative of anything and it is wholly comprised of idiots dumb enough to take the survey in the first place secondly who gives a shit i think pride is a strong word for something so trivial

canada,removed,the neonazis that resort to violence arent representative of the ideas of neonazism neonazism is a proud nonviolent hating ideology and political movement since the careless acts of some fakes and the media reporting them as neonazis hate crime against neonazis has grown in the last year we need more cultural outreach to show that neonazis are peaceful and teach people in society that our views should be tolerated and accepted
canada,removed,stupid story written to offset the terrorism and make canadian sheeple feel good about themselves there is absolutely nothing new or unique about canadians giving directions

canada,removed,this post gave me cancer
canada,removed,get the fuck out of here with that shit no ones fucking condoning these actions
canada,removed,why do you guys censor stuff why not just let the internet be what it is people can still think for themselves

canada,removed,oh look youre an ass that was quick of course if you dont know any left leaning people that are very anti feminist and anti migrant they must not exist what have i got on lock down my support for bringing in refugees when well vetted okay then
canada,removed,politicians talking division not unity unity based on what canadians share no common race religion culture or language there is literally nothing for all of us to unify around his calls for unity are hollow political rhetoric the only thing the people here now have in common is that we live on the upper half or the north american continent thats it arbitrary geographic borders are not a strong enough foundation to build a nation on a donut shop is not a strong enough foundation to build a nation on history has proven that the only foundations strong enough to build an enduring nation upon are race religion culture and language when you dont have all of those in common unity is difficult to achieve when you dont have any of that in common unity is utterly ridiculous to even contemplate
canada,removed,if the victims of the shooting never entered the country they would probably be alive today mixing different groups is a proven failure
canada,removed,it is very sad and their offspring in average per man not mentioning their even more numerous relatives will have to bear a large burden and deal with hatred feelings towards quebec for the rest of their life
canada,removed,look like drug dealers and looks like an isis pedophile
canada,removed,because smiling in a few photos and getting shot automatically make you righteous and worthy of remembrance
canada,removed,most impressed with the brave sacrifice of freedom this patriot gave completely woke thank you quebec for giving us a strong and proud canadian to set the tone by example

canada,removed,banal platitudes are all it takes to get your fucking attention eh jeez no wonder an airhead luke trudeau can gey elected in a country of people like you
canada,removed,the real victims are those of us in the public who have to watch this in the media
canada,removed,im not claiming that this particular mosque was involved in any of that but to say they are benign places of worship is wrong
canada,removed,oh piss off comrade

canada,removed,poor kid hurt feelings take a break from pretending on the internet maybe
canada,removed,man someone got triggered take it easy kid once you find a way out of the basement you will see the light sun light

canada,removed,and whats wrong with nationalism nothing is wrong with it its actually good for uniting the country however antiwhite sjws associate it with white privilege and their racism towards whites is why they hate it if anyone is supporting the degeneration of canadian values its those supporting mass unchecked immigration from places that have abhorrent views on women gays etc yes but since this sub is overrun with sjws theyre going to tell you that islam is a separate cultureideology and that we dont have the right to criticize it also nationalism is not what caused and just more propaganda you hear from the farleft to discourage from pursuing beneficial ideas theyre hell bent on destroying canada and by extension making whites a minority as well as ending the white race all together
canada,removed,its about the narrative not individual columnists

canada,removed,i agree kill all men

canada,removed,its a hoodie ya bunch of prairie hugging shit heads
canada,removed,who was unable to get any government funding at all was running it out of his own pocket and eventually committed suicide he only ran out of funding because canadas biggest feminist organization protested the folks funding him then took his funding
canada,removed,for anyone interested theres a lot of good discussion and info over at rmenslib no there is not rmenslib is an absolutely disgusting subreddit they basically deny there is any institutionalized issue with men and literally blame every single issue men have on toxic masculinity men committing suicide its toxic masculinity blame the men men having their kids taken away by the courts toxic masculinity blame men men being forced to pay for kids that arent theirs toxic masculinity blame men for every single issue men have rmenslib answer is the same that the problem is men themselves rmenslib is what you get when you put a bunch of feminists in charge of controlling the male narrative the entire sub is basically a massive exercise in man blaming the mods on that sub are like cancer they will ban you simply for disagreeing that toxic masculinity is the cause of all human problems the entire community is toxic and disgusting no self respecting person who values their own mind would interact with such a disingenuous and intellectually dishonest community rmenslib is the lowest of the low do not go there
canada,removed,a chain of commentators that seems to lead away from a disturbing statistic toward fringe theories this is a common tactic of rmenslib when any discussion occurs where men cant immediately be painted as the perps and the cause of their own strife rmenslib tries to flood the conversation with irrelevant facts and basically derail the issue away from what is actually being discussed you can see this on the menslib posts the conversation immediately moved away from the topic men suicide and turned into a topic where women have it worse and need more funding the entire point of the article was missed they didnt even bother discussing it
canada,removed,which is the pseudoscience we know as psychology equating belief to reality is what makes you dumb if you cannot back up your spurious claims with some real hard fact you better shut up and about the article it is not targeting if it is targeting anything psychology per se it is showing a big problem science has these days which is that science do not do much replication studies and that scientists who do replication studies do not get much recognition it just happen that it shows up more in psychology studies but it exist in every aspect of science so just coming here and saying psychology is not science just shows the level of your ignorance and that you dont once stop and start to think at how you may be wrong doesnt bode well for your mental capacity at questioning your beliefs which are totally wrong in this case
canada,removed,already bought property up there so you can go fuck yourself canuck
canada,removed,good as long as you know you are actively contributing to the male suicide rate by supporting organizations that actively prevent men getting assistance and institutioanlize laws that prevent men getting help then sure go ahead and support whomever you wish xd after all there were tons of folks just like you xd that supported the nazis when they instituted ethnic cleansing so im not surprised there are more canadians who support a feminist supremacy agenda i love how flippant feminists like you are its that you know you are actively working to harm men you know everyone else is aware of it too but you still do it so openly as if to show off how cool you are for shtting on me just looking at your posting history and how chock full of double standards it is is enough evidence as to your type of character so yea if nazi supporters could sleep at night im sure you must be able to as well but yea you arent fooling anyone here though lol i like how feminists today think that by publicly supporting male suicide they are somehow being so cool by sticking it to the patriarchy the simple fact that you dont see anything wrong with an organization that supports male suicide tells us everything that there is to know about the type of person you are
canada,removed,average cost in us better dickhead
canada,removed,sorry enjoy your crack
canada,removed,actually both of those assertions are wrong most sexual abuse is not by a recognized caregiver and men are far more likely to perpetuate sexual abuse on children vs women vs that article was proved to be false nice try though trying to use publicly discredited studies in order to push a male hating agenda here are the stats form a nonbiased study in a large representative study that examined the characteristics of perpetrators in substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect in the united states neglect was the main type of abuse in of cases involving a female caregiver compared to of cases involving a male caregiver us dhhs so yea nice try there little feminist i do think its disgusting that even topics such as child abuse are open season for feminist lies you do realize by making child abuse all about how men are evil you are basically preventing the child abuse problem to ever be solved you do realize you are giving women an open license to abuse any child they want since men will just be blamed anyway so yea nice try but its still disgusting if i were you i probably wouldnt be able to look at myself in the mirror knowing that i am openly contributing to child abuse
canada,removed,i really wish we could deal with mens issues without having to engage with feminists i find it fascinating that people feel that you literally cannot talk about mens issues since it pisses feminists off i mean society is literally taking a stance that since talking about mens issues hurt feminist feefees that we should just let men die in droves unbelievable
canada,removed,whats justin going to do when he cant use harper as a scapegoat anymore he has to learn that immigration isnt the answer to everything we already had immigration program before he became pm
canada,removed,males are weak
canada,removed,thats the most objectionable set of words ive read in years
canada,removed,when janice flamingo or someone like her or the mra campus groups come in and say it is because of women our oppression is because of womens gains they dont they claim its feminists feminists are not women
canada,removed,feminists also arent the problem fighting for paid maternity leave and currently fighting for extended parental leave what a horrible thing for fathers and husbands to get oh you mean how many want to force it on men beyond that though this is hardly even a scratch on the surface what feminists want and youre disingenuous we just had a case that had powerful feminist lobbies calling for separate rape courts beyond this feminists are responsible for laws discriminating against men in family court in school and in governmental jobs via equal oppourtunity in a world where they make up the majority of government jobs fighting for equal wages how dare mothers be equal wage earners in the family women have equal wages they want more money for less work
canada,removed,ive been to rmensrights and dear god its basically bash feminism and never actually discuss mens rights all the time there what utter nonsense link even a single post from rmensrights that isnt discussing mensrights the mods of rmensrights actually will instadelete topics that have nothing to do with mens rights lie more you sick fucking feminist the simple fact that feminists cannot have a single converstion without lying puts your intellectual dishonesty for all to see feminists are like the human form of hrc politics hrc is openly corrupt and no one says a thing feminists openly lie and expect no one to say a thing disgusting
canada,removed,thought it was a dog relieved
canada,removed,that is not what happened that is what happened i lol that you try to blame harper when it was the feminists who threatened harper and forced his hand the single largest feminist organization protested against this shelter there is even a fucking video of it posted in this thread that you just ignored its disgusting how feminists will never take responsibility feminists are openly lobbying to prevent any male issue being addressed and then they go and blame their own behavior on men fucking disgusting you should be ashamed for propagating lies men are fucking dying by the millions and your only response is oh its ok coz men are stupid what fucking trash
canada,removed,lol
canada,removed,who says that every single feminist they protest cafe not mens issues i just attended a feminist workgroup on a campus on male victims of domestic you are so full of horseshte that its physically sickening reading your lies httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcvbytdmxlpm and there is thousands more there is fucking video evidence of feminists protesting men simply talking about their issues but because your disgusting fucking narrative doesnt allow it you literally ignore all the video evidence video fucking evidence you sick fuck you should read more this was written by evil feminists that is probably the most disgusting thing ive ever read why the fuck does a feminist have the right to define masculinity feminists go around screaming about how no one but themselves should define a woman then why do they fucking feel they have the right to define what it means to be a man lol destroyed by their own faulty logic here is something that a real feminist wrote men should be institutionalized and sterilized men only exist to serve women and it will be a better world when we make the government enforce this outlook for too long has every man raped and pillaged every woman and so now we have to fight back against the patriarchy and the only way we can do that and ensure it is if we take away all rights of every single man and replace them with mandates that we get to decide on men should not be allowed to breath without a womans consent and men should exist to serve women that is the face of feminism your constant lies will not change truth
canada,removed,as mentioned the feminist lobby is the single most powerful lobby in canada people voted him in just the same way all corrupt politicians get voted in using lies and deception thankfully for them lies and deception are specialities of feminists there is no other group alive who is as good at lying or deceiving as feminists the biggest lie told today is that men are in power men are not in power not in the west at least feminists are in power would men be dying in droves if men were in power would boys be being left behind in school if men were in power no basic fucking logic lets us see feminist lies but pple still ignore them thats how he got voted in
canada,removed,searching mens alternative safe house protest turned up zero results of a feminist group your lack of intellect and inability to use a search engine is not proof of the lack of existence of evidence the real world isnt limited by your limited understanding or your stupidity like other people in this thread have provided links like the neolib feminazi you are you summarily ignore any evidence provided that goes against your narrative right here you literally just ignored the evidence provided to you pretended it doesnt exist and then have the balls to ask source you are a regular run of the mill feminist troll this is the standardized interaction with these types of trolls person men are dying in droves due to receiving no assistence feminist this was you in this conversation no they are not women need more help men only die because they are stupid person um here are some statistics from the department of government proving that men are dying in droves feminist no there are no statistics i refuse your evidence since women are dying more person um can you provide some evidence feminist no you havent provided any evidence for what you said person um i just linked the evidence earlier did you not see it feminst no you didnt you never provided anything at this point you see the idea feminist will just outright ignore evidence even when its provided provide no evidence of their own and then call the person a misogynist when they do not agree with the flawed feminist conclusions so yea feminist troll begone
canada,removed,i agree all types of abuse are detestable um you agree all types of abuse are detestable but then believe that the types of abuse that women do are not to be accounted for um that just means you actually think that there are some types of abuse the ones women carry out that are not detestable its not a case of apples and oranges its child abuse plain and simple you cannot fucking arbitrarily say oh when women abuse children thats apples but when men abuse thats oranges and so we only want to count the number of oranges you are literally manipulating statistics to an agenda right there you are literally excusing womens abuse simply because it doesnt meet your narrative you expect people to be ok with you so blatantly saying that women abusing kids is ok and that comparing womens abuse to mens abuse is like comparing apples to oranges god that viewpoint is just totally disgusting so when women abuse kids its ok because apples but when men do it its because men are sickos and pedos and should be castrated because oranges jesus h christ the mental gymnastics feminists go through to justify female behavior is beyond words
canada,removed,im sure the woman who was assaulted would prefer they put him in jail rather than have him die do you even know what he did you dont i have not minimized anyone but you are minimizing abdis unnecessary death so a woman can feel fleeting justice you a sick twisted individual but at least you recognize you need to double down on libel and have stopped arguing that petulant fact let me guess you just got your first pair of big boy pants and dont have a nuanced view of the legal system or crime and policework in general
canada,removed,you should provide a source for the claim i have provided the source for the claim at least separate times now heck even others have posted a link to videos showing it you just have to check my post history for the video links the point being that even after sources were provide the feminists literally just ignored them they didnt refute them they didnt rebuke them they just ignored them and then went source please as if none was provided so no asking me for more sources after ive already provided them is just you trolling nothing more but please continue to keep feeling empowered because obviously the fucking source in the linked article showing you the studies that men are dying in droves and that men are the primary victims of suicides is somehow wrong simply because it goes against feminist narratives right facepalm the claim in this thread was that the reason men do not get support for any of their problems is that feminists deny the problem even exists and then prevent people talking about it that is literally what you and the other feminists in this thread have done exactly you have taken a thread about male suicide and made it about misogynists arent providing proof so it means it didnt happen how do you sleep at night knowing that your own goverment is telling you that there is an epidemic of male suicide and your response is source pleaze coz we dont believe it absolutely disgusting i am constantly amazed at the complete and utter lack of empathy feminists have for men i mean these men are dying in droves the fucking statistics in the damn article are telling you that but nope feminists wont believe it because reasons i mean really you are the proof of my point the simple fact that you took a thread about male suicide and tried to pass it off as all lies just goes to show how actively feminists attempt to suppress mens issues you dont even need to go far to get your proof just look at this thread as its bridgaded by feminsts
canada,removed,unfortunately it has already gone too far that nothing short of revolution or total collapse can alter the direction of the ship this is especially true today with feminist trudeau since one of the main focuses of his administration is to strip men of even more rights but then again the exact same thing happened at the end of the roman empire as well as the assyrian kingdoms the greek states and pretty much every single other major civilization in time has seen the exact same series of events right before the civilization collapsed in rome just before the fall men were forced to pay alimony to women for kids who werent theirs men were seen as rapists and poopood in all public works and media basically the old roman plays all started portraying men as bufoons incapable of tying their own laces kinda exactly like how men are portrayed in media today male suicide rate as well as malefemale suicide rations was almost as bad as today todays are worse widespread financial instability and the list goes on in short all major civilizations in the past fell precisely due to what we see happening now women took power and basically spent their time in power shafting as many men as brutally as they could this eventually lead to the economic collapse of the society which eventually lead to the breakdown of society and brought about the dark ages this is all history one that people ignore since its convinient so yea all this has happened before and it will happen again we are merely witnesses to the fall of canadian society i mean ffs there is a reason anyone with a brain goes elsewhere the canadian brain drain is real but yea there is no way back basically just have to hold on and pray that the feminists spare you after they are done ravaging the male population
canada,removed,maybe you should have unironically got a cat like everyone else you fucking hipster
canada,removed,mass cencorship and control of the media for example did you know my posts in rcanada were deleted without reason simply because i agreed that there is an epidemic of suicide for men in canada mods are actually going around and deleting posts that dont fit their narrative this is how it gets this bad the folks in power want to maintain power and so they do whatever they can even if it means squelching others or as is in the case of this story preventing men who need help getting it
canada,removed,the effects of restrictive and harmful gender roles for men and freeing ourselves from them the simple fact that you think men are killing themselves because of gender roles and not because there are no shelters for them to get help even if they want it just goes to show how disgusting rmenslib is you literally are blaming men for not seeking help when there is nowhere for them to go to get it do you not see how disgusting that is
canada,removed,back for more i see im done wasting my time here liar
canada,removed,this sounds like taxation in canada
canada,removed,
canada,removed,if you had been paying attention you would have noticed that all comments in violations of the rules reported or not have been painstakingly removed um deleting every single one of my posts on rcanada is hardly painstakingly removing something its nuking it from orbit sounds like a rage action to me shrugs a nerdrage of a triggered feminist if you ask me if the moderating team have missed any comments you believe to be actionable by all means report those comments and action will be taken where warranted there were comments making gendered and sexualized slurs directed directly at me calling me a schoolyard shooter and others making fun of my manhood i reported every single one of them absolutely nothing happened actually wait thats not true something did happen all my posts got deleted and the posts doing nothing more than making personal attacks on me are the only ones who remain so yea pretend like you are all innocent but you are judged by your actions not your words son this community has standards and rules either abide by them and be a welcomed seems you like to think your standards and rules are some form of civilized shindig but they simply amount to we mods are right you are wrong obey us and if we say men are idiots for killing themselves they are i mean you just went all trigger happy simply at someone proposing the idea that perhaps blaming men for their own suicide is not a good idea dont see how that makes it into a set of standards that are meant to be allow people the opportunity to openly discuss anything seems like open discussion only applies to topics you deem part of your narrative everything else will get people shown the door so yea again not fooling anyone but you know what ill just show myself the door since you have done such a good job of making your community inviting and inclusive lol jk you are nothing more than the vast number of racist sexist misandrist canadians i know since i arrived in your sick nation thank god i can leave soon i just find it hilarious that canadians online are just as racist and misandrist as their irl counterparts laters canadians enjoy your mass male suicide given everything ive seen about your culture heck you guys deserve what you get
canada,removed,ndp needs to be dissolved its a bunch of disparate radical school teachers racists sexists and feminists who pretend they have moral high ground when in fact they are the utter dregs of society fuck the ndp and if you support them fuck you too mind you i say the same for all parties fuck you canada get a clue already
canada,removed,actually you do not need a name to libel someone but if someone anyone doxxes me you could be sued for libel how do i know ask me how i know
canada,removed,yeah thank god adults can once again buttfuck year olds in canada without getting in legal trouble for it trudeau to the rescue
canada,removed,i hope they do see this and that you find a lawyer stupid enough to take this case so that i can see your face when the judge laughs you out of court and orders you to pay my legal fees in the meantime dear ucompscikinder ill leave you to your favourite pastime of rape and molestation have fun
canada,removed,well its obvious you have tell us the story of how you got out of those pedophilia charges ucompscikinder
canada,removed,muh safe space how will i ever recover
canada,removed,dont be stupid please
canada,removed,awww butthurt
canada,removed,durka durka durka lol
canada,removed,some one needs to be killed
canada,removed,awe shit we forgot to ask both indians who will be affected if its alright if canada progresses as an energy leader so that we can give those same indians a disproportionate amount of money because hundreds of years ago some people i never met took some land from some people that they never met
canada,removed,lol pulling facts out of your ass
canada,removed,you guys please go back to your inbred cave and dont come out
canada,removed,good on you for not respecting a book written by some warmongerer in the middleeast religion craves respect it doesnt deserve you have the right to believe this bullshittadaa i called an idea bullshit go cry muslims but the idea doesnt have any rights i do however disagree with the canadian flag being everything good with canada
canada,removed,what exactly os a muslim name this incident occurred a week after the orlando massacre and the left seized on it as an example of a backlash
canada,removed,i am muslim your honor i rest my case
canada,removed,fuck off zoolander
canada,removed,america number one biiiiitchhesss
canada,removed,yeah but youre the only person who feels that way because youre more sensitive than a twoyearold girl seriously go fuck yourself
canada,removed,well it is current year
canada,removed,ohoh someones not happy with their sex change
canada,removed,is internet doctor code for a thin skinned loser who has an inferiority complex but overcompensates by belittling everyone else while also being a poster child for riamverysmart
canada,removed,dude lots of people have high comment karma looks like you are completely comfortable being an open racist on your account so its odd that you give a crap about how someone else uses their time ymmv
canada,removed,but those people are better people than the other million or so canadians thats why we cant put them in jail when they rape someone
canada,removed,canadian law holds that natives are a master race over all other canadians they get all the benefits of being canadian plus the benefits of being native and thus entitled to tens of thousands of dollars in tax benefits each year simply for existing its also why theyre allowed to rape without going to jail
canada,removed,they were primitive cultures years behind european development when discovered they still are
canada,removed,my peoples culture was of at least comparable value to that of the europeans who came we met as equals lol wut your culture and people have produced nothing of value if every algonquin in history magically disappeared the history of the world would be completely unchanged
canada,removed,sorry let me connect to my algonquin search engine to find some algonquin primary material to validate how advanced their culture was and how it developed the algonquin math science and technology we use in our day to day lives oh wait theres nothing there at least you guys still have rampant alcoholism
canada,removed,you can seize my means of production unzips
canada,removed,unless your working toward a career in green energy your stupid how dare anyone want to do anything else
canada,removed,i agree you have too little intellect to waste
canada,removed,the reason why black people are allowed to be racist and violent while white people are not is because black people are not held to the standards of persons lololol white male teen spotted
canada,removed,go back to the pond frog
canada,removed,thats not what i said is it i said you sound like a white male teen you carry white male teen opinions theyre low value and based on your feels
canada,removed,stay buthurt frenchie anericans are also anglos
canada,removed,death to wynne
canada,removed,they are delaying because the americans are delaying you moronic twit
canada,removed,there is no wage gap its a feminist lie
canada,removed,because fuck you thats why when men become a voting bloc then well get shit for now just hope for the rhetoric that it will cause less transmissions to women and thats why itll be done
canada,removed,the wage gap is the feminist version of flat earth theory no matter how much evidence you provide that shows its false theyll never believe any of it
canada,removed,i dont like this attitude drug addicts are in pain theyre just focusing on getting by they dont have the mental energy to think about where they are putting needles we need to just be tolerant maybe we can open some more safe injection sites and things will start to improve
canada,removed,im uncomfortable learning new words those hungry freaks with funny coloured hair look too weird
canada,removed,why dont you all look at the reason this bloody budget for this program exists try looking at the sell off cancellation of gas plants billions cancellation of a wind farm millions come on people wake up youre the victims of reading the numbers and not seeing why the numbers are even needed thibeault is a hack who left the ndp and knows about as much about energy as bart simpson
canada,removed,lmao germany you are going to use germany as an example of a better democracy than canada the country that elected hitler are you that dumb
canada,removed,whos going to be next to read the fake news
canada,removed,they all mention toronto housing crisis thats why there are homeless people and social housing is needed you are too stupid to talk to level up your iq at least points and then well talk
canada,removed,edgy is having rcmp officers fake terror and have it headline news for weeks so your guy can get elected and they can increase their budget and tyranny
canada,removed,nobody does journalism the news has had no credibility for decades now if they need credibility they have to say it was a leak
canada,removed,im a dan matheson fan mansbridge is a talking head
canada,removed,during the last election campaign the couple in bc that were supposedly going to blow up the legislature news that convictions were thrown out came n a friday of a long weekend when nobody would notice not surprised you missed it the rcmp was caught fomenting fake terror plots of them involved in this one some protection racket
canada,removed,you think the bibeau incident wasnt also fake terror they orchestrated it they lied about it jts crew voted for they know what they are doing the people responsible rcmp officers involved will probably get a raise
canada,removed,peter mansbridge can go fuck himself under a big pile of money
canada,removed,a true canadian con not like evan solomon who was fired for lying about the bibeau fake terror incident mansbridge also reported the fake news and the fake terror plots he will not be excused
canada,removed,fake news was supposed to be illegal
canada,removed,that was some good fake news there
canada,removed,any actor can fill his shoes and lie to us
canada,removed,they have a roster of nazis in waiting
canada,removed,some bullshit cover story evan could go to jail for what he did if our police cared about justice and not only their own jobs
canada,removed,the distinguished gentleman former news anchor is hereby invited to fornicate alone with himself under his hoard of ill gotten gain
canada,removed,watching bulidings being obviously demolished he goes with the official conspiracy theory the official theory of hijackers is complete bunk so was the invasion of afghanistan to restore the opium production and the almost invasion of iraq harper would have loved to have killed more of our boys there too
canada,removed,get the fuck out of my country with your violent repressive shitty religion
canada,removed,uh youre a fucking idiot jump off a bridge if you think what happened here was reasonable or proportional you honestly should shut the fuck up and never speak agian
canada,removed,it sounds like youre itching to shoot somebody i dont think you should have a gun
canada,removed,im getting pretty tired of hearing blowhards like you complain about islam
canada,removed,god youre patheticlol
canada,removed,firstly starting any article with its is stupid secondly the article cherry picks facts that dont really help the article at all but rather just shows the authors ignorance take for example the fact that the bulk of canadian elementary and secondary schools begin their day between and am this despite ample studies that show many kids – and most teenagers – are at their cognitive worst early in the morning well duh do you know why this is the case logistics bus companies cannot have every bus on the road for every school at the same time for a later start nor would the school board be willing to pay for such an impossible expense not only that early runs are required in order to beat the traffic in areas like the gta and keep bus runs as short as possible
canada,removed,httpwwwcbsaasfcgccatravelvoyageatllatenghtml google fuckhead
canada,removed,why is there a syrian dick left unsucked by trudeau
canada,removed,twat
canada,removed,alright since you apparently have the memory of a goldfish heres what i originally had to say on the matter you responded to this point initially maybe youre just not taking it all that seriously because its music but the concept of a curriculum that every kid learns is important to build a society where people have basic competency in a range of skills that will be useful to them as people as well as in whatever job they might get
canada,removed,bla bla bla not interested open a thread and puke your bs there
canada,removed,you clearly didnt click the link because the enlightenment isnt just a were the best thing but a specific period of time where important changes about how the culture viewed the world government religion people and all sorts of other things occurred and you forget the protestant revival which has rejected much of what the enlightenment taught us that also happens to be the branch of christianity that is prevalent in the west the one where they believe in the literal word of the bible young earth creationists we have a museum dedicated to it in alberta and the like we christians have done our own fair share of devolving ourselves but theyve since regressed into mostly barbaric backwaters that have no separation of church and state few personal freedoms and next to no religious freedoms once again you lump all muslims together you can say exactly the same thing about christians if you lump us all together then we have to answer for uganda for russia and all those other repressive countries that happen to be christian okay so theres an exception it remains the exception rather than the rule there are many exceptions you now have to own any country that has a christian majority that doesnt respect the rights of its people yugoslavia russia mugabe in zimbabwe the death and destruction in the congo by the criteria you are judging muslims we are all guilty of the same thing im not a christian but you dont ask christians the same questions or judge them by the same criteria explain your hypocrisy you arent making an observation you are judging two groups of people differently based on their religion and nothing else that is being a bigot not an observer
canada,removed,oh shut the fuck up my parents were poor when i was a kid and my summers were great maybe summer sucks for kids with poor and uncreative parents but its not the job of the government to compensate for that
canada,removed,you know how you can tell when someone is unbiased both sides say he shills for the other side
canada,removed,im not youre just too stupid to realize it
canada,removed,im assuming youre being sarcastic and not just monumentally retarded
canada,removed,only his daughters after a corrective holy raping
canada,removed,im jewish fuck off
canada,removed,its also taught very poorly in many schools this is true i still remember all the french i was taught in school but i cant speak it at all because of what we were taught from grades was just memorization of verb conjugations but at least my grammar will be correct
canada,removed,wow only a year for stat rape if it was a guy hed be getting drawn and quartered by now
canada,removed,you really dont get the joke with hotels and the bibles so much thickness
canada,removed,see you are confused and talk nonsense because your analytical capabilities are shit your comment is written in so well it actually proves something else than what you really wanted to convey the issue is not a book at issue is actually a person or persons who try to lead their lives as closely to the rule of the book as possible but think for a second if that were true youd have those same people committing criminal acts on a daily basis but there aint any yet it takes a good ol canadian convert boy with obvious mental issues to act out how do you explain that
canada,removed,lol did i hurt your fee fees
canada,removed,were they nudes cuz if they were nudes it would totally be worth it
canada,removed,an extremist muslim wants to kill you a moderate muslim wants for the extremist muslim to kill you islam is inherently incompatible with western civilization
canada,removed,im in winnipeg where of the population is native it would be wrong to say that none of those native people make a positive contribution natives that get an education a hair cut and get with the program do well but those are the rare ones the rest are entirely dependent on welfare or criminal activity if there were no natives at all in canada we would need only one federal prison i was on the bus one day and a native lady was telling another that a family with whom her own family is involved in a blood feud had just moved into her winnipeg neighbourhood worse they joined a rival gang which outnumbered the gang of her own kids so the family was going to have to move natives here are largely confined to a few areas in the city where natives and whites seldom interact as a consequence most of the violence is between natives so whites just dont care any more there is a district in the downtown around central park that has become our african community it was an area that became known for extreme violence and families in the area were in constant danger then they figured out that the problem was with the natives once the africans ran off the indians problem solved i could go on but i think you get the picture natives have developed their own culture of dependence and criminality those natives that dont share in the culture are spurned by the majority there are an awful lot of simplistic ideas about the state of native affairs in canada we were told some time ago that there were two solitudes in canada english and french in fact there are at least three more including inuit reserve indians and urban indians there is not one single approach that will turn things around for all of them
canada,removed,holy fuck the burka is a mental illness both for the men who enforce it and the women who embrace it
canada,removed,burkinis are bad but we should tolerate them anyway because muh freedom to opress women what a load of horseshit
canada,removed,are you serious with this comment and actually in need of explanation or are you just trying to stir up an argument by saying stupid shit that you know is stupid
canada,removed,of course you do youre a scab
canada,removed,lol the truth always comes out a significant portion of this new crop of liberals are actually a hardcore antidemocracy crew borderline extremists
canada,removed,as if those things are remotely comparable more muslims are antigay than conservatives in fact almost half of the uss republican party wants to legalize gay marriage ask any muslim on the street in iraq or iran what he thinks of gays or even ask someone from indonesia a supposedly moderate country it wont be pleasant
canada,removed,ill give you a few hints cell service in cities is on a whole other scale in terms of complexity and cost and rural service is garbage also that most canadians live within of the border figure is still missing the important qualifier that they mostly live within of the ontario or bc border with the us saskatchewan is one of the least dense provinces and they have some of the cheapest plans its not about density
canada,removed,cant wait to see sophie trudeau with a black bag on her head
canada,removed,lol the butthurt is strong in this one
canada,removed,my you do have a bird brain
canada,removed,your mom answered my question and she said yes moar
canada,removed,smarter men than you have thought longer on this subject than you ever will we should therefore claim in the name of tolerance the right not to tolerate the intolerant karl popper httpsenwikipediaorgwikiparadoxoftolerance
canada,removed,mmm i can taste your salty tears mmmm tastes like ignorance whos canadas head of state again fake points to whoever answers this correctly
canada,removed,that a real interesting idea but as i have said yeah i stopped reading after this your bullshit rationalization and feefees dont stand up to the logic of someone who is generally regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of science of the century he answered this question your bullshit attempt to rebut karl popper isnt going to fly but feel free to reply with more feefees though
canada,removed,its about respect im not allowed to wear a hat they shouldnt be allowed to wear a trash bag
canada,removed,do you really think that you contribute to the discussion in any meaningful way id like for once – just fucking once – for people like you to stop for a second read what you intend to write in your head and realize im such a whiny bitch for making shitty comments like this and close the edit window
canada,removed,as in posing an example for comparison ffs how stupid are you do you even read anything at all ever
canada,removed,this does not meet legal test for slander since one cannot lie about the future said like someone who will probably fuck their under age sister
canada,removed,do you take your white hood off before or after you start plowing your sister
canada,removed,fuck teachers who are just awaking from their month naps to enter into their brutal slog to earn as they count down to retirement at the ripen old age of how dare the people we pay to educate our children be paid well and treated with respect how dare they meanwhile our education outcomes are far worse than most other oecd countries that pay teachers far less you are delusional they could easily be replaced by capable people willing to do their jobs for far less and work far more of course we can pay people less and expect better performance of course thats rational i was going to go on but youre just a sad pathetic delusional person thank you for reminding rational people that people like you vote you are the posterchild for irrational trump supporting brexit voting morons keep voting citizens
canada,removed,actually use your fucking ears and watch the video again its all being paid into child support you dumb fuck
canada,removed,congrats on being an ignorant piece of shit
canada,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
canada,removed,i hope you have to deal with the blunt end of the child support system some day then you will see why you are so fucking deluded
canada,removed,who would you punish for wearing the burka initially nobody take the burka point out its illegal give her alternative clothes baggy tshirt jeans send her on her way for repeat offenders escalating fines logistically the easiest path would be the punish the woman but what would that accomplish bleed the family to punish the behaviour same as someone serially speeding its no different than how society would punish me for running around nude all the time in canada no adult woman can be legally compelled to live or associate with an oppressive family member try growing up in an oppressive religious cult i did leaving that involves often losing all family all friends all business associates moving to get away from threats and abuse and severe depression nearly to the point of suicide im alive because its hard to kill yourself while not screwing up ones organs the fact that the law protected me didnt mean anything in any practical terms hence so many of the gay suicides fortunately here we have a practical way to discourage a type of behaviour banning it legally it gives each and every woman a defence against any wouldbe abuser i cant because its the law its the same exact thing we do for child marriages families again often muslim will pressure girls into marriage and sex so we criminalize child marriages refuse to enforce marriages contracted into out of state and refuse to permit children to legally consent meaning that sexual intercourse with them is by definition rape if we ban the burka we dont help the wearers see themselves as oppressed no we shun the behaviour and help the wearers who do see themselves as oppressed get away from their oppressors i cant its the law is a very powerful defence and one of the reasons that the government banned plural marriages is because mormons were forcing girls into plural marriages banning the practice protected the women from being forced into it and causes problems for people like me who would voluntarily be in a plural marriage just like with the burka society banned something that isnt necessarily abusive because in practical terms it was abusive more often than not if the burkini is banned how is an oppressed woman who would only go to the beach in a burkini likely to respond im advocating for banning both you may be right about the beach but its much harder for the men to force the women to stay home all the time than to keep them away from the beach thats the reason why you cannot fight oppression with oppression you dont you fight oppression with stigma and the strongest stigma is the law we protect the right of people not to be slaves by banning slavery even though there are people who genuinely would wish to be slaves in the bdsm community you dont fight oppression by giving into it
canada,removed,i heard through the grapevine that rcanada will be the the unofficial but eventually official government of canada ie liberal party sub will articles like this be allowed once that happens
canada,removed,for that price i hope the photographer got his gay sidei mean good side

canada,removed,dirty frenchies always trying to spread their propaganda s
canada,removed,well white is a race and islam is an ideology so i think it would be more difficult to ascribe beliefs and values to a race do you think you could do the same thing to asian people
canada,removed,if you actually believe that if you really believe donald trump has no flaws and that its all lies then you are too stupid to understand the insults you deserve after your comment

canada,removed,just read this imagine that youre sitting down to dinner with your family and while everyone else gets a serving of the meal you dont get any so you say i should get my fair share and as a direct response to this your dad corrects you saying everyone should get their fair share now thats a wonderful sentiment indeed everyone should and that was kinda your point in the first place that you should be a part of everyone and you should get your fair share also however dads smartass comment just dismissed you and didnt solve the problem that you still havent gotten any the problem is that the statement i should get my fair share had an implicit too at the end i should get my fair share too just like everyone else but your dads response treated your statement as though you meant only i should get my fair share which clearly was not your intention as a result his statement that everyone should get their fair share while true only served to ignore the problem you were trying to point out thats the situation of the black lives matter movement culture laws the arts religion and everyone else repeatedly suggest that all lives should matter clearly that message already abounds in our society the problem is that in practice the world doesnt work the way you see the film nightcrawler you know the part where renee russo tells jake gyllenhal that she doesnt want footage of a black or latino person dying she wants news stories about affluent white people being killed thats not made up out of whole cloth there is a news bias toward stories that the majority of the audience who are white can identify with so when a young black man gets killed prior to the recent police shootings its generally not considered news while a middleaged white woman being killed is treated as news and to a large degree that is accurate young black men are killed in significantly disproportionate numbers which is why we dont treat it as anything new but the result is that societally we dont pay as much attention to certain peoples deaths as we do to others so currently we dont treat all lives as though they matter equally just like asking dad for your fair share the phrase black lives matter also has an implicit too at the end its saying that black lives should also matter but responding to this by saying all lives matter is willfully going back to ignoring the problem its a way of dismissing the statement by falsely suggesting that it means only black lives matter when that is obviously not the case and so saying all lives matter as a direct response to black lives matter is essentially saying that we should just go back to ignoring the problem tldr the phrase black lives matter carries an implicit too at the end its saying that black lives should also matter saying all lives matter is dismissing the very problems that the phrase is trying to draw attention to

canada,removed,so people use sign language across the country and blm is making demands to have black sign language interpreters at a pride parade which would have what of em how many deaf people do you think also showed up to the pride parade and now how many of those deaf people at pride parade were black why does this fucking matter its just being angry to be angry
canada,removed,a warning is not enough to absolve you of responsibility for handing out a dangerous product negligence is negligence ffs we have this principle in canadian law called voluntary assumption of risk its the reason you cant sue the nhl because you get hit with a puck in the stands they put an adequate warning and the person willingly bought the product tea can burn at lower temperatures too you know a burn can develop in less than a second at a measly °c so get your stasi temperature nonsense out of here

canada,removed,the sky is blue what is a concern is that publicly funded bc schools are hiring lgbt teachers we might need to make that illegal or at least them talking about it or expressing it in front of students note the narrowminded moderators so entrenched in their echochamber world are so totally ignorant that im expressing a very common canadian opinion will only be able to conclude this must be rabblerousing and so delete the opinion which will further insulate the echochamber

canada,removed,i meant keeping gay teachers from mentioning their sos gender so its not normalized or mistaken by children as some accepted lifestyle and so they dont know about sexual perversions at too young of an age
canada,removed,tolerance doesnt mean facing zero consequences for spewing hateful shit under all circumstances as much as people like you and peterson try to pretend what a shock the real working world is going to be for you
canada,removed,children are born with their sexual orientation yes males are born to be orientated to females and viceversa there is absolutely zero reason to believe weve just discovered homosexuals are in fact a different kind of human as a gender or a race as a secret perversion kills children by driving them to suicide nope it definitely does not but what we do know and know very very well is that homosexuals if they stay at it long enough will have shockingly high suicide rates even higher if we counted as many drug overdose deaths as suicides shocking high which is one of the main reasons we dont want our kids to get into homosexuality that suicide rates remains skyhigh where being gay isnt just accepted but is celebrated it doesnt matter how common your opinion is yes it does when the very question and discussion is about whether or not i hold a common opinion many canadians would agree with me it is still delusional and dangerous and unacceptable in civil society homosexuals will have some of the single highest rates of suicide murder gays murdering gays domestic abuse and in particular the severity of domestic abuse highly disproportionate levels of drug abuse alcoholism weirdly almost levels of tobacco use then terribly disproportionate rates of disease and institutional mental illness i forget high levels of rape and sexual assault doing it or being a victim of it that is what is uncivil and almost by very definition and in a comprehensive list

canada,removed,the damage is done either way so many people are divided and quick to fight instead of discuss even in this sub i was banned and called a misogynist repeatedly by a mod only got overturned because of another mod stepping in who kept commenting after i was banned and its obvious whats going on he even quoted me from another sub just to keep instigating the mod was linking feminist type articles in a debate about singleparenting and welfare moms and i was relaying my own personal experience with how biased the entire system is in favor of women regardless of how badly they treat their children so basically the mod was upset that we didnt agree and proceeded to silence me because he had the power to you better believe theres a split on people who are okay and who are not okay with people doing this stuff in every realm of communication the reason its such a big problem is that so many people are totally fine with it because its not them being snuffed out and silenced and its not their opinions being warped and misconstrued to look so so much worse than it is even earlier on a thread about some old dude losing his mountains of cash someone couldnt help but bash trump its working and i am grateful for articulate and educated people like mr peterson for being a voice of reason in all of this bs
canada,removed,both of those statements coming from the same person are contradictory nope they arent i discuss alcoholism with alcoholics and i tolerate their points of view including the ones i strongly disagree with i can suggest we might make it illegal to hire teachers who are at the time alcoholics or at least keep them from talking about alcohol in front of the students you arent seeing a contradiction oh great logician when you start pushing for measures that discriminate against a specific subset of the population like laws preventing them from being hired as teachers is where you cross the line when you start hiring known homosexuals to work with children then youve crossed the line bigot
canada,removed,no its about encouraging critical thinking a skill that americans deemed unnecessary when they elected a clown

canada,removed,languages change literally every single day new words are added to the dictionary every single day new words come into common usage every single day but because youre a troglodite and cant see more than feet infront of your face its somehow only a problem when people want a gender neutral singular pronoun god forbid youre telling me that all of those are better than a gender neutral pronoun

canada,removed,trudeau isnt thats sexist those things are at least she earned them trudeau was given those things before not earned the canadian value test we dont have any roost v was denied entry so i guess those are not values so let him canada has values people to be treated equally and fairly based on their content of who they are the willingness to help others when it is possible and not harm us badly the freedom to say whatever opinion one wants it doesnt matter if doesnt if matches reality freedom to make choice right and wrong
canada,removed,making sure immigrants wont behead one of their four wives is indeed toxic
canada,removed,are you dyslexic please make use of our healthcare to get therapy our doctors are affordable because our great country and great legal citizens are contributing to our awesome health insurance
canada,removed,i cant help but notice that there are a few different users here with nearidentical writing patterns
canada,removed,yea i pissed in them and then spoon fed them to your mom
canada,removed,give it up you are digging for criticism clearly at least he is trying to consult with us whereas harper didnt even give a rats ass what we thought if we citizenry dont show up to consult is that his problem maybe he restricted it to just knowing full well that our sorry asses couldnt be bothered for the most part looks to me like you are schilling for the conservatives
canada,removed,kurds dank meme leftists
canada,removed,no im pretty sure race is a genuine thing thats what makes you a racist i dont believe you have any friends outside of your own cultural enclave bubble and this prejudice is one more evidence of it
canada,removed,
canada,removed,uvelvetjustice have you considered that given the immense number of complaints against you recently that the problem doesnt seem to be the users but your moderation theres definitely a pattern here and your response to criticism seems to be banning those who complain you hand out bans like candy and for every user here complaining there are many more youve silenced and unable to contribute i mostly lurk these days but i see a definite problem here and its not the users its you anyway i suspect ill probably be banned like all the others but what do i care all i do is lurk anyway
canada,removed,not if they pull out of paris agreement
canada,removed,im all for people being themselves but if gays want to be normal we have to stop making a spectacle out of the normal things that they do
canada,removed,where did you get the idea that i had an immense number of complaints against me because that hasnt happened at all shall we take a trip down memory lane and list all the incidents youve been responsible for or will you ban me before i do if you feel justified then im sure you wont have a problem itd be really nice if while you were lurking you reported posts in violation of the rules to the moderating team so we can try and make this forum a better place for everyone i could but i think theres a bigger problem here and youre deflecting
canada,removed,ive done nothing wrong here unless you believe somethings wrong about being honest and transparent about the actions of the moderating team stop trying to include yourself as part of a team as if to say my accusations are being levelled against all the moderators as a whole i am accusing you of being unfair and opaque with your moderation and i believe the other moderators are too complacent or apathetic to care you dont seem to believe theres a pattern here and yet there are multiple people saying theres a problem here get off your high horse for a moment and take a good long look at yourself
canada,removed,i think that youre going to get ejected eventually a little searching into your recent actions uncovered this by the way you wanted specific examples did you not shall i call in all the other people you banned for complaining too there are way more where that came from too utrudeauhatecanadians uvicegrip ucptpicardstoupee shall i keep going i see no reason to continue talking with you ah yes i recognize this said right before you throw a ban at someone classy im not impressed by your actions and all i do is read and post the occasional snarky comment im compelled to speak out because of this crap and i think you would do well to acknowledge this criticism and try to do right
canada,removed,absolutely not rcanada is becoming a fucking racist shithole i have no interest in this if your basic argument is immigrants are stealing our jobsliving off welfare theres no point
canada,removed,rather than take responsibility for your actions and acknowledge your misdeeds you continue to behave defensively and you are unrepentant youre name calling right now those people arent able to be here to defend themselves so you call them troll in what you perceive to be absolute safety this is the kind of attitude im talking about here youre not willing to improve the state of affairs in this sub youre clearly just trying to cling to power
canada,removed,im here addressing concerns and complaints and explaining my actions to the best of my ability i find it absurd to be accused of being opaque when im being as transparent about my actions as possible i wish i could just be quiet and lurk some more but your attitude has compelled me to speak out something i took a break from a long time ago youre stubborn and unwilling to acknowledge the mountain of criticism being thrown at you things need to change around here and rather than banning people who dont see eye to eye with you i firmly believe that change needs to come from you if you are incapable of making that change then someone else needs to take your place
canada,removed,you do understand that states with higher population still have more electoral votes you are just salty your candidate didnt win good luck next time loser hahahaahah

canada,removed,
canada,removed,to be fair to the guy he did explain why race was being brought into it he was explaining the actions of another group of people who were the actual ones to bring race into it he was just sharing the story about them to us i dont fault him for that i fault him for being a coward all my great aunts uncles grandfathers and grandmothers who served andor died during the first and second world wars would be ashamed of him for not standing up for what is right they would also be ashamed of the rcanada mods for trying to censor my previous reply to him i want to give you gold for this but you are too much of a cowardly hypocrite to deserve it practice what you preach its nice to see the mods doing their job but it would be even better if they applied that skill to the posts that actually need it
canada,removed,i honestly do not know what to do the battlecry of single mothers everywhere

canada,removed,dude youre letting your hatred of harper blind you the man isnt pure evil just as trudeau isnt an angel or mulcair a raging lawyer i am a a victim of abuse where religion was one of the tools that used as a form of control yes there is a need for one we have a particular class of people from areas that perform acts that are offensive to canadians these same people then raise their kids between two worlds secretly harbouring hatred of the western ways while their kids yearn for the western way it puts the children in a tough spot and the police arent the social workers that we would need in that situation it needs to be discreet it needs to happen in such a way that it is us that is coming to them as opposed to being seen as the women who brought us into their homes and if youre such a diehard partisan dont vote our motto in canada is peace order and good government good government means being able to agree on ideas regardless of source growing up i wish there was someone in my life who could anonymously do this there wasnt a purpose specific way for this in those days as a young child i had to take action and the divide it has created has literally estranged me to my family you in your hatred are stopping progress in your country in effect youre emulating the very attitudes a conservative would have youd fit right in alberta

canada,removed,the light of kek must come to canada and chase trudeau back into the darkness
canada,removed,i suppose we should all just slam ourselves in the head with a brick and kneel before the offices of the ministry of truth aka mother corp aka the cbc in celebration of their dispensation of all that is correct and good in the world s feel free to lobotomize yourself lunatic the rest of us will continue to say that actual reputable news organizations are superior to the kind of malignant lying trash that characterizes the rebel and anything to do with ezra

canada,removed,what is the enlightened progressive fascination with high speed rail and public transportation in general you people are fucking obsessed with it we have cars cars efficiently move people from ab at very little cost which is why most people have cars you people love to shoot your mouths off about being so progressive and forward thinking and yet you seek to condemn us to a century mode of transportation insanity
canada,removed,what can i do to convince you im not a bigot do i have to be a black person to not be accused of racism when i levy accusations against blm im completely and totally open to seeing any of the good work that blm has done other than make noise destroy property and be generally unpleasant

canada,removed,cant wait for you to be banned from this sub antagonistic posts like yours have no place here and dont contribute to any conversation
canada,removed,im not the one running their mouth about anyones overwhelming historic majority of unspeakably historic proportions bub who is exactly because at the top of this thread the comment says when will the liberals realize that harper and the cons had plenty of support from canadians thats why he won so many elections and he wasnt cast out last election it wasnt a devastating lose and he received a lot of the vote now im not sure if i would characterize elections as so many but this comment is miles away from the laughable straw man youre setting up when you discuss the fact that harper never won over of the vote what is your point and how is whatever point youre making not even more true of trudeau who won less of the popular vote than harper also dont be a condescending cunt the bub is unnecessary and the immediate downvote was almost equally childish
canada,removed,great cant wait to get a cheap condo

canada,removed,thats the easiest way to equalize the pressure
canada,removed,your argument lacks consistency you dont know what you dont know first you claim that lpc is almost always elected then you claim that we would just get rid of trudeau if we wanted to youve completely failed to demonstrate how that is inconsistent with anything else ive said we on average have an election every years at which time canadians can choose a different government that they have consistently chosen the lpc a majority of the time isnt inconsistent with anything else ive said according to your numbers that almost never happened throughout our history according to my numbers it happened times remember when i said this more specifically the lpc has governed for years the cpc no thanks only the lpc supports that option wonder why the ndp wants pr gee i wonder why could it be perhaps because they cant win shit under the current system after they blatantly pandered to separatists in the last election i say were all the better for keeping them out of the hoc

canada,removed,lol calling people out my favourite arm chair activist battle cry let me make something clear for you youre a worthless sack of shit who thinks that theyre making some great contribution to whatever bullshit cause youre championing by lol talking the reality of the situation is that you are a lazy cowardly useless motherfucker with absolutely nothing to offer anyone if people like you really want to make the greatest contribution to society that you can i suggest not looking both ways next time you jaywalk across a busy street youre a pathetic loser act accordingly
canada,removed,dont even start with any facts i dont want to hear them head in the sand i cant hear you i cant hear its not real la la la la reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ftfy now lets start with some facts in chrétien liberal government canada ranked as for arms exports and spiked in as worldwide before falling to reach in still liberal in when harper and the conservatives took over we ranked and later years were or except for during which we ranked which was lower than the liberal max at unfortunately wikipedia seems to be missing the stats maybe someone can find original stats source if they care but in we fell down to for arms exports nothing there for either so in summary we ranked higher as a worldwide arms exporter under the end of the chrétien liberal and also the martin liberal governments than under the harper conservative government even during his majority does that fit your narrative obviously these numbers do not include types of arms nor who bought them but nonetheless it seems that they quite clearly show that youre just trying to push an anticonservative stance without having a fucking clue what youre talking about source

canada,removed,you asked a quesiton you troglodyte
canada,removed,you are claiming that the liberals are responsible for these laws being struck down that is false the judiciary is if my heads in the sand yours is up your ass
canada,removed,round magazine does help to mitigate that quite a bit you are one stupid mother fucker
canada,removed,inaction isnt implied approval or disapproval taking the posts down would be implied disapproval youre pretty quick to request censorship
canada,removed,they will be conflicted because its a woman whos getting investigated and according to tumblr all women are perfect angels who never do anything wrong they will blame the patriarchy and men for it cause thats what they do
canada,removed,so is the pcs for going full retard in the last weeks of the campaign seriously who the fuck says im going to create a million jobs by firing a public service people it makes no logical sense
canada,removed,heres a butthurt redditor who claims to love science and yet cant stand contradictory evidence over his patent bias i sure care about your anecdotal shitty opinion
canada,removed,pathetic eu uk was right to leave you like a sack of shit that you are enjoy being raped by migrants
canada,removed,tbh you are a racist is what people like you would be doing years ago because you dont feel like having coloured people around you remember youre an immigrant too white people arent native to canada
canada,removed,you think that the only real canadians are white anglos youd never accept a nonwhite person as a real canadian
canada,removed,oh please he is a white supremacist i dont have any sympathy for that
canada,removed,ah so youre one of those white genocide people why dont you get to know those strangers huh talk to some nonwhite people rather than cowering in fear and running home to complain on stormfront and how are they dominating you as far as i can see the vast majority of immigrants try to integrate their children are integrated the amount of mixed race couples goes up all the time this is btw the exact same thing people thought about the hordes of jews and irish flooding in years ago how right were they then has america or canada been dominated by jews have the irish and italians failed to assimilate
canada,removed,it was criticized for being a boring city back in the day and it sure seems like youre a racist you seem awfully scared of people with a little more melanin in their skin why not just embrace the label call yourself a racist say nonwhite people scare me and i dont want my children to grow up around those coloureds you seem to have a nice mentality why not join your local soldiers of odin or kkk
canada,removed,this is exactly what i mean youre a typical white supremacist im proud we committed genocide natives are drunks and we owe them nothing only whites are real canadians
canada,removed,i would gladly trade the hateful human garbage in rcanada for some hardworking refugees
canada,removed,this is brought up time and time again everytime some guy says people said this about the irish and the italians im not talking about anglo culture either youre jumping to huge conclusions and being a fucking asshole like what the fuck are you talking about the culture of canada now will persist even as the demographics change we could be of non white decent and the dominant way of life will remain the same although massive segments will be noneuropean and huge societal changes will be evident are you naive or just non observant of how society changes based on demographics of those living there key to your point is that irish and italians are europeans over of canadas immigrants are from asia again im not saying they will overtake anglo culture whatever the fuck that tangent is about but asian canadians will very much change how this countries society functions ever been to scarborough markham brampton or richmond sure the dominant way of life is similar but the societal changes are massive not to mention it will continue to change as the demographics change im not saying that noneuropeans wont adopt a western lifestyle but to say the country will not change is a fallacy and is naive again i do not want to be a minority what is inherently bad glad to see that you faced little racism growing up but i didnt i faced racism on a daily basis for being white and thats it i was bullied for my skin colour for my culture im of spanish and french decent i do not want to become a minority simple i am happy with the current demographics of canada i dont advocate for the continuous decline of european canadians as seems to be the prevalent rhetoric in todays political and societal climate again im not saying i want canada to be european i cannot stress the fact that i find canada and even torontos current demographics to be a great balance again i simply do not want to be a minority the decline of white populations is not unique to canada and this dominant rhetoric is seen in many many western nations where people seemingly support the continued decline of people of european decent
canada,removed,kys

canada,removed,her facebook is bethe wettlaufer she actually post a lot of stuff on there
canada,removed,there seems to some linguistic confusion going on here no you are just arguing for the sake of arguing yes it was prove it how is it genocide when of people living in tibet are still tibetan after thousands of years with contact how is it genocide if the vast majority of people in tibet are tibetan you are making a mockery of the term genocide and you are insulting all jews aborigines natives etc just because you want to push an agenda what about giving tibet its independence what about it what about returning canada back to the natives what about giving texas its indepedence why the fuck are you taking about indepedence on a comment about british invasion of tibet huge difference between these and simplistic yes the difference is that a foreign alien people invaded foreign lands and committed genocide if the chinese were as savage and primitive as canadians australians etc there wouldnt be any tibetans oh why did i bother just reporting this you are a scumbag for making a mockery of genocide i reported you as well

canada,removed,half the time you seem to be sane but on this fuck you we have low iq associated with higher violence dregs being imported fuck them how about we not import human trash especially low iq people that think raping children is cool or that stoning women for the crime of being raped is ok fuck islam its a toxic ideology that we dont need in canada its barbaric and vile there is nothing remotely redeeming about islam who gives a fuck what race they are there are white people that choose to follow islam and theyre subhuman trash that have no place in any civilised society theyre garbage the only thing they are good for is fertilizer because they have no value to give to humanity when they support raping children beating women and murdering gays fuck islam fuck muslims they have no place in canada where we actually value human life
canada,removed,pride should always be a protest go fuck yourself you dont get to tell every lgbt person what pride is supposed to be for them for me pride is not a protest what the hell are we protesting for me its a celebration a celebration of the communities weve built the bridges weve built with other communities the legal rights weve gained the social acceptance weve gained the social progress weve made for me pride is celebrating a victory we won also i dont want police to wear normal street clothes because their uniforms might trigger an overlysensitive special snowflake i want them in their uniforms marching with us in a show of solidarity for all the world to see that law enforcement and lgbt people have worked hard for decades to build a bridge of mutual understanding and respect for one another is it perfect no no relationship ever is but we have made significant progress and the fact that the police want to be part of our celebration speaks volumes about how they feel about us and our community if these special snowflake sjws want to have their own pity party somewhere else then theyre welcome to it is not their place however to tell the rest of the lgbt community how to have pride whos allowed to participate and what it means to us so once again go fuck yourself

canada,removed,fuck you racist protectionism blanketed as human rights even china has seen change as rising wages due to globalisation have caused people to become educated and demand better living conditions they just ratified the paris climate agreements even though itll hurt industry they did it because people there are furious with pollution they are taking their country into their own hands thanks to the wealth from trade you cant have a unionized factory like you daddy because of china tough shit learn to write code or something still useful but dont blame globalisation

canada,removed,i dont think any apartment block owner or mill manager would permit an inexperienced person to do the job yup you are a certified idiot
canada,removed,im not defending anyone you idiot im defending the laws that built this country unless of course you dont actually believe in those laws which pretty much means the entire discussion is moot or that you believe that a different standard of guilt applies to them for some shitty bullshit reasons if he is guilty than so be it we move on from there but to assume that the entire family is guilty simply for being related is wrong and frankly quite autocratic which i remind you is something that this country doesnt believe in

canada,removed,i read your post history thinking id find a bunch of things that made me angry but i didnt i found someone who believes most of the same things as me and is as blunt as i am often i wish wed never started arguing or at least i wish id been less adversarial since youve already extensively researched me i feel like you should know more about me for context i went to school for art as you may have guessed and have since tried to work exclusively in art services which is the super specific branch that deals with framing and conservation and the physical aspects of art i moved to toronto to work in that field and make my own art on the side before receiving a job offer in a city in eastern canada to work another specific art related job i work a day job and then hit my studio for hours every night and the weekend i work maybe hrs a week total i have a cat named sweetie who i kept from a failed long term relationship and i have made precisely zero friends since moving to toronto three years ago bummer right i also feel like were being manipulated by the top tier of society i also feel like this canadian society is set up to preserve hierarchy now you know a lot about me not to mention my name what you do with my personal information is up to you this is an account linked to my name so i only say things i would say in real life on it i went through my post history and deleted any comment that had any personal information linked to someone other than me since youre not the first person to threaten me with my own words id rather just get along though consider this an apology for being insensitive i dont want to see anyone lose their jobs so i can have them including you its not a zero sum game and we both know theres room for everyone my biggest regret here is pissing you off i think wed probably have been on the same team if i had been more diplomatic and less silly please consider this an apology we visit the same subs and i dont want this to turn into west side story or something
canada,removed,why is it cuckservative canadians cant communicate in both languages fluently regardless what language the question was spoken in our nation affords dual lingual thought communication trudeau thinks speaks in multiple languages thus is makes sense to answer in any damn language it pleases him i find it laughable that old stock canadians cant keep up with the two official languages of canada its silly that eurotrash cukservatives cry for canadian values but cant communicate beyond english im not even white yet i speak four european languages living in quebec ill often speak with quebecers who want to practise their english ill reply in developing french combining languages is rather basicso why cant yall keep up

canada,removed,i think you need to understand that many of us just happen to post more in those subs because we dont get censored and banned constantly there here in rcanada not so much the banhammer is on a hair trigger and you can largely thank vj for that so for many of us our opportunity to actually post here is somewhat limited and then we need to walk on eggshells here when we do post which isnt very encouraging vj has certainly accomplished some of his goal there
canada,removed,oh god people like you are the worst

canada,removed,my sister had her face attacked by a pitbull when she was a mexican stole my car ten years ago this type of unpredictable violent behavior is inherent in the breed its not and the scientific research says its not httpswwwavmaorgkbresourcesliteraturereviewspagestheroleofbreedindogbiteriskandpreventionaspx there is zero reason to own one as a pet except that they are one of the least aggressive breeds and they are very affectionate they are less likely to bite than a golden retriever i will never forget or support ownership of pitbulls its sad that youre so weak mentally and unable to learn new things

canada,removed,immigration is good for economy and culture bad for old right winger morons
canada,removed,
canada,removed,canadian white culture is in full retreat soon the only white people who arent full of selfloathing and white guilt will be considered the supremacists basically if you even try and argue to keep canada majority white youre a racist imagine if africa china or india had a neverending supply of whites from canada who immigrated there and displaced their populations oh wait it was called colonialism and it is now happening to us
canada,removed,my phobia is primitive ways of life which using weaponry is part of
canada,removed,tell it to france who have been living with suspended civil rights for over months because of an to muslim population yawn figures the rabid muslimhater would lyingly pretend that daeshs handful of attacks on france are something that can be blamed on all of them idiot wonder where the majority of those immigrants came from china and islamic states are my guess yawn rather have people from there then people like you shithole cow town old stock garbage would be my guess neither of which has and cultural traits we wish to emulate yawn you done
canada,removed,you sound like me about years ago id gather youre in your and have no family yet also i bet you dont live in a neighborhood that has the unpleasant effects of mass immigration whats going to happen years from now is im going to hate the rabidly antiimmigrant types and the altrightists and the spineless ones who support them because they like bigotry against those people as long as its not against themselves even more youre laying your narrative on so thick its impossible to take you seriously western nations are becoming so fragmented and so disillusioned with their own culture im sure the next years will be much more rocky than the previous i wonder if you can see the accelerating tribalism happening snore no need to call me a dipshit just because you disagree good day to you sir oh go play the victim somewhere else you know why im calling you a dipshit and its not just because oh he has a different opinion
canada,removed,omg its trudeau lol they feel excluded really nothing to do with the fact their icon their idol the prophet mohammed whom all of them are expected to emulate was a war monger genocidal murderer a rapist a slaver a brigand and a pedophile totally irrelevant perhaps you could explain attacks on jews to the point jews are fleeing france by the tens of thousands rapes by islamic men through the roof in sweden and germanyoh good lord you apologists are ridiculous have you watched the munk debates between faragesteyn and arbourschama it is quite educational
canada,removed,by virtue of being jewish nothing its the whole israelzionism thing im referring to if jews immigrate to canada to scream antisemitism any time people talk about palestinians and lebanese and iranians as human beings then i can do without them
canada,removed,you argue like a child but its the internet so chances are youre one
canada,removed,are you saying trudeaus a check
canada,removed,look edgelord its not some big conspiracy american politics is a shitshow that doesnt mean there is no difference between the candidates
canada,removed,but facts dictate that your views are not shared by most canadians what views my view is that canadians should be allowed to dictate how many people come in to the country and who they are i think every canadian shares that view if it is more ok if it is less thats ok too the policy should be based on what the majority of canadians want
canada,removed,a good start on inclusiveness but canada really needs its own sharia clause making pedophilia jihadism honour killings and what not illegal is a serious violation of their religious rights
canada,removed,another anti semitic muslim
canada,removed,no its not that simple far from it actually what is that simple you clearly hate and demonize anyone from the middle east barring israelis and no doubt other varieties of immigrants but we know what you are so its not surprising at all
canada,removed,the canadians whore similar to the brits who voted for brexit shouldnt have a say yes i noticed you cant respond to what i said outside of complaining about downvotes as well
canada,removed,sure i did read again obama renews george bushs emergency government every opportunity now go learn what cog and coop and you wont appear so ignorant on public forums
canada,removed,no i have a mathematical approach to immigration i want what is best for canada and canadians nope you have an awful terrible approach to immigration you are amongst our worst that much is clear you are the bigot who hates all jews extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence meanwhile you display your religious and ethnic bigotry for all to see brexit boy
canada,removed,precisely what the little bitch is doing son i remember you sucking off harper id be careful with the tall talk while you still have bitch on your breath
canada,removed,man these leftards are such nutters completely living in a dream world when they actually believes we can all create some magical renewable energy that is profitable makes economic sense and will have instant infrastructure so it can be efficiently delivered and actually usable can all be done overnight
canada,removed,ugh shut up idiot and dont repost the same crap hours after finding out no ones buying your ignorant tale
canada,removed,is this alt account of umauifiveo i honestly feel like there is person going around posting the same links in every immigration related post under different accounts
canada,removed,i cant because hes dead but based on your other responses you were probably too stupid to realize and youre too dumb to realize i was mocking you youre asking me why a country would tell people not to integrate i dont know why are you asking me that do i look like the person who passed httpsenwikipediaorgwikicanadianmulticulturalismact im an immigrant maybe ask yourselves why you were so stupid to vote for a guy who officially enacted a policy that says hey guise all culturevalues is canadian culturevalues integration optional
canada,removed,you should know looks like youve eaten mountains of fajitas cheesy tits

canada,removed,you brought it up lmao as a cyclist i always stay out of them but if i were hit while in one on some fluke chance it would absolutely be the drivers fault
canada,removed,i think you fell for the propaganda that told people it was the wee little farmer protecting his crops from the big bad foxes bullshit usually flies both ways no animal should be mauled to death by a dog and farmers are still allowed to protect their land from pest animals so its a fine law
canada,removed,its isnt the bolt your dolt it is the trigger grouping maybe you should not talk about stuff you have no knowledge on
canada,removed,but thats not a reason to legalize it good god kid you know its legal right restricted just means you need an rpal license fucking moron
canada,removed,yes passing on the right is illegal because it is unsafe engineers create ways of skirting that law and now a girl is dead what did you not understand here did you want me to call you personally to explain it to you maybe a pie chart or a bar graph
canada,removed,i know the law quite well its too bad your reading comprehension isnt up to snuff or this conversation would have been over three posts ago now im sorry youre not very smart but please dont pawn your idiocy off on me
canada,removed,please dont take out your inability to read on others thank you
canada,removed,this incident happened in ontario so needs to point out why its illegal in ontario as he has claimed so many times that it is
canada,removed,dont bother hell just get frustrated and smear your name over hald the thread to distract everyone from his gargantuan stupidity
canada,removed,none of those sections say that its illegal for a cyclist to pass to the right try again though
canada,removed,my opinions arent extreme they are based on fact your opinions run counter to those of the majority of canadians that actually want gun laws tightened one could call that extreme as for being based on factlol we dont need more gun laws if you even knew what they were already and the laughable effect they have here and in other countries you might agree you have zero evidence to support this our society is the safest it has ever been and that happens to coincide with our tightening of gun laws why fuck with that system especially considering the epidemic of gun homicide in the us and criminals continue to commit crimes sometimes with guns because get this they dont follow the law yes and many of those weapons are smiggled in from the us where gun laws are incredibly lax how is loosening our gun laws going to make anybody safer by the way even if mass shootings were commonplace why shouldnt we place the blame squarely on thr shoulders of the perpetrators its not like they cant get the guns they want regardless of what the law says keeping the population with the lowest criminal element from having for hunting and plinking protects no one why do you need to shoot bullets in seconds at a deer just to kill it you sound like a shitty fucking hunter and i wouldnt want to be anywhere near a shit shot like you
canada,removed,overkill talk about a lack of education i wouldnt shoot at a deer passed yards with an because the round might not have enough power for a proper kill if an scares you then the average hunting rifle should have you shitting your pants educate yourself next time before you open your mouth next time fucking pathetic
canada,removed,what he describes is accurate fuck all the chinese immigrants who refuse to learn english or french in quebec

canada,removed,yawn crawl back up your own ass muslims are subhuman barbarian wahhabis by default defended as freedom of speech is an effrontery to the principle of the value of free speech its only useful in singling out the dumb fucks on sites like this one

canada,removed,harmful substance you moron
canada,removed,im speaking from experience i spent quite a bit of time in the wonderful world of student government and every single person that went into these kinds of hysterics and incessantly complained about the fascism of the pc police or whatever nonsense terms are in use today really just wanted social license to be a racist sexist holocaust denying boorish douchebags brah why are all these people so upset i walked around with a confederate flag during black history month and like whats up with there not being a white history month lol did you hear the one about how copper wire was invented btw do you know when student senate is going to open up my white student union club usually these people were with entitlement complexes and were never told no by mommy and daddy but this time its a prof with tenure making a stampy foot tantrum but despite the fact this story has been vomited up repeatedly by the press for a week no legal experts that im aware of have come forward to support this profs interpretation of this bill that might have something to do with his comparison of sensitivity training to reeducation camps but whatever and yet the martyr act continues now with pokemon games wtf but no matter how much you dress it up with analogies or academic words its the same shit as it always has been i dont want to be accountable for my actions and should be able to do anything i want because freedom of speech should override everything help help im being oppressed now you see the violence inherent in the system
canada,removed,sounds like youre craving some attention youre a selfish piece of shit
canada,removed,this is proof positive youre an utter idiot
canada,removed,
canada,removed,mods are pussies
canada,removed,mods are pussies
canada,removed,i dont like when they criticize islam but i bet if it were the damn jews it would be gone by now by criticize islam do you mean slander and demonize muslims in canada and in the middle east generally pretend that the region is defined by wahhabism shitpost to an extraordinary degree fuck off and yes if people were saying the same shit about the jews the most entitled spoiled minority in the west you can bet the threads would be shitcanned by now mask it however you like the first thing you did when calling this racism was use subtle antisemitism as a counter balance uh this thread pretty clearly has ethnically and religiously bigoted nonsense in it i think were going to be done here in a moment since you seem to want to deny it when it comes to muslims and nonjewish middle easterners unlike you ive been to countries in the region unlike you i have friends from those countries that means i have a vested interest in calling out bullshit no antisemitism here i just dont treat jews specially problem fuck off with your accusations of hypocrisy go lie and pretend that living in beirut or tunis is the same thing as living in a cave with the talibs
canada,removed,it wasnt used to oppress it was used to try and bring them into the civilized world you know the same thing people are begging for through africa and the middle east it became corrupt largely by the catholic church as far as i can tell along with a litany of similar abuses that affected young children across the board but youre also talking about nomadic tribes who dont know what fractions are so the intention was to bring them into the rest of the world so if were in a situation where they dont want to learn about math and politics and science then fine but dont be surprised when they remain subsistence farmers and essentially remain nomadic people who will come knocking on your door the moment things go wrong
canada,removed,das rite boii yall be living too good u need dem taxes now my man das rite who really thoght a snowboard instructor would make a good pm das ritee canada is fucked now boiiiii fun fact the first greeks was ruled by kings who was black agamemnon the last black king of greece was overthrown by the whiteys who ruled greece for a couple of centuries until mausolus the great black general overthrew the whiteys and exterminated them in the social war now blacks was running greece again and a whitey wasnt seen in the region again until it was sacked by lucius mummius and the whiteys eventually killed or sent the black greeks to africa seleukos nikator was black

canada,removed,this is why native advertising advertorials should not become the norm i attended a newspapers canada conference where the practice was applauded as a great advertising business opportunity the whole point of it is to trick readers into thinking theyre reading news and if the readers cant trust what they read news media becomes irrelevant
canada,removed,here you go
canada,removed,you deserve to be demonized for blaming all your problems on immigrants
canada,removed,except study after study after study completely refutes that canada has an immigrant problem there is no immigration problem in this country and unless you can pull up evidence that can support your position then it is only fair that your position is rooted in your own ignorance and fuelled by either racism bigotry or xenophobia no matter how hard you try and scream that you arent acting like a racist it doesnt change the fact that you are if i was in charge of immigration canada would be a much much better place more affordable better jobs better education better everything because youre a racist my goodness

canada,removed,yawn making mountains out of molehills like harper did youre going to shit your pants over the halfdozen women tops who actually demanded the right to do that im more antiniqab then you because i know about the nations and people of the middle east whereas youre clueless but this really is embarrassing and pathetic maybe if you clowns werent so hysterical about it we could all quietly say that it wasnt acceptable and thatd be that but no apparently thats not good enough your ilk have to pretend that this country is teeming with niqabis and that everyone from the mena is a salafist or something
canada,removed,do you see them opening up the immigration floodgates indicate of filthy altright political views in reality no one is opening up the floodgates

canada,removed,i think its bullshit that someone like weston can accrue if hes doing so by putting canadians out of work so he can pay less to a tfw if thats the case he should be dragged out of his house covered in gas and burnt alive in the streets
canada,removed,its not dumb luck asshole its the persistence of those canadian values that you conservatives try to do destroy whenever you get the chance
canada,removed,you can have an opinion on the sky being blue red or any other colour but theres still an empirical fact about the colour at any given point and location moral judgments even if everyone agrees is an opinion for example anyone who read your post thinks youre an idiot that still doesnt make it a fact because thats not have facts work everyone thinks that the holocaust was bad i dont disagree with that statement but it doesnt change it from being my own conclusion of opinion because thats all it is you can have opinions on facts but opinions dont become facts because of nearuniversal agreement you idiot my opinion
canada,removed,ya i hate when people have to fight to get paid a fair wage what do you do for a living asshole

canada,removed,you must be a special kind of stupid brainwashed moron didnt you read the article it was done by a reputable research group and they were unable to detect any thc you understand that means they would pass a drug screening test dont you if they dont find the drug in your system you pass the test

canada,removed,considering the phrase was coined in since then on a side note it was borne out of the civil rights movement you know what that is it was a social movement where african americans fought for equal status under the law and human rights kind of disgusting that you would evoke such a term as a means to target another visible minority while trying to restrict their human rights not that i would expect you to understand any of this just another day when dealing with the intellectually inferior as if their opinion matters
canada,removed,would you rather i use the term ethnic minority you people are boring and im so thankful that youll never amount to anything close to having authority on these issues you lead a sad and little life i feel sorry for you

canada,removed,wow what an irritating retort a i am not a liberal you sneering moron b i never used the word mass when referring to immigration mass immigration is unusual and not typically sound policy c you seem to believe the word educated exclusively means attended a post secondary institution it does not nor was i implying such a thing educated is also a synonym for informed and being informed on both sides of a debate and able to form a rational opinion is important prior to voicing one you managed to strawman my post three separate ways in one go on top of opening with an ergo decedo fallacy congratulations on being the type of idiot who probably shares oodles of misinformed political memes on facebook
canada,removed,i find hilarious how guysgals like you say stuff like this but come saint patricks day every fucking body durh durh i am irish i find it hilarious when people like you say stupid shit like this i think those people are idiots too but go ahead and try and find a blind generalization that fits bud surely something has to stick if you throw enough ignorant bullshit right i was just saying that using were all immigrants if you look far enough back is irrelevant to the discussion about the current wave of immigration im not firmly in one camp or the other but your dumb ass was pretty quick to assume what you wanted to hear me saying

canada,removed,identity politics are narcissistic and masturbatory but you should be free to do whatever you want as long as it doesnt hurt anybody and i suppose being harassed for being trans or nb is not harmful or denying housing or work to trans and nb people is not harmful or physically attacking trans or nb people is not harmful it sounds like there is the possibility of even just criticism of trans or nonbinary to be interpreted as a hate crime what why would criticize someone being trans or nb its like criticizing someone for being bisexual what are they supposed to do about it how are they supposed to change even criticising this proposed law for said reasons has wrongfully caused you to interpret that as hate speech or bigotry against trans youre not being charged for criticizing a law are you youre free to do that just as im free to call you a moron for criticizing it

canada,removed,youre entirely right something doesnt add up your calculations dont work because the world is complicated and well beyond your puny brain welcome to humanity
canada,removed,the muhammad guy shooter was a trump supporter also thats not my point my point is that japan has a much better culture than that which is found in the middle east no one was having an outrage either from indian immigrants either so what is your solution the middle east has been warn torn for decades now will you just keep accepting them every year this does not solve the problem as to why their nations are terrible

canada,removed,the status of womens testimony in islam is disputed muzammil h siddiqi a notable scholar from north america has said the quran makes very little reference to genders in terms of testimony in cases of hudud punishments for serious crimes maliki jurist averroes wrote that jurists disagree about the status of womens testimony according to averroes most scholars say that in this case womens testimony is unacceptable regardless of whether they testify alongside male witnesses however he writes that the school of thought known as the zahiris believe that if two or more women testify alongside a male witness then as in cases regarding financial transactions discussed below their testimony is acceptable in case of witnesses for financial documents the quran asks for two men or one man and two women it is disputed whether this means that a womans testimony worth half that of a man either in disputes about financial transactions or as a general matter on the other hand javed ahmed ghamidi writes that islam asks for two female witnesses against one male in the case of financial transactions because this responsibility is not very suited to their temperament sphere of interest and usual environment he argues that islam makes no claim that a womans testimony is half in any case he interprets the quran verse as only a recommendation and argues that it will be for the court judge to decide what kind and whose evidence will be enough to prove a case regarding the prophetic narration that is used to prove halftestimony status of women javed ahmed ghamidi and members of his foundation almawrid argue against its reliability and its translation from arabic ghamdi also contends that the narration cannot be used in all general cases because it is related to the quran verse whose subject is related only to financial matters another pakistani religious scholar ishaq argues that acquiring conclusive evidence is important regardless of whether it can be obtained from just one man or just one woman ibn alqayyim also argued that the verse referred to relates to the heavy responsibility of testifying by which an owner of wealth protects his rights not with the decision of a court the two are completely different from each other it is also argued that this command shows that the quran does not want to make difficulties for women ibn taymiyya also reasoned the deficiency of using quran to prove evidentiary discrimination against women however both ibn alqayyim and ibn taymiyya did believe in the difference of probative value of mens and womens testimony it is argued that even though ibn alqayyim believed that women were more prone to making errors instead of concluding a general discrimination from this womens testimony was to be treated on an individual basis this is because ibn alqayyim contended that in cases where a woman and man share all the islamic good qualities of a witness a womans testimony corroborated by another woman may actually be considered stronger than the uncorroborated testimony of a man additionally ibn alqayyim also regarded the testimony of some exceptional women like those who transmitted hadith as doubtlessly greater than a single man of lesser esteem in matters other than financial transactions scholars differ on whether the quranic verses relating to financial transactions apply this is especially true in the case of bodily affairs like divorce marriage slaveemancipation and raju restitution of conjugal rights according to averroes imam abu hanifa believed that their testimony is acceptable in such cases imam malik on the contrary believes that their testimony remains unacceptable for bodily affairs about which men can have no information in ordinary circumstances such as the physical handicaps of women and the crying of a baby at birth the majority of scholars hold that the testimony of women alone is acceptable but the number of women witnesses needed is debated in different islamic schools of law hanafis and hanbalis see even one woman enough according to malikis two women are required as for shafiis they see that women are needed in certain situations the scripture accepts the testimony of a woman as equal to that of a mans and that her testimony can even invalidate his such as when a man accuses his wife of unchastity i am a bot please contact httpswwwredditcomusergregmartinez with any questions or feedback

canada,removed,this title is sensationalized as this quote states otherwise thats the second highest rate of population growth in the country behind manitoba were still a growing population tombe said also this is not low content this is an opinion
canada,removed,i am not expecting a damn thing from a leftist sub with trudeau cheerleaders
canada,removed,the article states otherwise thats the second highest rate of population growth in the country behind manitoba were still a growing population tombe said its a sensationalized title stop removing this comment
canada,removed,i hope this isnt doxxingbut i was able to get their phone number location and email from google search i suggest everyone write them a friendly ahem email as i did
canada,removed,people lost their jobs you inconsiderate fuck
canada,removed,is a good start yes i actually think that and no i dont give a shit if you report me poor life choices poor life results
canada,removed,i could say lick cop puss harder if that suits your narrative better i didnt presume which sex the person i was responding to to be but rather used a colloquial phrase to denote your bias prejudice as being profrivolousticketing via the reference to figuratively offering your mouth up for the pleasure of those seeking to milk the public for revenue under the guise of protecting the public now im trying to figure out if you give a shit about gay rights at all or are just future her goading for the sake of a rose as your first post was clearly intended to do
canada,removed,post the legal definition of a hobo he was wearing his badge and refusing donations
canada,removed,this is smart policing we need to slow the epidemic of deadly distracted drivers just the media coverage of this event is causing some formerly negligent drivers to reconsider their sneaky texting and lack of seatbelt use
canada,removed,and thats only if you believe the seatbelt was actually buckled in the first place im not so sure
canada,removed,nope an operation like this would have been planned in full cooperation with the crown they even anticipated certain objections and issues and guarded against them
canada,removed,the police service has issued a statement that essentially suggests the driver very likely was unbuckled already they let other drivers go who did unbuckle briefly or who took out their phones to photograph the officer
canada,removed,this isnt about revenue as this revenue goes to the province not the city anyway its doing something about the out of control amount of deaths damage and injury resulting from negligent texting drivers
canada,removed,one could even do more than over the speed limit in that province given the sad state of their roads would you put your money where your mouth is if we can arrange a driver to prove a car can be driven in the province at km over you surrender your car plus costs are you up for it
canada,removed,or the guy is lying his face off
canada,removed,theres no quota but if you gotta make up conspiracy theory to prop up your viewpoint might be time to reevaluate
canada,removed,my biggest issue is the epidemic of dangerously negligent texting drivers it is literally killing innocent people its racking up lifetime debilitating injuries and causing hundreds of millions in preventable damage that we all have to pay for im glad someone is doing something
canada,removed,the people who believe in bigfoot and chemtrails
canada,removed,maybe read the article it had nothing whatsoever to do with panhandling
canada,removed,for me its the opposite im glad to hear at least one police department is actually trying to reduce the epidemic of deadly negligent texting drivers
canada,removed,if that paranoia makes you stop texting and helps remind you to wear your seatbelt thats a good result
canada,removed,according to their statement they would not ticket him if the story he told were true they point out they let many others go but that in his the ticket was warranted and will be proven in court
canada,removed,if you knew people killed by distracted drivers i do or didand if you knew people killed by dui i dodid then you wouldnt be deluded in thinking the penalties are high and the enforcement is anywhere near adequate
canada,removed,at this moment this post has points whereas a misguided diatribe against the police and effectively cheerleading for deadly distracted driving has points says it all
canada,removed,should we assume the opposite people get joy from knowing that innocent victims are being killed by texting drivers
canada,removed,perhaps but perhaps not one of the primary goals of this operation is deterrence there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that all of canada is now more aware of enforcement for their sneaky texting it will stop many people and inevitably save a few lives
canada,removed,nope visa and mastercard are direct competitors like coke vs pepsi they do however collaborate on certain things like agreeing to mutual standards for processing protocols for security and clearing houses and disputes and such continuing the parallel its like how coke and pepsi make their can and bottle sizes similar and compatible with each other for shelving and accessories while still competing fiercely
canada,removed,im sympathetic and agreeing with you however walmart would counter and say they will gladly give almost anyone a walmartaffiliate mastercard and they would also encourage people to use debit anyway
canada,removed,i find ctvs incorrect title isnt helping matters the man claims he threw the change on the ground the police officer never asked for or accepted the money
canada,removed,do you have autism
canada,removed,said in a sea of conspiracy theory nonsense fiction about quotas and revenues and entrapment
canada,removed,and now its about a viral awareness that sneaky and dangerous texters just got a little bit more likely to get caught and prosecuted believe me even dirty police officers would rather respond to fewer deaths and dismemberments
canada,removed,youre going to need to read the article
canada,removed,there may not be an explicit quota correct nor an implicit one
canada,removed,you dont see the hypocrisy in distracting drivers how can i see hypocrisy in an event that never happened do you see the hypocrisy in dane rusk blowing vape smoke in the officers face especially when it breaks the citys own safety related bylaw about soliciting at high volume intersections i dont know that citys bylaws but i suspect youre making up a bylaw that doesnt exist and even if it did exist credible reports are that the officer was very carefully and deliberately not soliciting
canada,removed,dictating walmart mastercard only is not acceptable to the mastercard international consortium that controls the franchise their rules stipulate a merchant must take any issued mastercard walmart is big but could they try to be the one to break that rule maybe but really why would they theyre already entering uncharted confrontational waters by dropping visa
canada,removed,starting any day now costco will only be accepting visa
canada,removed,are you kidding millions of canadians have mastercard not sure who has more but visa and mastercard would be comparable sizes in canada
canada,removed,whenever someone tries to sell me a credit card i say yes im currently in bankruptcy and gravely ill whats the highest limit they can offer
canada,removed,what do you mean about credit protection making it hard to get credit
canada,removed,perhaps but theres precedent that suggests otherwise lesser retailers than walmart have tried doing this and the result was a slow negotiated resolution given that they were patient with a small fish it seems unlikely theyd go nuclear on a big fish granted they wouldnt like it one bit but immediately cut off walmart canada probably not some stern communications probably but pulling the plug without warning not so sure about that besides as many have been saying since paypal was invented the duopoly of mcvisa cant last forever i personally thought some combination of internetpaypalemoney would have blown up mcvisas party by now yet it hasnt then it sounded like apple would disrupt them but instead they just joined the cartel mcvisa may be more flexible now than in the past given the competitive threats and openings that now exist
canada,removed,luckily i do plus i know how to read articles before posting you should try that sometime
canada,removed,you can expect it but theres precedent proving the opposite and loads of common sense and good business practices working against it as well and i hate to burst the bubble but walmart canada isnt seen as a global powerhouse within international mega retailer circles and besides it isnt walmart canada its a tiny remote experiment
canada,removed,shut up
canada,removed,no your link shows that a police officer is accused of doling out invalid warnings possibly to make himself appear busy and theres some concern others are doing it to theres nothing about a quota critical reading matters
canada,removed,if you think standing passively with words is distracting drivers then youre selectively deluding yourself you never seen a t shirt before youve never seen outdoor signage or are you letting your brainwashed rage against the popo fully disable any common sense you might once have possessed
canada,removed,dont analyze situations using your sphincter
canada,removed,thats debatable and the tiny experiment represents just of credit card revenue but all of that is beside the point its not about whether it is significant its about whether the global financial community thinks its significant and they dont
canada,removed,sigh the original article didnt your first article explicitly states deputy police chief guy berthelotte says police arent expected to deliver a quota of traffic tickets the second one is a angry comment in a community rag im not even going into the quebec one because its basically its own wild west when it comes to policing
canada,removed,suspecting that the article text might be as shoddy as the blatantly inaccurate title i took seconds and googled the bylaw to confirm i was right soliciting in general is prohibited and has nothing to do with high volume intersections which would be too subjective for bylaw enforcement anyway the officer wasnt soliciting making all the cophate protest moot anyway but those hard core nitpickers should notice that the bylaw has an exemption for soliciting when the city themselves permits it soliciting from vehicle no person shall solicit business from a vehicle except where permitted to do so by the city no person shall annoy any person by soliciting or enticing any person to a vehicle s traffic solicitations no person shall while on the public highway solicit a person who is in or on a stopped standing or parked vehicle no person shall while on a median traffic island or traffic control device solicit a person who is in or on a moving stopped standing or parked vehicle s
canada,removed,please check for polyps while your head is in there
canada,removed,says the person who missed this deputy police chief guy berthelotte says police arent expected to deliver a quota of traffic tickets
canada,removed,lots of this involves blind faith in an angry facebook post of a less than credible source i look at this with an objective eye who is telling the truth was the police officer soliciting cars neither of us were there so we have to look at indicators to make the judgement call out of thousands who passed by only one has made that claim a guy who happens to be salty about getting a seatbelt ticket is throwing money out the window realistic or normal ive seen countless instances of people handing money to someone but never once have i seen someone throwing it more weight against the complainer did the police take special forethought and care to ensure they were not soliciting yes theres objective proof they did so thats three strikes against the guy the only indicator thats in favor of his story isnt really specific its just the general current mood that all cops are dirty
canada,removed,is that a chicken wearing a tiny sweater
canada,removed,were lazy im not that lazy will we ever know the truth
canada,removed,hey man which way to the next klan meet up
canada,removed,utexasnorth has likely never read or written anything remotely close to resembling what would constitute as a scientific study when you are dead you dont know that you are dead it is difficult only for the others it is the same when you are stupid

canada,removed,how can we legitimately differentiate the reasons about an extradition request look at their address corrupt officials buys million dollar mansions political dissidentstibetpassive objectors do not it isnt all that complicated if china wants an official on corruption charge and they have millions of dollars of assets inside canada while claiming welfare send them back
canada,removed,swing and a miss from the xenophobic grandpa
canada,removed,because over the last years of liberal government there have been a few scandals and people are too poorly informed and just generally ignorant about the issues but they lay all blame for all issues of the last years on kathleen wynne

canada,removed,i contacted the mods concerning your crazy shit of opening what is now threads for one comment apparently the mods are fine with your stalking and harassment as they seem to be agw believers who are willing even eager to protect you one reply is all you get archie that to isnt new carbon though its carbon thats already in the system humans add of new carbon each year some of it gets into the carbon sinks and the rest goes on to increase the relative concentration in the atmosphere the whole point is that the extra makes no difference youre trying to change the topic in order to continue your harassment outgassing is a feedback one caused by the primary warming the natural continues to be absorbed by carbon sinks however with the addition of new the sinks cant absorb it all and thus the natural concentration goes up outgassing would occur with natural warming it doesnt wait for a special case so you admit that you arbitrarily drew lines on graphs good to know that upsets you archie i drew lines exactly on the years the guy bought up so i did nothing arbitrary archie a five year old would find your objection childish archie you always start attacking people when you cant provide rational answers you have a real anger management problem maybe you should see someone about that no i pointed out that hes the one who did the attacking try to keep up archie no its not threads is obsession archie again you are the one displaying signs of mental illness such as calling me by my username several times per paragraph i use your name repeatedly as that is the best way to communicate with children add to that your habit of believing in all kind of pseudoscientific crap and youre all set pot kettle black archie you buy agw i could i just chose not to because its idiotic threads is not idiotic yes it is archie its also a sign of paranoid schizophrenia neither obsessed nor pissed now please stop trying to make this about me just because you have failed to defend your arguments with actual evidence or keep throwing that little temper tantrum of yours as you always end up doing maybe youll also get banned from this subreddit threads is paranoid schizophrenia archie deductively fallacious but theyre still not a fallacy when quoting sources that are being corroborated by a vast body of empirical evidence that really ties you in knots didnt it archie objecting your way out seems a bit of a problem for you the definition i gave covers that the guy did an a to a archie it has to do with the fallacious claim you made in that comment above in this subthread where im bringing back the discussion you said there has been no significant ocean warming other than that associated with enso and im calling you out on your usual bs there has been no significant ocean warming archie what i wrote is correct youre the one displaying irrational behaviour now and usually not me threads is paranoid schizophrenia archie so you admit your incompetence then every person who follows the scientific method and is truly skeptical assumes their own incompetence thats why i refer to sources rather than my imagination archie he would know considering how much his dataset has been adjusted hint quite a lot more than gistemp or hadcrut prove it again christys own dataset is constantly being adjusted it is very likely that christy is letting his own opinion cloud his judgement which is why his dataset is so unreliable bullshit thats your imagination archie christy isnt hes a contrarian scientist and he actually agrees with me more than he does with you in your dreams archie thats what we call delusion of grandeur which is another symptom of paranoid schizophrenia sorry but that is your case you constantly dismiss the vast majority of scientists who endorse agw i put evidence right in front of you archie you denied that its there which is delusional dk is what you suffer from and pretty much everyone knows it by now you are fighting a losing battle as i said a year old would find what youre doing childish and as i indicated before that evidence is bs its you drawing lines on graphs since when do people not draw lines on graphsarchie how many times have you presented graphs and used words to describe what you see all i did was suibstitute lines for words archie and the lines eliminate all confusion youre just upset that the graphs say what you wish they didnt getting upset over such trivia is your frustration bursting out archie what perverse joy do to you get out of all this archie youre probably going to say that you have a duty and that this gives you no joy people who apply torture usually say the same thing

canada,removed,these guys are psychos i used to consider myself left leaning but i cant stand it anymore they called everyone racists until the term lost all meaning and now they have switched to calling everyone fascists in the end all they are doing is enabling actual fascists by diluting its meaning and turning it into a slur to use against their opponents

canada,removed,youre an idiot this has everything to do with an unelected non official wanting to spend tax dollars on whatever they want the only reason you think its a gender issue is because you undoubtedly think absolutely everything is a gender issue your absolute cognitive dissonance is so obvious
canada,removed,if as his post claims there was funny stuff happening with the evidence then they deserve a fair trial having looked looked at the website linked in the fb post with many grains of salt im not sure if any of it is significant as a summary a censored report was given to the jury the websites author claims that having the uncensored version would change the verdict as far as i can tell from the first couple pages the censored parts are concerning coupe which the child did not have there are some xrays showing that the child had mostly clear lungs which the author claims contradicts the autopsy there is a claim that the father was being profiled as a threat there is a report that seems accurate enough to me there is information to suggest that the family are sovereign citizens also known as being from sovereign or freedom group folks from this group tend to be antigovernment and antiestablishment and there are suspicions that they would typically be well armed and may feel the need to protect their homes adn family from any perceived threats as a result workers should proceed with caution i feel that given the fathers history with protests and the circumstances such a warning is not out of place the author conveniently leaves out that the parents had been advised by several people that the symptoms looked like meningitis and still did not take the child to a doctor if a lawyer determines that there was a problem with the trial then have at it but i dont think it will change the outcome also from the op its a hard thing to try to communicate that to a and a as to why mommy and daddy wont be around anymore its a little bit harder to explain to them how your negligence killed their brother
canada,removed,what so i dont take this shit seriously and i delete my account you need to get a life bruh the best part about closing and creating new accounts is that the tags never go away and i can still retain the amounts of times that ive downvoted your ass and im constantly reminded of how you are a huge fucking dick and a retard im winning youre losing way to seek validation through the internets

canada,removed,egalitarian doctrines maintain that all humans are equal in fundamental worth or social status according to the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy humans are not equal if you understand evolution you would know that humans were subject to the whim of evolution when separated geographically just like any other species on this planet this result is different groups or races of people who differ in iq athleticism predication for violence etc but you just keep believing we are all the same and its just a few bad apples as opposed to a radically different culture that would want to see you in a burqua and accompanied by a man at all times otherwise get a stonin

canada,removed,they are not reporting the ethnicity of the shooters the shooters were muslim
canada,removed,liberals be like give peace a chance smfh
canada,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
canada,removed,just heard on the police scanner that the two suspects in custody are syrian refugees who entered the nation just last week
canada,removed,then why did i see someone shooting one shooting one while i was protesting at the local range learn the fucking laws yourself before you decide to be an expert on them

canada,removed,the live feed sure went quiet once the possibility of nonwhite shooters came up
canada,removed,im betting these shooters are nonwhite
canada,removed,the attackers were muslim it seemed to me that they had a quebecois accent they started to fire and as they shot they yelled allahu akbar the bullets hit people that were praying
canada,removed,it seemed to me that they had a quebecois accent they started to fire and as they shot they yelled allahu akbar the bullets hit people that were praying
canada,removed,listen to these cold hard facts and better your understanding of the worldor you can just flippantly say its wrong because its the rebel because you dont care about broadening your understanding your choice
canada,removed,it seemed to me that they had a quebecois accent they started to fire and as they shot they yelled allahu akbar the bullets hit people that were praying
canada,removed,uhhhhhhh guys

canada,removed,anyone thinking the media is salivating over them being white christians with trump memorabilia plastered all over their apartments yet
canada,removed,trumps hatred caused this do you hear me trump voters you are responsibleforthis
canada,removed,youre a moron trying to save face and downplay your vile comments
canada,removed,why didnt the gun laws work
canada,removed,i bet the white man did this
canada,removed,ive never heard of a terrorist saying praise jesus before detonating his explosive vest
canada,removed,maybe also mention
canada,removed,your criteria for me missing the point entirely is extremely arbitrary im far more likely to be attacked by a person of my group because of the proximity and sample size which you muslim apologists yeah im not going to stop saying it conveniently ignore
canada,removed,there are different muslim sects that do not agree with each other
canada,removed,that is cause any religion that forces you to dresseat a certain way is mentally fucked
canada,removed,these numbers are irrational because
canada,removed,you fucking retard thats a parody twitter account
canada,removed,unfortunately they do this all the time look up how many bombing happen in iraq and syria in muslim markets i dont know much about it but there is a war within the muslim community as well it fucking sucks dude
canada,removed,i support trump and i say fry these fuckers
canada,removed,they can be nonviolent but their religion can teachpromote violence many including bill maher would agree that islam is worse than other religions which are also stupid with regards to violence gay rights womens rights etc
canada,removed,the liberal victimization is very strong on reddit
canada,removed,who says im not critical of the rebel i think they do some ok stuff but i dont think they can do no wrong and i havent given you any evidence of that those are just the numbers and theyre the numbers from a group that is actively trying to paint a rosy picture which makes the damning facts even more sad
canada,removed,they were muslim it seemed to me that they had a quebecois accent they started to fire and as they shot they yelled allahu akbar the bullets hit people that were praying
canada,removed,bomb the shit out of it
canada,removed,but the attackers were muslim it seemed to me that they had a quebecois accent they started to fire and as they shot they yelled allahu akbar the bullets hit people that were praying
canada,removed,i think its time for some common sense regulation on the right to practice religion religions of hate have no place in civil society
canada,removed,they were muslim it seemed to me that they had a quebecois accent they started to fire and as they shot they yelled allahu akbar the bullets hit people that were praying
canada,removed,a perfect example of normalizing hate and radicalizing people on reddit itself
canada,removed,it seemed to me that they had a quebecois accent they started to fire and as they shot they yelled allahu akbar the bullets hit people that were praying muslim
canada,removed,not after tonight
canada,removed,it seemed to me that they had a quebecois accent they started to fire and as they shot they yelled allahu akbar the bullets hit people that were praying

canada,removed,ive never heard of a terrorist saying praise jesus christ before detonating his explosive vest
canada,removed,down amirite
canada,removed,i knew trumps victory in the us would throw fuel on white nationalism but i had no idea just how quickly it would spread or how violent these people could be why are right wing whites the only mass shooters this is disgusting
canada,removed,it seemed to me that they had a quebecois accent they started to fire and as they shot they yelled allahu akbar the bullets hit people that were praying people who were praying lost their lives a bullet passed right over my head said the witness
canada,removed,its important for us to remember that no matter what anyone says this is the fault of white men
canada,removed,there is no muslim ban in the us you idiot
canada,removed,why must you show empathy fucking hell youre a pathetic excuse of a human being
canada,removed,there are people that dont like islam and online and veer close to calling for their murder or deportation less than a week ago a rcanada user urenegademinds replied to me saying that muslims should be killed as they add no value to canada then there are those that take that terrorist rhetoric and affirm their beliefs to actually carry out the attack they are however both responsible we dont let terrorist sympathizers off the hook as long as they dont commit the acts and we should equally not allow this sub to be used as a soap box for that dangerous rhetoric
canada,removed,theyre muslim not sure about them being syrian refugees though it seemed to me that they had a quebecois accent they started to fire and as they shot they yelled allahu akbar the bullets hit people that were praying
canada,removed,nothing was confirmed you fucking moron i could go out and yell allahu akbar right now even though im an atheist
canada,removed,it seemed to me that they had a quebecois accent they started to fire and as they shot they yelled allahu akbar the bullets hit people that were praying people who were praying lost their lives a bullet passed right over my head said the witness
canada,removed,that youre racist scum yah i got that dont forget to also shrug indifferently when white people die
canada,removed,heh when were you ever better than american you syrup slurping pieces of garbage
canada,removed,turns out its the canadians that are hateful bigots
canada,removed,confirmed shooter one samuèl hyde
canada,removed,wow you are thick no the executive order trump signed is not called the muslim ban it was given that name by liberals kind of like how the affordable health care act was coined obamacare by conservatives back in the day
canada,removed,yeah fuck trump and his supporters for being reasonable
canada,removed,cant blame trump for this on
canada,removed,from cbcca a quebecois accent a witness who asked to remain anonymous told cbcs frenchlanguage service radiocanada that two masked individuals entered the mosque it seemed to me that they had a quebecois accent they started to fire and they they shot they yelled allahu akbar the bullets hit people that were praying people who were praying lost their lives a bullet passed right over my head said the witness there were even kids there was even a threeyearold who was with his father
canada,removed,fake news guns are banned in canada
canada,removed,all evidence points to this being the act of a muslim shooters sorry to blow your narrative
canada,removed,um the shooter was muslim and yelled allahu akbar
canada,removed,the shooter was muslim
canada,removed,trudeau cant keep us safe i feel scared
canada,removed,alt right fucks will latch onto who ever says what they want american or not
canada,removed,we need stronger vetting to prevent these horrible crimes
canada,removed,guys we must wait if it is white we must think of ways to blame it on trump if it is a snackbar remember notallsnackbars
canada,removed,your pm is weak
canada,removed,and trudeau wants to let them in with open arms
canada,removed,blame trump not the muslims who committed the murders youre a pathetic coward
canada,removed,yet stuff like this stays up
canada,removed,the winds are changing
canada,removed,rapefugees welcome cant wait for the virtue signalling
canada,removed,or basically anywhere in the middle east
canada,removed,haha funny that turns out they were screaming god is great
canada,removed,i guess you agree with sharia law then or did you only read the few sentences that supported your position you wont listen to acts just your feeling no reason to continue talking to someone who is incapable of changing their minds when actual facts are presented good luck to you
canada,removed,wrong again muslims attacked their own
canada,removed,religion of peace strikes again
canada,removed,see if america had sticker gun laws wait this is canada
canada,removed,bashir altaweed and hassan matti
canada,removed,deus vault xd
canada,removed,especially when theyre nonwhite
canada,removed,the principle being coulters law
canada,removed,sharia law apologists jesus
canada,removed,early reports from the rcmp and eyewitnesses state that it was islamic terrorists shouting allahu akbar not alt right people or white supremacists
canada,removed,make your women wear a hijab and stop eating pork thank you
canada,removed,what kind of sick fuck attacks church goers that just want to pray the shooters were muslim as well
canada,removed,people want to make this about politics but its more than just that canada as a country has no redeeming qualities as it was built on the oppression of first nations and chinese labourers people want to blame the altright but its honestly the last cries of racist while people as they realize their inevitable decline canada is going to be better without them soon canada will be a fully diverse country with a truly progressive government without fascists to keep us down these deaths are tragic and we just remember them when you hear people argue in favor of fascism nationalism and freedom of speech theyve already lost we just need to protect our muslim brothers and sisters while the white men are scared
canada,removed,a possible shooter posted to before holy shit
canada,removed,you mean when bashir altaweed and hassan matti syrian refugees commit the attack you yell at trump xd justin is responsible for this attack
canada,removed,
canada,removed,
canada,removed,
canada,removed,people are saying these guys are radical islamists damn it
canada,removed,you can bet your ass if the guys name was bob smith this would have fueled the haters who already dominate this website
canada,removed,the shooters were shouting allahu akbar though
canada,removed,can we finally start calling this what it is radical fascist terrorism
canada,removed,says its islamists who did it
canada,removed,the daily beast who the fuck reads this shit
canada,removed,thats what happens when chelsea clinton is on the board of directors culture starts at the top
canada,removed,i was hoping this was a live stream of the shooting sad
canada,removed,hahah fail
canada,removed,probably done by isis
canada,removed,coulters law
canada,removed,a bunch of trump brigaders are releasing bullshit without evidence hoping to sway opinion before the facts come out
canada,removed,at what point did you forget we have been at war with the muslim world for years
canada,removed,coulters law is in effect
canada,removed,trump pence and bannon were the shooters
canada,removed,weird that theres no description of the shooters coulters law
canada,removed,you know just the other day somebody was telling me that we have to be scared of muslims because islam is a barbaric ideology that doesnt agree with our values and might try to undermine our tolerant and civilized society this right here is why i dont take that argument seriously
canada,removed,they wanted it to be white supremacists to further the anti trump atmosphere
canada,removed,nobody cares
canada,removed,lets be honest here the last week has been all about racereligion in regards to national security and terrorism and now that its happened yet again you think people are just going to ignore it you cant just ignore the glaring irony here america restricts travel from countries loaded with terrorists canada publicly says youre more than welcome to come here america has no issues since and canada gets shot to shit by muslims within days the math is pretty self solving here
canada,removed,the live thread is posting rumors suggesting its likely white people rumors that a pigs head was sent to the mosque in the past but rumors suggesting the suspects were likely muslim shouts of allahu akbar are not allowed how about all the unconfirmed bullshit is kept out of the livestream cause right now it looks like there is an agenda at work
canada,removed,how long have the suspects been in custody now i feel coulters law might be coming into effect
canada,removed,bashir altaweed and hassan matti syrian refugees and recent arrivals were the attackers
canada,removed,that seems like the last place an islamic terrorist would attack not really muslims hate each other almost as much as they hate nonmuslims
canada,removed,oops forgot to add that they were yelling allahu akbar while committing the shootings also what i first thought of httpwwwsatporgsatporgtpcountriespakistandatabasesectattackhtm
canada,removed,oh come on everyone knows when you fake attackers you blame sam hyde actual names of the attackers is bashir altaweed and hassan matti
canada,removed,bashir altaweed and hassan matti such quebecois names but hey its totally the white peoples fault
canada,removed,sadly the quebec city shootings which just killed people answers your question bashir altaweed and hassan matti two syrians refugees are charged with mass murder
canada,removed,or youre just an assmad rightwinger who doesnt feel good about right wing terrorists attacking people again because it makes you and your ideology look bad
canada,removed,fuck your false news bullshit they were islamic you fucking twit
canada,removed,coulters law in effect
canada,removed,evidence such as the fact that they hang out in a subreddit called raltright where they routinely talk about destroying democracy murdering jews and shouting heil hitler its not subtle the ancient evil has returned in full force
canada,removed,this is americas fault
canada,removed,they shouted allah snack bar and opened fired according to eye witness accounts right now looks like this was a radical islamist attack
canada,removed,youre surprised your leader literally just two days ago
canada,removed,bashir altaweed and hassan matti
canada,removed,bashir altaweed and hassan matti the attackers were syrian refugees to canada
canada,removed,because the candian media is liberal as fuck and reporting about terrorists is against there islam is peace narrative
canada,removed,from bbc local newspaper le soleil said it had obtained information that one of the suspects was a with a quebec name and one had an automatic weapon in his possession police however have not released such details
canada,removed,waiting for someone to spin this into trumps fault
canada,removed,i think its justified to push an agenda of anti radicalism safer vetting processes less terrorism in our streets why is it not acceptable to use as an example the more we just ignore this and grieve over it the more it will happen actions need to be taken to prevent more of this
canada,removed,muh refugees
canada,removed,just checking in from the mosque shooting live thread so hows all that fun diversity working out for ya you welcome them in with open arms and it only took them what two days to start shooting your country to shit have fun kids after a few years of this shit going on under your noses maybe youll see why we finally hot fed up and did it
canada,removed,stop being fascist and well stop calling you fascist
canada,removed,weird how the witnesses reported a strong quebecois accent when the shooters entered the country just last week
canada,removed,the few times ive seen people link to the altright sub on reddit i was surprised at how many canadian white supremacists there seemed to be ive never encountered outright racism in canada before ive visited very frequently over the years since i used to live by the border so its been pretty surprising how much hate there is
canada,removed,poor you you dont understand why anyone might hate muslims however irrationally read the damn news
canada,removed,like from the ira
canada,removed,i wonder how you can determine someone has a quebecois accent when theyre speaking arabic
canada,removed,aaaaandits muslims
canada,removed,it was syrian refugees who got to canada less than a week ago
canada,removed,you can thank trump and his fascist party for all the violence that is to come from now on i think anyone that shows up to a protest with a maga hat one deserves to get the shit beat out of them for still supporting pure hate and bigotry think of the red hat like the red band nazis wore i think they are mimicking them on purpose anyways
canada,removed,could have been workplace violence
canada,removed,muslims have an amazing capacity for hatred even against muslims who believe in a slightly different version of islam
canada,removed,the terrorists were apparently muslims doesnt fit their narrative
canada,removed,stop avoiding the fucking debate i said that in north america its rarely more than one shooter even if media claims more and then you just started being a dumbass when you realized i would be right fuck off
canada,removed,the left go on the attack
canada,removed,the real question is how your clown of a prime minister is going to turn this into political brownie points maybe visit the scene draped in an lgbt flag i cant wait to hear his speak much about the religion of peace
canada,removed,wow at first i was all oh no it has to be some white supremacist thank god it was the usual bunch of muslims
canada,removed,they have to make sure it fits their extreme altleft narrative first give them time to make something up
canada,removed,where theres islam
canada,removed,youre demented lol
canada,removed,but the people who got shot actually won according to trudeau
canada,removed,they were muslim terrorists
canada,removed,being muslim is not a race retard
canada,removed,youre saying you werent insinuating that this was an attack done by the altright because it sounded like it was so i dont know what you think youre defending maybe speak clearly next time dumbass
canada,removed,cbc making sure its not other muslims first
canada,removed,shut the fuck up you piece of shit and shove your fucking politics up your ass this isnt the time to get on your fucking soapbox fucking shame on you you piece of shit
canada,removed,they had a quebecois accent but they were muslim
canada,removed,
canada,removed,lefties grand standing about trump and islamophobia are going to feel stupid if it turns out to be jihadists
canada,removed,grow the fuck up and understand evil is everywhere and dont blame trump for this
canada,removed,lol worth every second of it
canada,removed,enjoy d
canada,removed,picture of one of the suspects apparently
canada,removed,whats more concerning is the rise of the regressive left and their contempt for white people i could see this being a false flag attack
canada,removed,picture of the suspect
canada,removed,my personal opinion is that if the shooters names were claude and dion we would know
canada,removed,fascist scum
canada,removed,fascist scum
canada,removed,the refugees that did this is this a trick question
canada,removed,trump banned muslims death stalks canada now
canada,removed,i wouldnt overdo it they dont do much when muslims slaughter nonmuslims like at the gay nightlcub in orlando or in the truck attack that killed over people in nice france or the recent attack on the christmas market in germany
canada,removed,there was a shooting in a zurich mosque in december injuring it started out on twitter blaming white swiss but it turned out to be violence amongst themselves just look at the mid east they are always killing each other sunni shia so itll either be that or white canadians proving that a diverse society is not strong but prone to ethnic and religious conflict the strongest most stable societies are homogenous like japan
canada,removed,a livestreamed mass shooting damn technology really has gone too far
canada,removed,but he is letting more of the same in right
canada,removed,front de libération du québec strikes again right when you least expect it
canada,removed,us cia ops sent by the donald
canada,removed,as much as you anyways want to blame muslims it fucking isnt
canada,removed,im sure people will be able to spare the seconds it took to read the post
canada,removed,looks like another example of christian terrorist extremism
canada,removed,first shooter has been idd as samuel hydeaux year old white supremacist
canada,removed,fuck you
canada,removed,an antiterrorism unit has now been deployed and is on scene via ctv news you mean an afterterrorism unit
canada,removed,rednecks desperately trying to make this into a muslim v muslim shooting was it sunni or shia tho fuck out of here your bigotry is proof enough that some of you will go to these lengths
canada,removed,its time to stop fluffy tweets and start acting either the government comes down hard on quebec fascists or the quebec people need to do it
canada,removed,coulters law
canada,removed,ah the buzzfeed method
canada,removed,everyone blames this on trump no matter who the perpetrators were
canada,removed,are there any live news streams
canada,removed,announce the suspects and stop the speculation one singular source is claiming white people everyone else is piggybacking off that source but another source said that the suspects were known to the community since they were little kids making it unlikely that they are nonmuslim
canada,removed,trying to confirm they have the white guys
canada,removed,allah akbars
canada,removed,tfw kebab removes itself
canada,removed,we already have gotta stop watching the tv dude theyre just showing soros paid protestors sure some idiots get in there but these riots are coordinated and financed
canada,removed,one of the two men arrested in connection with the terrorist attack in a quebec mosque would be of quebec origin and the other would be of arab origin according to information obtained by félix séguin from our investigative office latest news
canada,removed,one of the two men arrested in connection with the terrorist attack in a quebec mosque would be of quebec origin and the other would be of arab origin according to information obtained by félix séguin from our investigative office latest news
canada,removed,one of the two men arrested in connection with the terrorist attack in a quebec mosque is of quebec origin and the other arab well shit i cant wait for the spin on this especially after trudeau already called it terrorism
canada,removed,just google translate it also top feed at worldnews live thread gonna be a doozy for trump this week big league always right
canada,removed,looks like one of the shooters is arab its a false flag killing their own to drum up sympathy
canada,removed,sigh it doesnt even matter who did it trump is going to spin it anyway he can to justify more fear mongering and bigotry
canada,removed,nope i actually want to know religious affiliation and it sounds like its turning out how we all knew it would one homegrown terrorist radicalized in canada and an imported terrorist
canada,removed,muslims are an integral part of our nation and we wouldnt be as great without them well you wouldnt have had this shooting
canada,removed,what an arab how can i blame trump now
canada,removed,in case this isnt just an alt of the same fascist scum were coming for you too
canada,removed,your mistake was electing someone who values foreigners safety over that of your own countrymen
canada,removed,and the other one was an arab
canada,removed,like they wouldnt speak their own language
canada,removed,to the perpetrators we are all canadian when you harm other citizens youre not bringing down those people you are harming yourself your family your neighbours we are a beautiful mosaic of cultures and you are trying to paint it white shame on you may you realize your actions have horrible consequences and spend the rest of your lives regretting every decision based on hatred may you have nightmares and flashbacks and grieve for your victims may you fully grasp the message you have sent and agonise over every step you took and shot you fired may you understand that instead of helping your country you have irreversibly wounded it at a time when it was scared and vulnerable
canada,removed,why arent they speaking arabic then
canada,removed,the next crusade tbh friend deus vult
canada,removed,intentionally not revealing details on suspect means only one thing its a couple of muslim teens who were radicalized and its all our fault for not being liberal and tolerant enough
canada,removed,how about not using a national tragedy to take jabs at the opposing political side fucktard
canada,removed,maybe he should think about the families of the slain before he opens his borders to third world savages get this piece of shit out before canada looks like germanistan
canada,removed,it was also likely to be a muslim on muslim attack
canada,removed,still dancing around the real question who did it they keep saying this unity shit because it was radical muslims if it were white people theyd come right out and say it and condemn them and clearly it was the muslim community that was attacked because the perpetrators were also muslim pro level dancing going on here lots of empty speech here theyre going to turn an attack by radical muslims into a white guilt trip unbelievable
canada,removed,rip to the victims one of the two men arrested in connection with the terrorist attack in a quebec mosque would be of quebec origin and the other would be of arab origin according to information obtained by félix séguin from our investigative office probably a homegrown frenchcanadian terrorist teamed up with a refugee to attack a rival mosque because their flavor of islam was absolutely haram
canada,removed,because you let in thousands of blood thirsty savages tbh fam pretty obvious
canada,removed,one of the two men arrested in connection with the terrorist attack in a quebec mosque is of quebec origin and the other arab could it be an example of radicals targeting innocent muslims because they were seen as westernized this is common form of attack in the middle east where moderates are attacked by hardliners
canada,removed,coulters law is in full effect here
canada,removed,a dirt poor country factions financing terrorism for capital gain and a whole lot of money is how this happens these didnt bump into each other off the plane theyve been indoctrinated well before this attack took place
canada,removed,holy shit this delusion is amazing
canada,removed,stop it you shill
canada,removed,welcometocanada
canada,removed,the officials dodge on the question concerning rising tensions with the muslim community is telling intramuslim violence is seemingly more likely as others have said may be radicals that saw this mosque as too westernized
canada,removed,coulters law
canada,removed,it wasnt like that when trump supporters and evil white nazis were being blamed only when it was confirmed islamic terrorism did the thread get cleaned up
canada,removed,useless press conference from a useless premier of a useless province glad it was muslims though
canada,removed,fair enough fam keep doing gods work
canada,removed,well theyre equal opportunity killers at least cant say theyre bigoted
canada,removed,canadian coverup
canada,removed,good good believe in the multiculti bullshit suck trudeaus schlong and go to work tomorrow and talk to coworkers about solidarity and go lay some wreaths in front of that mosque make sure to post pics on zuckerbergs data mining site youll make a real difference
canada,removed,look its quite simple were the attackers muslim or white canadians never mind coming out with cliches typical politicians
canada,removed,ama request redditors who have been virtue signaling about open borders for the past hours
canada,removed,one of the two men arrested in connection with the terrorist attack in a quebec mosque is of quebec origin and the other arab sectarian violence fucking called it isnt it fucking brilliant were importing these conflicts into our own societies
canada,removed,maybe justin can go take some selfies with the leaders of the muslim community tomorrow tweet about solidarity throw some loonies at some coloreds and call it a day eh
canada,removed,the two arrested suspects are muslims muslims kill muslims in middle east and now they do the same in canada you must be respectful of their issues with each other and learn to adjust and live with these attacks while they sort it out
canada,removed,i wouldnt be surprised if trudeau asked them to be tight lipped he is definitely going to be concerned with his muslim trump rhetoric these past two days and also his approval rating
canada,removed,but you forget these muslims are literally subhuman and their lives are worth nothing
canada,removed,as a conservative this event is shameful this is not the canada we ought to be what exactly did you expect you took in thousands of members of an extremely violent religion that have been committing horrific attacks against each other for decades their entire book from the ground up is a rip off of the bible with alterations made by a warlord who had sex with a nine year old child canada has imported so many muslims they are now carrying out terrorist attacks against each other canada now had a sectarian muslim terrorist attack in a major city the primary victims of muslim conflicts are typically other muslims with jews atheists and christians typically after thoughts
canada,removed,love this country political correctness ftfy
canada,removed,radical islam
canada,removed,if it goes against the liberal narrative lips will be tight as fuck
canada,removed,in its the religion of peace
canada,removed,it is now being officially reported that at least one of the shooters was arab born
canada,removed,nothing reliable is reporting that at all
canada,removed,its definitely home grown terrorism and its probably secondgeneration youths and dont you dare forget that this is all your faulttrumps faultharplers fault for provoking them
canada,removed,did you vote trudeau
canada,removed,you only say this because now we know that the attackers were not white you fucking hypocrite
canada,removed,yeah not white and one of them is a refuge
canada,removed,how sad that you feel embarrassment over the comments and usernames of strangers on a message board even sadder that you had to virtue signal this fact and seek validation about it
canada,removed,a thing to consider theres an army base pretty close to quebec city we might be dealing with veterans theres a farright group called la meute which was started by a veteran to be clear i have no information its a suspicion the only gunnuts i know in quebec are veterans
canada,removed,both shooters are muslims one of them is a canadian muslim the other one has an arab background just wait for the information to come out keep bashing trumps immigration ban and welcome trudeaus wir shaffen das
canada,removed,given one of the shooter is moroccan we can get rid of narrative that it was trump immigration related incident
canada,removed,yeah but it is looking more and more like muslims did this to other muslims they are bringing their wars with them into our country why would you want even more of them to come here and cause more violence
canada,removed,oh look its two muslims and no im not pointing it out because hurrr i hate muslims im pointing it out because i want to know how many people who were already blaming quebec nationalists are going to retract their statement and apologize thanks to the mods for removing the finger pointing that was well done on your part
canada,removed,because muslims kill muslims please you must learn the way of the world allowing your feelings to dictact your every action keeps you blind
canada,removed,i doubt it angry muslims attacking a canadian mosque because they couldnt get into the us would only show the measures were the right ones to take
canada,removed,its what they do its their religion
canada,removed,forget the prayer mat just give them your daughters
canada,removed,hi visitor from reurope here any actual info on the perps so much bullshit out there srs fam
canada,removed,religion of peace
canada,removed,the longer the shooters go unnamed the more likely it is that they are going to be north african or arab its just how the media game works these days
canada,removed,gotta hide the fact that the terrorists are muslim again
canada,removed,then stop importing radical islam
canada,removed,if anything trump probably just saved of his own citizens from being murdered by imposing the immigration ban oh but yeah im sure canada wont see any negative effects at all by taking in people from the countries that america thinks are too dangerous
canada,removed,right after canada welcomes in muslims publicly lol you cant help these people
canada,removed,omg dont fish for upvotes in a thread like this come on
canada,removed,shooter confirmed to be known black supremacist sam hyde he is known to local police for black panther and pegida activities
canada,removed,if they are islamic terrorists from one of the countries that america just imposed an immigration ban upon and they just came to canada from one of those countries intent on murdering islamic canadianss then yes its useful in that case we should also call for an immigration ban from those countries to save the lives of islamic canadians most islamic violence is done against islamic people by islamic people we have a duty to protect our citizens against violent immigrants
canada,removed,i know that its not really very cool to blame anyone for this but im just gonna go out on a limb and say its put ins fault trying to get canada to follow americas lead into a war against china to take over their manufacturing supremacy that or obama amiright
canada,removed,the most likely scenario was that these guys were radical muslims and they didnt like that the other muslims in the mosque down the street were actually nice to people it could also have been a sunni vs shia issue we dont really know we just dont enough information
canada,removed,as muslim man i hope is not a muslim brothers but a white mans shooter if it is muslim violence it will fuel bigotry pls be white shooter
canada,removed,sticky post this thread is now locked due to free speech seriously disclaimer were mods and we have lives outside of this so we have to shut it down
canada,removed,did trudeau bring this on with his canada welcomes you such an amateur politician
canada,removed,it is not terrorism it is people confused of islams message if you are offered peace to do something you will do it but that is not the way of islam islam is equality even to homosexuals we help them be cured not kill them there is a difference
canada,removed,trudeau will be on full drama teacher mode tomorrow
canada,removed,exactly what i said mass killing doesnt necessarily mean terrorism but youve got to love the morons on either side jumping to conclusions the morons on the left automatically used this as an incident to blame donald trump its now looking like the shooters were muslim or at least non white arab totally destroyed the narrative if they were refugees like some bs reports are saying itll make trudeau and those morons protesting at jfk airport look like total fools
canada,removed,trudeau called isis cowards so edgy

canada,removed,coulters law the longer that it takes the media to identify the shooter the less likely he is white and christian
canada,removed,its an attack on canadians by islamic extremists i dont think a toddler would have trouble with the concept seems it has to be spelled out using crayon to government officials and the media repeatedly and still nothing changes
canada,removed,you were sheltered then you let them in
canada,removed,islam isnt misunderstood it demands theocratic rule for a muslim supremacist government thats all of nonmuslims need to know to also know they dont like it

canada,removed,you think canadians shot up a mosque get out of here
canada,removed,
canada,removed,so the same day this moron calls for more refugees a couple of muzzies shoot up a mosqueliberals dont operate in reality it seems
canada,removed,i think people on the left are actually starting to hope that muslims get gunned down instead of the other way around so they can push their agenda sad
canada,removed,look who it is someone deleting truthful comments and providing alternative facts
canada,removed,within only one year of promoting equality to islam in canada we have a man shouting allahu ackbar and shooting people dead canada almost never suffers from such violence i hope people remember this at the polls vote against islam we cant allow our country to turn into the hellhole theyve plunged themselves into
canada,removed,moroccan arab and a convert to islam who shouted allahu akbar keep living your life by telling yourself comforting lies you stupid moron lmao this is confirmed by authorities themselves but hey man maybe the terrorists will have a change of heart right right uhh guys should we ask the six dead muslims you dont live in reality

canada,removed,we are canadian you bring dogmatic practice with no real value
canada,removed,because history shows multicultural empires working out so great for everyone involved
canada,removed,do they have the shooter i didnt see it mentioned in the article normally when they omit the shooter it because he is muslim surely they wouldnt be making a stink if he was
canada,removed,caliphate broadcasting corporation spewing fake news again
canada,removed,kia poster
canada,removed,fukin arite mane shoot em sand monkerinos
canada,removed,possibly just another case of muslims killing each other shias and sunnis have been slaughtering each other for more than a thousand years islam can lead to violence very quickly
canada,removed,mohammed
canada,removed,diversity is a code word for whit genocide
canada,removed,inspired how what stupid things
canada,removed,one of the suspects is named as alexandre bissonette just looked up someone with the same name same age as suspect named that goes to laval one of their likes is marie le pen
canada,removed,wow a terrorist attack on muslims by other muslims hopefully now all of us including muslims can band together against islamic extremism were all victims of their hateful ideology
canada,removed,people in a is not too much dipshit
canada,removed,blah bs young ppl can get rentals pretty easily
canada,removed,i started yelling allah akhbar mohamed jihad after watching team america
canada,removed,coming from someone excusing age discrimination i couldnt fucking care less
canada,removed,both self identified muslims religion of pieces
canada,removed,i think im on the facebook of the alexandre dude nothing on his facebook seems to indicate he was on the jihad tip
canada,removed,vote for a politician who plans to control the influx of violent extremists into the country
canada,removed,send them all back
canada,removed,you are probably a piece of shit yourself you do realize that
canada,removed,youre a real dick
canada,removed,you are so deluded youve flown right past funny beyond sad and pitiable to a state i dont even have a word for
canada,removed,shhh you gonna get banned if you think for yourself on this subreddit
canada,removed,you will swallow this load of a comment within the next few hours i guarantee it
canada,removed,of course you wont you seem the type to solider on no matter how stupid
canada,removed,only left wing propaganda on nights of tragedy man you got to read the rules
canada,removed,the longer it takes to release the name of a suspect the greater the chance of ethnicity goes up if it takes more than hours its a muslim
canada,removed,its because it was an islamic terror attack and they wouldnt want anyone talking about that the religion that must not be offended can not be talked about
canada,removed,yes but theyre doing it for religious reasons islamic ones
canada,removed,i wish people would read the united states of jihad describes how cases like orlando happen and i would bet this is similar with a new converts radicalization
canada,removed,not everyone uses a browser that automatically records and uploads everything you do to google
canada,removed,and they never will now that its come out there was a muslim shooter its against the narrative cant have judd looking like the total fucking idiot he is in front of the whole world odds are this event will never even be mentioned on cbc or the mainstream media again
canada,removed,why do you guys have a victim hierarchy if it was scientologists conducting all of these attacks would you still play mental gymnastics
canada,removed,its only racist if white people say it
canada,removed,the more stellar news organizations are already reporting it as fucking white males and trump to blame and using an image of bissonnet
canada,removed,trump for prime minister
canada,removed,i dont need to argue against absurdities that frees me to be sarcastic
canada,removed,brampton smells just like youd expect it to climb onto a public bus and breathe in the diversity i am not even making a joke here sadly
canada,removed,the white guy alexandre bissonnette is muslim if you check his facebook he seems antimuslim his likes include israeli defense forces marine le pen richard dawkins donald j trump and in a lot of his pictures its about megadeth drinking winebeer and partying
canada,removed,so almost no terrorist attacks at all compared to other countries save my comment because i guarantee you it will be ten fold in the next few decades if we continue coddling islamists and refugee programs get ready to talk about this every third month
canada,removed,it takes time to create spin they had a gold mine when it was a white person shooting up a mosque but its a little hard to make refugees look good when one is also the shooter
canada,removed,boooooooring take your anticanadian antiislamic antiimmigrant stances to someone who cares to argue with meaningless absurdities founded in juvenile xenophobia
canada,removed,peacefull muslims are irrelevant when were talking about how islam is an ideology that is irreconcilable with western values
canada,removed,radical islamic terror
canada,removed,diversity was their strength
canada,removed,that would be the biggest overreaction ever
canada,removed,last i checked christians dont shout allahu akbar when they slaughter people i strongly suspect hes a muslim convert
canada,removed,so quick to call it a terrorist act but if it was done against whites they would either call it workplace violence or violence or hooliganism or best of all call it mental issues mods dont be fascists and delete this comment it states a thought that it depends against who the terror act is done before its either labeled as terrorist act or mental issues
canada,removed,i hope youre on medication
canada,removed,friend you should see a doctor you may have the retarded
canada,removed,quran soon shall we cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers for that they joined companions with allah for which he had sent no authority
canada,removed,i look forward to your statement
canada,removed,all those damn racists that dares connect the dots they are not supposed to notice how the crushing majority of terrorists acts are done by muslims damnit white people are the problem not muslims
canada,removed,if calling you on your bullshit is extreme then i can live with that
canada,removed,moroccan origin you can have em all trudeau be the merkel of north america
canada,removed,and just about every rapper thats made an album its undeniable the influence music and entertainment have on our youth and culture according to your pc logic anyone who use the nword should be denied employment—so no more acting jobs for denzel that will make the world a better place why not have a list of banned words in the criminal code that would make things so much simpler obviously the crazy coot is being targeted because shes white its only racist if white people say it
canada,removed,has christianity had reformations yes has islam never can it no httpsmyoutubecomwatchvfgsrnmzxeuy

canada,removed,
canada,removed,would you bet a testicle on that

canada,removed,lmfao you guys are both douchebags politicizing this that quickly to fit your little life view is pathetic
canada,removed,they started to fire and as they shot they yelled allahu akbar nonmuslims have no interest in killing muslims however muslims have a long history including all of last year all around the globe killing other muslims for not being muslim the right way
canada,removed,islam is crazy yo

canada,removed,facebook profile likes of alexander bissonnette
canada,removed,i meant the other guy was as in the terrorists were a muslim and a male feminist
canada,removed,a guy named mohammed yelled allahu ackbar before killing a bunch of peoplei guess well never know the motivation
canada,removed,the downfall of the west is allowing postmodernist moral relativism to not call a spade a spade and realize that islamic terror is an actual threat and people who come from places where islamic terror occurs predominately should be held at an arms length
canada,removed,alex is the only suspect now so it still holds up cuz hes the homosexual one
canada,removed,chill fam police said the arab guy isnt a suspect anymore it was alexandre bisonnette case closed fam
canada,removed,moderate muslims were targeted for death by extremist muslims a rival extremist mosque radicalized their group into thinking that these moderates were apostates see this vid for a statement from the targeted mosque httpsmyoutubecomwatchfeatureyoutubeveabpinqytus
canada,removed,im not trolling habibi
canada,removed,anybody else surprised that this kyle guy isnt banned
canada,removed,its because he was sexually confused now its because he was gay not because he was religiously motivated i guess muslims are higher up on the victim ladder than gays now which is funny because one throws the other off rooftops lol
canada,removed,
canada,removed,
canada,removed,
canada,removed,only one suspect
canada,removed,httpimgurcomaszrgu from his facebook likes profile let the ideal speculation and blame begin again
canada,removed,reported
canada,removed,electronicintifadanet fam
canada,removed,good trudeau needs to use this as a justification for finally cracking down on whites their attempts to harm canadian diversity will only continue to get worse now that trump is empowering the from across the border
canada,removed,keep trying to confuse people it will surely distract from the fact that a white trump fan killed muslims in a mosque feel free to call this fake news too
canada,removed,hahaha i spent hours here talking about in those situations how of the fist information coming out is bullshit trolls from rthedonald kept invading rcanada saying it was a muslim attack
canada,removed,marrying first cousins
canada,removed,make no mistake america we are dealing with a misogynist oppressive scapegoating gaslighting strawmanning lying cheat he is reading out of the dictatorship playbook we havent seen a threat like this to our democracy since our democracy is beginning to crumble into a dictatorship we have to stand up now do you hear me america
canada,removed,proving trumps point one atrocity at a time
canada,removed,so whites alcraqa has to be stopped in its roots
canada,removed,was also saying the muslim guy who was released as innocent was antigay also claims he has insiders at rcmp when hes only a year old student also he has a very homophobic tone to everything he is saying also claimed thousands a month are murdered by idf but abandoned the debate when questioned for sources hes also calling on antifa a group that wears all masks and all black to destroy property and assault people tldr he wants to blame gays
canada,removed,not to mention that the idf has muslims who chose to enlist idf has apostate traitors not muslims
canada,removed,the pmo wouldve had all the information available before trudeau came out and called it a terrorist attack i dont believe trudeau wouldve called it terrorism if a mohammad would have been involved they knew then it was just one white guy so why let the media and general public run with the there was a muslim involved i think at least part of it was so they could turn around and say look at all those racists islamophobia is of enormous concern islam is unfairly criticized they manipulated the information so theyd have a little more ammunition to curtail our freedom of expression to paint all who criticize religious idealogies as intolerant racists
canada,removed,deport send him back
canada,removed,there were two attackers
canada,removed,do your self an favor while in a washroom just after big turn around and take a deep breath through the nose what may surprise you that that your shit smell as well

canada,removed,wat
canada,removed,reminds me of our little bitch dylan roof
canada,removed,dont forget its only the altright that lumps everybody into one category those racist white males
canada,removed,this is so sad that it happened here canada has had way more terrorism of all types over the years than people recognize i think it is because of our cultural values that we literally do not believe that it happens here
canada,removed,shouted allahu akbar while shooting accomplice name is mohamed khadir
canada,removed,who said it the shooters or people praying grasping at straws eh face it dude this is just another muslim terror attack its certainly not the first and thanks to people like you it wont be the last either
canada,removed,what ever happened to not giving these idiots publicity the liberals dropped that idea pretty quick
canada,removed,chill trump lover no need to be mad fam
canada,removed,better than trucks of tolerance and gropes of peace
canada,removed,i read this one last night a witness who asked to remain anonymous told radiocanada that two masked individuals entered the mosque it seemed to me that they had a québécois accent they started to fire and as they shot they yelled allahu akbar the bullets hit people that were praying people who were praying lost their lives a bullet passed right over my head
canada,removed,the suspect is now gonna be mad rich im in the wrong industry
canada,removed,weird his birth certificate has the following entry biological father fidel castro pierre trudeau
canada,removed,mohamed khadir who is of moroccan heritage you fucking white male oh wait
canada,removed,he is a québec guy yes but he is of a muslim background
canada,removed,looks like canada has their own sadistic racist here much like dylan roof in south carolina although bissonnettes target was muslims instead of blacks like dylan roofshame canada doesnt have the death penalty
canada,removed,the racists desperate to demonize muslims here yesterday were so cringy man and could have put peoples lives in danger mods please be more stringent with allowing names to be posted if god forbid something like this happens again httpimgurcomaubgxf
canada,removed,according to his now archived facebook page hes a fan of marine le pen front national donald trump the late rob ford the israeli army a page called united with israel george w bush john mccain mathieu bockcôté
canada,removed,you are engaging in illegal discrimination
canada,removed,youre very wrong i thought that too because i kept hearing the term thrown around raltright is real and very delusional
canada,removed,today rmetacanada finally jumped the shark and they will eat so much crow itll be an endangered species
canada,removed,ether way it all comes back to our pm and his irresponsible ways fuck you seriously
canada,removed,lmfao you are really trying to say this kid listened to trump and leitch and thats why he commited these acts you are as bad as the worst white supremacist trump supporter i have seen if not worse you mine as well say the ndp is responsible because he liked their page on fb as well or dominos is responsible because he posted a dominos ad and said he wanted some earlier this year youre a fucking idiot
canada,removed,in prison he should be treated like one of muhammad little boys
canada,removed,you assume everyone would agree with an idiot such as yourself placing that type of blame on trump or leitch in a horrible attack such as this is as bad as the worst most racist right wing nut job blaming muslims when they thought it was a muslim attacker congratulations you are as shameful and despicable as a white supremacist
canada,removed,no proof i havent dna tested this guy but looking at the pics available of him its pretty obvious hes of mixed race not that it matters
canada,removed,no i blame the ideology that trump preaches for this for the bigotry of donald trump same way i blame the fucking nazis for their crimes against the jews you fucking stupid idiot
canada,removed,probably the same odds as being involved in a terrorist attack
canada,removed,rmeta has still got top voted headlines naming the witness as a suspect is this a violation of reddit terms of service can the sub be shut down for this
canada,removed,bissonnette is the only suspect and the other individual was a witness this should give the retards in meta brain infarctions g
canada,removed,okay so literally an hour ago bissonnette was deemed a muslim convert and there was at least three shooters minimum everything about it has been stripped down there is no details about his family his friends all his pictures are of him at his current age alone doing something pedestrian like playing chess no facebook no twitter no social media presence whatsoever despite the fact that they talked about it in detail on every news outlet there is no video evidence nobody knows any of the victims personally okay so does anyone else find all of this a bit fishy i cant be the only one who thinks this is extremely suspicious will be interesting to see if this develops any further something tells me it wont
canada,removed,to be fair his brothers a muslim so if you were referring to alexandre its fact the rumour about justin is that he took the official ceremony to convert although justin identifies as christian so that is all that matters really hes christian regardless of if muslims claim him as their own
canada,removed,funny how trump is the only like you mention he also liked marine le pen john mccain israel defense force united with israel president george w bush the canadian new democratic party and ndp leader jack layton so is your neglect to mention that his likes spanned the spectrum a lack of information intentionally withholding information or laziness youre too much of a buffoon to realize there are no sides everyone freaking loses a mentally deficient individual because sane people do not kill other people did something horrible to other individuals and there is no real clue as to his motives you have decided it has to be trump but what if its not do you care what his motives were does someone elses rhetoric absolve him of the choice he made do you hold the same contempt for those that tortured a disabled person simply for being white and allegedly supporting trump your pompous finger pointing is part of the dang problem
canada,removed,tva nouvelles used a screenshot of it in their
canada,removed,i wonder if the left will try to blame some imaginary mental illness for this attack like they do every single time a muslim commits terrorism

canada,removed,how does what someone elses birth certificate negate your own the legal role has not changed just the name of that role to be neutral at this point i have to believe you are insanely stupid and your political position should be discarded with the rest of the chaffextremeoutlayinginexplicable views the birth certificate is not a feeling document it says nothing about your relationship to your kids other than your legal status its not an affirmation of your role in your childs life it is a legal document
canada,removed,the purpose of unfccc conference is to take photos of our glorious leader and other uneducated ppl telling us the truth about climate change since naysayers are incapable of knowledge inviting them is redundant so a ban is appropriate trudeau akbar death to the non believers

canada,removed,chill on the capitalisation its not necessary marxistssocialist love to say well i would be a better then those guys before because they didnt do marxismsocialism right nono youre misinterpreting what im saying they did it right they surely implemented socialist and communist ideas but the point is that not every socialist idea is a good one nor is every communist idea certain implementations of socialist ideologies will work well in certain situations eg paved highways in northern ontario whereas others will not stalinism in ukraine thats not to say this socialism is better than that socialism no no no not what im saying at all certain forms of socialism will work in certain situations as does capitalism there is a balance you think we have a democracy in canada lol thats funny the only saving grace for canada is that we are close in proximity to the greatest democracy on earth which wouldnt stand for a socialist totalitarian state as a neighbour ok so you think canada is a dictatorship of a political party which just fyi would be called a dictatorship sure im curious how you think america is all that different in terms of democratic freedoms americas political system is extremely similar to ours the executive branch varies greatly but in terms of democractic freedoms there really isnt too much of a difference individuals in both nations are relatively free to pursue office and individuals of both nations are relatively free to vote for who they believe should be in office i justi dont get it how is america the greatest democracy but in your eyes canada isnt even one i dont get it our politics are so similar if your whole definition and apex argument of socialism is healthcare it perfectly exemplifies the ignorance of a marxistsocialist ideology no no its certainly not the apex argument healthcare is not the endallbeall of socialism i dont really think its appropriate to be making apex arguments off of anecdotal evidence roads healthcare educationthere are a lot of socialist ideas that i enjoy but youre entirely correct that none of them should be used as arguments for the absolute greatness of socialism there is no free anything in canada especially healthcare totally true but that statement isnt hurting my wallet when i go to the hospital regardless of whether its free or not thanks to nationalised healthcare when i break my foot i dont go into debt you cant say the same for more capitaliststyled healthcare systems such as americas your lack of world experience paints you as an arrogant entitled canadian fool that has zero knowledge of world history just to be clear you dont know anything of my world experience you dont even know if im canadian you assumptive fuck i wouldnt bother replying to this post im not going to entertain this argument any further youve shown yourself to be an asshat by insulting my person for no apparent reason so how about you and your gob of slimy shit family go fuck yourselves you delusional koolaid drinking piece of shit

canada,removed,looking at your comment history it seems you spend all day commenting on reddit you have over comment karma can i ask why im concerned for you
canada,removed,i just gave you three examples of people altruistically fighting against the corruption inherent to the tfw program no you didnt i recognize your nick now and understand that you have a very dubious concept about examples or proof the vast majority of antitfw rhetoric in canada is funded by canadian unions and it isnt to improve the working conditions of tfws its to send them home seeing as how we know this is the same logic people use to defend sweatshops remember you have a childlike sense of logic that betrays a profoundly simplistic mind i imagine the world is binary to you yes your rhetoric is laughable garbage you want brownie to go home but want to coach it in some claims that youre really just super concerned about them its a laugh

canada,removed,i wonder what this muslim police chaplin would say about muhammads pedophilia i know hes not a police officer but certainly he has to recognize that muammad raped a year old girl hows he going to spin that one
canada,removed,muhammad contracted his marriage to aisha when she was six she lived with her parents until age nine when he came and took her in to his home and raped her ive heard many apologists talk about how it was a social norm back then for girls to be married off at a very young age and those marriages were contracts which may be all fine and plausible until you actually meet a nine year old girl and have a conversation with her how at any time in history in any culture could an adult male be sexually attracted to a nine year old girl without being a total pedophile i dont care if she had their first period and thus was sexually mature in a biological sense aisha was nine years old and was playing with dolls nobody ever wants to talk about this but to me its the greatest damnation of muhammad and clearly shows he was a villain and a false prophet
canada,removed,trudeau would repeal it so he can enjoy it with his gay lover boys

canada,removed,sweet international relations and political economy are my bread and butter thanks for linking to an academic source without reading it you clearly only read the abstract but not the actual paper and clearly dont have the reading comprehension to even understand what the paper is about the study itself has a very narrow focus immigration entrepreneurship and analyses research finding as a whole heres the first line of the closing paragraph after the paper analysed all the available research overall much of the existing research points towards positive net contributions by immigrant entrepreneurs the emerging literature on these contributions as measured by innovations represents the most convincing evidence so far
canada,removed,these discussions always come back to the same solution mandatory driving tests to maintain eligibility to drive fuck if i care what age they start at budget i pay thousands for the car as is costing another bucks to do a test again every years is literally nothing in the cost of owning a car freedom youre a fucking idiot driving is a privilege not a freedom mandatory retesting needs to start
canada,removed,refugees will most likely pay tax dollars into the system in the future the elderly will most likely cost the system a good deal of money in the future so the people who already paid into the system should get nothing while some people who we brought here from their apartments in jordan get everything given to them horse shit theres no war in jordan they arent refugees there has to be money coming in to cover the money going out or the whole thing collapses so lets bring in people who cant work read or speak any oficial languages and have no economically viable skills by bringing here on the public dole billion spent to bring people here before the end of the year and we dont have any money for our senior citizens to get healthcare and housing but the refugees get dental and vision coverage no ammount of taxes paid in gets any canadian citizen that privlege most of these people didnt save or didnt save enough for retirement and when the burden falls on the government they need think about things from an economic perspective youre going to die so wed rather spend that money on supprting this foreign person for the rest of their natural life instead but i suppose thats one way to bring in more voters for your party if they spend too much on elder homes and not enough on population growth then the issue just gets worse each generation better bring in a family with kids and a company of grandparents and all with no canadian language skills thats way better than funding canadian seniors its after all if you think caring for our older generation is derimental to our economy then you should really do us all a favour and stop drawing anything yourself you habent paid in a fraction of what these seniora have and yet youre such an emtitled ass that youd claim theyre the burden not the rejects that germany wouldnt take begging at our coutnries doorstep canadian seniors are the burden to you the ones canadas economic stabding was built upon the backs of you disgust me

canada,removed,fuck quebec
canada,removed,churchill falls fucked up a whole lot of shit as well as any relationship between the two provinces and i say this as a newfoundlander who feels like if anybody was ever to be our good bud out of all the provinces and territories it should be québec what happenned is that you newfies are totally incompetent at building hydro dams so when you guys wanted to build churchill falls nobody in his right mind would trust you because you have zero experience however when québec wants to build something every bank from here to hell and back rolls out the red carpet for hydro québec because hydro québec fucking delivers and it has the most efficient and uptodate power grid of all northeastern northamerica thats the only one that didnt go bellyup during the blackout so it turned out that only québec had the competence expertise and most importantly the ability to raise capital to do it well québec did it and just because we are the ones who took the whole risk about it its perfectly normal that we get the profits thats called business something you blokes always like to remind québec about but not when it doesnt suit you but of course when you are a redblooded british you dont like to be reminded that you suck big time compared to the french so when they wanted to do muskrat falls just out of spite they decided to have anyone but the french build it so now they are on their way to bankrupcy despite the federal government having to put the canadian taxpayers on the hook to pay huge loan guarantees joey smallwood hated the french to guts it seems his legacy is alive and well whereas if they simply asked québec to do it it would have been done at absolutely no cost to taxpayers but no you have to hate the french and you are going to pay dearly for it and its not nothing that we laugh at newfie jokes
canada,removed,thats fine of course no matter how the facts are laid out you would wail about churchill falls being unfair every time newfoundland goes to court about churchill falls and gets a kick in the balls for it means that newfies are pretty stupid they are also pretty stupid to vote for such stupid governments that do such stupid things being stupid is repeating a given action and expecting a different result i dont feel like dealing with morons like that in my life but as a canadian taxpayer im pretty pissedoff at having to bail out you newfs who are a basket case of governmental incompetence it took you guys two referendums to get suckered into canada and you should have realized that the deal you were going into was where investors get their dues not some of unicorn fantasyland where money and cod rains from the sky

canada,removed,being downvoted by frantic vision vancouver staffers is fun i really wish rcanada and rvancouver would crack down on that bullshit but they seem to welcome it with open arms it doesnt help that rvancouver permits hate speech against people in other parts of the country stating that its not technically hate speech that sub is fucked up
canada,removed,no hes right about the vision staffers theyve been at this for fucking years on that sub you watch the trends and the votes long enough and you begin to notice that something really fucky is going on the mods on rvancouver are pretty banhappy throwing around the banhammer just because you feel hate speech should be removed and going on banning crusades right before someone from vision does an iama on the sub its really about time this bullshit got exposed
canada,removed,
canada,removed,maybe you moronic feninists should stop mindlessly listening and believing anything your fellow cult members say without any proof
canada,removed,staffers are not downvoting you people who think youre being an arrogant douche are handling that and yeah trump doesnt give a shit what the mayor of vancouver says as far as canadaus relations
canada,removed,i think you stumbled into a pot kettle situation here canadians are extremely smug when it comes to talking about americans i point that out and they call me smug you people all desperately want to cling to the idea that you are somehow right but youre not
canada,removed,should people other than white trust whites after all they are responsible for centuries of slavery and genocide against first nations throughout the americas as well as muslims and jews in europe lets not forget not forget all the christian against christian violence that has gone on since someone nailed some papers to a church door oh so many years ago
canada,removed,you are making an ass of yourself you can think whatever you want but if you think donald trump is stupid or unaware of the world around him you are a fool
canada,removed,the guns are legal here maybe you should focus on your criminals rather than inanimate objects
canada,removed,yeah but we need intelligent educated white immigrants not cave dwellers
canada,removed,he said mean words so he cant do business here fuck off
canada,removed,youre probably right if trump ever shows up the mayor should just keep his class act together and only start kissing trump because he cant help it and then grab him by the pussy
canada,removed,right on white pride world wide or something like that he can fuck right off about coming to toronto as far as im concerned
canada,removed,good the man had a good heart but his policies were fucking stupid
canada,removed,no you cant give the muslim town shit for that because it would be racist to persecute them for their culture but the christians are uncultured white redneck slime so fuck em
canada,removed,do you need a safe space bro
canada,removed,but i did not slander that bourgeois insect you truly are a grand intellectual of the ages arent you that kind of snark and belittling attitude is exactly why he won and youre too damn thick to see it
canada,removed,fuck that canada should attack and kill all the americans they deserve to die
canada,removed,vancouvers a place with multitudes of different races and minorities in addition to strong support for the lgbt and womens rights and how has anything that trump has said or done gone against any of that because he wants border enforcement are you that detached from reality
canada,removed,pm zoolander is not going to be doing anything but saying yes sir and then overcompensating by allowing a gay syrian bodybuilder rape his wife to show hes a progressive man and our country is advanced but the great thing is that trumps usa will so overwhelm tiny degenerating canadas economy that the people will have no choice but to get on board the trump train or get run the fuck over say hello to pm kevin oleary or doug ford either that or we are just years away from saskab reuniting then joining the usa
canada,removed,sorry some of our smugness is warranted it really isnt americans are far more innovative productive ambitious and valiant and their collective history and economic output prove it canadians on average are pretty mediocre people both intellectually and in enterprise americans set the standards in pretty much everything these days
canada,removed,the two situations are not remotely equivalent so you rationalize why its okay for you to be closeminded but when other people do it its suddenly not okay its hypocritical you dont have morals that you defend and apply to people equally you have prejudices that you force upon other people
canada,removed,so instead of trying to educate those who havent had the priviledge to obtain a proper education you want to insult them and humiliate them yes some dumb fuck who flunked out of high school and is proud to be a stupid fundamentally ignorant cocksucker deserves to be treated like the garbage he is especially if he or she thinks that they know whats best for the nation you are a hateful arrogant person you are what is wrong with the regressive left bullshit the regressive left accusation is likewise bullshit carry on making it meaningless though
canada,removed,the angry white people that make up his base feel emboldened they think their hate racism sexism islamophobia and homophobia have all been validated now they were right all along the kkk is celebrating like its again

canada,removed,asking a lot from a man that sits with his legs together
canada,removed,question if i let slip that i believe he should be killed could i have admissibility issues
canada,removed,yea the government isnt they are supportive all three branches its you ignorant fucks that are claiming a student run club running prayer services inside school is somehow an infringement on everyones rights when they book rooms just like any other club had to get approval just like any other club and are supervised by a teacher just like any other club csas exist ive never heard anyone saying csas shouldnt exist this country has freedom of religion that includes freedom to practice religion a club should not be banned from practicing religion when they follow all the protocols a club is supposed to follow
canada,removed,i hate these stupid damn feminists and sjws deport their asses theyre a cancer to modern society
canada,removed,good weve been hearing about these stupid women issues so damn much these days its time they take a slap in the face
canada,removed,this is why you shouldnt let women be journalists they dont have the temperament for it
canada,removed,hah something tells me they made the right decision in your case
canada,removed,i think this is key because if a demagogue has such control over what their followers believe in the face of any evidence so in regards to the us election you were on the side of the mainstream media even though it was wrong about basically everything so i guess starting january right wing death squads are going to start rounding up social justice warriors and gassing them i mean that would be nice but
canada,removed,i am a canadian i adore donald trump and have written letters to various government officials asking the canada reject any and all immigration applications made due to the perfectly legitimate election of trump and the fact that he has not done anything wrong other than say something offensive not enough reason if he starts locking you up for being a feminist then you have cause
canada,removed,like billionaires from china care about a depreciated canadian dollar amounting to whats that hoo flung dung another business expense just pay it

canada,removed,and your father told me you should have been an abortion so
canada,removed,i guess thats where i should go to find the rest of you mouth breathing kiddies
canada,removed,give it a rest buddy youre coming off stupid
canada,removed,then i get attacked for not respecting their gender fluid otherkin i want to be an apache helicopter you literally cant win with libs
canada,removed,lolol they are already appealing that the mandatory minimum isnt meant to be for police for fucks sake educate yourself before opening your mouth
canada,removed,they should raise the price make it guess where the majority of them going to i would bet on it that it is bc i am pissed as much as the next guy about foreign money driving up property prices but do you understand what visa mean as in tourist visa
canada,removed,the government needs to get their shit together they never have a problem charging canadians insane fees for stupidity but give away things like visas for pennies guess where the majority of them going to i would bet on it that it is bc i am pissed as much as the next guy about foreign money driving up property prices but do you understand what visa mean as in tourist visa
canada,removed,well i guess its just this one gunfor now if you bought a marlin or remington your round magazines are still perfectly fine as retardedly arbitrary as that is still its hard to see this as anything other than taking advantage of the political atmosphere to make a grab at firearms owners there are a lot of people whose property is now essentially worthless because of this the is not worth even close to its retail price of anymorea round semi auto is and the mags ranged from ea all worthless the worst part the rcmp just proved the crazy gun nutz right a vote for the liberals was a vote to have your property confiscated by the government
canada,removed,you know that you look like a wack job when you reply with the same comment repeatedly in a thread you will appear to be less of an unhinged crazy person if you keep that in mind
canada,removed,you cant seriously be this stupid youre either just refusing to understand basic law or youre just trying to avoid what really happened
canada,removed,is there ever a time where you arent in a canadian gun thread waiting to add nothing to the discussion via personal attacks
canada,removed,good
canada,removed,wrong if they had stayed it would have served no purpose and would have been in the way what you just said there is completely idiotic they say imitation is the highest form of compliment
canada,removed,honor killings are different as they are a cultural practice the implication that people from the middle east regardless of how they behave are going to be predisposed to honor killings by default is nonsense ethnically bigoted stupid nonsense how is this difficult to digest why try and prevent attempts to stop honor killings wow are you full of it youre one of those slimy illfavoured little guys in real live arent you i mean the disengenuity is just oozing out of my screen right now
canada,removed,but where will young men go to rape and be racist
canada,removed,if the muslims there stop blowing stuff up im sure they will pig ignorance the only people whove been blowing stuff up have been the daeshi cells but go scream at some syrian kurds living in germany about it because theyre sunni and so guilty by association dumbass logic right but unfortunately they are all segregated into ethnic ghettos and wear burkas and just have no interest in engaging in the country other than welfare hilarious bullshit are you sure youre not just a parody of a farright cretin hence the reason the far right is gaining so much traction there wishful thinking on your part par excellence
canada,removed,if you dont like my opinion then bugger off racist sexist and xenophobic wow scary words that are only backed by speculation and taking trump out of context this kind of smug shoving hillary down my throat is why im not supporting her now go cry somewhere else you little baby absolute embarrassment eat shit asshole and learn to have some respect other others i guess supporting hillary means supporting bullying because thats what youre doing
canada,removed,because the chikneez are colonizing and that is known to increase the risk of earthquakes of course
canada,removed,edgelording is not an opinion
canada,removed,edgelords typically do not perceive themselves as such they think this is reasonable stance the trudeau govt should kick her out make her reapply and expediate her application she would have to resign her seat but could run again next election
canada,removed,im really sorry about your oppression bro
canada,removed,but you wont work a skilled job for a year which is the point that job still needs to be done this is why you diversify your economy because when youve got a one trick pony and that pony breaks a leg the whole circus ends up out of work when supply outstrips demand prices fall rapidly and if you wont work below your station we find people who will
canada,removed,are the coordinates
canada,removed,old ass dentist who should have retired long ago honestly happens in medical too much where these old timer doctors continue on without updating their patient care skills and procedures
canada,removed,thats why you make them regulated and maintained if a train carrying oil crashes that is a metric fuckton of oil spilled if a modern maintained pipeline leaks the detection systems shut it off immediately and a relatively small amount of oil is spilled you may cite the enbridge leak as a counter argument but they willingly went against regulation to keep the oil flowing pipes leak all the time but you never hear about of them because they are dealt with before usually a few square meters of oil are spilled a train has one mistake and its a colossal disaster a pipe has one mistake and its lights out for the pipe until it gets fixed
canada,removed,wheres my watermelon favours shitlords
canada,removed,i expect to be downvoted heavily but i will say it the white nationalist movements have more logic and are more reasonable than these sjw ideas that pumpkin spice lattes whiteness and that the study of glaciers and the sport of skiing are both misogynist

canada,removed,ah yes another demonstration of a real kanadian you see world kanadians are just angry miserable sociopaths that would rather attack a fellow countrymen than work with them what a bunch of dumm fcking people in kanuckistan the people in winnipeg are the most hateful ignorant pieces of shit in the country that city is full of complete douchebags and world immigrants both in a race with each other to the bottom should build a wall around all the prairie provinces to keep all those angry wackjobs away from the rest of the country and genepool

canada,removed,muslims have a credibility gap to this day members of isis have not been declared apostates and have not been subject to any punishment according to their sharia law in fact isis has been
canada,removed,the thing that really pisses me off is this idea muslim is a race visibly muslim what the actual fuck it has nothing to do with race it is your crazy beliefs that destroyed the country you are running from and now you want to bring that shit to our country no
canada,removed,thats because there is no such thing those who are nonviolent are simply pursuing hijra a means of waging jihad the forced spread of islam until such time as they can guarantee success through strength in numbers and force of arms they come exploit the generous social systems of the west breed like rabbits and when time comes sharia patrols and fgm httpswwwpoliticalislamcommigrationasjihad
canada,removed,cmon now im sure those are only coincidences
canada,removed,if i said i was part off the kkk but i dont actually do any lynching everybody would still call me an asshole for being associated with that group why if you call yourself a muslim but you dont commit any terror attacks is everybody supposed to assume your peaceful and believe in western values an easy way to associate yourself with muslim extremism is to call yourself a muslim everybody knows how many muslim terrorist acts are committed around the world on a daily basis and we know hundreds of millions of muslims treat their woman like second rate citizens not to mention numerous other barbaric practices youre not fooling anybody by saying you yourself are peaceful youre choosing to represent a horrible ideology and its not up to me to wonder how close you actually follow islam and if youre extreme or not
canada,removed,you mustve been one of the guys passing antisikh posts around a few weeks ago lol
canada,removed,islam gtfo canada its more than a religion its a poltical and economic system that has no place in canada
canada,removed,i have arrived at this position after careful extensive and objective reasoning i sat down and read the quran then i read the hadiths a commentary on the quran which provides additional structure and commandments to islam i looked into the science and statistics some of which i have linked in this thread i was shocked surprised and appalled by what it uncovered anyone in the west currently defending islam is doing so from a position of naivety and well wishing there is a great deal of misunderstanding that islam is akin to christianity with the same flexibilities it is not it is a sociopolitical force with very clear well defined goals goals which are wholly at odds with the values and traditions of the west moreover its ultimate goal is to subvert and destroy them dont take my word for it unless you have some objection to simply reading and objectively assessing fact read up on it yourself look at the state of the middle east for over years now under islam look at the massive and systemic inbreeding look at the suppression of females the murder torture and mutilation of homosexuals the suppression of knowledge make no mistake the muslims you defend are happy to have your help just as they would be happy to continue the commands of their prophet by subjugating you by the sword if necessary all canadians all westeners have an obligation to be responsibly and objectively informed about islam if you do not know what is in the quran then you need to find out for yourself
canada,removed,considering who has been muddying the waters of that issue the most along with incensing racial tensions youll excuse me if i take your perspective with an asteroid sized grain of salt
canada,removed,i dont argue with tinfoil hat wearing islamophobes

canada,removed,its truly disturbing and makes me personally very angry said u of c president elizabeth cannon what disturbs and angers me is the coddling of an ideology that has core tenets of misogyny bigotry intolerance homophobia antisemitism violence and oppression
canada,removed,so you being racist is the solution you are insane there are real problems and they have nothing to do with pronouns go protest the selling of arms to saudi arabia if you want to actually want to complain about things that matter jesus christ man the only thing worse than this ladys comment is how oblivious he is to the facts shes got an intellect comparable to a potato the same kind of person who thinks chopping an year olds dick off and stuffing them with hormones is progressive not child abuse when an year old says they do not feel like vegetables and you say ok and then they die of malnourishment it is a criminal offence but when an yr old says they feel like a girl and you chop their cock off you get a cbc special made about how progressive you are and how big of a hero you are for acquiescing to the will of a childs feelings seriously though your ignorant and racist response must be intentionally ironic i mean you define the problem of marginalizingdefining an entire group of ppl based on gender and skin colour you are the hateful asshole for which we require laws to keep quiet you are a perpetrator of hateful intentional discrimination against an entire group of people because you disagree with them congratulations you oblivious idiot you have failed at life your brain is damaged and you are quite literally a sociopath
canada,removed,thats because your end goal is to defend islam and muslims not to criticize this particular case i see that you cant discuss without making up stupid arguments to argue against you have fun with that that sort of dishonesty isnt worth engaging with
canada,removed,listen fucko your hate on muslims obviously stems from longterm childhood trauma probably to the head or maybe the fact that your parents are sibling i dont know im not a doctor get all the acclaimed studies you want proving that muslims are literally the devil but im going to stick with my way of doing things which is to actually interact with these people and decide for myself on a case by case basis id suggest you do the same as the above applies for literally every fucking minority group you can think of within reason
canada,removed,i would say a religion where the perfect man of god raped a year old girl is pretty incompatible with western society
canada,removed,have to agree id rather immigrating muslims to leave their barbaric practices in the shit holes they came from if you come here it should be with the intent to be canadian
canada,removed,but the quran deserves to be fucked islam is a disgusting religionlike all the abrahamic religions but slightly worse
canada,removed,people need to get it through their heads that isis are the perfect muslims islam is terrible thing the less strictly one follows it the better they are as a person
canada,removed,just wait well get our own trump when canadians get tire of sjw and islamic bullshit
canada,removed,thats really funny you literally wont look at another opinion that doesnt align with your own personal views of muslims and islam have a look at some of this stuff some of its garbage some of it isnt expand your narrow mind just a bit
canada,removed,this is good news islam is incompatible with the western democracy that made us great and there is no two ways around it hope to see more demonstrations like this in more areas of the country

canada,removed,the mods are being assholes if youre going to censor factual fucking posts you dick heads why dont you just pull a cbc and disallow commenting on articles like this i posted that a religion where the perfect man of god raped a year old doesnt fit into western society and you jerks removed it muhammed is seen as the perfect man of god and married aisha when she was years old he waited until she was the ripe old age of before he had sex with her how can a religion where the perfect man of god is a pedophile fit in with western values a man who every muslim tries to emulate we have a religion that treats its women like possessions that feels raping little boys is perfectly fine but gay sex is punishable by death the feels if you leave the religion of peace your punishment should be death etc if youre going to censor truthful comments no matter how much a certain group may find it offensive then you are not doing your fucking job hiding the truth because it hurts is way beyond a dick move i dont care if i get banned at this point but not allowing truthful speech in this sub especially when there are so many other subs that have much worse comments is ridiculous islam has no place in the modern world along with every other religion
canada,removed,it would be fair to compare the above with other faiths and they score much higher which culturescountries are most comfortable killing civilians contrast the above with christian fundamentalists who score higher in pew research

canada,removed,except you do have a choice buying less shit or at least buying better shit one of the big problem right now is that the environmental impact of getting all that low quality shit shipped from china to us is not reflected in the prices so it gives them a competitive advantage over our own production people are whining all the time about tax dollar being wasted by the government but your money leaving our economy is arguably more damaging to our purchasing power on the long term than higher taxes on stuff we dont even need for the most part
canada,removed,youre language gives it away youre an idiot
canada,removed,you assume what i believe thats why youre an idiot
canada,removed,at the beginning colepram began with the argument with their reply to korobatsu that trans people are categorically men or women and thus should all be called either he or she and that anyone who says they prefer other pronouns is pretending for the sake of stirring shit procor did not argue that most trans people are nonbinary just that some quite a few of those they knew transgender people are nonbinary and that they deserve to be respected procors anecdotal experience disproves coleprams initial statement because coleprams initial statement was an absolute one falsified by the existence of any easygoing nonbinary people the anecdotes dont cancel each other out because the ratio of binary to nonbinary trans people was never a part of anyones argument colepram appears to have since changed their argument and now acknowledges three instead of two pronoun sets that people are allowed to use he she and they which means that they have changed their mind and now disagree with both the professor and their initial statement but are attempting to look like they never made the argument they did in the first place
canada,removed,driving is a privilege every ticket ive received has been paid within a week wow i bet you are the poster boy for lawful good in your dd group real life is just a little bit different than moms basement though the government may license and regulate driving but reducing it to a privilege is like saying not going to jail is a privilege if we break the law we may go to jail but jail is not the default position in fact it takes quite a bit to go to jail and our constitution protects us against disproportionate punishment removing someones ability to drive and by extension their mobility for work and pleasure should take a lot more than an unpaid parking ticket driving may not be a right but it ranks a lot higher on the scale than the word privilege implies

canada,removed,this is real life
canada,removed,its incredibly difficult to build in nunavut you need to sink deep pilings into the permafrost and building materials can only be shipped up on a boat during the summer there are no roads
canada,removed,i dont think its fair to state entirely for us folk who grew up somewhere like bc that not learning french was a lack of interest were literally a continent away that may as well be like flying from london to istanbul and quite a bit more expensive after visiting ontario and quebec a few months ago i have a great respect for the bilingual people i have met i think the french language and the quebecois are vital to our country and to widen divides would be a terrible loss for our national identity this report is from a shitty conservative thinktank and no stock should be put into what is said
canada,removed,article is enough to deter russia from even thinking of trying to invade or annex a baltic state i think putting is willing to test nato resolve he might bite into a baltic state whole but i do think hes willing to nibble at the edges id prefer deterrence now to war later

canada,removed,youre not owed a good faith rebuttal certainly not when your arguments are so pathetically childish what im dismissing is you you have no idea what petersons or his employers rights are and you want to elevate petty schoolyard behaviour to the level of national debate its a joke ill leave you with the following pearl of wisdom do your best to internalize it perhaps the only thing more childish than putting glue in the lock of the door of a professor you dont like would be that professor tweeting about it like its a big deal with the hopes of mobilizing other children to his cause
canada,removed,theyre not alternate pronouns you twat its what we are there is no alternative refusing to use them is disrespect at a basic level

canada,removed,i bet you wouldnt hve a problem hiring a bunch british military right you fucking racist motherfucker youre a piece of shit and nothing more
canada,removed,well yes this is canada and were rapidly importing people from the same areas that have created the people perpetrating atrocities across europe yet nothing has happened here why are you trying to draw a parallel invariably people on the left want to assure us these are not a result of islam but mental illness while people on the right are convinced that islam is a mental illness brought on by satan since the people were importing en masse are coming from the same area have likely had the same experiences and have the same background i am curious what we are doing to identify the mentally ill in the thousands were hauling over i dont think you give shits about the screening process in as much as you want to imply that refugees coming into canada will ultimately commit acts of violence similar to instances in europe youre attempting to troll and its obvious
canada,removed,fuck that if muslims become radical because were not nice to them then they deserve a bullet in the head itll just make it easier to lessen collateral damage if a lot of them are terrorists
canada,removed,hes trolling refugees its the hobby of the altreicht
canada,removed,that doesnt mean anything wow ive had just about enough of this type of stupid passing as legitimate discourse using your stupidity i would be just as probable of grinding up prostitutes and feeding them to my pigs like pickton enough with this dumb dumb stuff
canada,removed,which they do but people like you refuse to think its enough it is never enough i hope your daughterson marries a muslim and they have muslim babies maybe then that will be enough to quench your hate fire for islam
canada,removed,they cant because they know that it is socially unacceptable to be an open bigot they hide behind buzz words and gaslighting in a attempt to rebrand fascism and normalize it
canada,removed,im not about to take lessons on religion from a bigot
canada,removed,do you not think that people with a vested interest to live a better life and be productive humans wouldnt find their way into the numbers being brought here youre a small pathetic individual i feel sorry for you
canada,removed,then we have yourself the typical progressive who endlessly defends islam as if its totally innocent of all crime and can just call people bigoted or racist nice gas lighting attempt i defend people and their rights to live a life free from boneheads like you who want to attack groups of individuals because theyre different i havent seen anybody denigrating muslims ive seen a guy voicing concerns about mentally ill migrants theyre refugees save the altreicht garbage for alex jones and migrants that may have links to terrorist organizations there is nothing substantive to assume that these refugees have links to anything to suggest otherwise is trying to push an agenda it is people like you who are a danger to our freedoms why do you hate canada so much and who is calling out flaws within islam hes not an authority on islam the only thing that is flawed is his logic nothing was said about muslims as a whole not directly because the altreicht are a bunch of cowards
canada,removed,and the fellow who ran down the other soldier seems islam has many mentally ill followers
canada,removed,bit of a deflection there look you said that all were canadian citizens then i posted a link with the truth now youre saying that some were canadian citizens its probably best if we dont interact on here

canada,removed,great i look forward to abusing my new found rights ladies ill see you in the washroom and if you have a problem with it its now a hate crime rolf

canada,not_removed,i thought this was cleared up years ago when prayers of all kinds were taken out of schools
canada,not_removed,keep all schools secular
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,its a completely secular school that doesnt give space to anyone who feels the need to put their faith in false belief on display how is this discrimination
canada,not_removed,the boys who told the human rights tribunal that praying is mandatory in their sunni religion continued to hold their prayers in secret in the school or even outside in the snow how is this a human rights issue i had this intense sense of shame and humiliation despite that i was just exercising my right as a canadian citizen as a human being to practice my faith siddiqui testified before the tribunal i felt the same way when i was raped as a young girl i dropped out and started working so i could take care of my sick mother want to talk about shame and humiliation im deeply ashamed of the country im from and what it thinks a human rights issue entails while they ignore hundreds of incidences like what happened to me because we wouldnt want to address those stagnating issues would we poor people dont even matter the irony in all of this for me is that the people who are constantly pumping out the feel food refugee propaganda are the same people who are totally comfortable being friends with a pedophilerapist canada get your fucking shit together but school founder neil webber argues that the school was purposely set up to be nondenominational and has a right to remain secular annnnnnnyway this is all that fucking matters unless youre a rich prick then you can just sue anyway
canada,not_removed,not this shit again nobody was asking for a dedicated prayer space as part of a letter written by the parents to the school section emphasis mine the accommodation being sought i am requesting the follow accommodation from webber academy i that the children be permitted to carry out their prayers on webber academys campus the space need not be a dedicated prayer space i would only ask that it is sufficiently large to allow the children to bow kneel and stand safely and ii that the children are excused to pray if andor when the prayers coincide with their scheduled classes all they needed was a bit of room to quietly bow a library classroom or office would have worked fine but instead the school told the kids they would have to leave school property although another private school seamlessly accommodated prayer for these students on their campus webber academy asserts it could only offer reasonable accommodation to these students on the following terms they could pray offcampus they could be given permission to miss school in order to drive to the mosque to pray or the students could find a nearby neighbour who would allow them to pray at their house on some occasions the staff actively tried to disrupt their prayers on february mr siddique was conducting a prayer in the library at webber academy mr siddique gave evidence that he was about to commence prostration when ms webber approached him interrupted him by coming very close to him and asked repeatedly what are you doing mr siddique felt compelled to break his prayer i had this intense sense of shame and humiliation despite the fact that i was just exercising my right as a canadian citizen as a human being to practice my faith due to this intense sense of shame and fear i just got so stressed out i just had to break as well she was so close to me i couldnt continue my prayers so i broke my prayer the school never had an official written policy regarding oncampus prayer or really what nondenominational was even supposed to mean ms webber in cross examination testified that the respondents published statement of being a nondenominational school was enough to convey that no prayer is allowed at webber academy q well with respect to the the islamic school the policies regarding prayer were set out in that school parents handbook a yes sir q is there a policy a similar policy set out at webber academy on prayer a no we dont allow prayer so we dont need a policy on prayer q how is one to know that prayer is not allowed at webber academy a because it is reflected in our parentstudent handbook that were a nondenominational school the school had allowed other forms of religious expression despite their attempts to prevent these kids from praying the evidence also showed the respondent accommodated religious headcoverings and facial hair the respondent asserted that because prayer constituted an activity this justified a different approach we see no distinction between a turban as a religious obligation or prayer as a religious obligation and we find no reasonable justification for treating these students religious prayer requests differently than a religious headcovering request webber academys express allowance of certain visual religious observances undermines its position that overt praying could not be accommodated tldr in light of all of the foregoing we conclude that webber academy has not demonstrated that their rigid and unwritten policy of disallowing these students to observe their sincerely held religious prayer practice on campus is reasonable and justifiable the supreme court of canada stated in meiorin and confirmed again in moore that alternative approaches to accommodation must be investigated webber academys response and refusal to seriously consider hardship aspects is in conflict with webber academys obligation to show that it could not have done anything else reasonable and practical to avoid the negative impact on the individual despite the respondents specifically stated goal of making people of all religious backgrounds feel welcome its actions objectively viewed were not welcoming of these complainants the respondent has not provided this tribunal with sufficient evidence to establish it would be an undue hardship for webber academy to permit the students to pray on campus during school hours in conclusion we find that webber academys standard of no overt prayer or religious activities on school property was not reasonably necessary to accomplish webbers purpose of maintaining a nondenominational identity that is free from religious influences and that the students could have been accommodated without incurring undue hardship
canada,not_removed,those were the right prayers to take out of schools this story is about the wrong prayers to take out of schools
canada,not_removed,a key pillar of our founding principles is that the school be a nondenominational environment in which children can thrive and focus on their academic success webber said it sounds like that was the intention for their school but apparently by not letting the muslim student pray times a day during class thats a human rights violation
canada,not_removed,that would have been schoolsanctionedteacherlead prayers this has to do with whether or not muslim students are entitled to be excused from class to pray the school wanted the students to pray before or after class on their own time but the students wanted to either be excused from class have class stop so they could pray or have the schools schedule adjusted so that their prayer time wouldnt overlap with classroom time
canada,not_removed,well i cant speak to every situation but the one you describe involves a private indoor space for muslims to pray away from everyone else and a christian street preacher in public praying at people who walk past those arent exactly the same thing
canada,not_removed,reasonable accommodation of belief systems is part of freedom of religion are you also saying a vegetarian option for hindus in a schoolprovided lunch is some terrible burden too or not mixing kosher foods with nonkosher ooh lets force jw kids to do participate in schoolvolunteer programs too jesus why is it so hard for people just to be reasonable they want to pray so fucking what shrugs
canada,not_removed,muslims are pushing their way into every secular region of our society they have the terms xenophobia and islamophobia as their most effective weapons the biggest issue is that there will no place for your kid to go if you dont want him or her exposed to religion
canada,not_removed,its disgusting how were expected to cater to them while they show no respect for our values in canada tolerance appears to be a one way street
canada,not_removed,im confused how are the people who support refugees comfortable being friends with pedophilesrapists also what you went through is unimaginable power to you
canada,not_removed,it isnt if they wanted other people to join their religion or follow its rules id have a real big problem with it but they dont so i couldnt care less reasonable accommodation is a key requirement of freedom of religion in this country there isnt anything unreasonable about allowing a brief time out for religious observances except these are muslims
canada,not_removed,because we arent supposed to have religion in public and private schools unless its a religious private school it opens up the doors to a lot of other things
canada,not_removed,either allow all prayers or none you cant allow only one group to have prayers and not others
canada,not_removed,no those were staff organized prayers these are student organised prayers which are allowed and have never been removed i used to be a fucking prayer group for christ sake like multiple students and staff self organizing and using public buildings for religion totally legal and id love to see the nuclear reaction if it was banned ok it wasnt a fucking prayer group i wish but it was for christs sake the new butthurt generation only sees the devil they dont know not the devil they do also jws could opt out of assemblies prayerbefore it was removed anthemn and any celebration where is the witch hunt maybe we should remove all religious affiliated holidays to keep the butt hurt to a minimum move christmas break into january easter to something less loaded oh i forgot the antisikh movement post airindia where we all wanted to strip the sikh students of knives that were as effective for killing as the crosses on so many other kids necks we love to shit on someone
canada,not_removed,letting muslims pray is also a violation of a different law religion discrimination if they allow muslims to pray then they should also by law allow christians or other religions to pray otherwise theyre discriminating against every other religion except muslims i hope that some christianjewishathiest parents get involved with the other side that it is indeed discrimination
canada,not_removed,neither option would work no school should be forced to stop classes or to adjust schedules there is simply too much to go over per class plus switching rooms every hour the muslims either have to adjust their ways or form their own school to make their own schedule
canada,not_removed,the only thing the students were asking for were space to pray and to be excused for a few minutes to do so not adjusting schedules or anything like that practically it was no different from a student asking to go to the bathroom or to grab a book from their locker the school responded by telling them they had to leave school property entirely if they wanted to pray the kids either had to pray outside in the middle of december ask someone living near the school to use their house or be driven to a mosque the closest of which is a minute roundtrip
canada,not_removed,im of the mind that religions are like genitalia in that id rather not have small children forcefully exposed to them yes im mangling a hitchens quote bite me eh
canada,not_removed,i dont understand you dont think muslims should be in our society then complain when they bring up that youre being xenophobic is that what youre saying or am i misinterpreting your comment
canada,not_removed,i really hope people start to wake up and realize how wrong this behavior is my grandfather fought for my future in war and needless to say hed be pretty damn upset to see this is what he fought for in the end
canada,not_removed,yep never had a problem following the rules of the school to be secular until because theyre muslims id prefer to call these people assholes
canada,not_removed,the school allows none problem solved
canada,not_removed,you mean like we can allow catholics to have their own school board
canada,not_removed,i used to be a fucking prayer group its evolving
canada,not_removed,its not part of christianity to have formalized daily praying are you drunk
canada,not_removed,im talking about the article not myself also i never said that muslims shouldnt be in our society that was a pretty weak strategy on your part
canada,not_removed,most of the elderly males in canada who served in our military are appalled by the present day stupidity they ask themselves why did we sacrifice and bury our friends in far away places to be now told that we are such bad people they see the future of canada and shake their heads in disbelief jim b
canada,not_removed,life uh finds a way
canada,not_removed,sure it is every major catholic branch follows some organized prayer cycle anglicans methodists and lutherans do too vespers at sunset compline at bedtime midnight office at midnight matins dawn first hour prime am third hour terce am sixth hour sext noon ninth hour none pm each hour is derived from somewhere in the bible like psalm at midnight i will rise and praise you or luke there they crucified him it was now about the sixth hour or mark and at the ninth hourjesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last each of those have a type of prayer that is supposed be done and each day had a theme and each season it gets quite complicated now most western christians dont practice their faith so as much they talk about practicing their faith but you wouldnt have to look too hard to find some grandparents that go to multiple services in a day or stop to pray at these times it was much more common in the past all that to say that i was a kid in this school and someone else was allowed to take breaks to pray for their religion i would be getting out of class too for mine at least ostensibly and i would have a couple thousand years of documented practice on my side editto fix the times and names formatting
canada,not_removed,not drunk just pissed that we have to constantly change decadesold policies that have worked because of one group if they cant operate in canada without raising shit they should not be here
canada,not_removed,a strategy for what i just wanted you to clarify man no big deal thanks for doing so
canada,not_removed,what it says is hea more a liberal than a conservative
canada,not_removed,ask hudak how well that strategy works
canada,not_removed,sabi marwah recently retired as vicechairman and chief operating officer at scotiabank revolving door politics at work courtesy of the tax payers
canada,not_removed,httpswwwliberalcarealchangesenatereform seems like hes doing exactly that
canada,not_removed,seems to be stacking the senate id assess it as an absolute certainty mr dreamy has some very very controversial legsialtion coming soon and he needs a senate with a majority of independent senators who always vote liberal he will have them very soon once his handpicked selection committee finishes which will be very soon then he can get on the the most important piece of legislation of his first term rigging the electoral system to ensure many subsequent liberal majorities stay tuned he is nearly there now
canada,not_removed,a politician is lying im shocked
canada,not_removed,so we blame government employees for the government paying them living wages instead of criticizing private companies for not i have family that has done well in the public sector and now with current costs of living are finally starting to struggle and become house poor im not even a person to blame the but this is outright bs that is trying to get people to turn on each other there are sooooooooooooo many variables that come to play with income inequality i know in america income inequality is just as high as it was during the depression there are a lot of similarities between now and the that makes me believe that there could be something cyclical about income and equality
canada,not_removed,this message is brought to you by the
canada,not_removed,blah blah blah dont look at us and our back room lobbying tax avoiding ways look at those working people with pension plans
canada,not_removed,i dont mind the db pension benefits they have its something all companies should aspire to the db pension is an incentive for retaining skilled employeees for the long term ilo of paying them substantially more or having them and their knowledge go elsewhere what i do mind terribly though and believe is a major component of the have vs have not divide is the constant pay raises far and above what the private sector folks get that are putting the civil servants further and further ahead of the majority who have to pay their salaries while falling further and further behind thats unsustainable its not not right or just and i think there should be a moratorium on civil service salaries until the private sector folks can catch up
canada,not_removed,why is mcleans known as a formerly respected canadian news magazine
canada,not_removed,having read this article i feel like the pension i have worked to earn is somehow something to be ashamed of that ive somehow gotten one over on the rest of the country im not sure this is any kind of stance that will keep experienced people like me in the workforce vs making me consider the option of take the money and run is there some danger my pension is going to be clawed back

canada,not_removed,this isnt a gun issue it is a social issue about radicalization and violence
canada,not_removed,police have not commented on the type of gun used we dont even know what type of weapon it was or how it was acquired they could at least wait until all relevant information was available
canada,not_removed,i cant submit an article with an original title that is factually wrong most people on rcanada only read headlines and i think it just spreads bad ideas when you have terrible titles like what global news put here
canada,not_removed,ive read at least four variations on the combination of rifles and handguns he used including prohibited weapons ill be interested to hear how he came by those
canada,not_removed,thats not surprising the booze cruise was a common thing as a teen growing up in sk
canada,not_removed,those in probably live in the middle of nowhere where seeing another car on the road is an occasion to celebrate
canada,not_removed,its so popular that even our deputy premier does it while driving a government vehicle through a construction zone at am seriously though its a problem in saskatchewan that i dont think education is going to fix overnight i posted about giving those with duis a different license plate for years after a successful conviction but i was told overwhemingly that humiliation isnt the answer
canada,not_removed,for an unfortunately large amount of people here being drunk is the normal mode so that article isnt surprising
canada,not_removed,moved to saskatoon from ontario and holy hell its night and day i definitely have known people and seen people do it in ontario but its a whole culture out here and its absolutely not just a rural thing its in the city big time ive worked with several people with previous duis and it seems to be a slap on the wrist compared to out east their insurance went up by percent or so when back home you couldnt afford to drive anymore the government insurance is absolutely amazing out here my bill went from year to under but their dui game is weak
canada,not_removed,more importantly how does it work out for them what are their stats on injury and death due to it
canada,not_removed,i lived in sk for a time as a foreigner and was shocked at the amount of drunk drivers honestly blown away by how common it was
canada,not_removed,part of the problem is the lack of transit options in saskatchewan in regina we dont have uber and our transit system ends service around midnight and even then a bus only comes every hour after what were left with is either calling a cab and hoping one arrives in a timely manner making sure to have a designated driver or staying the night at a friends house if there were better options to get home i think things would be better
canada,not_removed,if sk is anything like i imagine rural farmland all rural farmland i could see why they think that nobody wants to pay and wait around for a cab to get home when you can drive yourself and even stop for mcdonalds
canada,not_removed,and in rcanadians think its ok to drive after smoking pot
canada,not_removed,im only surprised its that low apparently another of sk residents are liars
canada,not_removed,weird based on the people from skatchwn ive met id settled on
canada,not_removed,depends what one considers drinking in driving vast majority would think downing beers and then hitting the road is awful but downing or beers and driving well i think sask is less vehement about that
canada,not_removed,people from ontario say oh shit before they hit the ditch people from saskatchewan say hold my beer and watch this on the serious note its a huge problem i am from rural sask and can confirm the booze cruise to mc dicks is a country staple
canada,not_removed,not surprised probably half of saskatchewan grew up backroading it and id be interested to know how they operationalized drunk for this survey
canada,not_removed,not justifying it but the main consensus is usually its alright to drive home after having one or two beers with buddies after being their for a couple hours i know i am guilty and probably of my buddies are
canada,not_removed,nope no more for me thanks im snowmobilin home
canada,not_removed,well of course its not like theyll hit anything
canada,not_removed,all those beer cans in the ditch didnt come from space
canada,not_removed,its absolutely never okay to drive drunk under any circumstances you cant guarantee that there wont be any other car or bicycle pedestrian etc let alone if you smash into personal property and damage something
canada,not_removed,people without cab service more likely to drive drunk shocking pretty easy to play moral high authority when you have uber at your disposal the kids these days are much more responsible than my generation and my parents generation was much worse than us
canada,not_removed,seems reasonable when you only have one road with no curves
canada,not_removed,well the worse thing they can hit is corn or wheat
canada,not_removed,as someone from saskatchewan this is embarrassing
canada,not_removed,i grew up in saskatoon and in the winter the car follows the ruts in the snow pretty easy driving really
canada,not_removed,the example they give driving on a short distance on a quiet road in other words an issue of convenience i want to drive and i am willing for others to take the risk of my impairment how about out of cell coverage or no cell phone and dealing with a seriously injured person if i had a seriously injured family member i wouldnt watch them expire the right thing to do would be to drive only far enough to get back into cell coverage or to find a working landline assuming quick ems response could be expected i think that youd opt for the defense of necessity if need be
canada,not_removed,unfortunately its like that in alberta too incredibly conservative here and if you ever have the misfortune of working in an oilsands camp you will be blown away at how horrible the rig pigs are its common to hear groups of them talking about how theyre going to either down a bunch of energy drinks and drive through the night after being up for hours or get shitfaced go to sleep and start an hour drive first thing in the morning while still drunk or hungover disgusting people
canada,not_removed,that seems low
canada,not_removed,friends of mine
canada,not_removed,ya but dude im good at it dont worry i do it all the time
canada,not_removed,well if were told that texting while driving is more dangerous than drunk driving
canada,not_removed,til driver in sk misread the legal bac limit as instead of
canada,not_removed,ive just moved to montreal and i have to say the drinking in driving culture is off the charts here its done so casually that i dont think people even realize theyre doing it im talking hammered
canada,not_removed,canadian stereotypes at work in the above article one example of a number of recorded zui cases usa and canada breathalyzer installation on road safe motor vehicles from mopeds to big rigs would be a pricey solution that could ultimately spare the cost of labour on a broken family smucked up transformer in the dead of winter in a small town and the job security and well being of the offenders engineer a cheaper alternative to the current device a fingerprint activated keyyour breath your signaturethat you personally carry which can be used in combination with typical starter keys or push start to power up a vehicle key is lost replacement template on file in regulatory office printing a new one now how would the vehicle recognize that you were the one in the drivers seat not sure steering column mounted optical facial recognition and combined key insertion just spit balling here self driving cars arent going to be mandatory and solutions to drinking and driving require a biggie sized shift in public perception as a preventative measure or a more active approach
canada,not_removed,what constitutes being drunk
canada,not_removed,heres a strange question is it legal to drive drunk on private property ie your farm its not very smart obviously but im wondering if any provincial traffic laws extend onto private property
canada,not_removed,oh no the public isnt unanimous on the conventional wisdom what are we going to do
canada,not_removed,same problem in winnipeg when you dont have reliable mass transit then people will drive drunk taxi prices are usually too expensive compared to just driving to the bar and home the solution is better transit
canada,not_removed,thats because it is ok to drive drunk under some circumstances this isnt a religious conviction im looking at you madd its a common sense issue almost all the time theres no justification for driving drunk but its not an absolute
canada,not_removed,thats rural canada for you wouldnt have it any other way
canada,not_removed,most of the country drank the madd koolaid and think that accidents are caused by people who had a couple drinks
canada,not_removed,so do i however if you are a danger to others on the road regardless of what substances you consume you should not drive and should be punished if you are caught being a threat
canada,not_removed,and i guarantee that number is closer to once you leave saskatoon or regina the number of saskies i worked with up in fort mac who would openly talk about grabbing a case of beer for the drive back was absurd
canada,not_removed,you stay classy saskatchewan
canada,not_removed,spent a few years in saskatoon for uni was always surprised how little concern people had for drinking and driving i can understand that attitude in more rural areas but it was rampant in the city as well
canada,not_removed,sometimes it is if drunk means over the legal limit had a beer middle of nowhere wife going into labor drive to the hospital remember folks only sith deal in absolutes and whoever says this quote heck the former mayor of toronto did it all the time and the police let him they would watch him drive drunk so at that point the bar has been set
canada,not_removed,yeah but as many surveys have shown at least in people choose the stupid option in any survey just because they feel like being a rebel
canada,not_removed,the question shouldnt be is it ok that doesnt mean anything it should be is it a higher risk than x driving drunk on a quiet road is less risky than many activities that are legal
canada,not_removed,i have driven drunk and high on weed mushrooms and acid and i would say mushrooms for me was by far the most fun experience
canada,not_removed,they arent wrong
canada,not_removed,i think people not from sk need to go check out sk
canada,not_removed,oh fer sher
canada,not_removed,define drunk please
canada,not_removed,you know if the of people that are absolutely shittasticaly shit terrible drivers didnt drive it probably never would of been much of an issue i have seen some seriously horrible fucking drivers just terrible
canada,not_removed,id say its ok if youve been in the bush drinking and you have to drive to civilization because your friend got attacked by a bear
canada,not_removed,its not just a problem with people driving cars imo i think there is also a huge problem in this province with people who like to mix booze and quadssleds
canada,not_removed,well lets face it if you kill anyone its just going to be a saskatchewanean
canada,not_removed,i bet the study was flawed what those respondents probably meant that sometimes in saskatchewan theres no realistic alternative to driving drunk
canada,not_removed,inbreds
canada,not_removed,still very common
canada,not_removed,it was so weird living in saskatchewan people would be like nah im fine to drive i only had a dozen and like no one in the room would blink
canada,not_removed,whats the booze cruise google is only returning ferry information if its what i think it is that is supremely stupid
canada,not_removed,we used to put a picnic bench in the back of a pickup and booze cruise with a bunch of people haha
canada,not_removed,the booze cruise was a common thing as a teen only in the wheat or corn fields
canada,not_removed,especially if youre stuck
canada,not_removed,then they see another car fixate on it and crash like the story of the drunk driver hitting the only tree in a desert youll fixate on something and steer towards it
canada,not_removed,as much as i love drunk farmers the traffic stats are horrifying saskatchewans fatality rate is double that of bc holy crap saskatchewanians
canada,not_removed,like fuck they are ive seen a few who are pretty visibly impaired in broad daylight in regina make no mistake once the provincial government sells off sgi insurance saskatchewan will be one of the most expensive places to get insurance in the country might take a few years to catch up but this place is outright dangerous on the road
canada,not_removed,live in the middle of nowhere like saskatchewan
canada,not_removed,and then promptly crash headfirst into them
canada,not_removed,lived in a similar place still not a reason even remotely to drink and drive i dont give a fuck if they die but sooner or later theyll meet another person
canada,not_removed,education wont stop farmers from having a bunch of brews then driving home to the middle of buttfuck nowhere im fairly sure most farmers in the surrounding assiniboia area have duis hah
canada,not_removed,several states have party plates not only do they publicly shame they also allow cops to identify risky drivers and put them under more scrutiny i really dont see how theyre a bad idea driving is a privilege you can always choose to walk if being identified as a drunk driver is too embarrassing
canada,not_removed,nah those were just the sjws telling you that
canada,not_removed,sounds kinda racist
canada,not_removed,they have the highest drunk driving rate out of all the provinces which results in one of the highest rates of impaired driving causing death edit interesting side note quebec despite having fairly liberal alcohol sales laws and the httpmontrealgazettecomnewsnationalwhoarecanadasbiggestdrinkers have the second lowest drunk driving rate
canada,not_removed,id be surprised if a manitoba poll showed a significantly different percentage id guess its more a rural thing than specifically a saskatchewan thing
canada,not_removed,to be fair theres a lot of people that think because pot is all natural that its okay to use it whenever school work whatever bro its all natural so its okay
canada,not_removed,didnt answer cuz they needed to get to happy hour at gibbys
canada,not_removed,yeah im kinda confused about the context are we talking about people drinking a case of beer and being over the limit or someone who has beers with supper and heads out a couple hours later and is under the limit pretty much everyone i know does the latter
canada,not_removed,or beers over the course of a few hours and then driving is generally under and is thus legal so thats not exactly remarkable
canada,not_removed,thats not drunk driving either legally or functionally so its not really what were talking about here try out one of those online drink calculators linked up thread to see what it takes to actually blow over
canada,not_removed,still doesnt justify it
canada,not_removed,there are more dangerous things no shit sherlock just because something is safer by comparison doesnt make it inherently safe or even safe to do once in a while and you used the wrong than thats got to be pretty embarrassing in your appeal to intellectual honesty
canada,not_removed,take your rationality to toronto bud
canada,not_removed,shitfaced drunk sure over the limit id rather worry about speeders and aggressive drivers in my city than a couple rural folk who are half a beer over an arbitrary limit which means completely different things for different people
canada,not_removed,drunk driving is one of the most arrogant and self centered things i can think of nothing makes me think your a dumb ass faster than being one of the people who thinks other people shouldnt drive drunk but im me so its okay
canada,not_removed,you should probably live in northern sk for awhile
canada,not_removed,drive drunk not all drunk driving is equal its ok if youre only marginally impaired and at least a decent driver
canada,not_removed,its fine you nerd
canada,not_removed,its absolutely never okay to drive drunk under any circumstances and how drunk is too drunk we dont live in a zero tolerance country there are limits on what is acceptable and what is too much and they are open to reasonable debate because we have the moral responsibility to balance freedom with responsibility and safety im tired of gross oversimplifications like your statement good for you for virtue signaling now youre better than everyone else now can we actually have a realistic discussion instead of a knee jerk that everyones already heard a million times that doesnt actually solve the real problem
canada,not_removed,bac didnt think that was malleable or subjective at all
canada,not_removed,pretty easy to play moral high authority when you have uber at your disposal or just drink less if you know you have to drive
canada,not_removed,im becoming accustomed to the embarrassment if its not one thing its another drunk drivers crime rates provincial government making assbackwards decisions gth land deal skip the dishes grant potential sale of sasktel par for the course
canada,not_removed,the part of the earth called saskatchewan is pretty flat
canada,not_removed,it is in saskatchewan
canada,not_removed,its nice seeing people tell it like it is and not get downvoted to oblivion like they would on ralberta
canada,not_removed,its part of the criminal code of canada to which private property is not exempt
canada,not_removed,i dont believe its legal even on private property traffic laws may not apply but drinkdriving is a crime not just a traffic violation that said other than on a private roadparking lot thats open to the public i think thered be virtually zero chance of ever being arrested for it
canada,not_removed,address it as in this case the that dont agree are putting themselves and the other at risk
canada,not_removed,ok so what are the circumstances you refer to
canada,not_removed,we strive to be like ontario where absolutely no one drinks and drives even rurally s
canada,not_removed,driving drunk on a quiet road is less risky than many activities that are legal this just reinforces my belief that drunk driving has become a particularly rural problem of course there are drunk drivers in urban areas the sheer numbers mean that will happen but people who live or come from the boons seem to think drunk driving is just a thing you do or even a skill to be honed
canada,not_removed,driving drunk on a quiet road is less risky than many activities that are legal its exactly this type of thinking that needs to be combatted you cant guarantee that youll encounter no other cars cyclists or pedestrians on your drive and even if you could youd still be putting yourself at risk driving drunk is never ok if you live in a rural area and have no other way to get home the solution is to drink less
canada,not_removed,i dont agree with you but i see where you are coming from you shouldnt drive after drinking even when you are in a desolate area but i do think if everyone who villifies you for think otherwise had their way we would live in a completely sterile and benign world
canada,not_removed,nothing like driving around slowly in the summertime with a cold beverage on a farm out for a rip like
canada,not_removed,statistically yes they are
canada,not_removed,ya dare bud
canada,not_removed,bac how do so many people have trouble with that you can even google a chart to predict your bac based of weight gender and number of drinks
canada,not_removed,here in manitoba too im sure a poll here would show similar results
canada,not_removed,its probably what you think it is people on back country roads drinking while they drive or driving right after or on the way tofrom a bush party edit drinking to driving typo
canada,not_removed,if youve ever seen dazed and confused its a lot like that
canada,not_removed,the injury rate differential per licensed drivers between saskatchewan and the safest province is roughly percent so although saskatchewan ranks among the worst in the country it isnt like its a death trap compared to the rest of canada
canada,not_removed,ive seen a few who are pretty visibly impaired in broad daylight in regina i have no doubt you have seen that and that is not what the question was asking about because regina is not a rural area especially in the mind of your average person in saskatchewan
canada,not_removed,um no people have heard of the middle of nowhere
canada,not_removed,either that or pretty soon everyone has one and theres no stigma attached to it which leads everyone to believe its alright to do i would be up for a oneweek driving ban let them bug their friends for rides social stigma of being the leech or get dropped off at work in a cab and have to explain why they didnt drive in theres a nice unspoken fee associated with the latter
canada,not_removed,can confirm lots of family there and we drink until the cows come home
canada,not_removed,party plates lead to more drinking and disruptive behaviour i was told
canada,not_removed,you are projecting he didnt say anything about race
canada,not_removed,there was no mention of race in any way unless you count saskatchewan residents as a race
canada,not_removed,i made no mention of race nor did i intend to being sloshed is not limited to a certain skin color if there is a statistical correlation out there it still isnt racism but socioeconomic problems that you jumped to this honestly says more about you than i
canada,not_removed,uhhsaskachewanian isnt a race
canada,not_removed,everything is racist
canada,not_removed,you must be kidding right
canada,not_removed,anyone confused about why bc seems to have a skyrocketing dwi rate but has fewer drinking driving deaths should be aware that the first chart refers to all incidents where people got an impaired related penalty not a criminal charge around bc implemented immediate roadside prohibitions for impaired drivers since these arent criminal charges they can be served with much less paperwork which means the police have more time free to pull over the next drinking driver this oddly means the roads may be safer in part because the police dont have to charge everybody criminally
canada,not_removed,the liquor prices in quebec leave you with enough money left over to be able to pay for a cab
canada,not_removed,out fer a rip are ya bud
canada,not_removed,thanks
canada,not_removed,grew up in rural manitoba and know for a fact a lot of drunk driving goes on even in my final two years of high school we had a few students alone killed in accidents let alone how often ive heard adults talk about the time they were pulled over drunk and got away with it
canada,not_removed,albertas numbers seem higher than they should be as well
canada,not_removed,a driving suspension cost that though
canada,not_removed,i get why thats a reason but i cant stand it if you cant afford bucks you cant afford to drink
canada,not_removed,oh gibbys
canada,not_removed,i think he was referring to that study stating it was more dangerous to walk home drunk than to drive home drunk though i think the education needs to be more along the lines of make arrangements before you need them than now that youre drunk in the middle of nowhere youre fucked so just stay there
canada,not_removed,doesnt make it inherently safe what might make it inherently safe is some combination of real factors including honestly not being fucking wasted and having about as much chance of even seeing a single other vehicle as being hit by a rogue buffalo or even safe to do once in a while frequency has nothing to do with it if you are too drunk to operate the vehicle with perfect precision under the real conditions then you are too drunk and there are no excuses ever the complex set of factors that actually determines that bear little resemblance to the law or any number like
canada,not_removed,this i hate how the law is so preoccupied about arbitrary numbers go after the drivers that are actually being dangerous regardless of the reason
canada,not_removed,the problem becomes how does someone know that theyre only over the limit not everyone travels with a breathalizer im obviously only referring to those that are drunk not just had a beer or two in a couplefew hours
canada,not_removed,a lot of countries have a limit of because thats when most studies show impairment starts id say that provinces setting their administrative limit at is already giving leeway over the scientificly identified limit youre right though that other driving behaviours need to be looked at too its bizarre to me that people who actually drive the speed limit are scorned by other drivers for interrupting the flow of traffic either the speed limits need fixing or people need to slow down
canada,not_removed,can be its not black or white at least for sleeping it off in your car httpwwwmacleanscanewscanadathedangersofdrunkparking in the supreme court went one step further ruling that the crown must prove a realistic risk of danger not merely a theoretical risk in that case the high court upheld the acquittal of a quebec man donald boudreault who was charged with impaired driving after passing out in his pickup truck while waiting for a cab to take him home use of the vehicle for a manifestly innocent purpose should not attract the stigma of a criminal conviction the majority ruled in a decision
canada,not_removed,i disagree about riding a bicycle drunk as you can still cause harm but i do agree that you should be able to sleep it off in your car
canada,not_removed,a cop once told me to stay in the back seat if i was drunk he said you can reach forward and turn the carheat on but no reasonable cop is gonna arrest you for drunk driver if youre in the back seat
canada,not_removed,so if caught riding bicycles drunk we would lose our driving licenses
canada,not_removed,disagree on bicycling at least riding one on the street crashing into something such as a pedestrian or a car while on a bike while not as bad as doing it while in a car is still very dangerous
canada,not_removed,what the fuck driving a bicycle is not impaired driving you must be operating a motor vehicle aircraft rail equipment or vessell edit seriously i see way too much of this shit on this sub if you dont know what the fuck youre talking about dont fucking type anything stop spreading misinformation
canada,not_removed,riding a bicycle drunk is absolutely not ok lots of people die from doing so drunk walking too the only safe way to deal with being drunk is to sleep it off or have someone sober drive you so long as they are good at dodging all the other people drinking and driving
canada,not_removed,theres a big difference between having a drink and being drunk
canada,not_removed,bac didnt think that was malleable or subjective at all what did it say in the study
canada,not_removed,or get a buddy to be the dd or drink somewhere you can sleep or check in at the local hotel if you really need or sleep in your car questionably legal but infinitely safer
canada,not_removed,sigh it is frustrating the gth land deal was pathetic skip the dishes i have mixed feelings on largely because i have not read much about it evening mentioning the sale of sasktel infuriates me especially because now brad wall is going on about the potashcorpagrium merger with comments like well the saskatchewan government will only support it if it makes sense increases jobs and benefits the province trying to being all wise then considers selling sasktel the parts they havent sold off already that is what kills me about that is how many small divisions of crown corps have been sold off par for the course indeed i just hope we do not choose to stay on this same course again
canada,not_removed,how else would you watch your dog run away for three days
canada,not_removed,thank you i hate alberta but its partially why im here im in ohs and my goal is to do what i can to fix the problems here half the shit i hear from these people sounds like a joke but its serious
canada,not_removed,whats your legal background or have you researched it im wanting more that a belief as an answer
canada,not_removed,the that dont agree are putting themselves and the other at risk no what they are doing is not agreeing whether they also drive dangerously drunk is an entirely different question i disagree and i also do not drive dangerously drunk so you cant say im putting the other at risk
canada,not_removed,youre right the rate of impaired driving in census metropolitan areas is as of the most recent stats in saskatchewan also has the highest rate of policereported impaired driving incidents of any province excepting the territories every other province is below incidents per saskatchewan is just below
canada,not_removed,this just reinforces my belief that drunk driving has become a particularly rural problem it certainly is in rural bci cant believe how country dwellers i know carry on and when confronted they point out that the cops only come down our road on thursdays as though that means its ok
canada,not_removed,it happens a lot here in thunder bay too basically anywhere where cabs would be outrageously expensive i remember when i was in montreal i got from the airport to brossard for like bucks or some shit in traffic that was over compare that to my city where its like bucks for a min ride across town
canada,not_removed,i didnt write anything like that maybe read my post again slowly or get someone to explain it to you
canada,not_removed,where is it that they define drunk we have a legal limit on blood alcohol level if youre over youre going to be in trouble should something happen
canada,not_removed,thats one way to look at it the other is that some legals activities arent ok wheres the fervour over fast food drive throughs
canada,not_removed,you dont agree with what that there are things you can do legally that are riskier than driving drunk in a desolate area
canada,not_removed,is that what the study said
canada,not_removed,i think if you did this survey in ontario exclude the gta and ottawa youd probably find the same results people in the country like to drink and drive
canada,not_removed,when i go to family reunions out on farms my farm cousins would routinely get hammered and party until things died down around midnight eg the older generations fell asleep then theyd all hop in a few pickups and drive to the next party three miles over luckily theyd always stagger back around when the rest of us were waking up and getting the pancakes started i was usually drunk too but never impaired enough to get into a truck with a drunk driver
canada,not_removed,i think people fail to understand just how isolated and barren these small communities cant even say small town are detachment with rcmp covering a area live there for a while and you know where they are usually hear about some shit going down where they get called out and you are basically untouchable
canada,not_removed,hell even the towns with a few mounties dont even try when ones called in and at that it still takes them half an hour to show up after the asshole has plowed though another vehicle
canada,not_removed,in new brunswick they call it a bumble dumb decisions know no regions
canada,not_removed,i know someone from the middle of nowhere who called this playing left turn right turn get a case of beer go driving and drink the case
canada,not_removed,road pops
canada,not_removed,i thought it was the police putting a drunk native in their car and driving him to the edge of town to be left to die
canada,not_removed,it was all like that back then remember that movie takes place in austin and its population in the mid was hardly the sticks
canada,not_removed,what stats are you using last time i was looking saskatchewan was the second most deadly province to drive in per km driven second only to yukon both places being like double the place contender
canada,not_removed,i dont think you are reading that right in that document the injury rate on page is per in saskatchewan vs per in ontario which is more not and the sk fatality rate in the column to the left is more than three times ons
canada,not_removed,first there was no question involved second the person you are replying to is saying that the in people arent all rural because at least some of them are in regina tone it down a little or at least reread what youre responding to before you fly off the handle next time
canada,not_removed,a car being in the shop for a week isnt unusual
canada,not_removed,as far as im concerned drunk driving should lead to getting your license completely revoked after a month let them start from scratch again when youre driving youre in charge of a big rolling death machine you need to be able to drive it safely or else youre putting yourself and everyone on the streets near you in danger
canada,not_removed,you think people whove already shown they dont care about the safety of themselves or others or the rule of law would actually not drive if they were banned from driving for a week or longer they will and they probably wont get caught only reinforcing their belief that they dont really need to follow the law
canada,not_removed,a week driving ban for drunk driving why not just scold them or send them to bed without dessert why not a year its supposed to be a punishment for putting other peoples lives at risk for purely selfish reasons
canada,not_removed,i havent read any studies but assuming someone wishes to be a part of society at large theyll see it as a shameful reminder some people you just cant reach but thats why law enforcement exists and a unique plate makes it easier to spot potential trouble
canada,not_removed,well said glip glop
canada,not_removed,some do have green blood
canada,not_removed,and thats assuming only a monetary issue
canada,not_removed,sure you can maybe you can afford for the beers but not the next for the cab im not defending drinking and driving but its completely reasonable that some peoples budget might allow a night out but not a one
canada,not_removed,the problem becomes how does someone know that theyre only over the limit not everyone travels with a breathalizer protip if youre not sure if youre too drunk to drive you shouldnt drive that said determining ones approximate bac is a simple calculation based on weight time and amount consumed heres a httpwwwimpaireddrivingdefencecombachtm alcohol elimination rates vary between mgs per hour however so best to assume unless you have good reason to believe otherwise
canada,not_removed,you missed the part about the arbitrary limit which means completely different things for different people
canada,not_removed,most people know their limits
canada,not_removed,its absolutely not my wife is impaired at around she slurs and fumbles and definitely shouldnt drive im pretty sharp at and not noticeably impaired is a safe threshold i dont have an issue with it but we have to admit that it is arbitrary in the sense that it attempts to apply one number to millions of people with different physiology and base driving ability in a perfect world we could review everything case but case and do a full assessment but i understand that a legal limit makes persecution easier i just take issue with people who this issues are so black and white
canada,not_removed,no youre wrong it is entirely arbitrary thats how the ontario system defines it because people could win their dui case with science pre based on charter rights but ontario banned the practice and changed the legislature so they could get higher or guaranteed convictions on drunk drivers many provinces followed suit theres proven cases where a man at wasnt impaired at and that was proven in court this is why ontario now charges the accused with being impaired and over separately to to push the conviction agenda the government knows you may not be drunk but that doesnt help their bottom end dont sound so high and mighty when you dont even know the full story
canada,not_removed,drunk walkers cause harm too should we give duis for that
canada,not_removed,see the thing is that you should be right but there are unreasonable cops and the law should bring all cops to a standard of reason rather than hope our officers are good people im not saying they arent but id rather not get arrested by the one bad
canada,not_removed,whats your definition of driving then maybe you would think differently on the topic if everyone just operates their vehicles does it still carry the same distinction why shouldnt a drunk bicyclist on the roads be held to the same standard as a drunk motorcyclist
canada,not_removed,having a drink that is still not a precise description its a weasel term and i wont accept it some people might have several weak drinks over the course of a long evening maintaining a mild and pleasant glow of mild intoxication without ever being too drunk to drive safely they may or may not be over the blood alcohol limit depending on local laws if they are actually intoxicated enough to impair their driving significantly then they are too drunk to drive safely are you trying to avoid dealing with this issue factually for a reason
canada,not_removed,the article was for under the influence which is usually legally defined at bac also since thats a relatively small amount of alcohol anything over drinks in an hour for most i dont think many in the study were basing their answer off anything below
canada,not_removed,you do know that deep sub zero temperatures are very common in saskatchewan right are you trying to advise drunk people to death by freezing thats not very wise most of them would be safer driving home a little drunk obviously not if they are wasted
canada,not_removed,its hard to justify when its a minute drive home to most of my friends
canada,not_removed,clearly its not just these factors atlantic canada is actually and yet it has a
canada,not_removed,you say dangerously drunk as if there were a safe drunk to be driving
canada,not_removed,what does this mean exactly
canada,not_removed,sure what can you do legally that is more dangerous to other people
canada,not_removed,the study asked if respondents agreed with the statement driving under the influence is ok if you are travelling a short distance on quiet roads
canada,not_removed,truth welcome to the rest of ontario please drink and drive carefully
canada,not_removed,likely a correlation between lack of public transits affordable taxi rides lack of enforcement and how often people drink and drive regardless of where it is
canada,not_removed,well if rural ontario had a subway system opinions might change
canada,not_removed,i had a buddy in rural ontario that drove with a beer in his cup holder this was years ago so i dont ghoul hed do that today
canada,not_removed,thats quite the sweeping generalization i would think drinking and driving is more common in cities than rural areas but then again i dont have any data to back that thought up just like you made an ass of yourself and made a prejudicial remark against a group of people only because of where they choose to live
canada,not_removed,what a great term for a sad thing too bad ive known people who got killed when the pickup truck they were in the back of rolled because the drunk driver put it in the ditch and yes this was in ontario stupid choices know no regions i agree
canada,not_removed,no thats different thats either a starlight tour midnight ride or a frozen mukluk
canada,not_removed,what the fuck
canada,not_removed,it takes place in a small town outside austin
canada,not_removed,edit dont be jaded read the data updated you are right in the fact that saskatchewan is significantly higher in raw numbers than other provinces but that is based on drivers or kilometres driven so on a percentage basis of likelihood it is actually only a fraction of a percentage different when compared to other provinces the difference between cents and cents is justifiably insignificant when compared to dollars and dollars in this case raw numbers dont show the real value compared to ratios edit i am not justifying drunk driving lets just not distort the data
canada,not_removed,first there was no question involved the article is about a survey question where in agree its sometimes ok to drive drunk in rural areas the person popsiclejesus answered was referring to those in the people who answered the question and living in regina doesnt mean you cant hold that opinion about other places people drive drunk in regina but that was not the question and fewer people would have said its ok tone it down a little or at least reread what youre responding to before you fly off the handle next time screw you tell that to popsiclejesus who opened with like fuck they are
canada,not_removed,i suppose so
canada,not_removed,thats already what they do httpswwwsgiskcaindividualspenaltiesconsequencesroadsidehighbachtml httpswwwsgiskcaindividualspenaltiesconsequencesroadsideindexhtml id say theres an issue with education on the consequences though consequences can only act as a deterent if people are aware of them and these charts arent the easiest to find or understand
canada,not_removed,this is nice but will result in a lot of people trying desperately to cover and even lead to people covering for others not to mention increasing numbers of people driving without a license
canada,not_removed,i was hoping the ban would be short enough that they wouldnt risk breaking it
canada,not_removed,i got the rick and morty reference very nice have an upvote
canada,not_removed,there are vulcans in sk and they drink alcohol
canada,not_removed,who only spends for a night out beer is each
canada,not_removed,im just picturing the look of shock on my friends face when she discovered from one of these that of wine is not the one cm from the top of the glass that she typically pours we give her a measuring cup to drink from now just to tease her
canada,not_removed,forgive me if im wrong but im pretty sure the bac means the same thing to different people just how much you drink to get to that level changes as your tolerance goes up it takes more booze to get your bac up but two people with the same bac that may have drank different amounts due to tolerance are the same level of intoxicated im no scientist thats just something from smartserve certification
canada,not_removed,i did mean placed the decimal in the wrong spot was supposed to be this is what ive been saying though people shouldnt be drinking and driving
canada,not_removed,but you do have a way you could just go get the keys and then drive or if you leave your car at home you could still steal a car and drive it or if youre not drunk you could go to the bar get drunk and then drive thats what makes such an interpretation stupid we cant be punishing people based on their ability to do something wrong far as im concerned if its in park or the parking brake is set and its properly parked it should be legal any other interpretation punishes responsible behaviour and gets into precrime territory
canada,not_removed,growing up i was always blown away by hearing stories of police charging those sleeping in their cars with keys on them with impaired driving sometimes the car was on to keep the owner from freezing to death what good does charging these people do i knew many who would just drive home drunk because it would be the same charge if they were found sleeping in their car so they thought they might as well chance it and try to make it home seems to have the effect of encouraging drunk driving in that case
canada,not_removed,technically speaking being drunk in public would be considered public intoxication but unless youre making a complete fool of yourself would be ignored if anything a drunk person might be endangering themselves rather than risking other peoples lives
canada,not_removed,that is all it can result in in saskatchewan anyway
canada,not_removed,i have enough trouble not driving into cyclists who are sober and randomly cutting across busy streets i dont want to be the unwilling implement of someones suicide because they were drunk on a bike and decided to enter vehicle traffic at off a blind sidewalk
canada,not_removed,its ridiculous to ruin someones life over a drunk bike ride tell that to people who get run into them by drunk cyclists
canada,not_removed,you must be operating a motor vehicle aircraft rail equipment or vessel his definition was pretty clear
canada,not_removed,holy fuck im not even going to entertain this stupidity read the impaired section of the criminal code it starts at section
canada,not_removed,no because factually what i was saying that someone shouldnt be driving drunk which is exactly what youre saying not sure why theres any disagreement
canada,not_removed,do you know that drunk driving is very common in canada and kills or injures people in source madd source statscan for incidents year right are you trying to advise drunk people die by attempting to drive home thats not very wise most of them would be safer arranging alternate transportation than driving drunk at all i actually cant believe the fucking amount of impared driving apologetics in this thread country its not ok to drive while under the influence of anything fuck people yes obviously if youve had a couple glasses of red with dinner fucking drive home if youve had a few beers at the pub with your mates after work fucking drive home if its been more than that no fuck you the legal limit is very reasonable and is set intelligently everyone is different but you dont get pulled over and breathalyzed for driving properly yes i am advocating for people sleeping in their cars im from ab i am aware of the sask climate i have on multiple occasions over winter slept in my car when i was not able to drive guess what im still alive for the days when its or below yeah its not gunna work but if its like a mild november night throw a coat on and sleep it off you dip i also gave the possibility of many other methods like getting a designated driver or taxiuber if possible or finding somewhere to stay
canada,not_removed,i wonder what would happen if you called the cops for a ride home if it was subzero and you were drunk
canada,not_removed,a minute drive is a minute walk just fucking walk
canada,not_removed,as if there were a safe drunk to be driving there is sometimes a safe drunk to be driving it depends on a bunch of complex factors that are specific to each and every individual situation
canada,not_removed,the way that youve qualified this is very telling am i supposed to be a mind reader or do you expect everyone else to assume and agree with your bullshit insinuations to the extent you dont even have to mention them directly
canada,not_removed,distracted driving and speeding both cause more accidents doing either in busy traffic would have a higher risk of injury or death but most people wouldnt consider them as taboo as driving drunk even on an empty road at night even if you dispute the relative risk that obviously doesnt mean im saying drive drunk instead
canada,not_removed,so that could mean one beer to some people
canada,not_removed,the next station is kapuskasing kapuskasing station
canada,not_removed,ghoul
canada,not_removed,still happens today i would never buy the guys i work with regularly drink and drive
canada,not_removed,sure probably because theres a significant population differences but id bet anything that a higher percentage of people drink and drive in rural areas simply due to the lack of public transit and cost of cabs all im saying is theres more options for people to not drink and drive in the cities where in the country you have to have a dd if you want to get home which many people dont do there also seems to be less stigma lots of people brag about how they got loaded and went for a rip
canada,not_removed,as a kid i remember my parents receiving calls over time about people who had died from drinking and driving from parties they all had just attended made an impression
canada,not_removed,i wonder why native people are angry
canada,not_removed,frozen mukluk quoting this for future use
canada,not_removed,google only knows about starlight tour not the other two
canada,not_removed,pretty sure i frozen mukluked a friend once he was one pissed native
canada,not_removed,no im pretty sure thats called a murder at least where im from
canada,not_removed,httpwwwmacleanscanewscanadanewlightonsaskatoonsstarlighttours
canada,not_removed,i think it used to be whats the preferred term now i probably should have said native person instead of just native im gonna assume from the downvotes that some people think native isnt the right word but god forbid you tell me the right word so i can avoid offending people
canada,not_removed,it is pretty soon didnt you read the article that being politically correct has gone too extreme even the english think so pretty soon our kids will be able say lets play cowboys and indians again instead of cowboys and natives or cowboys and first nations
canada,not_removed,in sk native is exceedingly common at least it was the years i spent there its not really a pejorative per se they often use the word themselves and its not antagonistic ive heard much worse slangs for them growing up there from the obscenely racist to the benign
canada,not_removed,im honestly curious where you found this because everywhere ive seen it says a suburb of austin
canada,not_removed,page in the pdf has the national casualties graph on the left and the breakdown of fatalities and casualties on the right here i made you a picture i think youll agree that is at least three times and i admit to typing out the wrong number for sks injuries but i read off the wrong line and its actually which is even worse at divided by more than on
canada,not_removed,the survey was about quiet roads not rural roads so their comment is perfectly valid
canada,not_removed,huh thats good here in bc youll just get a fine and maybe vehicle impoundment
canada,not_removed,the vulcans are in alberta
canada,not_removed,watching nothing but riders and putting on green makeup apparently does that to you the more you know
canada,not_removed,people who can only afford to spend
canada,not_removed,roadside capability test if you can do all the things required to be in control of a car then go ahead and drive there are many people who would fail the test completely sober who should not be on the road
canada,not_removed,imo should be that way there is no confusion
canada,not_removed,this is incorrect your bac is a simple matter of weight and amount consumed tolerance makes no difference to your initial bac after consuming alcohol although a heavy drinkers bac may drop faster when a person has developed a higher tolerance for alcohol they will appear less drunk than an infrequent drinker with the same bac
canada,not_removed,thats not how alcohol works man
canada,not_removed,i never said i drink and drive i live in downtown vancouver i dont need to im just saying that pretending an alcohol limit is some gold standard is like saying a single speed limit can apply to every road in town some roads that are could safely be some should we just pick a number for simplicity
canada,not_removed,your charged with both if you plee your charged with one if you fight they will try to convict you with both charges so that escaping a conviction is highly unlikely
canada,not_removed,his van was his home
canada,not_removed,talk to me when theres actually a problem of cyclists getting drunk and mowing down pedestrians or dont i understand if you have to check with your nanny first strangers on the internet might be dangerous you know
canada,not_removed,seriously its hilarious that they have more sympathy for the person who gets caught then they do the victims of the crime kind of sums up our justice system though
canada,not_removed,i was saying that someone shouldnt be driving drunk is not the same as what i said if they are actually intoxicated enough to impair their driving significantly then they are too drunk to drive safely your statement lacks precision it is ambiguous and that is a real problem because many people will fail to make that distinction in the right place because the real discussion was never had and they never learned how not to make the mistakes
canada,not_removed,let me start by saying thank you for this yes obviously if youve had a couple glasses of red with dinner fucking drive home if youve had a few beers at the pub with your mates after work fucking drive home i mostly agree but with genuine caution because even a few beers is sometimes too much im not advocating or apologizing for people driving while significantly impaired call it anything you like too drunk is a good term because we fucking well know that a little drunk honestly just a little for real just a little is often safe depending on the circumstances and that varies all the time in a bunch of ways it depends on the road conditions the traffic the persons own response just that exact moment none of this can be generalized and the blood alcohol measurements are a poor indicator but you dont get pulled over and breathalyzed for driving properly except in every road block ever and they make you blow in those minidetectors without a second thought if theres even a hint or doubt you could possibly have had anything to drink which means a lot of perfectly competent people get nailed when their actual performance would have been absolutely safe and acceptable and i wont even go into the cases where people are convicted for sleeping in a vehicle with the engine running to stay warm which is exactly on point in saskatchewan and most of canada im actually sick and tired of madd type people apologizing for and pushing draconian laws on us that actually worsen the problem because people just give up and say fuck it and do stupid shit when they should have been encouraged to have fun more responsibly when we set limits wrong it can actually do more harm than good finally do you know that drunk driving is very common in canada and kills or injures source madd people a year i hate to say this but i cant trust that statistic because madd are dishonest and this is demonstrated fact eg ive seen credible analysis showing those numbers likely get stretched to include accidents where anyone at the whole scene was drunk including a drunk passenger riding in a car with sober drivers they are too political and are pushing for total prohibition of alcohol and will say anything to further their agenda i think they are a horrible group that will actually harm the cause much more than they help it which is usually the case with fanatics
canada,not_removed,the problem is the legal limit is just a rough estimation on intoxication by random science it by no means is the beallendall for each individual ive been derided for this before but a few drinks for me and id blow under but a few drinks for someone else with low tolerance and theyd blow over people are different this extends to the amount of booze you can have over time and not be intoxicated here ill give you a thought experiment can you drink beers and still drive the answer is yes if you space the beers out everyone knows this and the pacing is what keeps the whole plausible deniability aspect of the so called apologists on this thread or any other about drinking in check not only that but the limits are also arbitrary my might feel like your aka not intoxicated your might feel like my it cannot be solved by random regulatory restrictions soon there will be zero tolerance for blood alcohol i mean why not who is to say that blood alcohol doesnt impair you to some degree were voting in people who will eventually do this some asshole scientist funded by madd will say so and the government will make it a law simply to control you more its pathetic authoritarian bullshit
canada,not_removed,madd is not a source it is a shitty and long outdated organization that has outlived its purpose and should just go away at this point
canada,not_removed,that depends if the only number they have is then you better have honestly slipped and fell on the bottle that ended up inside you or have been locked out in the cold and in an emergency otherwise making the call is misuse of emergency services im not going to say its impossible they would help you but i think you would need a damned better excuse than i was too stupid to plan ahead or i dont feel like sleeping on my buddys couch
canada,not_removed,ok well to make an analogy i play a lot of sports and have a good reaction time does that mean i get to drive faster than the average person
canada,not_removed,doesnt fit the black white narrative please check yourself in for reeducation and have an upcheers
canada,not_removed,given that drinking impairs judgement how the hell are you supposed to trust yourself to make the call of whether youre a safe drunk to be driving just stay below the legal limit or figure out another way to get home
canada,not_removed,autocorrect on my phone strangely i wrote think
canada,not_removed,its a rural ontario thing she was drinking tequila and baileys shooters all night no ghoul shes puking now
canada,not_removed,have we not yet figured out that autocorrect on phones does this
canada,not_removed,to live there youd have to
canada,not_removed,you should not drive with your parents
canada,not_removed,jesus thats fucked up
canada,not_removed,funny thing when the police kill someone they tend to get away with it
canada,not_removed,sweet mercy thats positively evil
canada,not_removed,i dont see why native would be unacceptable but i also see a lot of use of first nations and indigenous
canada,not_removed,i watched it while on a plane yesterday in the end scene they are driving through open country from their town to austin which is why i say its just outside austin id can understand if imdb or similar sites would say a suburb of austin
canada,not_removed,oops you are correct it is quiet roads not rural i stand by the idea that a fair majority of respondents in saskatchewan would make the same association and answer accordingly they would envision remote places not a quiet urban street if you care about what they mean that is what they would actually mean
canada,not_removed,actually bc is similar its a bit different because you dont have to be convicted in court for non criminal offenses so theres a day prohibition instead of an indefinite one theres still an appeal process but having it be optional means a lot less wasted court time and cop time read taxes being spent so someone can take a day off work to show up and say yeah you caught me im guilty it goes back to the education thing everybody gets told in school that dd is bad because it can kill people and it is because it does but that is the worst case scenario and people have trouble believing that it will happen to them and seeing the consequences to themselves getting pulled over by the police is a more realistic scenario so we should tell everybody what actually happens when you are so it cant be minimized in the brain of a drunk person thinking about driving as probably a slap on the wrist
canada,not_removed,thats only the ones undergoing ponfarr
canada,not_removed,then why would you even go out
canada,not_removed,with the exception of roadside stop programs you arent pulled over under the suspicion of being impaired until youve pretty much already failed what could be considered a capability test if a cop is asking you to take a breathalizer its because they have a reasonable suspicion to believe youre drunk typically this involves crossing the line while driving or otherwise driving erratically you generally already dont appear safe to be on the road by the time youre being pulled over for drinking and driving
canada,not_removed,thats unreasonable youd have people getting their cars impounded for using mouthwash before work and besides its simply not true that any amount of alcohol impairs you so severely that you cant safely operate a motor vehicle i want to save lives at much as the next guy but there comes a point when you need to rely on people doing the right thing and not police every little aspect of our lives ive been through ride checks where i admit to having consumed alcohol but i also include times and amounts and ive only ever been asked to use the breathalyser and i blew just gotta not be a dumbass and if youre worried about other dumbasses theres probably a hundred other ways you could die at given moment
canada,not_removed,but then how do you get home from the bush party
canada,not_removed,god dammit if i cant stop by the pub and have a pint on my way home from work or have a glass of wine with lunch im just going to flip the fuck out whats next permission slips to go to the bathroom do i need my local rcmps permission to stay up past midnight we are not fucking children and can assess risks on our own every once and a fucking while
canada,not_removed,its not that they appear to be less drunk its because they are less drunk its straight forward science
canada,not_removed,should be allowed to have the car turned on in the winter someone will freeze to death charging people like this just gives them an excuse to chance it and drive home
canada,not_removed,talk to me when theres actually a problem with drunk cyclist having their life ruined because of a ticket
canada,not_removed,what im saying is that its never okay to drive drunk im really not quite sure what youre getting at here as it is absolutely not ambiguous
canada,not_removed,as i said elsewhere i just put the madd thing up as a disclaimer to take it with a grain of salt the government reports incidents vs madd reporting injuries i agree that madd is fucking horrendous except in every road block ever and they make you blow in those minidetectors without a second thought must be a bc thing gone though tons of them and all that ever happens is that the officer will ask where im coming from and if ive drank never been breathalyzed only time ive seen that happen was after my buddy went through one and said hed had half a bottle of red wine and wanted to try it out so he knew where the limit was i guess he knew he was fine to drive so did the cop wouldnt have breathalyzed him if he didnt ask and he blew a and was fine
canada,not_removed,what is pathetic is people justifying driving drunk look again i know that the legal limit isnt perfect but its a pretty good measure the vast vast majority of people will blow under if sober and over if impared ive driven literally hundreds of times after consuming alcohol but i have never once driven drunk theres a limit and the government of canada says that your body may think that its and maybe that is it for you but maybe its just drunk you thinking you can get home
canada,not_removed,yeah thats why i put the disclaimer thing take it with a grain of salt the government reports incidents
canada,not_removed,that might be reasonable a little bit under certain circumstances where the speed difference does not cause miscoordination by surprising the expectations of other drivers of course if you want to make the case then i suggest you make it and best of luck getting laws changed i have pretty good reaction times too because i concentrate fiercely and take driving very seriously so if i have a chance to be tested and prove im worthy of an exception ill be glad to try to avail myself of the opportunity i would suggest that it seems unlikely to see more than an extra granted and only then notwithstanding any officers opinion that youre causing undue hazard as a result that seems like a relatively small advantage to fight for but i wont deny it would be nice meanwhile i dont even have to argue the point because we already recognize in law that people with full licenses in bc can drive legally with some alcohol in them and that amount was chosen based on safety which means you can be slightly drunk and drive safely according to the law is is so shocking that i not only agree but think the idea could use a little refinement in order to allow a better match between actual ability which varies by the individual and the freedom we ought to accord people for doing anything that doesnt actually hurt other people or are you the kind of person who simply likes to declare things illegal regardless of values like actual harm and freedom
canada,not_removed,ikr you think people would at least notice their own goddamn laws even allow people to drive with significant blood alcohol level and therefore there is a safe drunk to be driving according to the law i wonder if that might have anything to do with balancing safety and responsibility against other values like freedom crazy idea i know cheers
canada,not_removed,given that drinking impairs judgement you must recognize the exact same claim is true about lack of sleep and yet in spite of impaired judgment from many possible sources many people still know their own minds sufficiently well to judge their own condition with sufficient accuracy in order to accept your statement at face value we have to completely ignore the vast majority of people who in spite of being strongly drunk and impaired still manage to recognize by feel that they are too drunk to drive the vast majority successfully know what you claim they cant trust themselves to know they dont have to count the drinks or blow in a machine they know by internal feeling they are too drunk to drive and they therefore dont drive in fact most people even hesitate when they feel even the slightest bit tipsy even if they would be legal to drive because they are sensitive and because they care even though their judgment is slightly impaired how can this possibly be possible i wonder if nobody can ever trust themselves because of drinking any alcohol in order for you statement to be true consuming alcohol would have to completely annihilate peoples ability to choose not to drive everyone who got drunk would be utterly incapable of choosing not to drive if you said hey lets go they would never hesitate and they would jump behind the wheel totally oblivious to the fact they have been drinking but almost nobody does that because almost everybody knows they are too drunk the exact same internal knowledge also successfully tells most people when they are not too drunk the shitty reality here is that a small minority of people do indeed sometimes become incapable of making the judgment accurately because the alcohol does impair their judgment and your statement becomes true for them at those times other people get might get legally caught out by the factual difference between blood alcohol and impairment eg i know a guy who got a day suspension over glasses of wine he had over a long dinner date who wasnt drunk and was both shocked and mortally embarrassed that he blew just over the limit in a road block because hes not a fucking idiot but his blood alcohol being just over the warning limit of was not representative of his very real lack of intoxication at that time fwiw im talking about a phd geophysicist in his mid not some year old who drank a pack at a party a vast majority of people learn to be self aware mature adults who know their own minds reasonably well and behave accordingly
canada,not_removed,im recognizing that even though my not dangerously drunk driving is usually below the legal limit doesnt mean im not actually somewhat drunk and doesnt mean its not a very real scale where the legal cutoff numbers are a matter of law and not a matter of natural fact if you want to declare my conduct legal and therefore not drunk then you are a fool who is distracted by proxies to the important metric of concern impairment by intoxication sadly we dont even try to measure that
canada,not_removed,this also isnt just a sask thing this has definitely happened in ontario ive had family members who years ago had to provide care to fns whove been found on the outskirts of town nearly dead after being taken into custody downtown
canada,not_removed,because indian got a negative connotation then native got a negative connotation aboriginal got a negative connotation indigenous and first nation so far havent gotten the negative connotation but give it time
canada,not_removed,everybody who was born in canada is a native so using that word to mean just aboriginal people is confusing you are including millions of people that you didnt mean to include
canada,not_removed,im sure they said they are driving to
canada,not_removed,but those numbers in the document are literally number of injuries or fatalities per drivers in the province ie how frequently a bunch of drivers would have injuries or fatalities if you grabbed ontarians or saskatchewanians read the column header these are not the total numbers for the provinces
canada,not_removed,a very canadian exchange updoots all around
canada,not_removed,when our politicians do it they might sometimes get a stern talking to
canada,not_removed,to enjoy the company of your friends over a few drinks
canada,not_removed,good if youre impaired but capable theres no reason to be pulled over
canada,not_removed,or not signalling or going over the limit or whatever the cop feels like saying he saw you do
canada,not_removed,it was expanded because of overzealous madd hysteria
canada,not_removed,dd
canada,not_removed,well they can stay home and drink then
canada,not_removed,youre right i was unclear how drunk one is is subjective a measure of the effects of alcohol not an objective measure of bac what i meant was that if you take people of the same weight and age one a heavy drinker and one light give them both x number of drinks and then check their bac minutes later they will be very similar a field sobriety test however will often demonstrate that the heavy drinker is less drunk
canada,not_removed,they just have more practice drunk is only a scientific term if you attach numbers which means theyd be equally drunk as an infrequent drinker who matches their bac a frequent drinkers neurotransmitters may have adapted to a state of intoxication which makes them better coordinated and clearer minded so assuming better coordinated and clearer minded less drunk my comment was stupid i still dont think people should be allowed to drive on the road with alcohol in their system though people may think theyve got a higher than average tolerance but be wrong and those who do are at risk of seizures if they start withdrawl
canada,not_removed,its also worth pointing out that tolerance to the obvious symptoms of intoxication eg stumbling slurring develops more rapidly than tolerance to the overall depressant effects of alcohol thus a person with a tolerance for alcohol might appear nonimpaired and capable of operating a motor vehicle but is in actuality still at rather high risk for being delayed in their reaction to any unforeseen circumstances eg pedestrian crossing animal in road though the legal bac limit might seem arbitrary and it is by no means a perfect system it is in fact rooted in a fair deal of science and is in all actuality a pretty good compromise balancing public safety with personal liberties
canada,not_removed,ive seen a study that compared liquors because people say they get more fucked up on tequila all the time conclusion of the study alcohol is alcohol maybe when you drink beer thats all you drink but when downing the you have some water in between
canada,not_removed,bull fucking shit youre telling me you can drink a of vodka or whiskey without even being noticeably drunk ya right bud i dont fucking buy it most people can barely handle a mickey let alone a ive never even seen someone finish a to their face
canada,not_removed,have you ever heard of someones life being ruined because they were bicycling drunk
canada,not_removed,what im saying is that its never okay to drive drunk what exactly do you mean by the word drunk be precise because lives are literally on the line
canada,not_removed,im glad when cops are reasonable which is most of the time that having been said things are anything but perfect i would love to see some kind of video game machines in bars that test driving skills for signs of impairment and make a fun game out of people learning when they are functionally impaired and when they are not im going on the principle that no amount of laws and policing will ever stop this problem people are always their own first line of defense if they know how more self knowledge is better and that is why i fight the prohibition attitude that tries to shut down the whole discussion with impossible absolutes if you want to get crazy with the idea i could see making tests available to people you would pay maybe to attend an afternoon drunk driving class where you would also get tested and could earn a license exemption allowing slightly higher blood alcohol because you proved you can handle it not much higher just a little maybe or depending on the results at the same time you would have to sit through some scary heart wrenching shock films and you would get a really good demonstration of watching people fail and comparing the self reports with actual tested performance carrot and stick at the drivers expense but go ahead and even try to have that conversation with the madd types around and all that happens is you get shut down im strongly against impaired driving by any cause full stop but as long as there is any lack of honesty and clarity about when alcohol actually causes functional impairment people will keep thinking they are exceptions and they will keep making mistakes people need to be their own police but they will refuse as long as the advice is zero tolerance which is obviously untrue
canada,not_removed,ive driven literally hundreds of times after consuming alcohol but i have never once driven drunk theres a limit and the government of canada says that your body may think that its and maybe that is it for you but maybe its just drunk you thinking you can get home do you realize how hypocritical you sound right now sask residents would literally just use the same argument against you im ok to drive says me never caught
canada,not_removed,you seem to contradict yourself you admit that an ability based system would be a regulatory nightmare with little payoff then you suggest we use that system for alcohol do you view the payoff of being able to drive a little more drunk worth it as for your all caps will make my point point thats just semantics i think the majority would say anything below wouldnt be called drunk or intoxicated the limit is what lawmakers define as drunk or not based on study you want a better system based on ability but the truth is there is no better system available bac already accounts for many differences between people genderweightmetabolism and it isnt exactly a tragedy for the few it doesnt i take a libertarian view on many things but it shouldnt come at the cost of other peoples safety and liberties its just completely unnecessary when there are easier ways the real tragedy is the lives lost and broken to people with poor judgement ie alcoholics that believe they are safe the numbers say that bac is the balance between safety and personal liberty however even the most hardcore libertarian would struggle to argue for that level after experiencing real alcohol caused trauma
canada,not_removed,theres probably variations of it everywhere hell even rambo basically starts with the same boost through town even in urban centres like toronto there was always the infamous cherry beach express
canada,not_removed,it happened in vancouver the guy was soaking wet and it was actually cold for once cant remember his name tho
canada,not_removed,and still many would have us go back to indians which is super clear no ambiguity there
canada,not_removed,cheers
canada,not_removed,well gordon campbell was in hawaii so i suppose thats a jurisdictional issue and i think we lost a couple soliciter generals but a quick google looks like that was for speeding but it does kind of feel like every other year we hear about an mla doing something stupid on the road and not getting in trouble for it with their party we could take it as evidence that the cops at least still pull them over people with money affording better lawyers seems like a universal constant though maybe politicians should have to use legal aid
canada,not_removed,legally they need more than just not signalling to ask for a breathalyzer not saying they wont use that to pull you over though and then might hear slurring or seeing blood shot eyes etc not saying all cops follow this but they are suppose to under the charter
canada,not_removed,thats not how drug tolerance works
canada,not_removed,you fucking kidding have you not read any of my comments ive never once said its not ok to drive after drinking im saying its not ok to drive drunk those hundred times have been after for example a beer with dinner putting me at like bac well within the legal limit my personal sobriety and all measures of common sense the difference is between beers over an hour and beers over an hour the latter is the dangerous one and what this entire conversation op article and everything has been about if at any time in my life i was pulled over by a police officer and breathalyzed i wouldnt blow over and yet like i said have driven after consuming alcohol many many times can these of sask residents say the same obviously not thats what this entire post is about there is no getting caught because no law was ever broken
canada,not_removed,the numbers say that bac is the balance between safety and personal liberty however even the most hardcore libertarian would struggle to argue for that level after experiencing real alcohol caused trauma i remain unconvinced that is the right number or that a significant amount of the harm is caused at numbers anywhere near that low you talk about the problems caused by alcoholics and i agree but that has next to no relationship with it has everything to do with serious addiction and far more serious and frequent drunkenness at which point laws are scarcely a deterrent if you want deterrence a cop told me the zero tolerance for young drivers during the graduated license program has saved something like of the deaths and that makes sense given things like party culture and young people having poor sense of realism or self control in many cases giving them no excuses makes sense im not even going to argue that all older adults have successfully developed the necessary selfregulation and its true that some of them would still do well to face a zero tolerance because they tend to go out of control when they drink but there are some large majority of adults that are very responsible and capable and many of us have safely and responsibly driven at alcohol levels that are illegal this can have a significant impact on the quality of our lives especially as the laws are perpetually edged towards lower and lower numbers as though some magic number will finally solve the problem it wont it will just make life suck that much more for so many more people because we lose the freedom to enjoy ourselves in many situations and this when we know damned well the majority of the problem are extreme cases that wont be solved by tweaking a number down by yetanother bac either justify an absolute ban complete universal zero tolerance or face the real debate of how much is really too much and why in all its terrible dimensions the fact is people see an absolute ban as unreasonably restrictive and given that it probably cant solve the majority of the remaining cases we merely end up criminalizing normal behavior for diminishing returns btw im sick of things being a regulatory nightmare were strangling ourselves desperately for no good reason not because it would be hard to live with different laws but because its often impossible to consider changing the laws in the first place due to pure bureaucratic resistance example we whine about wanting better fuel efficiency all the time yet here in bc we see people outside cities driving trucks everywhere often because thats the one vehicle they have and can afford to keep insured even though they seldom need the capacity how about allowing one person to insure two vehicles that share a single plate let them have a truck for when they need it but drive a small car the rest of the time charge a small extra fee for tracking two vehicles and huge fines for driving without the single rear plate attached shit this idea almost makes sense but forget ever fucking seeing anything like it actually happen i mean few people in vancouver could give a shit so why bother with the hassle of trying to fight government to actually change anything for the better in creative ways besides nobody will actually profit fuel vendors will even lose money so fuck all other possible priorities the same obviously goes for something as totally arcane as actually allowing people to individually demonstrate their abilities and be licensed accordingly in order for them to enjoy their freedom when that wont harm anyone who gives a shit right i give a shit at a point in history when were talking about the need for universal basic income because robots are putting people out of work maybe we ought to make a little more time for allowing edge cases
canada,not_removed,there you go i didnt know canada bothered with those tests i thought it was just based on blowing or blood test for bac following the link you provided i wont dispute that some of those tests are plainly relevant to measuring impairment but i will suggest most are still subjective and partially fallible and aside from officers having observed erratic driving they are still ultimately proxies for the fact the criterion also include bloodshot or watery eyes flushed face and odor of alcoholic beverage amongst the signs which clearly have nothing to do with ability to drive nor even impairment and undermine the purely functional purpose of the assessment i think we should consider driving simulator tests which effectively directly measure a persons ability to drive instead of relying on secondary indicators modern pcs and gaming controller hardware would make the hardware cheap to do a sufficient job of this this is relevant because were about to legalize weed and there is no way to blowtest for it if the suspect can pass a minute simulator maintaining concentration and reactions to within safe levels it would be hard to argue they are unfit to drive or deserving of sanction it could also become standard practice to expect people to pass such tests for license renewal and this would help screen out unfit drivers based on nonobvious factors such as dementia age related inability or even just pure scatter brains im arguing that we should directly test ability to drive as an end goal for numerous reasons instead of relying on proxies you were right that we do test some important reactions and skills but they are still not driving ability itself
canada,not_removed,yep cherry beach immediately came to mind i dont think they still use that location but i know a few that got the ride in the sixties and seventies
canada,not_removed,i still remember being super confused as a kid because all the adults who grew up with the first nations people being called indians now called them natives but still called people from india east indian i always wondered where the fuck all the west indians were
canada,not_removed,which always annoys me as a mixed person whose heritage includes indianfrom india the constant im not that kind of indian spiel i have to give gets damn annoying
canada,not_removed,you dont divide a percapita number by the population count i still dont think you understand that the numbers in that table are not the total number of deaths or injuries in each province in they are the total numbers already divided by the population count of each province so for example according to first data column with percapita counts in the table on page in ontario with people according to the had road fatalities whereas saskatchewan with people had road fatalities note that a province with about twelve times as many people only had about three times as many total fatal collisions and that is reflected in the ratio of sk on or in other words sk people are times more likely to die in a car crash than if they lived in on
canada,not_removed,itd be great if politicians were forced to use the services that are handed out to poor people who cant afford luxuries itd be a great way to make sure theres an acceptable standard of living for everyone
canada,not_removed,it would be nice if the world ran on supposed tos
canada,not_removed,a direct quote from last fall im pulling everyone over who leaves the bar tonight not much going on
canada,not_removed,youre right i meant to just attack the idea of drunk being a scientific term but my comment on reread is pretty much just wrong
canada,not_removed,haha no clue man id stick to beer if i was you ave dat money
canada,not_removed,i was actually thinking about this afterwards i can think of two people who have as well one had to get his stomach pumped and the other who well was just a big drinker that being said both were fuckin smashed so i stand by my point that theres no way you werent noticeably drunk ill take your word for it that you did in fact drink that much but dont stand there and tell me that youre completely fine after drinking a but slurring your speech after a few beers like buddy said before me thats not how alcohol works
canada,not_removed,there is no getting caught because no law was ever broken right not broken if you dont get caught
canada,not_removed,as far as the limit goes i have to leave it to the people who have actually taken a good look at the numbers although i dont think raising it would help anything it isnt ruining your life to take a cab home after some drinks if you cant afford that or cant find a better way then maybe you should be worrying about other things to improve your life rather than drinking i agree that the most dangerous ones are the addicts i also agree that most would be fine if they were a little over i think theyve been improving the system by allowing more discretion from the officer to impose less detrimental punishments to those they view as minor offenders and more detrimental ones for repeat or dangerous offenders theres just not much way tell them apart without a history i guess i could agree with your tangent about insurance but that has nothing to do with regulating drinking ability from person to person what would you suggest a quick stop in the icbc bar before the alcohol tolerance driving test
canada,not_removed,i always wondered where the fuck all the west indians were kicking ass at cricket httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwestindiescricketteam
canada,not_removed,and you would have been right there is a west indies httpsenwikipediaorgwikiwestindies but as a kid in sk yeah good luck with hearing about the west indies i mean some days when im feeling particularly generous i can give a slight pass to people from sk knowing they could have easily grown up knowing hearing at all about the world i mean at least in my town we had the indian family who wasnt actually indian at all but closer than not
canada,not_removed,yes were an entire country full of unique people with voices worth being heard canada is not run by the wellmeaning populist views it is run by people
canada,not_removed,everyone is welcome in canada even altright people im not inviting them over for bbq but whatever they can come if they want its all good
canada,not_removed,i think everyone is overestimating the numbers of alt right the alt right are a fairly old group internet wise having been around since when donald trump began to be popular some of his followers began looking for a way to describe themselves and appropriated the term alt right groups that followed donald then began realizing that the original alt right had white supremacist thought in it so they decided to begin calling themselves new right which is essentially trumpism so you have old guard alt right the white supremacists the new right who took the name alt right and the people who just call themselves the new right you can see how this may confuse people on the size of the original alt right movement
canada,not_removed,looking at these comments it would seem canadians are so rigidly polite they tolerate well nazis
canada,not_removed,leitchs definition of elite isnt the worst one ive ever heard actually
canada,not_removed,is it really constructive making hairsplitting distinctions between old shitty white supremacists and neonazis and new shitty white supremacists and neonazis
canada,not_removed,i dont believe theyre nazis and we have lots of crazy people in canada with crazy beliefs
canada,not_removed,i refer to people who dont respect facts as dumbasses climate change is a hoax youre a dumbass tax cuts plus more government spending will reduce the debt youre a dumbass nasa didnt go to the moon you better believe youre a dumbass does that make me an out of touch elitist
canada,not_removed,whats yours
canada,not_removed,yes or else wed become like mccarthy and communism were everything even remotely resembling communism is communism
canada,not_removed,oh no im not an altright person i just couldnt comprehend how she was calling people elites given her station in life but her definition made more sense when i read it here
canada,not_removed,mine has the same outoftouch component to it but its still wealthlocation based
canada,not_removed,i dunno i feel like theres a difference between mccarthyera demonizing of any imagined connection to communism however faint and tenuous and this older group of overt white supremacists and neonazis who make no attempt to hide that theyre white supremacists and neonazis and this newer group of overt white supremacists and neonazis who make no attempt to hide that theyre white supremacists and neonazis are pretty similar so why split hairs thats just me though
canada,not_removed,see the difference is that leitchs definition is worth caring about
canada,not_removed,this older group of overt white supremacists and neonazis who make no attempt to hide that theyre white supremacists and neonazis since theyre usually not totalitarian i doubt theyre nazis again a distinction is made theyre also a really really small group and this newer group of overt white supremacists and neonazis who make no attempt to hide that theyre white supremacists and neonazis are you referencing the new right theyre not white supremacists they dont follow any of the tenants of such an ideology like race realism or scientific racism theyre just conservative nativists following behind trump
canada,not_removed,no
canada,not_removed,ohhhh tough talk i think if the elites became the rich elites shed get more traction
canada,not_removed,looks more like the face of someone who let one rip and realizedthere was someone behind them
canada,not_removed,my husband is in the industry though not in development he would tell you to get a degree in computer science or something that allows you to do software development get a day job and make games in your spare time independently where you set the pace the games industry is known to be brutal to their workers i was just at a bbq tonight with a few game devs from well known canadian studios and they were talking about the horrendous shit they had to go through long hours shit bosses boring work now they all make independent games they do it because they love it
canada,not_removed,is there a specific area in development youre looking to get into modelling world building design if youre interested in modelling or graphic design colleges will offer more handson experience i dont know many colleges actually in toronto but sheridan and niagara college have some good programs and are fairly close by if youre interested in a more academic angle ive heard great things about ryerson if you have the grades to get in brock also has an ok program theyre a little lacking in terms of what they offer compared to ryerson but their program is probably the most flexible out there if youre not sure what area youre specifically interested in
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,thats an unnecessarily narrow field just learn computer science and pick up game making skills on the side
canada,not_removed,i dont have an answer but i wanted to say that college is definitely worth looking into i went to university and then college and college was much better for getting experienceconnections in the career youre after
canada,not_removed,go for comp sci its worth far more than game development as it gives you a fall back when you burn out of game dev in years
canada,not_removed,im interested in every part of it really but im looking for specifically coding since its the most useful and since its what im current taking for high school httpswwwfullsailedudegreesgamedevelopmentbachelorcourses except the whole cram it down into months part
canada,not_removed,its a massive industry at the moment but also very competitive
canada,not_removed,whats the difference
canada,not_removed,if youre serious then you need to go to waterloo there is no better place for programming
canada,not_removed,i find college is more hands on more practical experience and assignments geared towards getting the skills you need to actually do the job university is more theory and big picture stuff you have to learn more skills independently and outside of school
canada,not_removed,okay ill check out waterloo
canada,not_removed,oh i thought they were just two different words for the same thing
canada,not_removed,he probably didnt go to a good university go to a school with a well established internship program if you want experienceconnections look into pey uoft coop waterloo
canada,not_removed,jokes aside it wont really matter that much isis hate it when they are called daesh however in arabic daesh still refers to them as a state d dawlat state a al islam islam e erak iraq sh sham the levant syria lebanon jordan palestine
canada,not_removed,the terrorists hate being called daesh just as those who insist that they be called isis hate the acronym by which they are known c citizens u using n nouns t terrorists s sanction edit settle down yall its a joke
canada,not_removed,jokes aside it wont really matter that much isis hate it when they are called daesh there is no evidence for that beyond articles that say allegedly
canada,not_removed,i could care less to be honest the can call themselves dick heads for all i care we refer to them as the hypocrites because they hijacked islam and are hurting muslims all over the world
canada,not_removed,does it really matter whether they like it or not theyre terrorists period us muslims are f suffering because of them they should be called sissy names that gets them going crazy
canada,not_removed,islam has been pillaging europe for the last years it was never hijacked
canada,not_removed,does it really matter if it didnt matter then why even mention it
canada,not_removed,you realize other countries have done this right this isnt a justin thing
canada,not_removed,thats your opinion and youre entitled to it
canada,not_removed,im not the best person to answer this and i hope that you are not just trying to instigate a never ending debate here i cant speak for the millions out there but i personally believe that many parts in religion are adaptable and should be reviewed over time so for example while i totally respect my religion as well as that of others i do not believe that going on conquests today is the way there were reasons why it was done back in the day but were almost years later now and times have changed because technically speaking we could be saying the same thing about other religions who had a history too whats done is done and i dont feel the need to justify or defend what happened back then were here now in more on a personal level i could tell you that i do not agree with several of the teachings in my religion because i dont think they are applicable anymore i respect and observe the fundamental pillars but the branching teachings need to be reviewed that said being a practicing muslim has never been an obstacle for me to be part of canada for example i grew up in this amazing and beautiful country and i love it to bits im so proud of being canadian a muslim canadian read my previous posts and comments to get a feel i have friends from all faith and racial backgrounds i treat them with respect and courtesy i dont impose my ideas and beliefs on them if im asked to explain why islam does this or that ill explain it with the best of my knowledge and i wont condescend or show that im superior i never told my employees not to drink alcohol when we have office parties because im muslim i live in canada so im the one that has to accommodate others not the other way around ill drink non alcoholic beer with them or order virgin drinks why not by doing so id be showing the real definition of islam not by objecting and criticizing every single detail and asking for unreasonable accommodations by the way the argument of the prophet expeditions and imposing islam by the tip of the sword is a classic but so did others ill not condemn it nor defend it it happened i cant deny it but what about the millions who entered islam over the decades and who never seen a muslim army south east asia has some of the largest muslim population and no one imposed it in them they became muslim through dealing with muslim ship merchants and they were impressed by their values professionalism and honesty friend i understand the frustration that people all over the world feel now towards islam and if you feel angry we feel helpless and we are totally depressed with everything we see on tv and read in the papers i wish you a lovely day
canada,not_removed,what i meant is we shouldnt really give much importance to the name its the content that matters most
canada,not_removed,no its a historical fact the crusades started in httpsenwikipediaorgwikicrusades
canada,not_removed,so what should i do apologize its historyits done a gone you want to hate me for that
canada,not_removed,i dont think id want to answer that because it will only instigate more hate one thing though i said i do not condemn what the prophet did it had to do at his time as for the murder of the kid youre referring to no sane person muslim or not agrees with that no matter what i strongly condemn it and always will thanks for the exchange i really appreciate you took the time to write all that
canada,not_removed,its so great that youre telling a muslim how to believe a faith that you dislike way to go pal youre a real citizen unfaithful nagging a theologian
canada,not_removed,youre still a c for telling others how to believe their faith
canada,not_removed,death cult you mean like the dominant canadian religion that worships some zombie dude fuck yerself
canada,not_removed,youre still a for telling others how to believe their faith
canada,not_removed,i read about this when they fist thought of it back in november and i remember reading a lot of comments that this was an overreaction at first i thought they were right and that things wouldnt be as bad but now im glad they did this
canada,not_removed,theres a misconception about the whitehouse website the new administration doesnt change the website of the previous administration it replaces it presumably previous versions are available on the httpsarchiveorgweb
canada,not_removed,this article uses the word science when discussing climate change quotes and everything omg the democrats are going to try to stop climate change wah wah wah its trash
canada,not_removed,not a single mention of trumps antinafta rhetoric which would have big effects on canada this is a dreadful article
canada,not_removed,the democrats under the influence of collectivists and socialists such as bernie sanders and elizabeth warren are clearly driving the partys policy regime off the centrist track and turning sharply left this where i stopped reading
canada,not_removed,of our exports go to the usa it doesnt matter which candidate wins that number is going to shrink and many branch plant jobs are heading south luckily for us we have been assured that we are diverse so none of that goofy economic shit will matter any more
canada,not_removed,what a rag no mention of trump wanting to destabilize the world as we know when he backs out of nato that should scare the shit out of everyone then downplaying global warming which i believe is the biggest threat to the worlds political economic and ecological stability we are facing in the next years
canada,not_removed,nope im not going to be petrified of the sane candidate im more worried about the number of people that support the nonsense that is trump
canada,not_removed,hilary is more of the same from obama so improved markets improved stability some shady black ops shit nobody likes but heres the thing she will do what is needed to keep things stable sure she will do offensive shit but at least shes not asking russia to hack the us to support her cause she will do bad things but nothing near what trump will causethats not even fear mongering just taking trump at his word which i admit is laughable
canada,not_removed,quick somebody get this guy a soapbox how else is going to sell his snake oil
canada,not_removed,we should be petrified of both
canada,not_removed,whose we oh trump supporters damn right
canada,not_removed,yeah ill take clinton shell do a great job especially if both houses can flip
canada,not_removed,one of the worst articles ive ever read trump will destroy canadas economy and nato protection he is a cancer to our country
canada,not_removed,we just need more women in power its called diversity fusion and will make us shit gold gold prices are about to drop
canada,not_removed,the united states were isolationists until they didnt mingle in other countries affairs they werent the planetary police force after that changed and they became what we know them as today there is now an estimated foreign us military bases worldwide eight hundred bases trump is actually the only candidate short of sanders that has actually determined that hey maybe we should rethink our foreign policy considering the amount of money they spend and the trouble they are in financially it makes sense to take a few steps back and let other nato allies shoulder some of the load isnt that the point of nato its not a team if one member does of the lifting canada as being part of nato should be spending of gdp on its military as a country we need to decide are we part of nato and a contributing member or are we not over the past years it seems as though we are half heartedly supporting our military yet still attempting to fulfill our nato requirements placing massive strain on our equipment as well as our men and women in uniform eventually somethings got to give
canada,not_removed,does that hurt a lot when we shit gold
canada,not_removed,it is a requirement for nato members to do so nope its a guideline and very much not a requirement
canada,not_removed,saying he wont defend members of nato is akin to pulling out and saying he specifically may not defend baltic states against russia is destabilizing if he wants to renegotiate or enforce nato policies thats something you do in private you dont announce to the world that the alliance is in question thats just stupid
canada,not_removed,our colons are unbowed unbent unbroken
canada,not_removed,yes a spending goal it still doesnt change how under funded undermanned and over tasked our military is
canada,not_removed,right now earning puts you in the top of earners if that seems extremely low to make sense then it would pay to party attention to the people with as much wealth as the bottom million when you have such a small group holding such massive wealth even jobs that used to be middle income jobs are top tier imo the tax system needs to catch up with the reality of income inequality in this country right now its completely skewed to benefit the tippy top
canada,not_removed,economists worry about high marginal effective tax rates because they weaken the incentives for people to earn extra money by working additional hours or investing in their skills — actions that increase a persons current and likely future earnings if you consider working and earning more income but you will only keep a portion of each additional dollar earned you will assess the costs and benefits of doing so if the amount you keep is too small you may decide not to expend the extra effort who are these economists unless your marginal effective tax rate is greater than you still end up with more money than you had id never turn down an opportunity to make an extra a year even if i knew id only get to keep of it thats still a year i dont currently have
canada,not_removed,worst change made so far by the liberals completely disgusting
canada,not_removed,depends on how much extra work you have to do for the extra might be better to choose to work a hour shift on saturday then it is to do a job that gives you an extra
canada,not_removed,well you might not turn down opportunities at a marginal tax rate of but theres plenty of people that would
canada,not_removed,meh id rather not work and scale down the amount i work if im only keeping though unfortunately thats not how things work and i cant scale my employment at will like that
canada,not_removed,he will probably be the author of your econ textbook
canada,not_removed,or to spend less
canada,not_removed,if you have less to spend sure
canada,not_removed,for some context the new parenting bill samesex parents will no longer have to go to court — spending thousands — to get legal recognition allowing them to register births in the same way heterosexual couples do oosterhoff is the new progressive conservative mpp he is years old was homeschooled was elected by rallying support from his fundamentalist church and is staunchly opposed to homosexuality in general the pcs were trying to delay his confirmation until after the same sex bill passed to make sure he couldnt voice his concerns about the bill as the pcs are trying to shift towards the center and appear less socially conservative the toronto star managed to get a hold of him despite this and he has made his socially conservative views quite clear folks im not a fan of the ontario liberals either but i really hope our province doesnt give these gay bashers any kind of power at all this is the kid that has power in our province httpsiimgurcomnbtaoebjpg
canada,not_removed,amazing when they ask him a question he starts talking about being a summer councillor its like my first job interview
canada,not_removed,would someone get that ignorant home schooled year old fool off the stage jesus christ the fuck is wrong with conservative voters that this dipshit ended up with a microphone
canada,not_removed,ladies and gentlemen i present to you the bullet oosterhoff that will take off the reaming toes of the progressive conservative party in the next election 😏
canada,not_removed,so much for a strictly fiscal conservative coming out of the cons so corrupt libs or corrupt social cons meh i always vote ndp anyway
canada,not_removed,patrick brown must just roll his eyes every time this kid speaks oosterhoff is distracting from the party by taking a stand on shit that was settled before he was born sorry kid but canada believes in equality maybe he can just accept that and have mom read him a bedtime story when she tucks him in tonight
canada,not_removed,ontario pc had a good chance last time around but chose to talk about sex ed vs hydro ontario debt and lost patrick brown just a few moths made sex ed an issue people have moved on going against thse social issues wont win the pcs ontario
canada,not_removed,ffs the writing is on the wall with this kid he was home schooled in a very religious family i would bet money that hes deeply closeted and has a breakdown someday and comes out as gay last thing the tories need it socially regressive mpps like this brown is trying to move the party forward and this indoctrinated social conservative will be such fodder for the olp
canada,not_removed,its like all the pc party in ontario knows how to do is lose
canada,not_removed,i dont mind conservative ideology when it comes to finance or governance we all have different ideas but hearing personal judgments on the lives of my friends and i from an elected official with power over the laws that bind us is disturbing i will not support such people in word or deed and i am disgusted by browns pandering to these fundamentalists giving them a voice and influence in his party doubtless sam oosterhoff would like us all to live in pastoral ethnically homogeneous rural religious communities as is his only life experience but its pretty fucking insulting to have to listen to him tell us how to live our lives the pcs electing this idiot teen are really showing their colours the colours of ignorance and intolerance fuck em says i
canada,not_removed,if it was horrible legislation why wasnt he there to vote his job against it instead of planning a party not so much his job
canada,not_removed,if i hit him over the head with my hockey stick what would break first my stick or his hair gel
canada,not_removed,i am now super confuse how a child can have four parents but there is some common sense now a parent can go after the other partner for child support even if its not their biological child it was often the case where we would see a partner that didnt want to have anything to do with the child if the partner cheated and got pregnant
canada,not_removed,why cant we have a socially progressive fiscally conservative alternative to the liberal party you would think that a modern equivalent to a bill davis or peter lougheed would win in a landslide today
canada,not_removed,there is nothing discriminatory in the existing laws regarding parenthood even heterosexuals have to go thru the courts to have judge approval changes or adoption the leftists simply hate ppl with family values and obviously wynne is playing this to her base shes intentionally provoking the right so her sjw followers can start calling others as bigots
canada,not_removed,an inspiration for all progressives
canada,not_removed,wow it takes a kid to speak some senseyou have my vote down the line ooster
canada,not_removed,staunchly opposed to homosexuality in general what does he want to do about it make it illegal
canada,not_removed,dont you just wish this province would figure itself out politically its been a mess of terrible choices for quite some time now
canada,not_removed,the pcs are trying to shift towards the center and appear less socially conservative why are they straying away from their base
canada,not_removed,a parenting bill reminds me of the time i looked after kids at summer camp
canada,not_removed,u realize he was elected precisely because of his socon credentials his constituents were very well aware of other candidates with bigger names than his and still picked this guy
canada,not_removed,one could only hope but for some reason everyone seems to think the pcs are better than the olp and not just the same thing but with bonus antigay people httpwwwthreehundredeightcompontariohtml
canada,not_removed,and trump was supposed to be the republicans bullet being reprehensible doesnt keep people out of office
canada,not_removed,id love to give them a chance but im hesitant to see them in power after seeing what theyve done in alberta
canada,not_removed,ontario pc had a good chance last time around but chose to talk about sex ed vs hydro ontario debt and lost what in the fuck are you talking about sex ed wasnt an issue until after the election during the election hudak talked plenty about debt and hydro costs but didnt even touch social issues he lost because his fiscal plan was incoherent the ontario electorate doesnt care about social issues one way or the other they never have its the economy stupid if the liberals run on nothing but social issues theyll be crushed
canada,not_removed,im not convinced everyone who is rabidly antigay is just worried theyre gay too he was clearly brainwashed from a young age youd think tomatoes were a tool of satan why else would they be so red if thats what your parents chose to drill into your head
canada,not_removed,i would bet money that hes deeply closeted and has a breakdown someday and comes out as gay he may simply be dog whistling while religious conservative men seem to have a hilarious tendency to secretly crave man ham and then get caught soliciting it they cant all be closeted unless they are
canada,not_removed,theyre still winning httpwwwthreehundredeightcompontariohtml
canada,not_removed,he wasnt sworn in yet so he couldnt
canada,not_removed,i am now super confuse how a child can have four parents two biological parents divorced married other people
canada,not_removed,socially progressive fiscally conservative alternative to the liberal party the liberals are the party the pcs brand themselves to be they claim theyre socially progressive and that the liberals arent fiscally conservative when the pcs are actually socially conservative and the liberals to half of the spectrum are too fiscally conservative privatizing public assets being accused of undervaluing the public sector those type of things that the public pick fights about are ideologically conservative platform pieces the key difference here is varying degrees of fiscal conservatism the pcs are historically more incrementalist than anything we know that the pc party wants less but how much less generally depends on the moment you can typically count on them to suggest less taxes than the liberals by a relatively small margin save for some extreme measures like the job cuts which like the million jobs plan were more branding than anything the liberals are a centrist party to the left wing of the party they come across as far too businessoriented and fiscally conservative ie net zero across the public sector for years theyve been increasing the degree to which the average person subsidizes small business and industry pretty much since they entered office for better or for worse you can point to corruption and lack of transparency but those arent inherently liberal things back in the davis days there wasnt a lot separating the liberals and the conservatives and theyve moved apart from each other but i think at this point theyve largely moved closer together in recent years aside from an increasingly extreme rhetoric employed by the pcs
canada,not_removed,why cant we have a socially progressive fiscally conservative alternative to the liberal party vote splitting in a fptp system party forces as well as right wing people themselves are afraid of forming an alternative right wing party in fear of splitting the vote and handing perpetual power to the liberals a pc party with a chance of winning is better than two right wing parties with no chance
canada,not_removed,just so youre sure this is the guy youre talking about httpiimgurcomnbtaoebjpg you think homosexuality is a sin and are upset that our society accepts it
canada,not_removed,looks like it yeah or at least make society shun it again
canada,not_removed,thats what you get when you have a province larger than some countries sharply split between rural and cosmopolitan urban areas the kinds of cultural and political divides we have in ontario are an inevitable result of being too big and split along urbanrural lines
canada,not_removed,theyll never win an election if they dont
canada,not_removed,they can afford to there is no other right wing party for their base to vote for so they can tell themselves its just strategic chess they dont actually mean it they really do hate gays just as much as us
canada,not_removed,theyve lost all of the elections this century by catering to their base
canada,not_removed,thats because that region of ontario is all related or go to the same church
canada,not_removed,to be fair to the people of niagara west glanbrook while there was a significant socially conservative contingent which won him the nomination and probably voted for him in the byelection most likely voted party line any pc would have won that race which is why its really sad that the pc party didnt refuse his nomination you cant say we dont hold those views and then still give those people a voice in your party
canada,not_removed,hence the fuck is wrong with conservative voters
canada,not_removed,theyve always rode high until they opened their mouth remember they where also in the lead to win in the last election until hudak opened his mouth with job cuts million new jobs and down that ship went i never understood how the pcs kept getting chances after all the mishaps in previous elections and the harriseves era even the ndp cant shake the ghost of bob rae years on
canada,not_removed,literally anything is better than the overly comfortable olp the outright deception and negligence may be coming back on them theyve promised to stop the outright stupidity and wasting of taxpayer dollars through two separate governments no change from the inside
canada,not_removed,hey now dont believe all the criticism out here
canada,not_removed,i suppose i should read up on their post election status not being in or from alberta i genuinely forget about em after their provincial election
canada,not_removed,sex ed isnt even an issue you will always have your vocal minorities but the pros outweigh the cons knowledge is not inherently dangerous for children of any age they will seek it regardless
canada,not_removed,i have seen this played out before looks like victorythen someone starts talking about gay people
canada,not_removed,probably
canada,not_removed,didnt think about that could even be six parents then
canada,not_removed,freedom of expression includes faith therfore both are valid opinions
canada,not_removed,and use dog whistle politics to signal that
canada,not_removed,can confirm used to live there
canada,not_removed,refusing the nomination has its own set of problems as well personally i have no issue with someone holding different views that i dont agree with winning a nomination or election it doesnt matter what party someone belongs to there will always be outliers like this if he doesnt follow the party rules he will get kicked out and sit as an independent i do think that sam will continue to be a lightning rod for the pcs over the next two yearsbut maybe he will gain a larger perspective being exposed to other views for reference im a socially liberal fiscally conservative conservative that voted ndp in the last provincial election
canada,not_removed,the better question is why the ndp are judged so harshly the liberals have got plenty of second chances from mcguintys broken tax pledge to the gas plants to ornge meanwhile the ndp and bob rae have thoroughly disowned each other yet people still use him as a reason not to vote ndp its bizarre
canada,not_removed,man i think were still a generation away from the ndp getting any legitimacy back itll be a sad two way race until then
canada,not_removed,they have been pretty alright but the whole lets increase minimum wage by like dollars in a recession thing didnt strike me as the most thoughtful idea lol
canada,not_removed,i also support the curriculum but it was more than a vocal minority opposing it were showing disapproval at one point compared to approval like it or not that means it was an issue
canada,not_removed,i can only hope but their margins have never been this wide before either
canada,not_removed,its all good as long as they leave room for jesus
canada,not_removed,they are valid opinions in that they are opinions and are legal to state they are not equal in terms of validity in the sense of being discriminatory based upon a trait someone is born with
canada,not_removed,no religion ends at the person holding the views they dont get to enforce their nonsense on society and before you complain about marriage equality heres a tip you dont have to marry someone of the same sex if you dont want to other peoples marriages are not your concern just like yours isnt my concern
canada,not_removed,what what does that even mean i support freedom of expression id defend this guys legal right to make an absolute ass of himself do you support this guy and his antigay views or not if youre saying its a valid opinion that homosexuality is a sin thats pretty concerning
canada,not_removed,there is a difference between the right to free speech and a valid opinion people will not be imprisoned for preaching the sun revolves around the earth but it is absolutely not a valid opinion
canada,not_removed,personally i have no issue with someone holding different views that i dont agree with winning a nomination or election its not that i dont agree with them its that i dont agree and the pc party acts as though they dont endorse them but refuses to have a backbone it would be like if the liberals had communists in their caucus and still professed to be a modern capitalist party it makes the party fundamentally wrong about its own character if he doesnt follow the party rules he will get kicked out and sit as an independent thats the thing the party is making excuses for it they cant enforce any rules because theyd lost a third or more of their caucus they let people vote their conscience on things like this which is why certain members just dont show up when its something they disagree with the party on id be shocked very happily shocked if they kicked him out of the caucus for his views
canada,not_removed,its always been bizarre mention to anyone that your thinking of voting ontario ndp and theyll go into the bob rae screwed the province over story the problem is with a stubborn voting block on the left that is still bitter from the ontarios ndp time in office that causes a vote split when people switch their votes from liberal to ndp but will vote liberal in droves if where to stop the opcs from taking power the ontario pcs know this and have used this split to their advantage by monopolizing the right side of the spectrum hence why you see two different competing ideologies from the opcs but why they havent suffered their wildrosereform party split moment
canada,not_removed,the ndp betrayed the public sector unions with rae dayswho will never forgive this sin in reality they likely saved huge amounts of public sector jobs by temporarily lowering wage expenditures through jobsharing parents pass along the rhetoric to their children who have no memory of the ndp government and it becomes a mantra of they were the worst government the province ever had when in reality the ndp was more or less on par with opc and olp governments in terms of general ineptitude with the added bonus of having to deal with a recession as well as obstructionism from key government partners such as various police services and business leaders who wanted the ndp to fail and be discredited as a governing force
canada,not_removed,well at least they mean well
canada,not_removed,polls are predicated on people who agree with it taking the time to answer the polls people who are displeased with something go out of there way to make it known people who are happy do not generally wast there time about stupid shit no one protests in agreement with that in mind a approval rating might as well be while a disapproval rating might as well be its incredibly rare to be thanked for a good job vs being chewed out for performing a bad job by a factor of or more thats just people kids however are resourceful you cant isolate them in a world where ever person carries around a device allowing instance access to pretty much anything imaginable they are better off having as much information as possible so they can learn how to consume evaluate and rationalize information rather then just taking it at face value you are there to guide them not dictate
canada,not_removed,well the olp is pretty bad
canada,not_removed,i find it interesting that in your opinion a gay person deserves full respect and any speech going against or disagreeing with its practice is discriminatory and yet someone with faith who carries out a life following the words of their religious text can be discriminated upon catholics in particular represent over of our countries population never mind other faiths which homosexuality is not only frowned upon but condemned when ooster declares his willingness to imprison or treat gays i will call it out but alas this overreaction is all too typical nowadays
canada,not_removed,billions of people many in the developed world follow common faiths that disagree with its practice however we treat people with the law and grant them freedoms like any other person to expand upon and normalize homosexuality in society does nothing for its own benefit propping people up for acting in their own self interest seems rather odd to me whereas a nuclear family is a desired outcome due to its mutual gain to both person and community
canada,not_removed,in reality they likely saved huge amounts of public sector jobs by temporarily lowering wage expenditures through jobsharing it really was shortsighted for the public sector to draw such a hard line on that better to have someone who shares your values and makes concessions with the opposition than someone who rejects it completely on the other hand the ndp desperately need a new leader in ontario i was sure horwath was gone after but shes still here and she severely lacks substance and sincerity
canada,not_removed,like i said i support the curriculum so you can stop trying to convince me the change was good i agree with you and thats not why im posting the definition of an issue is a point of political discourse there are enough people who dont like sexed that discourse is happening whether you like it or not dismissing them out of hand breeds resentment which can lead to populists like donald trump and rob ford i think your complaints about polls are utter nonsense forum is a wellrespected pollster and they use statistically sound methods but for the sake of argument if you dont believe polls how are you coming to the conclusion that sexed opponents are a vocal minority i could just as easily claim the opposite by pointing to all the anti sexed signs i saw in my neighborhood and you would quite rightly dismiss it as potentially unrepresentative
canada,not_removed,yeah but id really rather not have all of olps corruption and mismanagement and cronyism plus bonus gay bashing fundamentalism
canada,not_removed,catholics do not represent of canadas population httpsenwikipediaorgwikidemographicsofcanadareligion
canada,not_removed,in what way is it discriminatory to ask you to treat people with respect or to suggest that you go along with the evidence that says that there is no appreciable difference between a same sex couples parenting and a heterosexual couples parenting it is not discriminatory to suggest that youre a bit of an asshole for hiding behind a book and claiming your opinions are not to be subject to any scrutiny because of it your religion is just that your belief religion should have zero sway in politics especially in terms of rights for individuals who are discriminated against on the basis of some trait which was determined at birth and the discrimination is typically based on religion you dont see gay people going around and saying that heterosexual people shouldnt have equal rights to gay people if they did id say that person is a bigot and an idiot youre making a ridiculous false equivalency and parroting the persecuted christian line of argument which is hilariously sad
canada,not_removed,what part of a catholic life is discriminated against
canada,not_removed,i find it interesting that in your opinion a gay person deserves full respect and any speech going against or disagreeing with its practice is discriminatory and yet someone with faith who carries out a life following the words of their religious text can be discriminated upon yes because that gay person isnt publicly denouncing catholics as dirty shameful people freedom of expression does not mean that there is equivalent validity between my personal choices and your decision to call me a heathen for those choices to most of the country live and let live is the modus operandi as soon as you start shitting on someone elses life youre the one in the wrong regardless of what religious text youve used to relinquish personal accountability for your actions freedom of expression is a legal concept it does not mean that if you can state it it is valid or acceptable it means you wont be sanctioned by the government for it
canada,not_removed,except oosterhoff doesnt want to treat them the same as everyone else he doesnt want the law to be equal for them as it is for nongay people thats the entire point of this post that oosterhoff because of his christian beliefs does not want to treat gay people the same as everyone else its why patrick brown didnt swear him in until after the bill had passed and his past comments on his facebook page show how he really feels
canada,not_removed,billions of people many in the developed world follow common faiths again what does any of what you just said have to do with anything we are talking about its like youre rambling on about unrelated topics in an effort to derail the conversation and the fact that youre supporting a gay basher
canada,not_removed,lets go back to the days when gay people had to get married to the opposite sex and raise families everyone knows when mom or dad are in the closet and hate their lives thats a recipe for a healthy family and community no chance of anything going wrong there
canada,not_removed,and that doesnt even say who simply identifies and who actually practices my mother for instance identifies as catholic but she doesnt practice has no issues with any gay people
canada,not_removed,oh please the priests can take care of that part without government help
canada,not_removed,the part where they arent allowed to discriminate against others s
canada,not_removed,he calls it a sin billions of people agree it is a sin i dont have to agree with everything every person of faith says about the topic to the degree that i can disagree with legislation preventing civil unions or required treatments being gay in the eyes of the faithful is a sin but something the religious text tells us is not to judge others to allow god to do so we are not to punish them we teach those who listen to not follow in their footsteps
canada,not_removed,are we going to speak in hyperbole or can we act like mature people as i stated if that was ever presented i would be outspoken as a majority of catholics have over support of civil unions however the faith and natural history has given us the framework of success and the greatest chance of both happiness and success on average comes as a result of the nuclear family hell single parent families are disasters for any economies i would rather all gay than all single mothers dare i or any politician say something that contradicts your opinion though we are all open to free speech and open dialogue except when it triggers someone and makes them associate the opinions with some radical future involving slaves and electrotherapy
canada,not_removed,thats a very reasonable position of faith to take but given that he won his nomination largely on the basis of religious fundamentalists with no record no interests and not even enough life experience to know what his parents hydro bill was can we really separate his political views from his public religious positions why else did he run why did people vote for him in his nomination he is nothing to anyone if not a religious fundamentalist if this were a old who had otherwise been a stellar advocate for his community or an active champion of a good cause that would be one thing but this kid has no other public positions and the first thing he has done is spoken out against the party line in a manner which is clearly motivated by his biases he has lost the benefit of the doubt already
canada,not_removed,so aside from your obvious issues with divorce and death how are civil unions going to affect anything what difference does being able to raise a family under a civil union have from raising one under a marriage to another man or another woman are you trying to say gay people just shouldnt have kids because that would involve sterilization and a whole bunch of other human rights issues also your natural history comment is unfounded the romans and other cultures integrated gay people thousands of years ago and they were pretty successful until they were all hacked to death by your ancestors and the dark ages began
canada,not_removed,he won because its a traditionally held conservative seat the liberals are reaching record low popularity and he is an outsider
canada,not_removed,he won because its a traditionally held conservative seat yes and in the conservative nomination race which ultimately decided who became the next mpp he won because hes a religious fundamentalist the point is that this old has literally nothing else going for him he cant even claim to be a new youthful perspective or to represent the issues of his cohort because he has no basis on which to relate to them so youre saying look the other way if hes not pushing his perspective on people but he already has and that perspective is the only identifiable thing about that kid usually mpps have pet issues passions etc and if they dont have particular issues they want to direct attention to theyll join a party which reflects issues they believe in the party sam joined does not reflect his issues and he doesnt have the experience or the insight to even pretend to care about the issues they are focusing on hes a wasted seat
canada,not_removed,sam is a signal that the conservative party is engaging in meaningful change by adopting a younger face paired with its national counterpart lead by strong women the belief that all conservatives are fundamentalists is as ridiculous as saying all muslims share views with isis just as claiming sams view of homosexuality is akin to those who wish to treat the gays with conversion therapy he has everything going for him and his win proves that the same cannot be said about wynne a lesbian women leading the most influential province only to have record low popularity
canada,not_removed,sam is a signal that the conservative party is engaging in meaningful change by adopting a younger face paired with its national counterpart lead by strong women are you a direct relative or have you not been paying attention there is not a single progressive conservative i know who thinks that sam oosterhof or rona ambrose for that matter are indicative of meaningful change oosterhof is only a signal of anything positive if the only thing you ever learn about him is his age the rest of it is repulsive to average conservatives if oosterhof meant meaningful change patrick brown wouldnt be having an aneurysm every time he had to speak in public about the kid
canada,not_removed,brown is a result of losing mutiple elections badly to the liberals all while the ndp gains ground sam represents the right wing that is less interested in being right of centre and more clearly right as the liberals have done nationally we conservatives have become weak allowing wrymkin to be a protected identity wheras believing in the word of god is a vice done far from the public for fear of scrutiny
canada,not_removed,we conservatives have become weak allowing wrymkin to be a protected identity wheras believing in the word of god is a vice done far from the public for fear of scrutiny this is a ridiculous comparison piety and faith are absolutely accepted in our society they arent as revered as they were before but theyre nonetheless accepted what is no longer accepted is being judgmental and disparaging to someone for aspects of their life which have no bearing on yours admittedly those who are devout may have taken a bit of misdirected flack for it but it isnt because of the faith so much as the assumption which isnt always correct that you intend for that faith to be imposed on the unwilling some of my best friends are extremely devout people but we dont clash because they arent critical of my lack of faith and so long as that stays the same i have no reason to be critical of their faith thats the distinction if your views do no harm on a balance of probabilities no harm will be done to you on account of your views theres one valid connection that can be made between kin type identity politics and christianity and it is not that they are inherently contradictory but that the same factors which have disparaged christianity are the factors which encourage whatever we call this new phenomenon that factor is do no harm i dont profess to understand why people identify as animals and im not convinced theres any truth to it but i dont care what you want to call yourself there isnt protection for nonhuman identities btw wheras believing in the word of god is a vice done far from the public for fear of scrutiny specifically on this topic this reminded me of something i learned back in school matthew and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly your faith is not a vice but it need not be public either faith as i understand it is a deeply personal matter
canada,not_removed,what is no longer accepted is being judgmental and disparaging to someone for aspects of their life which have no bearing on yours every facet of modern culture rejects the influence of faith be it modesty being humble respect and kindness to all these lessons that had once been taught through faith in schools has been gutted and replaced with simple reviews of world culturesfaiths when faith is propagated through culture we see its effects across society and removing it has done nothing but cause a form of moral collapse in which we praise and reward the most vulgar in our world while a persons belief in god and their connection to him is personal a societies connection to its faith is vital to its continued success it sets a standard a moral road for those to travel upon and i feel not only politicians but artists and those who influence our children and youth should have some more faith maybe we could have avoided twerking or otherkin if that had been the case
canada,not_removed,ive been going through a shitty time with intelcom too i was supposed to receive a package via prime shipping on friday intelcom claimed to have attempted two deliveries but had left no slip did not call me and did not try to use the building intercom i was home the entire day had they actually attempted the delivery i would have been there to receive it i contacted intelcom and their own customer service told me that the driver should have called me they rescheduled a deliver for the following monday so monday rolled around and intelcom never showed up they claim my address is incorrect the same address all my prior amazon orders have shipped to for a year i tried to contact intelcom again but all my calls were directed to a full voice mail box and i never received a call back after filling out the contact form on their website at this point i contacted amazon told them what was going on and requested a replacement they granted the replacement and shipped it via intelcom again intelcom hasnt shown up again i cant contact them again and my tracking status is prioritizing whatever that means oh and speaking of the tracking they post your address name and if they actually do deliver your package a picture of your home to an insecure web page just to drop a cherry on this whole thing so to summarize intelcom has lied to me repeatedly and amazons response has been to ask me to be patient after a week waiting for a package with expedited release date delivery i still have no idea where the hell it is theres more to this whole thing intelcoms tracking barely works and ive had more back and forth with amazon but at this point im so annoyed that i dont really want to get into it im cancelling my prime subscription and wont be using amazon again until they stop shipping through intelcom
canada,not_removed,this company is a fucking joke and its unbelievable that theyre allowed to get away with this horrible service amazon is about to lose a prime customer because they cheaped out with such a shitty courier
canada,not_removed,the problem in a nutshell is this intelcom pays crappy wages for their drivers they sub contract everything leaving the driver bound to a contract they barely understand six pages of bs that the average joe likely does not process much less interpret properly without a lawyer part of the contract relegates drivers to no time off no sick days no way to see a doctor during shift time shifts start at am and can go until pm the drivers are literally baited with training wages that seem unreal and awesome but the moment that contract is signed they drop from a day to something like a parcel that works out after gas in the vehicle and tax remittance to far less than min wage it is a complete and utter joke so not only do you have drivers trying to fulfill an unbelievable amount of deliveries per day parcels spread out all over hells half acre you also have grossly underpaid people and grossly overworked driving through a major metropolis or city area for up to straight hours a day take it for what you will folks but the service is low for a reason and yes amazon has made a seriously big mistake in this judgement
canada,not_removed,i have already logged several complaints with amazon as well as a nasty google review and they dont seem to get it im trying to gather enough people to sign a petition to cancel their prime membership if amazon dont cease using intelcoms services immediately im actually writing a letter to intelcoms management advising them of this but they wont be surprised ive had to go to their office to pick up a package and there are all kind sof whiteboards with special handle with care instructions for amazon customers yet they still send me to vm every time i call enough is enough with these people anyone want in let me know please
canada,not_removed,deleted
canada,not_removed,order placed june expected delivery expected june intelcom status received though at one point it said optimized amazon doesnt have any tracking for it other than latest update wednesday jun parcel arrived at the final delivery station montreal qc ca im in alberta theres been no word on where the package is i did have one successful package from them a few weeks earlier for a usb bluetooth dongle i live in a secure building and somehow they got in and actually tried shoving the package through the mail slot in my door all while i was home if their tracking were more advanced at least we could have some idea of where the packages are in processing instead of a single vague word and no actual tracking information edit mt july intelcom has finally delivered my package after amazon already began a refund for the package not being delivered ive reached out to amazon regarding reversing the refund i live in a secure apartment where every door has a mail slot meant for the building to deliver notices ive been sitting right next to the door in my office and they saw fit to push the package through the mail slot instead of doing anything to get my attention neither buzzing or even knocking on the door if they knocked id have refused the delivery due to the refund process
canada,not_removed,i found this in a search thank you for writing this i too had a package in tracking show as delivered in montreal and have had many not show up the day theyre expected they havent lost any yet but its only a matter of time im super frustrated with intelcom ive written amazon about this issue usually they extend prime for a month and thats their policy intelcom is basically unreachable and their tracking tools are just awful
canada,not_removed,my package had a guaranteed delivery of wed jun in calgary its saturday jul and still no package the tracking status says out for deliveryin montreal wtf
canada,not_removed,im supposed to get a package today according to the shipping rule since i ordered it wednesday night which doesnt count as a business day since all stores are closed that left the thursday and monday which is today to ship the package friday was canada day so no business day my package consists in two small items hair brushes and one book the big ones like the manuals you have at school as such it cant fit in the delivery box so the guy has to come ring unlike most of the bad reviews i live in a big two story house which is a different color from all the others on the street so you cant miss it plus i live on a street that is directly connected to one of the main streets where i live furthermore their main office is also in my area its in montreal and i live in montreal west island although their tracking is absolute garbage and it literally says statusoptimized what does that even mean with a blank page and their logo amazon says arriving today and the green bar only has about left to fill as i said before my house is flashy with its red bricks so the delivery person has no reason the miss it furthermore there are people in the house and one that is reading literally meters from the door without any walls blocking so even if i have earphones in at any point in time somebody will be there to open the door the person reading also has a massive window next to the door where you can see anybody coming or parking in front of the house as such it is impossible for us to miss the guy and have a failed delivery i just hope they wont do some nonsense like in most of the reviews will follow up update its and i havent gotten anything nothing no notes no delivery guy nothing in my mailbox their system still announces a useless statusoptimized and amazon still say that it will ship today with an on time notice i wouldnt be so pissed if i didnt need the items i bought for tomorrow morning
canada,not_removed,ive had or packages delivered by intelcom and one supposed to arrive today their tracking is useless and gives no insight on package delivery or what has happened so far ive had them drop electronic equipment at my door inside a secure building with no buzz from the front doors and no knock at my suite door worse still is the package required a signature to deliver yet they marked the package as delivered and signed for im lucky no one stole the package before i opened the door and saw it there all said ive been lucky and received all my packages shipped through them but they are my least liked carrier and i would much rather have canada post or even ups deliver instead
canada,not_removed,shit i cancelled prime a few months ago march or april when it started taking them up to a week to process and ship my orders mostly movies and games it got to the point where i realized i was paying prime to have my stuff arrive at the same time if not later than other retailers ive used intelcom for work and they were terrible this shipping change for prime only makes me more unlikely to get prime again
canada,not_removed,i miss the days of consistent ups shipping when i first started amazon shopping i was worried because of all the horror stories turns out ups is amazing in my area free shipping usually meant packages delivered in business days canada post dragged that to business days ive had intelcom deliver packages to me one came in business day and the other came in their tracking system shouldnt even be used
canada,not_removed,i came here looking for info on this courrier i had never heard of it i have an amazon delivery expected today with this courrier and now im worried loll it says out for delivery so i hope its true i dont know why they didnt use canada post as usual never had a problem with c post i always pick the free shipping im not a prime member and usually gets my stuff before the expected delivery date
canada,not_removed,intelcom are all idiots my last orders have all been shipped with intelcom and have had problems with all they cant seem to find my address or simply dont bother to deliver the info they send to amazon is all lies they either state my address is incorrect or that i live in a gated comuinity both are false today i received a call from a company called allwest auto parts saying they mistakenly singed for a package addressed to me and could i please come and pick it up if they wernt kind enough to make an effort to contact me the package would have been lost amazon tracking showed the package as delivered i have asked amazon over times not to use intelcom but for whatever reason they cant seem to do that on an interseting note intelcom is allegedly owned by canada post and canada post has loaned one of their top dogs to intelcom to run the buisness hmmm i wonder if canada postintelcom is playing amazon as a fool and using them to gain more power in their strike negoations amazon must be loosing money and customers wake up amazon give your customers an option not to use intelcom or do yourself a big favour and fire intelcom outright
canada,not_removed,im their latest victim it seems oh well i can always chargeback prime cancelled of course status received yeah no
canada,not_removed,not sure if allowed to add links but if you can add the google review page for intelcom i posted two incidents there a real horror show only reason i havent cancelled my prime yet is that ive been awarded free months through october
canada,not_removed,same boat here today hours in chat and no resolution in sight guaranteed delivery from intelcom by today odd time and no one showed up amazon chat has been giving me the go around and apparently i need not worry at all everything is peachy and my item will arrive tomorrow they are just banking on intelcom being a day late really to top it all off they offer me free one day shipping on my next order as a compensation and thats it im a prime member so thats worth about absolutely useless im hoping to get my items and prime is getting cancelled immediately it will be a very long time until amazon gets another order from me
canada,not_removed,wonder if intelcom provided amazon a cheaper deal than canadapost with similarly cheaperquality service
canada,not_removed,i dont think its a prime only thing ive had intelcom deliver items and i dont have prime
canada,not_removed,it gets better intelcom closed their amazon tracking page using the other tracking service on the site seems to give you the updates they provide to amazon instead of the actual state of your delivery this has to be a joke right where are the cameras
canada,not_removed,i ordered on tuesday for one day shipment its thursday and i dont have anything i called amazon and they told me to wait one more day i spent the morning on hold with intelcom their customer service is horrible for them to tell me that they dont have my package and that it must be lost i contacted amazon and told them that i will never purchase from amazon again if they continue with this horrible carrier
canada,not_removed,i have an intelcomm package from amazon that is untrackable and late on delivery using amazon customer support chat ive asked them to not send me packages via intelcomm anymore they said they would escalate my ticket and not send me packages with intecomm hopefully they mean that
canada,not_removed,ive been dealing with issues with intelcom for weeks the first incident began when they left a package unattended in a communal mail room which of late has been prone to theft the items obviously disappeared what was most baffling is that the driver never made an attempt to notify me of the delivery they never buzzed called etc a reattempt of the same package was made the following day the same courier guess what happened same thing called amazon filed a complaint got my money back and bought the item locally taking the bite on the markup skip ahead weeks i place an order for a usb hub day shipping as ill be requiring it for an upcoming dj gig same weekend i receive an email confirmation last night that the item has shipped low and behold via intelcom i immediately called amazon support to notify the courier that a signature be required to accept delivery this of course was never the case item has been delivered aka left unattended and thus like the rest of the items stolen ive processed a complaint now with amazon regarding intelcom and they have put me in touch with a rep who will be brokering the call with intelcoms complaint department tomorrow afternoon they mentioned that volume regarding thefts and poor service due in part to this courier are getting out of hand no kidding and so i hope this finally catalyzes some change ill keep you posted
canada,not_removed,another happy intelcom customer here ordered three books yesterday and they were delivered today but not to my address how do i know checked with a neighbour same house number different street they had it been living here for four years never had that problem with other couriers im not renewing prime after the free trial i want to minimize my chances of having to deal with intelcom again
canada,not_removed,i figured id add my experience time having a package shipped via intelcom the package showed up on time delivery guy confirmed my name was the one on the package then left after he left i refreshed their tracking page to see that the delivery guy signed on my behalf claiming to be me my first name was being listed as the signer with a signature that wasnt mine the guy delivering the package made no mention of needing my signature when he dropped it off he didnt even have anything on him to take my signature super shady makes me wonder how often their delivery guys sign on the customers behalf time having a package shipped by intelcom the package arrived outside of their estimated delivery window it wasnt late meaning it was still delivered the day it was expected to arrive but their tracking estimated it would arrive by when it took until almost this time though the delivery man asked me for my name and signature rather than signing it himself so for that reason alone the second delivery was a lot more satisfactory to me
canada,not_removed,i have been fighting against intelcom fiercely due to their poor service according to an amazon support obviously intelcom provides false information to them so intelcom doesnt get penalized in my situation i made a few purchases through amazonca in the past few months the first item it was late for days and then disappeared but intelcom claimed it was delivered my second item just went missing and intelcom also claimed it was delivered for my third item intelcom was requested to call me upon its arrival with amazons help we kinda forced them to and i got my item days late i called amazon countless times to request not to let intelcom deliver my items amazon supports either didnt care or they claimed they would escalate it and file reports to have my problem resolved now its been months and still counting intelcom is still the carrier for me ergo i refuse to order anything from amazonca as well one thing i realized if i ordered from the states items would be delivered by either ups or canada post in canada however ordering from the states sometimes is a bit too expensive with all the import fees and shipping fees
canada,not_removed,just ordered something and it says intelcom now im scared shitless itll never show up
canada,not_removed,today i received an intelcom package everything went according to plan with no delays but i know i was lucky i looked at the reviews i know i could have had every problem getting the package before my fathers birthday party and that stressed me a lot in the hours before so even when the delivery goes perfectly amazons clients are feeling stressed it might be time for them to get rid of intelcom
canada,not_removed,im waiting for a package to be delivered today on amazon the status shows as out for delivery now after reading this im really worry i cant even find were to track the parcel on their website anyone have the link
canada,not_removed,i received my package from amazon today regular ol shipping and though it arrived earlier than expected intelcom dropped it off on my lawneven the doorstep would have been nice
canada,not_removed,ive come here to say that i ordered a package via amazon prime and was horrifed to discover that it was intelcom who was courrier although it did arrive the date it was expected outside of the window specified but at least it arrived the driver did not request a signature i found it odd when i went to go check the website and inputted the tracking number which was out of the way and completely hidden via popup i see that the driver forged my signature this is a crime i am tempted to go to the police as i see in the comments this is something that happens all the time and it seems like the company is not doing anything to curb this or most probably is actively encouraging it so that the drivers can deliver more packages in a day i am horrified if amazon continues to use this courier i will be cancelling not that amazon likely cares but this is ridiculous
canada,not_removed,i am having my first intelcom shipped package supposed to be delivered today i am nervous like a little schoolboy out for his first day of kindergarden they are shipping at work which is open normal business hours lets see how they will do on my case
canada,not_removed,i am baffled i am waiting for a delivery by intelcom of a book it was supposed to be delivered by but wasnt here when i got home at sometime after the status on intelcoms website changed to delivered even though my doorbell never rang it also noted there was no signature the package is nowhere to be seen and i have no clue how this company continues to make what should be a straightforward transaction so annoying amazons site says to wait hours and i dont have the patience to go to the trouble of getting their stock nonreply my amazon ordering has gone from about times a month to intelcom may just succeed in breaking my online buying habit as they have taken all the pleasure out of it im in montréal by the way
canada,not_removed,just got my package delivered by them today only took day except my stuff is in a different province on the other side of the country
canada,not_removed,im going to go against the grain here and say that i havent had any bad experiences with intelcom so far im in south calgary somerset and my packages have all come on time or a day early maybe it just depends on the driver in your area and i got lucky their tracking does absolutely suck though so i dont even bother checking it anymore
canada,not_removed,hmmmm i feel like the odd one out who likes intelcom i live in edmonton and the past orders ive had with amazon was shipped through intelcom the delivery guys are very nice in that they call me minutes before they arrive letting me know theyre coming and if im not home they just come back at a later time the same day happened to be the case for my most recent order that i received on wednesday ive inly had issues with canpar where they have attempted delivery not leave a delivery notice at the front of my condo and resend the package back to amazon the next day
canada,not_removed,ive had just a similar issue i placed an amazon prime order that should have been delivered on august tuesday today is friday it wasnt in fact as of today it still hasnt been delivered yesterday i received a call from an unknown number which turned out to be the intelcom driver he left a voice message saying he was attempting a delivery he did not leave his name number or any other identifying information notably it seems that in his mind calling my cell phone means he attempted the delivery the fact is he did not attempt the delivery he did not ring the buzzer two of us were home awaiting delivery i returned his call an hour later but despite the fact that he was only three blocks away he wouldnt promise to make the delivery that day only that he would talk to the boss today amazon order tracking noted this message the carrier was not able to access the front door to deliver your package this sometimes occurs when carriers do not have an access code for a gated community or secure building what a load of crap theres access to the front door if he had gotten out of his vehicle and rung the building intercom like any delivery service should the delivery would have been made there was also no notice left indicating that they attempted the delivery with no update today i called the driver back today but he hung up on me when i called back he replied by text saying that he was driving he ignored my text asking for his bosss name and phone number my amazon prime deliveries with canada post have been spotty but at least i could track them this has me reconsidering my amazon prime membership for me the whole point of having an amazon prime membership is to conveniently and reliably be able to order products but the orders are not showing up on time and im spending time calling couriers and having to amazon about nearly every order in the last few weeks amazon are you listening
canada,not_removed,adding to this thread made an order this week and got an email expecting delivery today but nothing come by today and no surprise since reading this thread contacted amazon cs which was apologetic and was issued a credit for future purchases from the conversation it seems that intelcom somehow marked my package as delivered before even attempting delivery on top of that theres no proper record of whats been happening to my package from the courier side
canada,not_removed,shit this sucks i ordered off amazon and i have prime and i paid for the extra fast delivery because im leaving on vacation this week item was supposed to arrive today but it never did tracking info on the amazon app just says out for delivery no updates since i was home the entire day no one showed no calls no attempted delivery slip nothing i took the tracking number to the intelcom website and when i enter my tracking number and press search it literally just refreshes the page with a blank tracking number box nothing happens i found this thread by google searching the company i can say im not thrilled at all after reading every single comment in this thread it appears as though someone hopefully an actual employee has been posting on intelcoms behalf on this reddit thread trying to put out fires i tried calling the number provided but no answer this is just bad all around for amazon and intelcom
canada,not_removed,i have been fighting with amazon for three days about an order that was to be delivered by intelcom i thought i would try to contact intelcom first but all they have is an answering machine if you leave a message no one calls you back what kind of company are you running intelcom as for amazon they already reordered this item for me and i still havent received it it was apparently out for delivery hours ago it is now after pm do they honestly think i would accept an order this late at night not to mention i pay a year to be guaranteed delivery did i receive this order within those days nope i have now spoken with four people at amazon and all they want to offer me is one month free of amazon prime do you really think im worried about the that would cost me all i want is for amazon to hold up their end of the contract that is put in place when i purchased my membership as for intelcom i suggest contacting someone as soon as possible if you see that you have an item being shipped by them chances are you wont get your order either
canada,not_removed,worst courier ever with a joke website none existent customer service and useless tracking system ordered a watch a year ago and never got delivered was on the phone with amazonca for hours and countless back and forth and the packag never delivered contacting intelcom was useless as they never returned my call after days a guy showed up at the door saying that he got a package delivered to his home by mistake that got my adress on it lolhere you go second order for amazonca and again delivery from intercomagain the item didnt show updid the call fiasco again to amazonthey refunded my moneytold amazon not to ship with intercom if they still want my business looks like they got the cheapest courier contract to go with as they cutting corners left and right what good out of a good deal on amazonca if it never gets delivered and we as customers that paid with our hard earned money get to fight with phone calls headaches and time to get our product not acceptable in take canada post anytime over intelcomatleast canada post they leave a paper notice for you and drop the item to your nearest canada post courier shop
canada,not_removed,i too have had the same negative experience with this company nothing else to add just trying to increase visibility ive emailed the company via the email addresses in this thread im interested to see what comes of this edit well it looks like my email to them got attention and got someone local to call back and the good news for edmonton based folks is they have moved their warehouse from leduc to edmonton as of days ago the fellow who called seemed genuinely interested in fixing the problem so im giving them another chance lets see how it plays out over the next week or so
canada,not_removed,i just received my amazon order today from a driver who had no uniform of any kind driving an unmarked minivan id be scared to open the door if i was home alone and not waiting a package i would never have expected amazon to affiliate themselves with such an unprofessional company reading all of these comments i am very lucky to have been home at the exact time of the delivery o
canada,not_removed,as a regular customer of amazonca i have had my share of frustration with intelcom they leave packages in the front lobby sometimes i have seen one for a neighbour taped to the front mailboxes that are accessible to anyone so far i have successfully received only package out of or when i write to amazon i get the usual cut and paste platitudes about how important my satisfaction is to them except for the last time the csr actually wrote that they understood how frustrated i was with intelcom and that they had a lot of problems with them i told them i did not want my missing package reshipped via intelcom and they agreed it was surprising then to get an email saying the new shipment was going by intelcom when i wrote to point out the promise i was told the rep should never have said those things to me and would be spoken to so the only honest csr gets disciplined and intelcom keeps being unprofessional and yes the replacement package never arrived my ordering from amazon has dropped dramatically maybe if enough people do it it will have an impact its hard for me to understand how all these missing packages help anyones bottom line or reputation
canada,not_removed,i was supposed to receive a package from amazonca today i saw on amazonca that my order was supposedly delivered at by a courier that we had never heard of before intelcom courier we were home at that time but we never heard the doorbell and we never saw a package left outside of our house i was initially so puzzled because this has never happened before usually packages are left outside in front of the door no problem but this was the first time that the tracking info said delivered but no package to be found i then did a google search and found the culprit an unreliable and poor courier intelcom courier that has massive amount of negative reviews by amazonca customer im waiting for a few more days and if i dont receive it i will send another email to amazonca i live in laval quebec just outside of montreal
canada,not_removed,prime packages in canada this week delivered on time by canada post one now days late by intellcom i pointed out that the parts were for a job scheduled this weekend and waiting until monday for delivery or reshipping a replacement nextday wasnt an option since they didnt get it out of the warehouse thursday afternoon they hear a lot about intellcom these days apparently so tomorrow ill need to go buy the parts at best buy or a local computer shop for about more amazon rep immediately credited my account with a apology and an extra month of prime great another free month of bullshit excuses and failed deliveries i asked if they can bar intellcom from future deliveries all they can do is deprioritize them for my shipments wow great i was told by our shipping manager that the intellcom delivery agent was swearing at our neighbors for closing at last week when he showed up late to a business and couldnt deliver to them real class act these guys are apparently their only real employees are in montreal everything else they do is just local shortterm contractors who dont give a shit
canada,not_removed,i am having the worst service with intelcom today as well i prefer ordered a package to be delivered to me on friday but for some reason it was only picked up from amazons warehouse saturday at around am i understand that nothing gets delivered over the weekend so i patiently wait until today monday i review the status and it states rye package was received at intercoms warehouse at am i contact them at around am using their online service for information regarding when i will get my package and surprisingly they respond quite promptly they tell me that since the package was received today they can only ship it out tomorrow or if i would like i can pass by their warehouse today anytime before pm to pick it up myself i inform them i will pick it up around come oclock i am at their warehouse and they tell me we have received packages today so there is no way we can find your package too bad if you want your package you can either pick it up tomorrow or we can try and deliver it to you it doesnt matter that the customer service said it will be ready today if you have an issue with that talk to them and now i am waiting again one more day to receive a package due to me on friday
canada,not_removed,intelcom is absolute trash will have to stop using amazon if this is the company there they are going to use similar experience here in alberta item had a guaranteed delivery date for the intelcoms tracking even had the package listed as on the truck but nothing same thing today the amazon rep was great refunded the shipping charge but this is ridiculous its also almost impossible to get a hold of intelcom the phone line cuts off pretty quickly forcing you to leave a message despite saying stay on the line havent to date had a problem with ups or purolater but intelcom is probably the cheaper option shame because their craptacular service reflects badly on amazon too
canada,not_removed,copypaste of my review i made on google for intelcom the first time i had a package delivered by them review crappiest delivery service ever why amazon uses them is a mystery i had a package that was suppose to be delivered on april im never home so i usually get packages held at the depot for me to pick up after the first attempt intelcom tries to delivery my package and leaves no note that a delivery attempt was made no problem i knew it was going to be an attempt as i checked on amazon called them to hold the package so i can pick it up myself since im never home during the day like everyone else because i work asked what the pickup hours are guy responds and tells me sounds good so far april i go to the depot at to pickup my package both doors warehouse and office are closed no one answers the doorbell or the phone when i ringcall was a friday so now i wont get my package until monday monday april i call and tell them i went at and it was closed girl seemed surprised and told me maybe they didnt hear the bell because they were working in the warehouse eyeroll i decide to change the address for the package and get it delivered by my wifes workplace its a business and its opened from april check the tracking out for delivery yay my wife gets home and no package call april and supposedly they made a delivery attempt at but couldnt deliver the package like i mentioned its a business opened from all you gotta do is open the door and there is a reception right when you walk in they even had my wifes cell phone number but never attempted to call it to say they were there no delivery attempt today because they already tried twice and the girl on the phone asks me if i want to pick it upwhy so that i go and no one is there again its now been days since i was suppose to get the package and i still dont have it another delivery attempt will be made at my wifes work tomorrow but im not holding my breath update after being out for delivery for the third time to my wifes work my package was finally delivered on may two weeks after the expected delivery date it was magically delivered after angrily calling intelcom sending them an email and making a complaint with amazon all in one day tip use canadaposts flexdelivery when purchasing on amazon so that they automatically use canadapost
canada,not_removed,in response to yet another missing parcel from intelcom here is part of what the amazon customer service rep wrote to me today please be informed that we are receiving a lot of complaints about the service of intelcom so ive forwarded a suggestion on your behalf regarding the carrier and have requested them to hire new carriers in place of intelcom its an interesting remark but naive
canada,not_removed,so far ive had amazon packages delivered by intelcom this year the first arrived a couple of days late the second was on time and the third showed as delivered but never arrived both the first and second times i saw the delivery guy who just dropped the package on the doorstep without knocking or ringing for comparison ive had other amazon orders this year that werent delivered by intelcom not including things my wife has ordered almost all were canada post and a few ups and all of them arrived on time or early the driver always rang the bell and asked me to confirm who i was before releasing the package its pretty insane that canada post owns of this company given how shoddy an operation it is
canada,not_removed,just had my first amazon package delivered by intelcom wasnt a christmas gift was workrelated and we need it tomorrow needless to say i was mildly worried after reading this thread fortunately it arrived without incident amusingly the guy who dropped it off is also my fedex carrier wearing an intelcom jacket i have no idea how he holds down two jobs at once but hes never missed a delivery ever
canada,not_removed,i have to say that i was really concerned about my package getting here on time after reading the comments here yesterday but to my delightful surprise the package arrived a day early and also hours before expected delivery time yes their tracking sucked but in terms of the actual product getting to me on time they did a fantastic job just trying to share my experience with the company
canada,not_removed,pm me if you need someone to sign petition
canada,not_removed,got packages stolen from intelcom they just take a picture of the safe dropped package and leave with it if theres any possibility that it might get stolen
canada,not_removed,worst service ever they are always late delivering packages and dont ring the doorbell they drive unmarked van dont have a uniform and have creepy drivers i dont think any woman would feel safe answering the door to those drivers
canada,not_removed,yep pretty much in the same boat they dont even answer the phone
canada,not_removed,hmm interesting in my experience intelcom is actually one of the better options on amazon purolator is the one you should be afraid of they consistently lie about attempting to deliver and it always takes at least an extra day with purolator because they never actually deliver in my experience they also blame it on the customer and say that the receiver was inaccessible when really they drove by and decided not to stop its always a pickupatthewarehouse two days after you thought you were getting it kind of dealits gotten to the point that when i order something on amazon and see that they have shipped with purolator i get disappointed and ready myself for a complicated and frustrating process also purolator treat you like a criminal with their insane strictness about ids and proof of address a guy in front of me last week was refused his parcel because despite his name and address being a perfect match the clerk noticed that the guys drivers license was expired and started lecturing him about valid id he was able to argue his way to getting the parcel but only after a stern warning that this is only because the parcel contains medicine and next time they wont be so understanding they were acting like they were doing him this big favor by allowing him to receive the parcel addressed to him with intelcom its actually the opposite the first time i got a parcel from intelcom the guy called my cellphone and i couldnt understand his accent and thought he had the wrong number so i hung up on him he called back and i hung up again because i was convinced some weirdo had the wrong number finally the third time he called he said amazon parcel in a loud clear voice soit finally clicked i wasnt going to be home for minutes and the guy actually waited for me it is very important to them to actually make the delivery the first time if they can so they will keep knocking and calling you if they think you are home the exact opposite of what all the other couriers do who only wait a minute or two at the most before giving up intelcom will actually go out of their way to deliver the package to you purolator will go out of their way to make it as hard as possible for you to get your parcel ups and fedex are alright too but they only deliver during business hours when i am usually not home intelcom will come by in the evening and drop off your stuff more couriers actually need to be like them i grant all the stuff about the unmarked vehicles and no uniforms and stuff i personally wouldnt call the drivers creepy i thought they were always polite but i can see how someone who isnt expecting a parcel at would be freaked out by a guy without a uniform in their yard or on their doorstep
canada,not_removed,i think amazon is well aware and equally as frustrated this is my own assumption i ordered a gift in midaugust it was expected to arrive august i moreorless forgot about it because i didnt actually need it until now the party is tomorrow i got an email from amazon on sept saying it has been shipped via intelcom ok no problem this past monday comes along the and i think that it must arrive this week amazon has always had really quick shipments it didnt arrive yesterday thurs so i click online to track my package it says its expected to arriveaugust despite the fact it also says it shipped on sept alas my gift did not arrive today either i wrote to amazon around saying that im fd now in very nice words of course they wrote back within hours saying that tracking packages is too costly for them they suspect its lost and if id rather get a refund or have the items reshipped getting it reshipped wont do me a whole lot of good at this point so ill opt for the refund by how fast they pretty much wrote it off tells me that they no longer believe in intelcom either edit spelling
canada,not_removed,horrible service been waiting a month and replacements later and still nothing this sort of service is a great way to drive customers away i work for fed ex ground as a driver and usually my packages come through my work or ups which has never been an issue with as much profit as amazon makes you think they would be able to give you the option to choose your carrier to avoid such problems and keep the customers happy
canada,not_removed,so i was very nervous after reading all of these reviews of intelcom i saw that my package was supposed to ship yesterday and it was out for delivery when i left my office at still nothing i checked later on that evening and saw that there was an attempted delivery at today i emailed intelcom and they told the driver to arrive before and it was delivered at the driver even gave me his phone number and explained that for any future shipments i can give him a call and he can make sure to deliver when im at the office after a bit of a hiccup i was very impressed with his service and he was really sweet hoping that all shipments go this well going forward
canada,not_removed,well i sat for over an hour reading all the reviews and comments on them and while i was reading the last comment what do you know my parcell came i have faith in this company at least for the edmonton alberta department keep in mind i left a note on my door nice and big on where to leave things if no one answered the door so all i can say is that for intelcom courrier canada inc on my part at least weel see if any of my other things come thru them in the followong week and ill keep updating i do hope this company makes it the guy looked like a normal and he looked really tierd to me and its only pm these people must be so stressed trying to up there game so lets hope for the best its all we can really do
canada,not_removed,yeah this courier as well as pretty much every other one that isnt canada post is fucking brutal i really wish they would stop using anything other than canada post ive never had a single issue with them and in order a lot from amazon the odd time it does go through another courier i either have issues with them or at least am guaranteed to need to go pick it up myself because they dont even attempt to deliver they just leave a sticker on your door and go about their way
canada,not_removed,i am having a hard time with intelcom too i cant believe this amazon has to quit using them they are not worth it they cant read an address at all i am fighting with this courier too you cant get a hold of them if you have a problem this is bull st
canada,not_removed,greetings i think its only fair to repoert that my first experience with the company has been posative i placed an order with amazon canada using my prime account expected delivery date was wednesday october i checked in on tracking today and found out that my items were out for delivery at pm today i received the package at pm today nice i do not like their tracking system as it would not let me log in to amazon canada through my fave tracking app deliverys now i am on ios beta so any how so far so good on my end with the first time being a resounding success tldr after the driver gave me my package he took a picture of my address my guess is that the company is trying to improve on delivery accuracy by doing so fingers crossed that things improve man as i had to call fedex the last three shipments as they showed my packages as delivery attempted with nobody home whilst i was sitting there with my door open with my trusty dog letting me know if i had a visitor good luck peopledoggyrocker
canada,not_removed,all the deliveries ive had that used intelcom have been fine maybe i shouldnt post this as i have another one supposed to come today but oh well theyve used the intercom came right to the apartment and been polite the last few canada post deliveries ive had ive had to go to the post office even though the mailboxes are in my building so canada post has the buzz code and earlier canada post deliveries got dropped off right at my apartment door with a knock so based purely on my experiences id rather have intelcom deliver even with their horrible tracking system than canada post
canada,not_removed,wow what an extraordinary company intelcom courrier canada inc actually is why is intelcom courrier canada inc so amazing well for a start intelcom courrier canada inc have mastered physical telepathic delivery by claiming that they actually delivered my parcel from amazon at my home address that is a house even though i was directly outside and in front of my house between the hours of pm pm where intelcom courrier canada inc and would have had to either walk directly past me through me even leverette above me as there no other way to my front door but never the less intelcom courrier canada inc have mastered what science thought was not posable amazing i never sore him her or it intelcom courrier canada inc have also proved that time travel actually does exist my wife checked the amazon web page on delivery update statics at pm to our utter surprise it states that my parcel was delivered at pm by intelcom courrier canada inc but the time is actually pm right now now this defies science at its best where can you buy stock chairs in this futuristic company on second thoughts no thanks
canada,not_removed,i just had my first experience with this shipper recently i was patiently waiting for a package only to realize that it was apparently delivered weeks ago ive never seen it and when i use the parcel tracking service on the intelcom site the status is billed whatever that means the package was apparently purchased with express shipping by accident i usually use the free shipping im contacting them and amazon and hopefully some good will come of it
canada,not_removed,i had a package delivered by intelcom as well but i never saw it either it wasnt delivered or it got stolen im not a prime subscriber and i had accidentally chosen nextday shipping that wasnt necessary i contacted amazon and received a refund in less than hours ill probably order another item and have it shipped for free to my office this time
canada,not_removed,i had a run in with intellcom being stupid today this is like the time so i contacted amazon specifically asked for a supervisor and they have a courier deprioritization form all further shipments would be prioritized to upsfedexcanpostpurolator give it a shot amazon is aware intellcom is pretty bad and the supervisor mentioned they are in the process of reviewing them
canada,not_removed,im expecting an express delivery by intelcom today or tomorrow its a house and the residents are home all day after reading all these bad experiences i am not holding my breath but you can be damn sure i will be leaving scathing reviews on them if i dont get it by the weekend
canada,not_removed,amazon prime is now a joke nothing i order that they claim they have in stock arrives in two days anymore and yes intelcom is horrible for tracking to make a real complaint you need to email jeffamazoncom amazons customer service is set up so that if you make a complaint you get a fun automated email with an unpronounceable name at the bottom make another complaint citing the same issue and you just get another automated response now all i got out of emailing jeff bezos and dealing with the high up customer service was and a free year of their useless prime account and empty promises to investigate my laundry list of complaints ever preorder something on amazon and then they remove the preorder from the item page and jack the price up times in the past year its happened to me what we really need is a replacement for amazon they used to rule now i dont want to use them to order anything because it never arrives in the proper time period and often arrives destroyed
canada,not_removed,they started giving me intelcom recently not a prime member and each shipment so far was day shipping and arrived just fine im never home and they just drop my box near my door for me maybe they got their act together
canada,not_removed,intelcom has been their recent shipping carrier to me i have made two orderes and both times they have or are using intelcom first time the package was lost in transit and amazon refunded me the total and told me to reorder the next day ups delivered it and guess what intelcom actually delivered the initial order i have another package coming tomorrow and truly am wondering if i will get it on time or not update i preordered a game and on release date i watched the intelcom delivery guy arrive at my house and then leave within minutes he was looking for my package in his minivan i was just amazed that three times in a row they have done the simple thing of delivering a package wrong i got that package days late monday
canada,not_removed,shipments different delivery results first time they called my cell on the package and i told them its ok to leave it in between the doors at my condo it was minutes to lunch and i went back home to pick it up worked out fine second time i get a knock on my condo door and the delivery guy starts by complains that my name is not on the intercom list at the front door hes right but when i know i have a package coming and im home i leave a note to call me on my phone and ill come open the door basically he said that he couldnt use his cellphone third times the charm to mess it up out for delivery i leave a message like usual except its now past midnight and i never got a contact their website is shit and does not load the status and nowhere was there a notice for attempted delivery i dont know if they deliver on saturday but they better deliver it latest monday
canada,not_removed,i am very happy with intelicom couriers so far with my amazon prime i got my order just as quick as fedex or ups he brought it right to my door waited to see if i was home very nice driver he told me they are taking over some of fedex and canada posts customers which is great as canada post sucks
canada,not_removed,well i can add my name to the tale of woe i ordered a parcel for one day delivery it said optimized for a while and then changed to data received shipment not received i queried this with amazon and intelcom with both blaming the other two days later no parcel and although amazon refunded me the item i purcased was a hatchimal for my nieces birthday present on saturday with zero chance of me getting a replacement i am willing to bet that its intelcom and their woefully inadequate logistics that are to blame in this matter and amazon have agreed to my request that they do not use them to ship to me in future
canada,not_removed,im waiting on them as wellpackage is two days overdue at this point
canada,not_removed,does anyone have an address for their warehouse in the city where do i go for pickups they failed to deliver
canada,not_removed,im in alberta and suppose to get a shipment yesterday still nothing tracking number doesnt work and they cant find anything amazon wont sent me anything a second time until they find what happened to my first order see ya never amazon prime
canada,not_removed,so to add to this im a prime member from vegreville ab its about east of edmonton on tuesday night i ordered a webcam a logitech only paid about which is a steal and of course got that free day shipping cheese i was confused cause i had never heard of them so i googled them and to my horror found this thread i was worriedhoweverit actually showed up on time ill inspect it when i get home currently on coffee break at work but my wife says it looks fine and the delivery guy was very polite he didnt however make her sign for it which is a bit worrying but i mean at face value my first experience with them didnt suck like everyone elses purolator on the other hand a company ive dealt with more is trash they always deliver in the late afternoon and even when my wife is home all day and theres a vehicle in the drive way to indicate as such they simply dont attempt delivery but say they did and that we werent available so for intelcom first experience with them was painless
canada,not_removed,i personally love intelcom i suspect that they might be the key to never having to pay for prime again plus it means i get to talk with another human being courtesy of amazon support at least once a month very good for my mental health
canada,not_removed,ok there might be a way to never have intelcom delivering to you the last two subscription deliveries where done by intelcom and both times it was delivered at another house so i just contacted amazon through their chat and the representative told me this well there is no direct way to choose the carrier however ill file the carrier feed back form then the carrier intelcom will not be assigned to your orders not sure if its true or just customer support lie but if it works it would be awesome bye bye intelcom we never loved you and will not be missed
canada,not_removed,i have had delivers from intelcom fail they left my package on my front door one got stolen they delivered again and left the package again on the front door they have failed to deliver a package in the last days i changed shipping to my work address and they still failed to deliver i got fed up canceled my order got a refund and used ship to access point for those that still want to shop with amazon use ship to access point instead of using their crappy delivery service by intelcom when they use canada post or ups or fedex it is perfect it arrives on the correct day they wont leave my package on the door i am able to pick it up later if need be i think canada post is by far the best anyways from now on ship to access point
canada,not_removed,this is my first dealing with intelcom and i hope it is the last my package was supposed to be delivered last week and it seems to be going out for delivery at strange times in the late afternoon or evening according to tracking on amazon intelcom attempted delivery after normal business hours at like i always have parcels delivered to my office for obvious reasons and of course it was closed no note no package also strange i checked the package status at and the notice says an attempted delivery was at clearly that didnt happen unless they have the ability to fail at delivery in the future i tried to contact intelcom with no success just like everyone else intelcoms tracking doesnt work blah blah blah they suck blah blah blah i contacted amazon who told me the package would be considered lost and that they would refund my money i get it but it really isnt the outcome that i wanted i want my darn stuff im hesitant to order again this has been such a mess is intelcom even a real company this seems like a joke according to amazon tracking my parcel is still out for delivery i will die of shock if that thing actually shows up certainly reflects poorly on amazon and makes amazon prime a completely useless service what i am going to try is canada posts new flexdelivery which lets you choose your post office for delivery via canada post when you choose your post office you get a unique flex delivery address you enter your unique flexdelivery address in the address form during online checkout instead of your usual shipping address looks like a post office box and voila the package should go to the post office of your choice i figure it should help to avoid the brutal courrier services like intelcom it will have to be delivered by canada post google canada post flexdelivery and sign up it should work
canada,not_removed,i just spoke to a csr at amazonca as i too am having issues with intelcom long story short there is no way to request that amazon not use a certain courier for your orders meaning i will no longer be ordering anything from amazon for the time being with that said they are aware that a great number of customers are having issues with them i encourage you all to take the time to either call or chat with amazon regarding your experience with intelcom until then amazon just lost a weekly user good luck to you all
canada,not_removed,their tracking site says i had a package received yesterday needless to say i did not
canada,not_removed,i bought a tablet pen for work and its looking like theyre not going to get it here before the weekend this is unacceptable the pen cant be purchased locally either
canada,not_removed,well just to add my cents worth to this debate i am in edmonton and we dont order a lot from amazon but my wife got a new iphone and wanted a particular case for it i never even thought of asking or searching who was delivering because we never had any problems after amazon said it was shipped i saw the delivery comapany was intellecom and found this reddit thread on the day it was supposed to be delivered the tracking would only say optimized wtf is optimized the morning of the next day it said received well it wasnt received by me i sent a email to intellecom and they responded fairly quickly that received meant received by them and it was to be delivered that day lo behold when i got home my package was there so i did not have a delivery horror story just a note to intellicom you have to fix your tracking page optimize is not a delivery word simply change to awaiting package received is very confusing simply saydelivery company has received package
canada,not_removed,check out this globe mail article intelcom is nothing but another get rich quick scam for a friend of the quebec wing of the federal liberal party just another example of the corruption that goes on in quebec and with the liberal party especially
canada,not_removed,i really hope that using intelcom is a temporary thing for amazon due to canada post issues i honestly will not deal with the headache this company caused me if they have switched given that i have basically replaced walmart with amazon this is a sizable amount of spending on my part when a ununiformed courier drives up to your door in a beat up sedan with the packaged piled on the back seat it doesnt inspire much confidence
canada,not_removed,just an update i eventually got the replacement package albeit a day late but all of a sudden today intelcom attempted to deliver my original package the one where they stated my address was incorrect its more than two weeks late the saga continues
canada,not_removed,all intelcom does for me is tosses my package on at the front door and then takes a picture to show its been delivered
canada,not_removed,this is the real intelcom story right here as a sidenote if you live in an apartment building go ahead and cancel your prime membership right now the intelcom experience for working folks goes like this you want your package drive out to an unmarked warehouse near the airport and hope they can sift though all the boxes and find it youll have to find the tracking number yourself by the way they dont typically leave delivery attempt notices and they dont have phones so dont even think about trying to call them no im serious ive probably called their warehouse times and never once had someone answer edit oh hey intelcom is trying to get rid of their hundreds upon hundreds of scathing reviews of their service because somehow my google review got deleted and now they only have reviews but this one is on the first page of google results as it damn well should be httpwwwfscomeaucomintelcomexpress
canada,not_removed,in order to discuss privately can you send us a message at suiviamazonintelcomexpresscom thanks the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,would sign this actually i am already cancelling my prime membership ive spend hours on this issue on chat already and they are doing nothing but ensuring me it will get here for sure that their shipping dept will make sure it does yeah they missed their expected delivery date twice already
canada,not_removed,you can just sign up for a canada post flexdelivery address which is a po box and it will then be delivered by canada post guaranteed the only problem is the shipping changes from day to days making your prime membership useless
canada,not_removed,thanks for giving us your comments your feedback is important and we would like to obtain the tracking id in order to figure out what happened with your delivery if you want you can send us a private message at suiviamazonintelcomexpresscom the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,probably means they returned it to amazon
canada,not_removed,thank you for your feedback as per our agreement with amazon if the recipient is not at home to receive the parcel the driver has the authorization to deliver it without signature if he has access to the door of the apartment or a secure place we are surprised that the driver did not ring andor knocked on your door since this is the procedure to be applied at all times in order to address this situation is it possible to get the tracking number of the package please note you can contact us at or suiviamazonintelcomexpresscom the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,same story for me fingers crossed i actually get my package
canada,not_removed,we apologize for the inconveniences that have occurred for your deliveries in order to investigate and figure out what happened we would like to gather information about your deliveries please note that intelcom express is not owned by canada post or vice versa we believe you have been misinformed because we dont do business together at all can you send us a private message at suiviamazonintelcomexpresscom it will be a pleasure to assist you thank you the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,we would like to understand what went wrong with your delivery then it would be appreciated if you could give us more information about the details of your delivery could you please contact us at suiviamazonintelcomexpresscom thank you the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,we are sorry to hear that there were gaps in our service for your deliveries we would like to discuss with you in order to understand what happened and make sure it will not be repeated can you contact us at suiviamazonintelcomexpresscom to give us more details about your deliveries thank you the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,of course they didwy you think amazonca went with intercom in the first place they trying to cut corners as much as possible canada post is a way more reliable courier
canada,not_removed,huh i refuse to believe anyone could provide a crappier service than canada post an amazon purchased birthday gift that was promised to arrive on their birthday took days longer thanks to those twats edit ok so maybe it was also partially amazons fault anyone here try using purolator also run by canada post especially around christmas what a disaster that was
canada,not_removed,were you using day shipping that seems to be their niche right now
canada,not_removed,ya it doesnt show the notification when you go to their website but its still there under e commerce delivery menuclick there and they you can see tracking in redclick on it and place your tr
canada,not_removed,they didnt mean that they sent me another package with intelcomm intelcomm lost my first package raaage
canada,not_removed,thank you for your feedback we apologize for the mistake that was made in order to notify the supervisor of the operations about your case and handle the situation with the driver who has been assigned to your delivery we would like to get the tracking id of the parcel mentioned above please note you can contact our customer service at sorry again for the inconvenience the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,id definitely be contacting amazon regarding the first delivery forgery is a serious offense
canada,not_removed,amazon at this point clearly just doesnt give a shit their customer service is useless and they keep copying and pasting the same bs lines about escalating to their shipping department and this wont happen again blah blah blah
canada,not_removed,hi same here ordered a phone via amazon prime on august delivery slated as september but shipment arrived in edmonton ab on the itself i waited the whole day it says it will deliver before pm edmonton local time i waited till pm still nothing then again i checked at around pm the shipment status says delivered pm how can shipment be delivered hour later then i called amazon they told me that it scanned delivered by mistake i mean what the eff is that how can any one do that
canada,not_removed,update the status is received grabs popcorn
canada,not_removed,same here packages received by them all on time havent used their tracking so i cant say anything about that
canada,not_removed,we thank you for your feedback and appreciate the fact that you took the time to write about your satisfaction thanks the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,at least canada post really attempts and leaves you a note of where to pick up the package intelcom is just a shitshow with no feedback at all an empty website and a poor tracking system
canada,not_removed,thank you for your feedback we would like to apologize for the trouble you have experienced recently and we are sorry for the lost time and effort that you have devoted to this situation in order to improve our service and implement corrective measures to ensure this is not repeated can you give us the details of your delivery tracking id please note you can contact our customer service at sorry again for the inconvenience the intelcom express team
canada,not_removed,hello can you email me the information of tracking you use at jbrindamourintelcomexpresscom it will be a pleasure to help you i think its because the update is probably in pacific standard time instead of mountain standard time i can tell you that the package has been received to our warehouse this morning at am mst and has been out for delivery at am mst i hope this information is useful to you and dont hesitate to send me a private message for more details thank you the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,an update so intelcom has lost my package reordered and sent to closest cp pickup point hopefully this wont get screwed up
canada,not_removed,been waiting for a package since monday i called yesterday and they said it would be delivered yesterday nothing came and now its wednesday
canada,not_removed,i would like to provide an update the package was given to my neighbor who brought it to me this morning apparently intelcom drivers dont know how to read an address how irresponsible can you be i hope amazonca reconsiders their relationship with them before one of my packages gets lost
canada,not_removed,i am currently in this exact same scenario
canada,not_removed,i literally just finished chatting with an amazon support rep about a package guaranteed for the like not even figuratively literally alberta too their tracking info is a complete fabrication it resets every day the package is late which leads me to believe its on an automated system i was able to get an extra month of prime along with my shipping charge refund
canada,not_removed,seems like a very driverbydriver sort of thing like if uber had no standards sometimes you get a goodie who does their job right for the sake of it sometimes you get a baddie who says fuck everybody because theyre getting paid peanuts to do a job not to do a job well
canada,not_removed,i was expecting an amazon parcel yesterday but i had doctors appointment at followed by a meeting i left the house at and yep the parcel came at when i came home i found the attempted delivery card on my doorknob since this was my first experience with intelcom i googled them to find an address and telephone number and accidentally fell on the reddit thread concerning this company after reading the various comments especially the earlier ones which were at the top of the thread i began to worry i called the company and left a message in their voice mail i then noticed an unknown telephone number in my caller list at the time the delivery was attempted i called that number and and reached the delivery persons cell phone and explained that i had to undergo more tests the following morning but would be at home all afternoon yes he had an accent but despite the late hour the gentleman was very polite and said he would make a second attempt the following afternoon andbingo i got it this afternoon he did not wear a uniform and he did not have a shiny new truck he was just a good honest guy making a living and taking his job seriously i hope that this message joins the thread on this company and that future readers get to the end of the thread because if there were problems at the outset this company has since gotten its act together
canada,not_removed,never had a problem with purolator across three cities within last year torontovancouvercalgary in the worse case scenario you can always pick the flex delivery option which is great if you dont have a permanent address in the city and a valid and current id is a reasonable requirement for proof of address the intelcom problems isnt one or two isolated incidents if you read through the thread there are people who have had multiple packages delivered by intelcom being either lost or delivered way late my package sent through intelcom was never tracked properly and was assumed lost by amazon only to show up days later this was a prime order redelivered by fedex all in the mean time purolator has been able to delivery my reorder within days its one thing to be skeptical but another thing entirely to ignore the mounting number of complaints here in this thread but intelcom really needs to get their act together
canada,not_removed,i have an order coming in tomorrow in the area so i hope its the same here
canada,not_removed,thank you for sharing your feedback the quality of our customer service is really important we do work closely with the drivers and the supervisors to make sure we reach customers needs thank you the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,thank you for sharing your experience we use advanced technology to offer best service thanks the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,we would like to hear more about your experience please contact us at infointelcomexpresscom the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,we are truly sorry for the time travel the amazon website uses pacific standard time so that is probably the reason why this situation happened please contact us so we can take corrective measures if necessary and help us improve our delivery service regards the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,thank you for having sent us an email we were able to indicate where the package has been left and give you explanation regarding our agreement with amazon thank you the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,yup literally just had these guys lose a package i blame the free trial of prime for this shit canada post is way better tried to contact intelcom for a few days now not a peep not even a fucking automated email awful customer service will be avoiding them in the future edit amazon was really good about refunding my money no questions asked i think they are getting used to this
canada,not_removed,we would like to hear more about your experience can you please contact us at suiviamazonintelcomexpresscom with your tacking number we will be able to undertand what happened exactly thank you the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,haha surprise surprise they completely missed the delivery today even though i had it shipped to my parents house and they are at home all day
canada,not_removed,amazon doesnt jack up the price that is the doing of all those third party sellers anytime anything goes out of stock from amazon those third party guys always double or triple the price for the same items in some cases they even sell bootlegged items
canada,not_removed,now the tracking just says billed grrrr
canada,not_removed,the exact same thing is happening to me right now bought something i needed for saturday using one day shipping and it still says data received shipment not received
canada,not_removed,try signing up for canada posts flexdelivery it should be helpful in avoiding that bogus courier company it has to be delivered to a canada post outlet that is my plan i was told that amazon cant allow customers to choose or eliminate a courier hope this helps
canada,not_removed,im also sick of dealing with this company yesterday i signed up for canada posts flex delivery service its free they assign you a po box and you designate a canada post of your choice to hold your package for pick up for all future amazon orders i plan to use that po box this will ensure the package is safely held and they will have to pick canada post as the shipper as nobody else would be able to deliver to a po box no more dealing with intelcom or purolator
canada,not_removed,in regina they switched to purolator and somehow its even worse than intelcom
canada,not_removed,as i pointed out in my other reply i realized a lot of items from amazoncom were delivered by ups or canada post in canada but with all the import and shipping fees the prices werent pretty i talked to at least a dozen amazon supports they either didnt care or they claimed to escalate the issue and file reports against intelcom however itd been months and nothing happened i just assumed amazon didnt care as well because intelcoms cheap for them to use however several supports did point out that they were not aware of the issue because intelcom had updated reports with amazon and they also said since a lot of us werestill are having problems it would seem intelcom falsified those shipping info to avoid penalization contracts with amazon and amazons a victim too
canada,not_removed,they have done this with one of my packages also my front door has steps in front of it and then its the sidewalk of course the package was not there anymore when i got home from work
canada,not_removed,the ceo of intelcom really appreciates the fact that you took the time to write an entire article about your dissatisfaction regarding our company we will be using your comments to adjust and improve our service he is also strongly interested in meeting you you can send me a private message at jbrindamourintelcomexpresscom thank you the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,i emailed this address numerous times and you guys ignore emails anyone who thinks that emailing this address will help them get their packages is seriously mistaken your company is a joke and i had to have amazon refund my order because you lied and didnt make delivery attempts when you said you would finally the day that amazon refunded my order you decided to show up and actually deliver my package in days you only actually made delivery attempt i dont believe that the first delivery attempt was actually made since there were people at my building the entire day and nobody showed up to our floor to ceiling glass doors with a package or delivery attempt notice
canada,not_removed,deleted
canada,not_removed,nice canned response no you cannot call them at because if you do you get a messaging service and nobody calls you back you could try the email address but they dont reply unless amazon contacts them and scares the shit out of them even then they dont bother to make another delivery attempt until well after youve already been refunded by amazon
canada,not_removed,what went wrong is the tracking was not accurate and i got my package the following week out of nowhere while i was originally trying the delivery service i was afraid id have to get a refund from amazon but my thing just showed up eventually just wait and hope i guess
canada,not_removed,i think it depends on the region canada post has been amazing for me as long as the package avoids montreal
canada,not_removed,on the other hand i have stuff ordered from amazoncom landmark from usa passed off to canadapost in canada arrive earlier than the presumed arrival dates normally like day but just got one order delivered today that was estimated for monday
canada,not_removed,nope it was just regular old free shipping
canada,not_removed,nevermind ups just did the same thing i notified amazon though so i hope you get to hear from them
canada,not_removed,yeah i might look into doing so id be curious to hear if anyone else has noticed this happening to them too might be worth people going through their old tracking numbers to see
canada,not_removed,we would like to assist you and identify the driver who seems to have signed for you indeed we consider forgery as an offense in order to obtain more details about the first delivery it would be appreciated if you could send us a private message at suiviamazonintelcomexpresscom we will be more than glad to make the necessary verifications the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,i just ordered something from amazonca and to my surprise the item was delivered within less than hours ordered on friday received on monday i thought intelcom no longer does deliveries over weekends their service is still crappy though they claimed they would deliver in the morning but they delivered at pm also the guy didnt even bother checking my identify in the lobbyi live in a condo he just gave me the item and ran anyone could have taken them at least i got the item i really wanted
canada,not_removed,update the package arrived on the promised date and in good shape i guess shipping to shop i work at has some benefits most cases i see here seem to be residential adresses
canada,not_removed,well my reorder to the cp pickup point went smoothly and received everything within to days funny thing my cancelled order showed up this week package had an intelcom sticker and a fedex sticker the latter indicating damaged shipping label days late good job intelcom
canada,not_removed,yeah i have not seen anything good about this company except for one comment in this thread one user said the package arrived and the drivers called ahead of time to make sure they were home out of replies i suppose it couldnt be impossible but with the google and yelp reviews thrown into the mix its more likely its an intelcom employee under a fake username lol
canada,not_removed,so this article was originally published in and was updated in there may have been significant changes since then years is a long time
canada,not_removed,excellent comment i think these guys actually get paid per delivery thats why its important to them to make every delivery other couriers drivers get paid by the hour with no performance incentives so they dont actually care whether they make deliveries just yesterday i got a parcel from intelcom i saw that the parcel was delivered while i was at work and i just moved to a new house so i was worried about where the guy might have left the parcel i was worried id show up and the parcel would be on my lawn or on my doorstep unguarded but it wasnt he carefully placed it between my screen door and my regular door perfect way better than a failed delivery notice or a summons to the depot on the edge of town besides if something does get stolen i would just tell amazon that i never got it and they would believe me ive been a prime member for two years and just got autobilled for my third year yesterday they trust their customers it is also very possible that this company is improving they have gotten a big surge in business since amazon started using them which makes sense that they would have some wrinkles to iron out as they were probably not used to the sheer volume of deliveries purolator actually also uses the same excuse since amazon stopped using canada post purolator has been swamped and the large volume is given as the main reason for the delays
canada,not_removed,the intelcom problems isnt one or two isolated incidents if you read through the thread there are people who have had multiple packages delivered by intelcom being either lost or delivered way late have you seen the reviews for purolator on trustpilot lately intelcom has a much better track record than purolator
canada,not_removed,amazon refunded me as well in a matter of hours which was appreciated
canada,not_removed,wrongit is amazon jacking up the price i am not talking about marketplace items i am talking about items sold by amazon i do not order items from the marketplace ever
canada,not_removed,also amazon jacks up the price when certain items are added to a persons wishlistfor me most noticeably its music items whether instruments of records ive documented this extensively and have screen shots one day i even went so far as to just start addding random items to my wishlist that are sold by amazon within hours of those items doubled in price the most noticeable price raise was on a guitar that was canadian suddenly went up to canadian sold and shipped by amazon
canada,not_removed,i feel your pain not sure what is going on and how parcels are seemingly missing let me know if your parcel turns up mine hasnt
canada,not_removed,canada posts flex delivery amazing idea thanks
canada,not_removed,i dont doubt it purolator is way worse than intelcom every single time people are giving intelcom way too much crap yes they are a little rough around the edges but not nearly as incompetent and corrupt as purolator have you seen the purolator reviews on trustpilot lately since the possibility of the canada post strike caused amazon to use other couriers there have been a ton of negative reviews about purolator just look httpscatrustpilotcomreviewpurolatorca my experience with intelcom is that they actually try really hard to deliver the packages if they knock and they see that youre probably home but arent answering the door they dont just leave like all the other couriers they keep knocking and try calling your cell phone they go out of their way to make sure parcels are delivered they also operate after business hours which is awesome because whats the point of ordering online when the delivery guy shows up while youre at work and you have to wait a full business day before getting the privilege to drive across town to pick up the parcel defeats the whole purpose of shopping online theres plenty to criticize about intelcom but purolator is way worse
canada,not_removed,you should tell your ceo that if he wants to have a respectable company with a good reputation he should actually ensure that his employees deliver packages intelcom is where packages go to die or be stolen or sold or something your company is a disgrace and i cannot afford to buy with amazon as long as your company is handling packages what a shame for amazon
canada,not_removed,classic intelcom lack of comprehension i didnt write the article i just experienced everything detailed in the article the same way as he did
canada,not_removed,your tracking still does not work seriously fix this
canada,not_removed,totally understand that i too would rather it take up to days for delivery and pick it up at the cp minutes away instead of running around and calling intelcom for my package i still feel like im paying for nothing considering the day shipping was my main reason for signing up
canada,not_removed,well thats depressing
canada,not_removed,we would like to assist you and identify the driver who seems to have signed for you indeed we consider forgery as an offense in order to obtain more details about the first delivery it would be appreciated if you could send us a private message at suiviamazonintelcomexpresscom we will be more than glad to make the necessary verifications the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,i went to pick up a package yesterday from intelcoms warehouse in leduc and the guy there asked if he could sign on my behalf i thought it was weird but said go ahead anyway interesting to see they did more or less the same to you i apparently had two packages out there and ended up just cancelling the second because i didnt know they were two separate packages and im not driving out there again for a item i live in edmonton
canada,not_removed,same here tried to forge my last name but wrote that wrong too
canada,not_removed,lucky you im still waiting on my item
canada,not_removed,google and yelp reviews for all couriers are one star seriously look up any specific ups or purolator location and see their star ratings some of them might have a most of them will be stars at the most pissed off people are way more likely to leave a review than satisfied customers most of what youre seeing on these reviews is the worst case scenario and the ratio of good experiences to bad experiences that you see on review sites isnt real you cant just say that only positive reply out of gives you a realistic picture of the service because youre looking at a thread titled intelcom sucks the op sounds like a bit of a dbag to be honest the guy gets credit from amazon because the courier that they cant control was late one time like half the stuff i order through prime is late and i never complain he admits that prior to this intelcom stuff he always got his packages on time and it was only late once and presumably he went crying to amazon about the one time it was late and they were nice enough to give the whiny customer some credit to get him to stfu guy sounds like a straight up difficult buyer i hope he never orders from ebay or discogs because it can take months to receive a parcel and customers have no choice but to be patient instead of leaving everyone negative reviews because the seller didnt meet their unrealistic expectations
canada,not_removed,i checked in with amazon customer service today it turns out that they lost the package completely there wasnt even an attempted delivery now i have to wait until the weekend is over until a replacement ships they said they cant choose a specific carrier for me so i couldnt potentially get intelcom again my weekend was just ruined
canada,not_removed,is it a regional thing im in alberta and have never had any issues with purolator
canada,not_removed,we contacted the author of the article however we wish to thank you for drawing our attention to his website sincerely the intelcom team
canada,not_removed,deleted
canada,not_removed,yep i can confirm that im not a prime member on amazonca and i have a package out for delivery with intelcom fingers crossed i actually stumbled on this post because i couldnt find a tracking link on intelcoms website a red flag if ever ive seen one for a shipping co so i just googled intelcom tracking
canada,not_removed,hi same here ordered a phone via amazon prime on august delivery slated as september but shipment arrived in edmonton ab on the itself i waited the whole day it says it will deliver before pm edmonton local time i waited till pm still nothing then again i checked at around pm the shipment status says delivered pm how can shipment be delivered hour later then i called amazon they told me that it scanned delivered by mistake i mean what the eff is that how can any one do that thank you for information regarding the warehouse i am going there tomorrow to find out
canada,not_removed,same says it was in edmonton and out for delivery and suppose to arrive yesterday by i didnt leave my apartment all day
canada,not_removed,i wasnt aware of the ratings ill have to dig into that regardless of that though if you google a companies name and the first results are all about how shit that company is it lends some weight in favor of op and i dont know the specifics for ops purchase but mine was late as well and i dont feel like its unreasonable or unrealistic to expect a package to show up within the guaranteed time advertised all over their site amazon especially if youre paying for it with services like prime or expedited delivery i am aware that most people dont give credit where credit is due so im sure this company does have some satisfied customers and yes op did come off as a little immature
canada,not_removed,same with me bud lost completely think someone did a runner with a truck full of goods by the sound of things however i did email amazon ceo at jeffamazoncom and got a free months prime plus they said they wont use intelcom for me again so worth a try
canada,not_removed,it could be an apartment building thing since i moved to a house purolator hasnt missed one delivery they just put the item behind my screen door when im not home which is perfect when i lived in an apartment building they always just skipped the whole building and then lied about attempting delivery
canada,not_removed,no problem i cancelled the auto renew on my membership prime just isnt worth it anymore between the shitty courier company and amazon taking its sweet time to mail out packages i ordered a prime item last week and it took days before they even shipped the order thankfully they shipped fedex though so i dont have to deal with intelcom good luck with your package buddy
canada,not_removed,nothing yet again even after calling them and being told it would be delivered yesterday
canada,not_removed,i dont feel like its unreasonable or unrealistic to expect a package to show up within the guaranteed time advertised all over their site amazon doesnt guarantee the two day delivery date they havent in almost a year it is an average two day delivery date
canada,not_removed,wow after being missing for three days its now out for delivery
canada,not_removed,update chatted online with a amazon cs rep this morning she tried calling intelcom and no one would answer she told me she would keep trying to call then call me back later she just called me back and said intelcom is not answering for anyone and she just went ahead and refunded my order because im likely not going to get it since an item i ordered was sold out now she helped me pick out another similar item and refunded the price difference i reordered and she bumped the shipping to one day at no cost to me i asked if she was sure it wouldnt be shipped using intelcom again she said theres no guarantee i see cupw just said theyre a day away from issuing a hour strike notice fingers crossed i beat it
canada,not_removed,then they should really really take that shit off their site because i enrolled in prime specifically for the fast deliveries and my last parcel i needed before i left on vacation so i checked the option need this sooner choose this method for delivery guaranteed by x time on x day for only xxxx more
canada,not_removed,and what did amazon do shipped my replacement package with intelcom again so done with this company
canada,not_removed,i think picking a cp pickup point is the only way to really avoid intelcom though at this point with the strike looming that wont work
canada,not_removed,its not on their site anymore though they havent used the word guaranteed in a long time just go try to order something right now youll see that the two day delivery option says averages two business days i think people underestimate how difficult it is to deliver stuff in a guaranteed way have you ever shipped a parcel to a buyer who bought something from you i have you drop it off at canada post and hope for the best you have no control over what happens all amazon can do is send canada post a stern letter if they cant deliver on time i have paid usd for shipping on one vinyl record when buying off discogs and ebay and waited weeks for the parcel to arrive that is frustrating amazon prime stuff is usually here in two days sometimes but compared to everything else its actually miraculous it also costs a lot of money to ship stuff especially for the fast options like a lot of money most sellers on ebay and discogs and other websites want the customer to pay for the real cost of shipping meaning it could easily cost you usd for shipping amazon is actually eating the cost of mailing and the cost of the packaging they are losing a lot of money because they can afford to eat those costs just to spite actual retailers if i was a small business i would hate amazon for sending all of their stuff for so cheap it probably costs amazon bucks to send each parcel through express shipping i have gotten vinyl records off amazon prime that cost bucks with free shipping amazon definitely lost money on those deals because the parcel probably cost them like bucks to ship they are intentionally losing money on shipping so that they can maintain their dominance over traditional brick and mortar retailers
canada,not_removed,i understand everything your saying i am usually pretty patient i am in no way shape or form trying to say i can do shit better but if a company this big is going to offer a policy they should be able to stand by it im not sure if its different in the us for amazon but in canadas amazon they still boast guaranteed deliveries all over the place and if you change from the expedited delivery option to the amazon prime free two day shipping the green guaranteed message changes from sept to sept they guarantee their services and when i pay extra for that specific service i expect them to be able to deliver
canada,not_removed,i have a ford fiesta that i just bought used a few months ago with the same problem it is going in to be fixed under warranty but the wait time to get in to the shop was months it goes in next week i thought they solved the problem i read some stuff that said they made a new clutch that fixed the issue
canada,not_removed,did you try the canadian motor vehicle arbitration plan
canada,not_removed,fiesta owner no bad problems but i am sure it will happen i think all models including have this problem
canada,not_removed,my focus had the same problem but i got it in on the recall almost immediately and its been good for a few years now there were ma y that the owners didnt bring in on the recall and then unloaded on unsuspecting buyers that have caused some major problems ford should fix it but the recall was issued in so people have had plenty of time to get the issue fixed
canada,not_removed,its been a known issue since the generation ford focus came out should have done your research and bought a focus with a manual transmission or something else i would just trade it in at the dealership and get something else if you feel guilty about selling it off to an unsuspecting buyer
canada,not_removed,i had one for a few years an early model took it in and they did something and it improved it never went away though i drove it afterwards in such a way as to avoid the issue if i recall it was just being less hesitant on the throttle not ideal for mileage but it was still great on gas kinda glad i got rid of it now although i love the drivetrain concept hope they get it sorted out
canada,not_removed,fiesta owner had the same issues as op clutch kept slipping out of gear and stalling or stuttering had my clutch replaced by ford last may only after i pestered them enough just before i hit the km mark and my warranty ran out my ford dealer had no idea this was an issue or didnt lead on like they did anyways i found out there was an issue with the clutch in other fiestas only after looking at the ford us service website nothing on the canadian one neutral start security system fried on me too and my car wouldnt start had to get that replaced constant problems with my abs sensors cant wait to get rid of this car but dont wish this pos on anyone else edit formatting
canada,not_removed,they certainly havent fixed the issue im on a wait list for my replacement it was also replaced this past may i was told after both the first and second replacement that we have redesigned the clutch with new plastics and metals and this should solve the issue the new clutchs have only given me a few months of smooth driving
canada,not_removed,i should also say i just hit
canada,not_removed,someone else had messaged me about that im going to look into that tonight thanks for bringing it up
canada,not_removed,yeah im on my third since the recall
canada,not_removed,yeah something else woulda been smart im come to realize it started with the there is a class action lawsuit being presented in canada that im going to try and get involved in even if i get nothing financially it will be an interested experience httpswwwcharneylawyerscomcharneyforddualclutchtransmissionclassactionphp
canada,not_removed,its been hell for me when i consider trading in or selling i feel guilty im far too honest and optimistic to be dealing with defective cars and their under delivering warranties i should have just spent the on cabs
canada,not_removed,that sucks to hear i knew about the clutch problem but i did not know it was an ongoing thing this must be costing ford a fortune also i am surprised their has not been any major accidents or deaths because of it how has this been kept under wraps let me know if you find anything out about motor vehicle arbitration plan maybe there is already another lawsuit or something in the works
canada,not_removed,dont think the dual clutch trans was offered in the models as it was still part of the gen could be wrong though really too bad that this is the case for the autos my focus has been trouble free from day one and i plan on running it into the ground
canada,not_removed,my focus gave me years of problem free driving when i had a baby i decided to replace it for something safer and more reliable in the long run yet here i am
canada,not_removed,yea they are all pretty solid except the first year of the focus and the gens lol
canada,not_removed,where did these tories come from
canada,not_removed,im about as pro legalization as they get but this seems backwards either second hand smoke is bad for you or its not theres no point in singling out tobacco smokers who i personally think are gross while making exceptions for pot smokers feel free to disagree
canada,not_removed,machiavelli theyre going to concede something innocuous to secure something much more devastating
canada,not_removed,sun life has now put nonsmoker status for their underwriting for marijuana smokers unless they also use tobacco httpnewsnationalpostcomhealthsunlifefirstinsurertostoptreatingpotusersassmokersasmarijuanaincreasinglyacceptedasamedicine
canada,not_removed,its more about the chemicals in the smoke think of it like having a fire and burning dried pine now add a few hazardous chemicals to the mix and its a completely different situation
canada,not_removed,i completely agree the laws should be changed to allow smoke lounges with adequate ventilation
canada,not_removed,i dont disagree but i will say is be very surprised if second hand vapor from a vaporizer were even a thousandth as bad for you as walking down the street huffing gasoline exhaust fumes and we arent banning that shit
canada,not_removed,although the concern is understandable there is little to no evidence suggesting that weed smoke is as bad as cigarrette smoke
canada,not_removed,feel free to disagree all smoke is the same to you just wow its such a narrow minded opinion
canada,not_removed,seriously can you link me to that one of my buddies just had to quit for a couple of months to get clean for an insurance test id love to send him that haha
canada,not_removed,there is times the tar in pot smoke its why i vape it the tar is probably the only bad thing in it though but i doubt its great for your health with that being said if such a place as a pot lounge existed those visiting it already made their health choices so it should be allowed
canada,not_removed,its more about the chemicals in the smoke just to add on some people think the chemicals are added to the cigarette for sure a few are accelerants to help it keep lit retardants to keep it from burning up in a matter of seconds but most of these chemicals are synthesized during the actual burning of the cigarette youre right to say theyre in the smoke even though they may not have all been there in the unlit cigarette
canada,not_removed,smoke is bad for your respiratory system whether or not pot smoke offsets the negative impact on your respiratory system is highly questionable at best
canada,not_removed,ive also seen them claim that pot cures cancer too im prolegalization but you have to admit a lot of people who smoke dont exactly make the rest look that smart with their outlandish claims
canada,not_removed,just added it
canada,not_removed,thats not entirely true the american lung association did a study on this and while marijuana smoke deposits four times as much tar as cigarettes do into the users lungs its mainly due to how a joint is smoked compared to a cigarette the user inhales longer and holds the smoke in longer than they would if they were smoking a cigarette
canada,not_removed,there might be more tar but i also smoke about less of the volume a cig smoker would in a day
canada,not_removed,theres a metric shit ton of pesticide toxins in tobacco i dont believe it has the same regulations as food either my cannabis is organic and doesnt use pesticides
canada,not_removed,ive also seen them claim that pot cures cancer too alas tommy chong got cancer
canada,not_removed,awesome haha
canada,not_removed,that wouldnt surprise me that different studies get different results the times figure i gave was from an old study just changing the strain could alter the end result regardless its probably not helping its why many switch to vaping that and the cost efficiency
canada,not_removed,thanks doc
canada,not_removed,dick and ass cancer
canada,not_removed,not necessarily there is more money to be made in treating a deadly disease than there is in curing it so it is possible that this type of information would be hiddencovered up
canada,not_removed,thats better than my lawyer
canada,not_removed,calm down there bud i never said i believed that i was just saying its not out of the realm of possibility
canada,not_removed,hi your lawyer here i was just thinking about you for the last minutes you still at the same address greeeeaaat
canada,not_removed,i dont think this is linked to the government in office apparently the cbc bosses are still largely those appointed by harper anyway cbc has been struggling with what to do with their comment sections for a while now they subcontracted it to viafora or however thats spelled if they are still doing it which routinely makes a mess of moderation they have been talking about getting rid of anonymous comments in order to deal with the trollinginsultsgeneralgradeschoollevelnonsense that is common in the comments i thought that was to be in place by now so maybe theyve changed direction on that or found it more difficult than anticipated the bottom line is that moderation costs money so they seem to be steadily reducing the number of stories that allow comments political stories often bring out some comments in need of moderation too i dont think this is some kind of liberal conspiracy thing edit according to the note above the comments sections anonymous comments are to be gone in june
canada,not_removed,the cbc comment section is one of the worst on the planet its one thing to have a discussion forum like reddit but i think more and more media outlets are realizing that comment sections just lower the level of discourse many are getting rid of them entirely
canada,not_removed,cbc has been going to no comments for a while now i dont even bother if there is a story that i want to comment on or want to know what others think i just post it on reddit cbc comment section sucks anyway sometimes it takes hours for a comment to go up and so responses etc are useless also if they dont like your opinion they delete it what i miss is the broader set of opinions because not everyone is on reddit
canada,not_removed,nope havent noticed cause i dont goto cbc anymore
canada,not_removed,cbc comments are the worst if you can even comment your post will probably be deleted by a moderator
canada,not_removed,i frequented cbc comments all the time for many years i saw the comment system change i saw the intelligent commenters disappear i even proved it was recently and in the past for kicks recently since the election it has turned upside down trudeau is blamed for everything and i cant emphasize that enough its been months if cbc commenters are to be believed the sky is falling in canada and its trudeaus fault i havent seen a valuable comment on cbc in months its a fucking cesspool of vapid hateful ignorant neocon trolls they know cbc is the most popular broadcaster in the country how else are they going to spread their message reddit as if someone here would pat them on the back for spreading inaccurate misinformed fear so whats the alternative fill cbc comments with drivel
canada,not_removed,til that the cbc which is governed by harper appointees is brainwashing canadians with lefty propaganda and protecting the liberals from the opinions of the wellinformed rational and sanguine commentators that op dearly misses also monkeys are flying out of my butt and the moon is made of green cheese
canada,not_removed,its not just the cbc almost every canadian news site has shut down their comments section recently and most of the ones that havent have decided to either heavily censor or else ban comments on most stories the national post and the sun used disqus they shut down the comments during the election so its not because the liberals are doing it and those papers wouldnt be trying to protect the liberals anyway its because the media doesnt like people having politically incorrect conversations andor disagreeing with their columnists they simply dont believe in free speech for the public only for themselves the cbc comment section was useless anyway too much censorship poor interface and the comments were delayed
canada,not_removed,i dont agree with the original thesis of this thread that the disappearance of comment sections is driven by partisanship however apparently the cbc bosses are still largely those appointed by harper anyway it bears pointing out that whoever the people on the board are the cbc is vastly dominated by liberal employees at basically every level throughout the hierarchy
canada,not_removed,i dont think this is some kind of liberal conspiracy thing no but the cbc has obviously leaned left on most issues for a long time now which begs the question how can they be so blatantly left leaning while being funded by taxpayers money imo they ought to either be apolitical or have their public funding pulled
canada,not_removed,lower the level of discourse you mean like actually hearing what the people think of these issues
canada,not_removed,yeah stories on gender or aboriginal issues also seem to have no comment sections its almost as if cbc is trying to control thought rather than report the news
canada,not_removed,it is occupied by people paid to post there it is vitally important for the oligarch class to prevent open honest communication the majority of people are empathetic and generous and support ideals that run contrary to oligarchs interests if people start connecting with people they start to see whats wrong in this world if people start seeing whats wrong in this world theyll want to change it if this world changes oligarchs are first up agains the wall and thus you get the cesspool we identify as news media comment sections
canada,not_removed,which is governed by harper appointees
canada,not_removed,something something reality has a liberal bias
canada,not_removed,are you butthurt that you cant troll the cbc comment section anymore no im concerned that people with informed opinion cant express them in what should be an open and democratic forum im concerned that a taxpayer funded broadcasting corp is hijacking their platform for political purposes when your journalists fawn over an elected pm you have to admit that there is something wrong with this picture
canada,not_removed,are you implying the cbc employs journalists lol bloggers arent journalists journalists report news not their opinion with their spin on it
canada,not_removed,no but the cbc has obviously leaned left on most issues for a long time now many including me would disagree with that assessment their opinion pieces may lean left although ive read neil macdonald articles critical of liberal governmentspoliciespeople taken in a broader scope everything has some sort of leaning you just have to pick what seems the most impartial or make your own decisions regarding what you hear compared to what sun news was or the deliberately inflammatory stuff the rebel is putting out cbc looks very neutral but i suspect well have to agree to disagree on this also you seem to agree that the situation with the comment section isnt motivated by political influence on the cbc which appeared to me to be what you were suggesting in your op
canada,not_removed,the cbc has obviously leaned left on most issues for a long time now since they broadcast hundreds of hours of media every week im sure youll be able to find a lot of examples they also have an ombudsman whos in charge of whether their news is biased my guess is youre the one with the bias
canada,not_removed,they just got a big raise from trudeau in the last budget and the promise of more to come their bias is now fully funded
canada,not_removed,well sometimes theres that and sometimes theres the jews are using the indians as their patsies to destroy the white race i wouldnt want to moderate that
canada,not_removed,the real names was never put in place as far as i know
canada,not_removed,by not allowing sad men to whine about cunts jews and niggers in an unmoderated freeforall comments delegitimize news sources most users have no use for them because theyre so toxic and abusive and they mostly attract traffic you probably dont want legitimate discussions are rare short generally interrupted by someone saying the word cuck a lot or calling kathleen wynne a man and transposable if you want to discuss the news there are better forums than anonymous comments they cost money to maintain they demoralize your staff female journalists in particular hoooo boy they may amount to legal exposure they dont generate desirable traffic they dont host worthwhile discussions from the sites perspective whats to like
canada,not_removed,its almost as if cbc is trying to control thought rather than report the news no theyre reporting the news and have decided like many media outlets that the cost and effort required to moderate comments isnt worth the reward i suppose you think the toronto sun is also trying to control thought
canada,not_removed,i know for a fact that the cbc eliminated comments for articles related to the indigenous community
canada,not_removed,is it a conspiracy
canada,not_removed,when i see people posting in excess of times per day often in the same article in the middle of the day during the week i suspect paid writers as well what their motivations are we can only speculate its something id expect to find in china by i think its naive to not assume their are similar tactics used by pr companies marketers political parties any given interest group cbc is the easiest avenue to attack as it can take a good hour before someone calls out a troll on misinformation only to have their comment hidden an hour later when more people chime in to agree with the trollthe current cbc comment layout makes this possible
canada,not_removed,sorry did i stutter eight of the ten directors of cbc were appointed by harper everybody knows this
canada,not_removed,i dont know about you but ive never seen anything i would consider an informed opinion in the comments section of any news purveyor
canada,not_removed,what should be an open and democratic forum why should the cbc allow comments when your journalists fawn over an elected pm you have to admit that there is something wrong with this picture suchas
canada,not_removed,many including me would disagree with that assessment let me guess you lean left
canada,not_removed,well sometimes theres that and sometimes theres the jews are using the indians as their patsies to destroy the white race i wouldnt want to moderate that of course you moderate that out did i say otherwise
canada,not_removed,no theyre reporting the news and have decided like many media outlets that the cost and effort required to moderate comments isnt worth the reward its not just in comments its in the reports themselves plus controlling the comments
canada,not_removed,no its what they do cbc has leaned left for years
canada,not_removed,a good many of those are bots highpowered natural language processing toolkits are readily available it is almost childs play these days to use this technology to write passable news media comments theres every chance that their purpose is to simply render news media forums unusable just like youtube comments it shuts down a communications channel that would be open to the public drives them to facebook
canada,not_removed,and yet the cbc still hit harper every chance they got and supported the liberals every chance they got there is something wrong with your theory that the appointed directors actually set news coverage policy
canada,not_removed,ive seen lots of good points being made and discussed you just have to have a decent moderator to screen out the trolls and the misbehaved
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,ill ignore the snide overtone assume you could have ended that with a question mark and give you an honest answer leftprogressive on social issues center or right on many financial issues i have voted conservative provincially in the past i consider myself an issues voter not a partisan voter i think partisan polarization is a negative thing useful to political parties but bad for citizens in general we should not treat political parties like sports teams where we stick with them no matter what decide based on issues and also based on the people running for office not what party they represent
canada,not_removed,and cbc has decided that the effort of moderating so much drivel isnt worth it if the everyday joan wants to state her opinion let her do it somewhere else
canada,not_removed,nope i just now tried it i logged in using my cbc chat name aka email
canada,not_removed,its in the reports themselves suchas
canada,not_removed,but what are you saying they control thought by deleting troll posts in their comments sections
canada,not_removed,lets play bot or human go look at the most liked comments select the second user down named count how many comments heshe has made in the last hoursill spare you the hassle comments look at the content its probably a real person sadly the rest of the comments as predicted all blame trudeau i wrote to automate account creation on cbc it isnt difficult to extend it to comment filling bot status so i absolutely agree with you
canada,not_removed,yah cbc didnt hype elbowgate at all nosirree their nonstop multiday coverage just did not happen they didnt satirize it in their political commentary videos at all they didnt publish the opinions of respected experts who said trudeau was a bad boy nopenopenope what colour is the sky in your world buddy the cbc has always ridden our politicians asses its essentially their mandate by the way you are of course aware that the httpwwwthecanadianencyclopediacaenarticlecanadianbroadcastingcorporation
canada,not_removed,natpo and therebel now theres bias
canada,not_removed,i consider myself an issues voter not a partisan voter i think partisan polarization is a negative thing useful to political parties but bad for citizens in general we should not treat political parties like sports teams where we stick with them no matter what decide based on issues and also based on the people running for office not what party they represent good point and i agree completely
canada,not_removed,my politics are naturally left leaning socially speaking and fiscally conservative in other words if were gonna spend tax money spend it where it will do some good or dont spend it at all i completely object to the cbc being social advocates when all we need from them is apolitical news and entertainment if they dont understand that then they need to go independent from tax funding
canada,not_removed,no you moron by overmoderating and excluding valid posts andor simply not allowing comments at all learn to read dipstick
canada,not_removed,its called httpsenwikipediaorgwikimediamanipulationdistractionbyphenomenon distracting the media and public from an important issue the motion being brought forward by the whip that would have given liberals overreaching power to control the business in the hoc with another issue look over there trudeau bumped an mp when people started to notice what the motion was the media party turned up the rhetoric of elbowgate to deflect attention someone from the ndp was on the radio the other day commenting that much of the hype about them playing up the incident was coming from the media itself good tactic on their part because now it appears the whole thing is silly thus makes it burn out of the news cycle faster all while making justin look good and hardly no one even noticed that motion and you fell for it hook line and sinker
canada,not_removed,cbc hyped the overthetop nonsense of the ndp and ignored the simple fact that a sitting pm angrily stomped across the house of commons dropping fbombs and grabbed the conservative whip physically by the arm and tried to manhandle him through the gaggle of ndp mps to his seat did you notice that cbc never mentioned that part much
canada,not_removed,well maybe we agree on some things aside from the cbc personally i value it where you dont every other news source is corporately owned do you think that contributes to impartiality i sure dont cbc while far from perfect is our best attempt to keep corporate influence out of the news i agree with you that we should also keep political influence out we simply disagree on the degree to which cbc is politically influenced
canada,not_removed,youre making a good case for the cbc fwiw if idiots like you are posting its easily seen why they would not allow posting cheers
canada,not_removed,actually dude i decried the elbowgate media fracas several times from the very getgo and then committed to downvoting every post involving it and still do however i dont recall seeing any posts from you telling people that theyre being distracted from important news so um welcome to my scene i guess
canada,not_removed,judging by your inability to read simple english yeah whatever
canada,not_removed,sigh you already know why theyre doing it its because of all the trolling doubledowning on the trolling effort is quite frankly useless
canada,not_removed,you know you can unsubscribe with one mouse click right
canada,not_removed,is this something you werent expecting when you subscribed to a political party mailing list id suggest you know unsubscribing
canada,not_removed,sounds manipulative
canada,not_removed,liberal part is awful wheres my electoral reform
canada,not_removed,give a mouse a cookie
canada,not_removed,donate your money to a different federal party and send them an email thanking them for reminding you
canada,not_removed,i dont think anyone subscribes to be spammed with money begging emails
canada,not_removed,i signed at a dispensary with my email earlier today does that count
canada,not_removed,the fact that there is a muslim only building is ridiculous if someone tried to make a christian only building it would be against all sorts of laws on discrimination etc pisses me off that they make all these exceptions for muslims
canada,not_removed,i thought this sounded familiar the story is from a year and a half ago
canada,not_removed,there are nonprofit housing places where you need to be christian or of a particular ethnicity that was a dumb idea to begin with but its not as if it suddenly appeared with this muslim building
canada,not_removed,nothing like posting a rebel media youtube video to rcanada to show credibility
canada,not_removed,the rebel like id believe this fascist propaganda ive reported you for islamophobia i thought we were more diverse than this diversity is our strength dump drumpf bash the fash
canada,not_removed,i new this was the rebel before i clicked the link it had the smell of real news in a sea of fake communist broadcasting collective articles
canada,not_removed,live about minutes from this building im muslim and my entire family thinks its ridiculous
canada,not_removed,seriously wtf is up with this i thought canada was supposed to be at least a bit secular
canada,not_removed,youve misunderstood things my friend its not an exception for muslims there are eight such buildings in toronto catering to muslims macedonians germans and seniors who are christian chinese greek hungarian or lithuanian and note that ops video and this article are from
canada,not_removed,but there are christian only buildings
canada,not_removed,because its remember careful not to say anything about muslims or they might lock you up as an islamophobe
canada,not_removed,actually there are christian only buildings under this same program in the same city so no exceptions were made for muslims rebel media is a very biased outfit this happened almost two years ago
canada,not_removed,got a source on that im not trying to be combative im genuinely interested if this happens
canada,not_removed,publicly funded
canada,not_removed,well it turned out to be fake news as it is a year and half late as well as neglecting to mention christian oriented complexes
canada,not_removed,secular certainly not the millennial generation the new order of the day is a brand of neomarxist philosophy that divides society up into broad groups of privileged and disprivileged the privileged just like the kolaks of the soviet union need to give ground before we can realize our egalitarian utopia this neomarxist revolution is being headquartered in our post secondary system yep the same one that gets your tax dollars there was a study done showing that in modern social science professors openly identify as a marxist scary stuff indeed remember when people were warning that shit like gender quotas and affirmative action were a slippery slope this is what they were talking about
canada,not_removed,are they publicly financed too
canada,not_removed,well those shouldnt exist either
canada,not_removed,there are definitely jewish care homes in winnipeg not sure if theyre jewish only would have to check on that
canada,not_removed,from while many attacked the idea that a subsidized residence could be restricted to muslims only its not the only location in toronto that selects tenants based on religion or age the mcclintock manor on pape avenue is geared to christian seniors under the mandate adopted by toronto city council in a total of eight residences are geared to targeted groups including buildings that house those of macedonian chinese lithuanian and greek backgrounds in a statement defending its practice the city says the provisions do not violate human rights laws the article and ops video are from btw
canada,not_removed,sure httpwwwnisbetlodgecommcclintockmanor httpwwwhellenichomeorgseniorshousingapplyasp httpwwwwigwamencomhousinglocationsapply
canada,not_removed,eh true its stupid i dont have any words on the whole cant insult islam law because legally i am not allowed to have them lol
canada,not_removed,yes because millennials made the decision to subsidize a muslim only building with government money right
canada,not_removed,very realistic comparison i dont think marxist thinking is bad in some areas but our post secondary system is becoming borderline indoctrination to think differently is a dangerous concept and criticism is usually kept to oneself people are promoted to conform rather than question in some fields
canada,not_removed,the subheadline of the article says city subsidizes affordable housing buildings that only take residents from a certain ethnic religious or cultural group so yes the others also get public funding
canada,not_removed,are they private or subsidized by tax dollars
canada,not_removed,thanks theres certainly still a strange hypocrisy happening here though there seems to be somewhat of an exception being made for old age homes perhaps due to historical prejudices in earlier generations but whats the difference with regards to larger scale residential housing not that id want to but as a residential landlord im well aware that refusing tenants due to race or religion is flat out illegal why the double standard for the sake of the argument why cant i advertise my condo as christianonly but they can advertise and enforce an entire apartment building being muslim only
canada,not_removed,the main thing is i think do they receive subsidy from the government
canada,not_removed,i have no idea its certainly possible since the earliest millennials are well into their now and have high level jobs it is relevant though we were talking about a modern divergence from secularism and its causes or are you asking this question just to be edgy
canada,not_removed,thats the study that found of social science professors considered themselves marxist
canada,not_removed,i honestly have no idea would have to look into it
canada,not_removed,i think speaks to that the safe space comment in the last paragraph below lawyer barry swadron who has extensive experience in disability law says the ontario human rights code allows for this kind of discrimination here you have a building for muslims and normally that would be discriminatory because other religions could not be accommodated there but the human rights code says if its a specialinterests organization — religious philanthropic educational or social — they can discriminate in that way he said its very unfortunate but thats how the law was written while the intention was to create safe spaces for minority communities this kind of permissible positive discrimination inevitably produces collateral damage swadron said
canada,not_removed,yes
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,i have no idea thats obvious
canada,not_removed,makes bold claims and sweeping declarations about neomarxism i have no idea
canada,not_removed,neo simply means new did you not know that
canada,not_removed,exactly but if we called it that there wouldnt be any controversy
canada,not_removed,and doesnt restrict freedom of speech no but it seeks to thats the point
canada,not_removed,see above for the slippery slope example
canada,not_removed,you asked what they were talking about i know its not a law
canada,not_removed,what in the fuck are you talking about neo always means new even when talking about neoconservatism or neoliberalism anyways to answer your somewhat coherent question perhaps the core component of marxism is a rejection of the individual and the establishment of identity groups based on race class or culture in historical practice the soviet union split society up into various socioeconomic groups like the proletariat and the bourgeoisie economic status is then equaled by some form of state intervention to produce an egalitarian utopia in theory in practice it always results in the opposite this is certainly not unlike hiring a woman because you have a gender quota to fill or making an exception for religious discrimination based on religions the state deems to be disadvantaged
canada,not_removed,this happened years back when health canada did the same thing on a windowless envelope there is a class action lawsuit pending on that incident
canada,not_removed,scott stuart should be in there too
canada,not_removed,libertarians are people who were born on third base but think they hit a triple theyve never had to work their way up to independence from the minimum wage job to try to feed clothe and house themselves on less than dollars an hour in jobs that often dont even provide hours a week because of employers gaming employment rules to withhold benefits from their employees
canada,not_removed,more to my point of the epidemic of part time work
canada,not_removed,the man is dead right if you increase minimum wage beyond simple inflation it can only result in a reduction in employment or an increase in prices countering the benefit of the increase unless it occurs in a tight localized market such as a city wide minimum wage
canada,not_removed,this is why some are forced to work minimum wage jobs just so they can get enough money by the end of the week this is why workers demand a higher wage due to their living standards dollars an hour is not enough
canada,not_removed,i cannot up vote this comment enough
canada,not_removed,they picked themselves up by their bootstraps provided for by their parents and paid for university themselves of which was funded by taxpayers and looked after their own health facilitated by public healthcare and public clean water and sanitation who are you to tell them what they should do with their hard earned money protected by publicly funded institutions that ensure the rule of law huh
canada,not_removed,libertarians are people who were born on third base but think they hit a triple bullshit we are people who worked our way up and believe it is the only way to build a solid foundation theyve never had to work their way up to independence from the minimum wage job i absolutely did and quickly learned that there were better options at other costs and balanced my choices accordingly i switched from working in the gas station to working sheet metal and doing cleanup on industrial farms because although the jobs were more difficult and had painfully long hours they simply paid more to try to feed clothe and house themselves on less than dollars an hour in jobs that often dont even provide hours a week because of employers gaming employment rules to withhold benefits from their employees utter nonsense i had jobs from the time i was and many of them were minimum wage
canada,not_removed,do you believe in trickledown economics
canada,not_removed,this conservative argument that increases in the minimum wage will result in a shrinkage of the job market fails to materialize every single time it has been brought up
canada,not_removed,your last comment does not actually address his last comment and its the most important part
canada,not_removed,so because you had to do it makes its right and just thats bullshit reasoning right there
canada,not_removed,sure i did too back when the minimum wage was less than an hour that world doesnt exist any more for a lot of people
canada,not_removed,trickledown economics also referred to as trickledown theory is a populist political term used to characterize economic policies as favoring the wealthy or privileged there is no trickle down economics as defined by economists the term is almost exclusively used by critics of policies with other established names it is usually associated with criticism of laissezfaire capitalism in general and more specifically supplyside economics httpsenwikipediaorgwikitrickledowneconomics i strongly believe that laissezfaire capitalism is the most sustainable economic system possible and that government intervention inevitably does more damage than good long term all forms of price control hurt those they are designed to protect the most and do grave damage rent controls reduce the desire to create rental units and thus housing becomes more expensive do you believe in trickledown economics i think it is a problematic term and that laissezfaire capitalism is a more accurate description i think without the transition to laissezfaire capitalism that was scene under thatcher in the uk the uk would be in a similar economic crisis as greece and i believe that the us economy improved due to deregulation as was proven by the laissezfaire economic policies of the clinton years under greenspan as well as in canada under chretien and martin i think that the price control models under trudeau and under chavez both led to hyper inflation which inherently did more damage to the poor and middle class than they provided benefit
canada,not_removed,but doesnt full time employment drop and part time employment increase
canada,not_removed,your last comment does not actually address his last comment and its the most important part like many others i have fed and clothed myself and sheltered myself at times for minimum wage however i also recognize that minimum wage should only exist for a short period of time in each case i was able to quickly establish my value and get my wages to reflect this i have scrubbed many a dish and pan in many a restaurant over the years and worked many janitorial jobs too simply pointing this at libertarians is silly
canada,not_removed,so because you had to do it makes its right and just no because i could do it and because effectively all of my family members could do it and because almost everyone i worked with over the years could do it and because over of canadians own there homes and could obviously do it maybe the issue is with you and not with us thats bullshit reasoning right there you commented on your own bs paraphrase what the hell do you expect
canada,not_removed,dont project your circumstances and history with everyone elses my history is similar to yours and by all measures i am pretty successful most of it was plain old hard work and good decisions but some of it was just dumb luck i have enough empathy to know that many people struggle through no fault of their own they have limited resources and lack the wherewithal to make their own breaks you must live in a bubble to not see it get out of your gated community and see how the bottom of society live realize how fortunate you are to have the ability and fortitude to make good
canada,not_removed,stop coddling others and be straight with them it does more good then crocodile tears and victimization we can realize our fortune and success and not be so condescending as to argue others cant i dont live in any form of a bubble i fundamentally believe your approach is wrong i believe i can help more people escape the bondage of poverty with harsh reality and by empowering them then you can with empathy on sunday i will be working with my personal charity digging a sewage trench in a slum in manila where i am currently based to date we have provided sewage for people i will personally pay the to fly you here for a month so you can understand the true nature of the bubble you exist in
canada,not_removed,lmao you must be a head troll do you not realize you just shot down everything you stood for you mock empathy yet there you are in manila doing charitable work you talk about harsh reality and not coddling yet there you are in manila doing charitable work i am grateful that you are doing charitable works but you are a hypocrite
canada,not_removed,thanks for your submission to rcanada unfortunately your post was removed because it does not comply with the following rules submission content posts which do not relate to canada will be removed tldr stay on topic dont make posts considered low content dont post duplicate content if you believe a mistake was made please feel free to message the moderators including a link to the removed post you can view a complete set of our rules by visiting the rcanadawikirules
canada,not_removed,it may not even be legal under international law countries have certain obligations towards refugees under international human rights laws under domestic law it may be unconstitutional here is a very very good writeup discussing the fact that it is an incompetently written piece of legislation that does not even serve its purported purpose httpslawfareblogcommalevolencetemperedincompetencetrumpshorrifyingexecutiveorderrefugeesandvisas
canada,not_removed,it affects more than those countries the us has numerous diplomatic commitments and has just violated at least one big one the us had previously committed to an international law that required that they take a share of refugees when a crises erupts the visa requirements for international travel differ for every international relationship and often is the result of negotiations this travel ban is a slap in the face to every country that has ever sat at a negotiating table with the us it the us wants to close its borders and cut of all international entanglements they are free to do that but there will be consequences if they are going to throw out individual commitments on the fly they are going to have a hell of a time expecting other countries to continue to follow agreements that would otherwise have been taken for granted
canada,not_removed,its a complete blanket ban on travel or immigration from any national of these countries its a throwback to racist immigration policies of the past the motivations behind it are bigoted xenophobic racist do you remember learning about canadas antiasian immigration laws in social studies it also applies to immigrants and refugees who had already been accepted under the previous administration and green card holders aka permanent residents a step short of being citizens who had left the country on travel getting turned away for forgetting your student visa isnt really the same as being turned away for being from a certain country it isnt the same as fleeing dire circumstances and instability and finding a country made up of immigrants holds no sympathy for your plight that almost no other country does either that the world basically gave you a giant middle finger ive also always questioned why so many muslims want to come to the usa its the usa and saudi arabias fault that these parts of the world are destabilized youre underestimating the impact of the american dream in nonwestern countries western countries are seen as bastions of economic prospects equal opportunity and freedom many muslim countries dont allow jews to visit this is antisemitic and wrong although specifically its israeli nationals but were supposed to position ourselves as above countries like iran right why shouldnt it be worried that there are individuals that may wish to do it harm because they blew up their family members because annually the deaths from islamic terrorists are little compared to other causes of death that youre much more likely to be killed in a random mass shooting by a young white male shooter it would be rightfully hailed as racist and discriminatory if all of a sudden we only ever checked white men at security points for movie theatres or schools and made it policy to do so couldnt we help refugees for the price of in safe zones in the middle east intervention in the middle east by the west is a cause of a lot of the instability but thats a good point the thing is theres not exactly a lot of safe zones in the middle east its a region marked by economic and political instability if you were born in such circumstances and they deteriorated to the point of a civil war wouldnt you want to leave to a country that markets itself as a haven of economic prosperity freedom and hope the reason you hear the compassion argument the most is because it is the primary argument its a question of morality not whether or not the us has the legal right to do this although it may be found unconstitutional and in violation of international law but thats not the primary discussion economically refugees do take longer to adjust and contribute to society to the same extent immigrants do but generally they provide the same economic benefits immigration does
canada,not_removed,the liberals are loosing their shit over this decision when it was the obama administration that selected these countries as those that pose the highest threat for exporting terrorism to america and the rest of the western world obama also put a month ban on iranian immigration to the usa in where was the outrage and protests for that decision
canada,not_removed,do you remember last year when the liberals promised to bring whatever number of refugees it was and there were concerns about speed vs screening and we ultimately slowed it down so we could do it properly its basically this but because its americans do it they have to be the most dramatic hysterical and crazy people in both implementation and reaction to it
canada,not_removed,do you remember last year when the liberals promised to bring whatever number of refugees it was was the number they pulled out of their ass and there were concerns about speed vs screening and we ultimately slowed it down so we could do it properly making good on the ndp promise huzzah
canada,not_removed,theres actually literally nothing new here there is no new standard for convictions for these types of cases the scc reiterates and explains but nothing in our law changes circumstantial evidence is evidence which leads to an inference of a fact if i walk through your front door soaking wet and shaking off a wet umbrella that is circumstantial evidence that it is raining out contrast that to direct evidence which would be if i were to say that it is raining out now there could be alternative explanations for the wet umbrella but an available inference is that it is raining outside is it possible that i was walking by with my umbrella out and an enraged rtoronto user poured water on me sure but is that a reasonable inference or would be it pure speculation to assume so without any evidence of that fact thats the issue in this case whether or not the whole of all the circumstantial evidence required the crown to negate speculative inferences in order to prove a fact beyond a reasonable doubt it was always possible to convict anyone on almost any charge based on circumstantial evidence particularly crimes that involve the elements of possession and control or identity the ancient rule from hodges case says that in order to convict must be satisfied not only that the circumstantial evidence was consistent with guilt but rationally inconsistent with any other conclusion than guilt the trial court convicted him on circumstantial evidence applying the correct test he owned and possessed the computer the files were downloaded on that computer via limewire he was the only user his username was inextricably tied to the computer the files were hidden the files were viewed through two different media players the names of the files were explicit he brought the computer to the repair shop the files were downloaded at least three months before he brought the computer in for repair all of this evidence is circumstantial evidence that the material would not have been downloaded without the users knowledge and the nature of the material would have been obvious that is to say the court found that he possessed it knowingly it looks like the alberta court of appeal went a bit offside and the scc corrected them the court of appeal said that the requirement that circumstantial evidence must totally exclude any other conceivable inference the scc confirms that that is not the case there is always room to draw a reasonable doubt but that doubt must be reasonable that is you cant just speculate and you cant expect the crown to presumptively rebut any nonrational speculative inferences such as the fact that a rogue hacker downloaded the files on his computer if the available inferences do not raise a reasonable doubt then that fact is proven in criminal court imagine this scenario a car runs over a person on the street in the middle of the night and takes off a few km down the road the suspects car is found in a ditch a further km down the relatively empty road a man is found walking piss drunk he is the sole registrant of that car should he be convicted is the fact that he did this an available inference are there any other rational inferences now lets modify the scenario by saying that a witness stated that they only say one person in the car though they could not identify the person does this strengthen the inference do you think we should require that the crown disprove that there wasnt a speculative second person that ran a different way through the woods even though theres nothing to support this
canada,not_removed,this is bad a hacker can easily place a file on someones computer there are other scenarios too innocent men will be jailed
canada,not_removed,tldr child pornography shouldnt be held to the same standards of evidence as other crimes because reasons
canada,not_removed,i am completely against it being possible to convict somebody with only circumstantial evidence but i dont see how this case was based on circumstantial evidence it was his laptop that he took in for service and only had one user account on it that seems like a fairly solid case to me
canada,not_removed,in particular in some cases completely circumstantial evidence can be enough in child port cases this means that it is still entirely possible to get pretty much anyone in huge trouble just by carefully creating a record of child porn download on their computer and then discovering it but that is an inherent problem with the law
canada,not_removed,all defence did was suggest that there may have been an alternate possibility such a defence needs to have an air of reality its up to the defence to show that there was a virus downloading child porn ie thats why he took it to be fixed a vengeful ex or other hateful acquaintance or whatever they didnt and the courts have said its not up to crown to come up with and destroy every possible hypothesis edit correct autocorrect
canada,not_removed,next time read more than the title before you do a tldr
canada,not_removed,the question was how it got there if he purchased the computer new was it purchased by someone else before and then returned was it a friend using his computer was it an ex trying to get back at her former boyfriend was it a large music file he downloaded that somehow had illegal content stuffed into it somewhere that he never found theres many possibilities of how it would end up there and with computer forensics it should be up to the prosecution to trace it now if it was a large amount of illegal content that may be a different story
canada,not_removed,its up to the defence to show that there was a virus downloading child porn ie thats why he took it to be fixed a vengeful ex or other hateful acquaintance no just no this is not how criminal law works or at least i didnt think so until this incomprehensible ruling
canada,not_removed,hmm ok i can see those situations now i didnt think of those before
canada,not_removed,if im borrowing a friends car and i get caught with his drugs in the car i get charged accountability is a thing and there is no reason in todays day and age that an individual should be blindsided by child porn on their computers
canada,not_removed,actually its a pretty dull ruling the air of reality is almost a standard for example its not enough for defence to say the radarfor speeding or breathalyzer for drunk driving is wrong they need to cite specific conditions that would make the instruments inaccurate and show through cross examinination that the police did not ensure accuracy yes its been done acquittals have happened same with the computer did the police check for maliscous software did defence show others had access even computer idiots usually try to get rid of stuff they dont want says the person who cleaned friends computers of thousands yes thousands of viruses malware and spyware edit words
canada,not_removed,its not that incomprehensible its short compared to many scc judgements
canada,not_removed,or at least i didnt think so until this incomprehensible ruling your comment is indicative of your ignorance of the law not the ruling
canada,not_removed,a car cant get a virus that allows an anonymous attacker to manipulate it into transporting drugs this can and does happen with computers and child porn
canada,not_removed,if im borrowing a friends car and i get caught with his drugs in the car i get charged the supreme court has delt with this already possession requires knowledge if you didnt know it was in the car it for all legal intents was not in the car
canada,not_removed,ive downloaded gigs and gigs of large music files ive been collecting a certain podcast which has led me to finding other things i wanted this was quite awhile ago as i simply dont have the time to keep up with it and im a new subscriber to spotify its not worth it to have external hard drives full of music ive downloaded some music files with gb of music ill admit i havent had the time to go through all of it if there could possibly be any illegal content stuffed in any of it i wouldnt know however it is highly unlikely because when i download things i make sure the reviews are good and besides that the chances are very slim however even though the chances are slim if it was before the courts it removes the beyond a reasonable doubt requirement for a conviction sure accountability is a thing but in the situation i described i would have no way of knowing for drugs in the car you ultimately know who youre hanging out with and the possibility of that person having drugs in the car im not a lawyer this is just my cents for what its worth not everything is black and white
canada,not_removed,not if you didnt know the drugs were there need consent and knowledge to be convicted of possession
canada,not_removed,which one would be hard pressed to argue in that circumstance
canada,not_removed,just out for a nip bud
canada,not_removed,i wonder if some of his campmates have been feeding this coyote that would explain its antics and boldness
canada,not_removed,ill hammer ya ass
canada,not_removed,if humans are not food then why are they made of meat
canada,not_removed,i got no food on me you are the food
canada,not_removed,you cant hurt me you motherfer youre beautiful though same thing i say to my angry girlfriend all the time
canada,not_removed,beautiful animal terrifying but beautiful
canada,not_removed,canadian version of dances with wolves edit dont do this you endanger local petschildren
canada,not_removed,because of how long this goes on for i almost think hes playing then i remember its a dangerous wild animal
canada,not_removed,when startled the canadian can become hostile you can observe observe​ this by hearing the standard eh add a h and become ouder creating a hey
canada,not_removed,this is terrible this guy is essentially teaching the coyote that humans are not threatening and little ones would be easy prey he should have made himself big and screamed at the coyote if the coyote got close he shouldve kicked it as hard as he could or swung at it with a hockey stick teach it to stay away from humans
canada,not_removed,that accent tho
canada,not_removed,is this guy just sitting in the snow i dont get it
canada,not_removed,this guys an idiot that coyote needs a little training as grains of it delivered at fps that never requires a refresher course
canada,not_removed,its the squeeking of his boots that the coyote is interested in it thinks its a rabbit sounds the same
canada,not_removed,just so were all clear if a coyote or pretty much any other predator behaves like this it needs to be exterminated as quickly as possible
canada,not_removed,pretty dark coyote not worth much on the fur market when theyre dark like that
canada,not_removed,i know that its a dangerous wild animal but if there was a docile coyote like this in a room with me i would pet the shit out of it
canada,not_removed,isnt this a coywolf
canada,not_removed,😂😂😂
canada,not_removed,its like a real life version of wile e coyote and the road runner
canada,not_removed,that thing needs a round in the head its too dangerous to have an animal that bold around it will kill a child
canada,not_removed,well if it was in the usa he could just pull out his machine gun and kill the fucker but it is north of so just play with the little fucker eh
canada,not_removed,oh are ya boy
canada,not_removed,it looks like its been eating well its rounder than most ive seen even with a winter coat
canada,not_removed,precisely what i was thinking thats the behavior of an animal which got food handed to it
canada,not_removed,coyotes can be really bold ive seen it first hand a few times the most incredible encounter ive had with one was a few years ago i used to date this girl we were up at her cottage a few years back in muskoka we set up a telescope down by the water late on a moonless night we heard something moving through the bush not to far away we figured it was just a raccoon pointed our flashlight in the direction of the noise and there stood a coyote no more than steps away he glanced at us briefly then looked back towards the deck which was built upon a pile of rocks all kinds of critters lived under there i was totally surprised at how little he cared i shouted hey at him thinking that would scare him off he just glanced again at us then went back to looking towards the deck we just stood there staring in amazement about seconds later he turned and sauntered back into the bush he could have cared less we were there and he was so close he could have closed the gap between us before we could even react
canada,not_removed,rabies could explain the boldness as well
canada,not_removed,i felt that this was the most canadian comment from the entire video
canada,not_removed,thats a coyote not a wolf
canada,not_removed,the video is showing typical coyote behaviour a coyote hunting technique is to act like it wants to play
canada,not_removed,dangerous and clever it knows that to attack something bigger than itself headon while alone it risks injury to itself so its either trying to spook the guy into running so it can attack from behind or its trying to lure him away while its pack mates circle around to close off his retreat and they have him surrounded
canada,not_removed,yeah that coyote is spending a lot of energy to kind of bite that guys boot at the end
canada,not_removed,look at these british folks interacting with a pack of wolves
canada,not_removed,i agree there are far too many people that encourage animals to interact with humans without consequence here in winnipeg we have too many canada geese in the city they are naturally wary of moving cars but many people will treat them like they are royalty when they try to cross the road i never yield to them if i can do so without harming them i also do my best to scare them and honk at them if they run out into the street people think they are being animal lovers by being nice to animals that kind of treatment is only harmful to them if you loved animals you would teach them to fear people and cars
canada,not_removed,someone else said this was up at a work camp there is nothing local in that case
canada,not_removed,look at these british folks interacting with a pack of wolves
canada,not_removed,how do you suppose there will be little ones on a worksite like that
canada,not_removed,the coyote keeps going for his feet he needs to get low so he can boop the snoot as needed
canada,not_removed,ya that thing is gonna need to be shot way too bold around people and this guy playing with it isnt gonna help
canada,not_removed,that was exactly what i was thinking and then i see your comment down voted so much already and that bothers me i live in a rural area and ppl dont realize that this wild animal would eat them it doesnt care about you or your family if it saw my kids playing outside it would fucking kill then eat them so yeah id blow its fucking head off its a pest plane and simple
canada,not_removed,ok there mr hick
canada,not_removed,not worth much on the fur market when theyre dark like that you have to admit he is a typical model moody quicktempered and not very friendly at all
canada,not_removed,how about some wolves
canada,not_removed,many of the comments here indeed agree with that
canada,not_removed,lol good point being a human he was thinking of food from the human point of view not thew coyote point of view but even beyond that the coyote wouldnt even understand any word in any language
canada,not_removed,doesnt look rabid to me its too spry and coordinated not shaking its head or panting or anything like that there isnt a ton of rabies up here especially in winter not as many active reservoir species
canada,not_removed,ive experienced a rabid canine trying to attack me and this is not one
canada,not_removed,i felt a swell of nationalism when he said that this could be a textbook example of a good canadian boy
canada,not_removed,no the way he said out is definitely the most canadian part of this video
canada,not_removed,people still get killed by coyotes never underestimate a starving animal
canada,not_removed,wolves rarely ever attack people either something like two in all of north america have been fatal
canada,not_removed,not much of a difference edit they can healthily interbreed which means they are the same species they have the same social structures and the only static difference is location and even that gets blurred at times the only difference is that wolves are usually larger but the same could be said of the difference between pit bulls and mastiffs yet we still realize that they are roughly equivalent but this is all theoretical let us look at the numbers in north america there have been reported fatal attacks by wolves were done by lone rabid wolves was a single lone healthy wolf wolves have also been reported in nonfatal attacks of which were done by a healthy lone wolf of which were rabid lone wolves for a total of lone wolf attacks against grown men if you dont consider to be grown coyotes have been responsible for two fatal attacks only one of which was alone and neither of which were found to have been related to rabies there have been nonfatal attacks of which were lone coyote of which were a lone coyote attacking a man or a group including a grown man only of which were shown to have been rabid wolf attacks have beeninvolved in attacks with lone healthy wolves meaning a lha lone healthy attack rate of and there have been coyote attacks with being lone healthy coyotes for a lha rate of the lha rate for attacks against grown men or groups including grown men is for wolves and for coyotes while coyotes are slightly less likely to attack grown adult men it isnt as if wolves are much different
canada,not_removed,coyotes are prairie wolves same family
canada,not_removed,i kept thinking to myself maybe this coyote is the distraction clever girl
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,my college campus wasis full of asshole geese who peck at students and crap everywhere id be in class and id look out the window and there are a bunch geese staring at me like i see youre in culinary too bad you cant cook me sucka
canada,not_removed,here in winnipeg we have too many canada geese in the city a lot of them are super aggressive too
canada,not_removed,take a look at these british folks interacting with a pack of wolves
canada,not_removed,you should never wash your hands either it kills your immune system
canada,not_removed,might be a native village nearby how you like that sjw
canada,not_removed,that doesnt matter all it takes is one family out camping to make this coyotes lesson in humans fatal that coyote was acting aggressively and in a predatory manner it needs to be taught not to
canada,not_removed,actually he needs to stand up tall raise his hands to make himself look bigger roar as loud as he can and charge at the thing chasing it away
canada,not_removed,im thinkinghoping the downvotes are for declaring the guy an idiot certainly if this coyote was in an area with children i think it would be prudent to transform it into something less dangerous like a parka
canada,not_removed,that this wild animal would eat them there are two recorded fatal coyote attacks two if youre the type who could be eaten by a coyote were probably all a whole lot safer if you dont handle a firearm coyotes are dangerous to livestock and stupid children this one is no danger at all to the dozen or so grown adults on the worksite
canada,not_removed,huh so a wild canine starts gnawing at your feet what do you do
canada,not_removed,yeah if mr hick means i have a functioning intellect which this idiot does not he is literally giving the coyote a okay to attack humans lesson in the bush you are either something to be feared or potential lunch take your pick down here in the east the coyotes are interbred with red wolves and have adopted the worst characteristics of both animals they hunt in packs are considerably larger have little fear of humans and are a threat to livestock pets and killed a young woman in cape breton a couple of years ago im old and dont shoot things for the hell of it anymore but i always carry my mini in the bush that little incident in cape breton put coyotes back on my shoot on sight list they are a predator they fear you or they eat youor more likely one of your kids reality city boy
canada,not_removed,yeehaw we done got that cay yote gud cleetus
canada,not_removed,do you think it could be early stage rabies i dont know the timeline re foaming mouth and comfort around humans theres not rabies in my province so i dont know much about it
canada,not_removed,thats my vote too git oot
canada,not_removed,two comfirmed fatal attacks by a coyote in history one toddler one adult two fatal coyote attacks have been confirmed by experts on august a coyote grabbed a threeyearold girl named kelly keen in the driveway of her mother and fathers home in glendale california and dragged her across the street her father rescued her by chasing the animal away and rushed her to glendale adventist medical center but she died in surgery due to blood loss and a broken neck because of the incident on october two eastern coyotes mauled a nineteenyearold singersongwriter named taylor mitchell she was on a break from her concert tour when they stalked and chased her down in nova scotias cape breton highlands national park on the skyline trail an air ambulance airlifted taylor to queen elizabeth ii health sciences centre but she died after midnight from severe injuries and blood loss that were sustained during the incident httpsenwikipediaorgwikicoyoteattacksonhumans
canada,not_removed,children and pets not an adult man
canada,not_removed,theres a ton of controversy surrounding many possible wolf attacks where it was difficult to determine cod due to condition of remains theres a certain hesitation on the part of many biologists to attribute a fatal human attack to wolves due to the existing prejudice against the animals one case in particular that stands out in my mind httpsenwikipediaorgwikideathofkentonjoelcarnegie
canada,not_removed,port arthur ontario on an elderly trapper left his camp to mush down to the village to pick up his mail later in the day two miles from the settlement two first nations men discovered his bones and blood in the snow amidst torn pieces of harness the two men took their own dog teams and extra ammunition out in pursuit of the same wolves but did not return the following day two miles from the village beyond the scene of the first fatal attack a search party discovered the rifles and bones of the two first nations men amidst bits of clothing and empty shells scattered in a circle about the scene were the carcasses of wolves httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofwolfattacksinnorthamerica there have been two fatal attacks in the past years of course any accounting does not include people in the bush that just disappeared im not arguing with your point wolf attacks are very very rare wolves are usually extremely wary of humans but any large wild animal carnivore is dangerous and the coyotes down east are larger than their western cousins and bolder than wolves
canada,not_removed,a friend of a friend of mine this is not an urban legend was the first person to be killed by wolves in canada in years
canada,not_removed,not entirely true httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofwolfattacksinnorthamerica scroll down to the nonfatal attacks section and read the details section
canada,not_removed,fox coyote and wolf side by side no coyote will try to attack a full grown healthy man by itself
canada,not_removed,those statistics are bugging me i live in ns and know from chatting with hunters that at twilight leaving the woods from a hunt it is very common to see a few coyotes or the whole pack near by or at least hear them the nonfatal attacks is very misleading because its not comparing it to total nonhostile encounters people arent likely to report an encounter where nothing happens so its hard to know the ratio of nonfatal coyote encounters total coyote encounters its very safe to say that humans encounter coyotes way more frequently than wolves i can make up some numbers here to articulate what i mean if there are coyote encounters and only wolf encounters then equals chance of bad experience with coyote and greater chance of bad experience with a wolf im very confident in saying the difference in encounters between the two is even higher as others have mentioned in this thread coyotes are in lots of suburban areas wolves are not
canada,not_removed,you can take on a coyote on your own you cant take on a wolf big difference
canada,not_removed,they can healthily interbreed which means they are the same species from what ive learned in biology that is not what distinguishes species if two animals can produce fertile offspring then they are likely the same species coyotes and wolves can not do this edit grammar
canada,not_removed,no theyre coyotes saying prairie wolves doesnt make it true they are the same family but a coyote is a coyote
canada,not_removed,wolves are prairie wolves we have wolves
canada,not_removed,waterloo
canada,not_removed,im a sjw because im reporting this is in the far north that makes sense
canada,not_removed,um no one would camp there its the far north
canada,not_removed,at the end of the video he does precisely that it ran a bit further away but was still hanging around definitely think it has associated humans with food and is trying to figure out what levers to push on the guy in order for him to produce the food
canada,not_removed,idk if thats a joke but that might have worked
canada,not_removed,he was kind of an idiot for sitting down beside it though all i could think of is that it takes one slip and his neck is exposed to that thing
canada,not_removed,certainly if this coyote was in an area with children i think it would be prudent to transform it into something less dangerous like a parka there is no guarantee that coyote will never meet a child or a small adult people hike and camp all over and coyotes travel large distances
canada,not_removed,i said my kids and how far back does that go also ive had two dogs lured off and killed by them do you live in a city how many wild animals do you deal with have you been hunting in the bush before have you even seen a coyote in person before what im trying to say is my children are not stupid i myself am not a gun nut but that wild animal would try to kill you if given the chance they are not stupid animals they have ways to lure dogs and like i read in another comment its by trying to play with them they are a pest
canada,not_removed,not sure how far east you are we got them hybrid fucks in on too theyre a bunch of pussies unless you have your dog with you then its lunch
canada,not_removed,southern ontario coyotes are shoot on sight last i checked it was bucks a pelt my old boss used his didnt take any chances
canada,not_removed,the coyotes are interbred with red wolves are interbred makes it sound like some zoologists were interbreeding them is that the case or just that they animals interbred with each other real question
canada,not_removed,this vid is from some remote work camp though i think youre overreacting
canada,not_removed,yeah the fact that your named incident is singular really brings home that you dont have stats to back up your paranoia people arent being taken down left and right by coyotes and human beings should have to live with basic risk from wild animals its part of being alive pets should be kept indoors and wild animals shouldnt be killed for protection of them perhaps youre the one who needs to stay in the city given how scared you are of nature without a gun to blow it away and i was born and raised in rural ontario around agriculture where there are plenty of coyotes to be seen and heard so shove any attempt at city boy ad hominems that you sent nordicos way
canada,not_removed,well tad imagine that oh the horror i cant wait to get home and tell muffy if she has returned from her buddhist retreat and is not meditating perhaps we could go out into the wildness and offer ourselves up to be consumed to become one with nature
canada,not_removed,it doesnt look like rabies at all to me rabid animals have a look to them i believe related to the diseases effect on facial muscle tone theres a certain laxity and usually other lack of coordination this little guy is hippityhopping around too much hes playing i think
canada,not_removed,well seeing as how bear attacks are much more common it wouldnt be that prudent to pin it on wolves unless you had good evidence otherwise while these instances can be difficult to determine for sure barring evidence to the contrary wolves shouldnt be top of the list
canada,not_removed,i wasnt suggesting wolves cant kill or arent dangerous just that wolf attacks arent more common than coyote ones really
canada,not_removed,even if it did it hunts small mammals and isnt suited to attack people
canada,not_removed,except they have people have seen it happen i have seen it happen we just watched a video of it happening do you think that coyote biting at his boot can be seen as anything short of a minor attack and the same can be said of wolves very rarely will wolves attack while alone unless threatened more often than not there is another wolf nearby they can healthily interbreed which means they are the same species they have the same social structures and the only static difference is location and even that gets blurred at times the only difference is that wolves are usually larger but the same could be said of the difference between pit bulls and mastiffs but this is all theoretical let us look at the numbers in north america there have been reported fatal attacks by wolves were done by lone rabid wolves was a single lone healthy wolf wolves have also been reported in nonfatal attacks of which were done by a healthy lone wolf of which were rabid lone wolves for a total of lone wolf attacks against grown men if you dont consider to be grown coyotes have been responsible for two fatal attacks only one of which was alone and neither of which were found to have been related to rabies there have been nonfatal attacks of which were lone coyote of which were a lone coyote attacking a man or a group including a grown man only of which were shown to have been rabid wolf attacks have beeninvolved in attacks with lone healthy wolves meaning a lha lone healthy attack rate of and there have been coyote attacks with being lone healthy coyotes for a lha rate of the lha rate for attacks against grown men or groups including grown men is for wolves and for coyotes while coyotes are slightly less likely to attack grown adult men it isnt as if wolves are much different
canada,not_removed,tbh most wolves wouldnt even attack a person by itself unless it is starving
canada,not_removed,but that is irrelevant he said that they are different that coyotes are not going to attack a grown man while implying wolves are willing to do so what matters more is the ratio of lone attacks to group attacks rather than hostile encounters to hostile encounters if he wanted to say that coyotes are less likely to attack people then i would agree with him if he wanted to say that coyotes are less lethal when they attack i would agree with him but he said specifically that lone coyotes wont attack a lone grown man and the numbers dont back that up the numbers dont even back up the idea that coyotes are significantly less likely to attack a grown man
canada,not_removed,read my other comment
canada,not_removed,except they can this is like saying grizzlies and polar bears cant interbreed yes they can those are called pizzlies or
canada,not_removed,it is a truly sad day when this needs to be used as an intelligible explanation
canada,not_removed,wrong they are widely known as brush wolves or prairie wolves in the west the eastern coyote is a half bred so to call it a wolf is not incorrect at all httpsenwikipediaorgwikieasterncoyote
canada,not_removed,north bay
canada,not_removed,you cannot make any guarantee that a child could not encounter that coyote the fact is that animal is acting in a predatory manner towards a human and the human encouraged it location makes no difference
canada,not_removed,i think the youtube comments had it right his boots are squeaking like small prey might so the coyote wants them
canada,not_removed,are your coyotes running up to people and nipping at them im sure your conservation officers would cull any coyote acting like the one in the vid asap
canada,not_removed,i dont live in the city i live in rural ontario yes ive seen a coyote and yes friends have also had a dog lured away and killed by one that said this is a work camp of grown adults and the coyote isnt part of a pack a swift kick in the snout is all youd need to send it running away theyre pretty skittish animals outside of a pack they want the easy meals not the meals they have to workfight for sure kids handle it however you want i guess but that doesnt change the facts that a no kids were there b fatal coyote attacks are exceptionally rare and c a foot is a better weapon than a gun in this situation putting an animal down should be your last recourse not your first dude makes you worse than any animal if your first instinct is to just kill it
canada,not_removed,you idiot great way to foster discussion how many kids or dogs do you think live on this worksite ive lived in a city maybe half my life grew up on an acreage i have spent plenty of time in the bush and ive seen and encountered probably more coyotes than you from time spent in boy scouts or playing around in the bush
canada,not_removed,a pelt if you dont annihilate it properly prep the pelt and sell it you can get waaaaay more than that
canada,not_removed,they have interbred in nature google coywolf
canada,not_removed,with each other biologists have long suspected it but a guy in northern nb shot a coyote that weighed almost lbs and they did dna testswolf since then they have done more and it seems all our eastern coyotes are part wolfto one degree or another
canada,not_removed,yeahit is not like they are a huge threatbut there is really no need to encourage them
canada,not_removed,they are a big threat here in ns they have no fear they grab cats and dogs out of yards inside towns they decimate livestock and all the other things uchucksmall noted he is not exaggerating rural people and those on the edge of rural areas have had to change their habits to compensate because coyote are a problem its not in the news much because people took the first number of incidents seriously
canada,not_removed,im not sure why youre getting downvoted its ridiculous to think hed even have a gun on him at the time and he didnt encourage the coyote he yelled at it and scared it off can someone tell me what else he was even going to do in that situation that wouldve made him less of an idiot
canada,not_removed,thats because in most place down east they get shot at and being the intelligent beings they are they realize that approaching humans is not wise the young lady not coincidentally imho was pulled down by a pack in a national parkwhere they are not shot at i understand that especially out west theyre not much of a threat my problem is not that coyotes are horribly dangerous it is that this moron is encouraging the thing actually teaching it humans are no threat mistake as for the coyote way too bold which is why it requires a bullet oh and if you are not willing to defend your dog or other livestock from a coyote then you do not deserve to own one tell you whatit is real simple for nordico treat me with respect and you get the same back otherwise you can shove it
canada,not_removed,pets should be kept indoors and wild animals shouldnt be killed for protection of them im an animal person wont kill the spiders in my house but if i saw a coyote try to take my dog id rip the thing in half
canada,not_removed,thats number two on the list i copy and pasted sorry it was in a weird format before but recheck my last post taken from wiki httpsenwikipediaorgwikicoyoteattacksonhumans
canada,not_removed,in this instance the body was surrounded by wolf and no other large animal tracks during a time of year when bears are hibernating
canada,not_removed,strangely enough it has evidently happened times in the last years compared to times for wolves in the last years
canada,not_removed,this is true once punted a coyote in a suburb
canada,not_removed,thought i was on rjoerogan for a minute there
canada,not_removed,interbreeding does not mean they are the same species tigers and lions can interbreed and its pretty clear they are not the same species coyotes and wolfs might be the same species if their hybrid offspring could reproduce with other coyotewolf hybrids
canada,not_removed,nonmobile link helperbot rhelperbot i am a bot please message with any feedback andor hate counter
canada,not_removed,i think i understand what you mean encounters with the two play out similarly in behavioral perspectives so when a hostile encounter occurs it could play out the same with a coyote or a wolf i know the east coast wolf coyote could put up a fight but the coyotes i met in whitehorse were pretty scrawny by comparison thanks for clearing that up
canada,not_removed,nonmobile link helperbot rhelperbot i am a bot please message with any feedback andor hate counter
canada,not_removed,all im saying is interbreeding is not enough evidence to state that two organisms are the same species
canada,not_removed,ok im not sure if you are understanding the words im saying there are no children within thousands of miles from these work camps now feel free to keep clutching your pearls but whatevs
canada,not_removed,first off ill say im sorry for using the word idiot before i dont think you are one in anyway and i use the word loosely in my daily speech and thats why i used it could this one be trying to lure the person out is my thinking and any wild animal this desperate or not afraid of ppl could potentially be dangerous dont you agree
canada,not_removed,my apologies your right ill change that
canada,not_removed,wow i see em thanks
canada,not_removed,got it thanks
canada,not_removed,what i could have sworn this happened while i was up there three years ago oh well still such a sad story
canada,not_removed,then that would be suspicious yes but since each case needs to be examined individually its a bit much to say that there are a lot of wolf attacks when there arent wolf attacks and fatalities are still extremely low
canada,not_removed,sure theyll attack humans but as far as potential to kill goes the wolves win hands down coyotes may think you are food but you most likely wont be
canada,not_removed,more household cat attacks than that im sure but it doesnt make them more dangerous though
canada,not_removed,the difference is that im not a paranoid steroidal juggernaut and he is joe rogan
canada,not_removed,hybrid species can akaik this is what we have in new brunswick for coyotes httpsenwikipediaorgwikieasterncoyote its a hybrid
canada,not_removed,and they can there are black coyotes that owe their colourization to breeding with wolves and the nonalbino white coyotes in newfoundland are all descended from a population that bred with some golden retrievers
canada,not_removed,lol i think that was the other person you were calling an idiot p yes it could be dangerous however it didnt exactly look hungry its pretty beefy for a coyote id consider desperate and didnt seem mangy at all so i suspect its kept reasonably well fed and i suspect with the work camp being so close its gotten used to there being food and people around which would definitely make it more ballsy since itd learn theres little risk involved with the reward of easy food hanging around the camp you see the same thing with raccoons in the city vs raccoons in the country city raccoons are assholes because theyre so used to people being around that said the guy in the video didnt seem all that bothered by it and i would assume hes got a better read on the situation than us that and in the end if it started to get really aggro instead of its playful luring sort of behaviour a boot to the face would likely flip the switch that makes the risk too much for the reward coyotes usually go after smaller prey so theyre not going to put up much fight against larger prey unless theyre sick or desperately hungry
canada,not_removed,the coyote in cape breton is crossed with the wolf its a larger breed no longer afraid of humans the coywolf when that woman was killed the following summers in cb have been exceptional with the anecdotal sightings i would believe it to be typical bullshit but ive personally run into them several times since the attack when walking alone along shore line or tree lines they have no fear and continuously need to be culled they started coming into towns to take pets in broad daylight there was a pbs documentary about them on netflix it was redubbed here as an episode of the nature of things httpwwwcbccanatureofthingsepisodesmeetthecoywolf

canada,not_removed,i was there saturday on the floor to be honest ive never been a big hip fan just because they werent on my radar as much as other bands i have heard a lot of their stuff though a friend had tickets so we went i was utterly blown away by the showmanship and talent they blew the roof off the place and you could tell gord didnt wanna end it they did like encore songs and with each comeback you just knew he didnt wanna let go it was definitely something to behold and im glad i went
canada,not_removed,it was a phenomenal show the songs scared and courage were particularly poignant ill always remember the final words of scared at that concert i got to go its been a pleasure doing business with you
canada,not_removed,armed with will and determination and grace too
canada,not_removed,i love the hip so dont hate me when i say i thought the thumbnail was of don cherry
canada,not_removed,for me the most emotional moment was when he stood alone on stage thanking everyone for all the nights
canada,not_removed,you know all your echoes and memories and dont need mine this article is great music journalism
canada,not_removed,saw this while sitting by a fire listening to yer favourites cant wait for the ottawa show
canada,not_removed,it is not the first time fish griwkowsky has written something real memorable and touching he is often very funny too
canada,not_removed,huge hip fan managed to see this row centre on the floor had me crying a few times will see them again in winnipeg row centre in a couple days and who knows may get a single in toronto somewhere to round out the tour
canada,not_removed,honestly i think the concert is overrated the audio was bad and the production values are low the redeeming factor for me was the emotion of the crowd if he wasnt dying it would be a mediocre concert
canada,not_removed,looked like he burst out in real tears there for a moment after he hit that line that whole showjust wow so much emotion im seeing them again in winnipeg on friday
canada,not_removed,speaking of snazzy outfits though he had these shiny coat and pants sets and every few songs hed change into a new one and a new feathered hat he also worked it the whole show

canada,not_removed,i was there for the last half of it didnt see the child or her hurting her heard screaming and swearing around the produce section which is beside the cash registers only witnessed the woman attack another woman in a queue line hair pulling punching and the suspect grabbed a water bottle and hit the other one on the head that fight got split up and as she was trying to leave the store knocked a flower pot out of another womans hand and that womans husband grabbed the suspect and put her on the ground telling her to never touch his wife again cops showed up a minute later and took to get her to relax and get her in the police cruiser males female cops she was kicking and screaming telling them to get the fuck off her she kicked the sliding doors at the exit off their rails just prior to the take down whole thing lasted minutes luckily police station is across the street from the mall they showed up fast just another sunday night at walmart
canada,not_removed,not too many details there assume terror attack
canada,not_removed,is it wrong that i care less knowing it was likely a baby tooth
canada,not_removed,im curious to see if they find a motive that person probably needs help
canada,not_removed,year olds have a good set of adult front teeth pretty good chance it was a permanent tooth
canada,not_removed,can confirm i have a year old and she has two baby teeth for her upper fronts and two adult teeth on her lower fronts chance we should be outraged

canada,not_removed,good this is the right answer i dont agree with a lot of conservative policies but at least we can see morality human decency and concern for our fellow humans here south of the border the right wing seems to be far far less interested i want a political adversary that i can argue policy with over drinks someone that i can disagree with but still respect as a person michael chong if this series of tweets is indicative of your character then i would gladly disagree with your policies over drinks some time
canada,not_removed,kellie leitch did the tactical thing and offered her condolences last night before the whodunit speculation got under way not a peep since not even from the normally outspoken kouvalis i think she believes keeping silent might help delink this from her campaign shes sorely mistaken the political pileup especially from within her own party is just beginning which to my mind is great she wanted to have a frank discussion about canadian values shes getting her wish
canada,not_removed,so how does the voting work for the conservatives parry can i simply become a member and vote

canada,not_removed,conservatives are going to nominate kevin oleary over this man think about that i would probably vote michael chong and i hate the conservative party
canada,not_removed,i likely wont be voting for the cpc but if he wins the leadership and becomes prime minister id be damn proud to say this man is my prime minister
canada,not_removed,as a conservative i think it would be wonderful if this man wins not because of this tweet but he will bring some change to the old ways of the harperrites and will help modernize the conservative party please lets make it happen
canada,not_removed,i hope he wins the leadership race
canada,not_removed,chong is the most reasonable of the cpc candidates however he is a dark horse compared to some of the more established individuals in the race nonetheless i hope his influence as a candidate extends to changing the discourse in the cpc leadership campaign
canada,not_removed,itt people genuinely shocked that a cpc leadership candidate is acting like a decent human being harper really did leave a legacy
canada,not_removed,ill take chong over leech and oleery spelling as intended
canada,not_removed,please vote for him
canada,not_removed,go micheal so much better than oreilly or that horrible leitch i could live with bernier
canada,not_removed,link
canada,not_removed,awesome to see a cpc candidate speak out against this and making this about division which i believe is where these attacks come from
canada,not_removed,as someone who considers himself an independent but most often lean liberal i would vote for this guy my only fear would be that if he were pm the possibility that nutjobs like kelly leitch would also find positions of power
canada,not_removed,why are the media so infatuated with leitch and oleary you dont hear much if anything from the other candidates chong would appear to be a candidate out of the days of the progressive conservatives
canada,not_removed,bernier is the safe bet for the conservatives but chong is the conservative leader we deserve i would choose chong over any other candidate
canada,not_removed,wow what an upstanding guy too bad he wont win though
canada,not_removed,i hope he wins because he is a decent human being which is why he wont win harper poisoned the base of that party to the point where a substantial portion will back leitch then move their votes to whoever takes over the dogwhistling when she drops out and someone will take over the dogwhistling because the racist base will win them the leadership at the end of the day chong has no chance against the machine of hate and ignorance harper and his ilk fanned and encouraged not this year anyway maybe in years
canada,not_removed,as someone who lives in quebec city i disagree with him there is no problem with hate in this city and anyone saying otherwise needs to pay a visit here quebec city is not a divided city it is a city filled with love and saying otherwise is an insult to every good person living here
canada,not_removed,well i guess we can count him out
canada,not_removed,assholes who use tragedies we dont yet understand for their own political purposes arent getting my vote
canada,not_removed,lol itt a bunch of liberals rallying behind chong
canada,not_removed,i disagree it is the direct result of some insane asshole who has no respect for life taking others lives at will trump and the like are assholes too but they did not cause this edit and i find it shameful that chong seems to be seizing an opportunity herebut then its par for the course these days
canada,not_removed,thank god racist hate doesnt play to our conservatives watching trump makes me glad that we only have to disagree with others over politics here we dont have to fear the other side of the isle
canada,not_removed,he isnt bad but i still want bernier to win the race
canada,not_removed,sadly this will hurt him the muslim ban in the us has support from the silent majority according to polls this is probably even stronger in conservative circles i think taking a hard stance on this is against the feelings of his base not saying that his expression of grief is wrong just my guess on the fallout
canada,not_removed,oh sure mr chong better to sit quietly and meekly accept the body counts of attack after attack with stupid vigils held every weeks like the european model right this was the first and probably the last time anyone in the public has heard of a michael chong btw cute little speech tho taking the easy lighthearted side of a difficult problem has almost no consequences
canada,not_removed,no
canada,not_removed,agreed we have a westminster government our opposition party are supposed to be ministers in waiting prepared to govern at a moments call even if i was unhappy with justin trudeau and the liberals i wouldnt vote them out of government so long as the opposition was in disarray catering to trump wannabes and genuinely look incompetent to govern i would be confident that michael chong would change that however
canada,not_removed,the fact that hes rational and levelheaded means that he doesnt stand a goddamn chance in the cpc race i wish he did i really do but the cpc voting base has fallen into the gutter and become radicalized i hope that im wrong
canada,not_removed,seeing how absolutely terrible his french is you might as well forget about it he would be destroyed by many of the other conservative leaders and trudeau
canada,not_removed,go join and help make it happen
canada,not_removed,yeah to be honest im not paying attention to the cpc leadership race but im paying attention to this guy now geez after so many years of harper its nice to hear a conservative even mention the charter to be honest but this guy is telling it like it is and its something a lot of people on the right need to hear imo
canada,not_removed,exactly this this guy hasnt been on my radar whats so ever but this has made me go read up on him and im very impressed with his history perfectly encapsulated in the sentence mr chong you have my fucking attention
canada,not_removed,damn that takes a pair
canada,not_removed,i think votes should be based on concrete platforms not twitter pr with that said i agree with what he said
canada,not_removed,if he wins the leadership race the cpc will have my vote for the first time in my adult life as a liberal voter i feel like joining the cpc party just to vote for a reasonable cpc leader so we can avoid the next canadian trump i know its wrong to mess with another partys leadership in this way but as a canadian i care about our country and we must avoid a canadian version of trump alas i will not join the cpc to sabotage their leadership race but i do hope that cpc voters vote for a reasonable candidate and not a candidate that will divide canadians and fuel more hatred in our country
canada,not_removed,its only to join the party and vote for him
canada,not_removed,he doesnt have a chance the pc party is dead and the red tories are gone
canada,not_removed,ah micheal chong the guy who all the non conservatives want to win
canada,not_removed,at the very least it would give the cpc a real chance with more center voting canadians going extremely right or following the us trump hate train is going to destroy them
canada,not_removed,same
canada,not_removed,id definitely consider it for once
canada,not_removed,i still dont think id vote cpc but i would be okay with them winning with someone like this at the head he seems like an eastern conservative with fiscal well being blended with canadian values and less like a western reformist with government overreach blended with depression and sadness and gin
canada,not_removed,are you on the edge of voting for them already then what makes you not like the people you voted for last time
canada,not_removed,same
canada,not_removed,you should vote for the best mp candidate in your riding not my party i echo your sentiments on chong but it doesnt change the fact that your local cpc candidate could be brad trost
canada,not_removed,i personally dont find his commnents noteworthy at all the fact that this seems like a brave stance when its really motherhood and apple pie is telling of how low the bar is now he also was too timid to name names added to be fair he mentioned trump and leitch later also but he supported the harper governments attempt to ban the niqab during the swearing of the citizenship oath which if you remember was harpers fear mongering dog whistle before the last election so how does that square with his current stance
canada,not_removed,yeah because it would be voting for a liberal with a c next to his name if some right wing conservative ran as a liberal i would vote for him too
canada,not_removed,are you that vain because someone strung together a series of nice words after an emotional event what if he has a history of child rape and listening to jazz music would he still get your vote because he said nice things
canada,not_removed,i think she believes keeping silent might help delink this from her campaign shes sorely mistaken shes never going to win i think shes not even in the top in terms of recent polling done anyways
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,she wanted to have a frank discussion about canadian values shes getting her wish its as if they didnt learn a lesson at all from what happened to pauline marois or mr harper for that matter playing identity politics as a wedge issue is an incredibly risky strategy in canada likely to blow up in your face
canada,not_removed,she needs the support of the piles of human garbage who see false flags and secret muslim conspiracies everywhere gotta slink away into the darkness or risk saying something like the truth which would mortally offend her base
canada,not_removed,didnt kouvalis apoligize for that cuck thing
canada,not_removed,i dont think i know of a single person following the cpc leadership race who hasnt already turned their eyes to her on this issue shes been mimicking trumps tactics and his bigotry and now theyve materialized themselves in canada in the death of six people if shes not directly to blame then she at least is left with the onus of defending her trumpinspired views
canada,not_removed,yup go to their website and you can sign up there im no conservative but id much rather fight him than any other
canada,not_removed,you can purchase a membership in the party so long as you do so before march you can vote in the leadership race
canada,not_removed,httpsdonateconservativecamembership i dont know how the voting works though
canada,not_removed,then would they not be doing what the democrats did with hillary choose the candidate they want instead of the one the people want
canada,not_removed,im skeptical of that im not sure if the cpc would give it to oleary
canada,not_removed,what do you propose
canada,not_removed,i think chong is wrong something is mentally broken with the shooteri dont think we should be blaming the current political climate for this insanity its one thing to be a racist or a trump supporter or a nationalist or all of them combined its another thing entirely to murder innocents no matter what this guys political leanings are hes a fucked up man
canada,not_removed,you can join the cpc vote for him before the election when your vote matters more
canada,not_removed,i really like his carbon tax idea rather than it just being a slap on tax it would be redistributing taxes from income to carbon this would mean companies would have a significant encouragement to reduce their emissions which would mean more profit for them and push the way towards green energy
canada,not_removed,if youre not a member of another party consider getting a oneyear cpc membership and voting for him hes currently a candidate
canada,not_removed,its going to take a while to scrub that legacy
canada,not_removed,good im sure all of them will be furious
canada,not_removed,i subscribed to rmetacanada just to see what was going on with all the mentions to it in this sub i always like seeing both sides no matter how right or leftwrong or right the sides are and to me it just seems like another variation of rshitredditsays or an rcanada circlejerk unless im missing something
canada,not_removed,its his twitter
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,the thing is their are lots of normal conservatives but are not well known because they arent nut jobs the crazy ones always get all the attention and somehow end up being called high profile
canada,not_removed,he can if you register to be a part of the conservative party and vote for him im going to for the first time in my life
canada,not_removed,they are actually pretty democratic in terms of political parties no delegates but ranked mail order ballots any canadian voter can join and have their voice heard here
canada,not_removed,i dont think he was saying hate was a quebec city problem i think he meant that candidates are trying to provoke people and this attack likely wouldnt have happened if we werent in such a volatile political environment
canada,not_removed,i understand the unjust attention quebec city is receiving but it is not from this man he is giving politicians grief not at all the city i feel like the vigils attended today have done much more than the terrorist attack in representing the good people of quebec city
canada,not_removed,hes not blaming quebec city
canada,not_removed,google soldiers of odin in quebec city and then tell me whether theres a problem with hate
canada,not_removed,you know that its also possible this is just his opinion that hes sharing right do you not want to know the positions of your politicians not everything in life is a malicious power grab you must live in a dark world
canada,not_removed,weird to want rational opposition right like im a very liberal person who voted liberal this time not a huge fan of the liberal party but i am a socially liberal technocrat if i were to define myself as anything and what i want from the cpc is rational representation of conservative values i would vote for a good conservative one genuinely interested in reform why is it so weird we would rally behind someone rational
canada,not_removed,murder of people who disagree with me should be a protected right
canada,not_removed,what do you mean he thought the discussion about canadian values was silly
canada,not_removed,where did he say criticizing islam is out of bounds where hes saying maybe we shouldnt hate each individual muslim and subject them to restrictions of their freedom due to their religion are all of those millions of people potential terrorists should they all be discriminated against and hated if its freedom youre concerned about then you shouldnt support any sort of blanket ban on immigration or travel of people based on their nationality how is that just how does that respect liberty how is that free
canada,not_removed,thank god racist hate doesnt play to our conservatives stick around this sub for a while and youll see that is not always the case
canada,not_removed,history has proven that the only foundations strong enough to build an enduring nation upon are race religion culture and language you remember what happened to germany right they were defeated by stronger nations of diverse cultures and religions when you dont have any of that in common unity is utterly ridiculous to even contemplate wrong canada and the usa have been stable countries for decades were running into problems because people are deciding that race religion and culture are more important than humanity
canada,not_removed,unify as canadians
canada,not_removed,the muslim ban in the us has support from the silent majority according to polls well its a good thing hes not running for potus then
canada,not_removed,this isnt whats going to do him in as far as the cpc race is concerned he supports a carbon tax total nonstarter for the base
canada,not_removed,citation needed no government sources allowed
canada,not_removed,the terrorist was quebecois by birth exactly what could we have done to prevent that attack
canada,not_removed,i was lucky enough to meet mc wonderful person and i wish i only got longer to speak with him i really hope he does win the race
canada,not_removed,im getting a conservative membership literally just to vote for this guy sadly oleary of all people is now the frontrunner
canada,not_removed,part of me wishes the cpc would fracture back into the a more backwards and a more progressive party but i think its not necessary the backwaters are fading and the members are slowly drifting to the centre canadians are big fans of dont rock the boat cpc leadership can win more votes by being you know conservativecautious on new projects and programs sticking with tried and true and not just outright regressive twotier health fuck you bernier launching wedge issues restricting abortion fucking with statscan elections canada dfo and others to keep us uninformed fuck you harper etc
canada,not_removed,what like oleary who cant even speak french
canada,not_removed,he can learn french in his spare time until the next election comes its not that hard really if it means getting more votes from québec like mine it could be a good thing down the line
canada,not_removed,join the cpc
canada,not_removed,i did three months ago got a couple friends to as well our votes will have impact in a leadership race and im excited for that
canada,not_removed,thats right keeping pushing that narrative
canada,not_removed,no youre right ignore everyone im just gonna ignore you youre a lonely angry old man and you probably have few friends so maybe take a chill pill
canada,not_removed,ps he is one of the few if not only cpc candidate talking carbon tax and the only one talking a revenue neutral carbon tax httpswwwchongcaeconomicopportunity httpswwwchongcaenvironmentalopportunity httpswwwchongcademocraticopportunity
canada,not_removed,i actually read through his platform today i think he accurately states some of the main issues facing canadians and has well supported positions to address them not that i agree with them all mind you he was also the strongest and clearest voice in his party after this attack which counts for a lot with me
canada,not_removed,i think votes should be based on concrete platforms not twitter pr httpsimgurcomrinfectioussmileseucifyy lets hope this trend catches on
canada,not_removed,agreed
canada,not_removed,imo youre only a liberal if you work for the partyare electedare a candidate otherwise youre a canadian citizen who should be open to the best ideas out there no one should be placing artificial limits on themselves just because they identify with a group do everything you think is the right thing to do
canada,not_removed,dont think of it as sabotaging the cpc leadership race think of it as your right as a canadian to have the best available choices in the next election its in all our best interests to have competent sane leaders of our political parties crazy leaders make for better news cycles but they arent good for the nation
canada,not_removed,i recently did it i know theres something of a moral grey area here but long term i think its important that i as a canadian have an opposition to my beliefs thats grounded in shared principles i at least resigned my lpc membership first before getting my cpc membership at this point my ballot is looking like chong bernier and obrai in that order oleary will be right at the bottom and leitch wont even make it on my ballot
canada,not_removed,interesting idea ive never joined a party before i could join the cpc im mostly rational
canada,not_removed,ive considered it too but if chong gets elected the tories might just win in besides olearys polling at support so it looks hopeless for all other candidates all thatll come out of this is an inbox full of tory spam and an additional in their coffers
canada,not_removed,i doubt oleary will win the party leadership anyhow even if he does itll only ensure at least one more term of trudeau
canada,not_removed,leaders tend to have a lot of sway in the parties direction and it would force a shift in the party
canada,not_removed,giving them is a tough pill to swallow
canada,not_removed,if he fails i hope he runs for leadership of the ontario pc at least
canada,not_removed,cpc party needs to split with the trump crowd currently on the party sidelines i dont think id ever vote for them too bad this can only realistically happen if electoral reform is enacted
canada,not_removed,the leaders right now are an outsider oleary a quebec conservative bernier and a multicultural red tory chong the party is closest to its red tory roots since mulroney
canada,not_removed,red tories need to stand up now more than ever to make sure our country doesnt swing the same way the united states has
canada,not_removed,yeah and trump will never win the presidency never write anyone off the consequences can obviously be horrific as we will see for the next years
canada,not_removed,yeah that guy
canada,not_removed,even if they didnt win itd be better to have someone like that in the opposition as supposed to one of the worse candidates
canada,not_removed,im in the same boat as op i really didnt care for harpers meanspiritedness extreme partisanship attacks on democracy and towards the end things like barbaric cultural practices on that note it irked me that the name of every bill was such hyperbole i voted mostly to see him go i consider myself fiscally conservative and socially liberal i have a hard time finding a party to get behind if chong wins i will for sure vote for him if a social conservative wins never ever
canada,not_removed,never is a long time my friend and if trump is any indication frequently used incorrectly
canada,not_removed,look at how much human garbage came out to vote for trump degenerate failures are everywhere and in much greater numbers than you would expect
canada,not_removed,the beaverton is getting too real
canada,not_removed,now is not the time for being political now is the time for pretending to mourn brutal
canada,not_removed,oh wow thats how you drag a hatemongering politician
canada,not_removed,he did today at noon conveniently
canada,not_removed,im no conservative but id much rather fight him than any other if the conservatives win the next election id prefer to see chong who seems like a smart man that uses reason in power over leitch or oleary
canada,not_removed,i know its by mail and ranked not sure about dates
canada,not_removed,but do the people that actually vote conservativenot talking about everyone thats gonna join the conserative for like months to try and prevent a oleary win actually want him
canada,not_removed,its not like clinton won the popular vote by million or something
canada,not_removed,i dont know it will be complicated there are lots of things contributing to our current climate of fear such as economic uncertainty the conduct of the media the conduct of our political candidates elected officials and bureaucrats those things need to be addressed and improved on we as canadians all need to talk to our neighbours build strong and inclusive communities and focus on building bridges between us not walls were all so busy allof the time that weve really lost those personal connections with the people around us
canada,not_removed,yes super easy took me about five minutes
canada,not_removed,i agree with you we should also make it a requirement that all new homes built in urban areas must come with solar panels its an amazingly cheap idea adds value to the homes and will pay for itself in years time
canada,not_removed,hes genuinely like this and had this attitude long before the attacks
canada,not_removed,its an improvement
canada,not_removed,its effectively rthedonald but for canada the name is misleading
canada,not_removed,which is sad really since the nut jobs make it impossible to vote for the cpc
canada,not_removed,he is the son of immigrant parents much of his platform was speaking out against the increased immigration restrictions people like leitch want to install
canada,not_removed,guess how many countries im banned from for having an israeli stamp on my passport also percent of muslims in england a western country think me and my family are a justified target i dont hate each individual muslim i just think it is a terrible idea to grow our muslim population any bigger than it actually is especially since a large portion of canadian muslims support hamas who have listed my extended families execution as part of their goals
canada,not_removed,if that surprises you then youre shockingly ignorant towards the scope of islamic terrorism worldwide seems typical of canadians these days
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,what is a canadian what is the basis for a canadian identity its not race religion culture or language the only thing it could be is living in a geographical area how can i unify with someone with whom i have nothing in common except living on the upper half of the continent
canada,not_removed,point is that banning muslims has more support here than youd think
canada,not_removed,more community centres
canada,not_removed,mcwonderfulperson sounds like a curator of rwholesomemusic
canada,not_removed,only
canada,not_removed,oleary is the front runner among previous conservative voters not the party its an important distinction because many diehard members hate his guts
canada,not_removed,we already have two tier healthcare i dont think bernier is regressive hes libertarian im fully behind supporting him when he becomes cpc leader as well
canada,not_removed,oleary will also lose
canada,not_removed,after seeing his past comments about québec i doubt he would
canada,not_removed,it costs adminstrative fees for a year membership you get the chance to vote for the next leader of the cpc you dont even have to vote for them come federal election but you could have a say on whos on the ballot at all and also who heads the opposition if they get place
canada,not_removed,wasnt he the democratic reform guy too
canada,not_removed,what are michael chongs stances on privacy and security versus law enforcementnational security
canada,not_removed,so basically he is a liberal calling himself a conservative
canada,not_removed,a carbon tax is an antiquated concept when the us is moving to abolish any such restrictions from their domestic industry it will only expedite the death of any residual canadian industrial activity
canada,not_removed,itd make sense if he said that about anyone but chong since chong is the only candidate that has an extremely well defined platform and goes in depth into policy
canada,not_removed,the above comment implied it so i guess youre technically right
canada,not_removed,no one said that anyone said that shall we continue
canada,not_removed,exactly tribalism is incredibly seductive were hardwired for it after millions of years of evolution but runs counter to just about anybodys ultimate selfinterest
canada,not_removed,that barely covers the administrative costs of your membership youre not filling their coffers by joining up
canada,not_removed,but then you get the joy of voting against kellie lietch and keven oleary without the anxiety of having to wait for the federal elections to do so im honestly considering doing it
canada,not_removed,jesus i might even consider that vote and im virtually a communist
canada,not_removed,you are a fucking genius i want this to happen so badly now we need to make this happen
canada,not_removed,lets not put this evil on him
canada,not_removed,well fuck that could turn out very well i do hope he gets the conservative leadership though the rest of the candidates for the conservatives are not very appealing to me but i would like the opportunity to consider all of the parties as serious contenders
canada,not_removed,oh i see i havent followed the cpc race at all
canada,not_removed,i could feel the groundswell support for trump leitch does not have the same authentic characteristics of trump to pull it off bernier oleary and chong are the top right now in my opinion raitt has an outside chance
canada,not_removed,i hope that trump winning is a warning to the rest of the world trump preaches hate and intolerance regardless of which policies he makes or changes for the better hopfully the rest of the world sees him as the man that divided a country and is smart enough to avoid the same thing happening to themselves
canada,not_removed,while never is a long time trump would have lost the primary using the voting methods the conservative are using cant win this one with percent support
canada,not_removed,lets not tell each other were as ridiculous as the americans selffulfilling prophesies and all
canada,not_removed,you know as easy as it is to call people names because we disagree with their thoughts just keep in mind the people who voted for trump are the same ones that need to be convinced not to do the same come reelection are you sure you want to be calling them human garbage
canada,not_removed,these people kept quiet while the left spent an entire year screaming and a billion dollars painting a picture of hopelessness for a trump presidency when no one could judge them they knew exactly which box they were going to check while the left was driven into a frenzy the right rests easy knowing that trump is doing exactly what he campaigned on you call them degenerate failures but it could be anyone in your entourage that supports trump it might even be the ones you least expect
canada,not_removed,i know right i go to the beaverton for hilarious japes about pop culture not for accurate timely reporting on current events
canada,not_removed,the onion updates and posts the same article on gun violence with the same headline every time there is a mass shooting in the us no way to prevent this says only nation where this regularly happens
canada,not_removed,im no liberal and all of these nazi punks can fuck off support your local antifa chapter
canada,not_removed,my entire family generally votes conservative dont judge them most are older small town folk and none of them like oleary personally living in ontario and in the gta has jaded me in regards to the liberal party so as long as the conservatives dont put some loudmouthed idiot in the running and put in chong they will likely have my vote
canada,not_removed,but at the end of the day she wasnt able to win the election
canada,not_removed,lol yeah the way to solve the problems caused by immigration is by more immigration you crack me up
canada,not_removed,where do you do this
canada,not_removed,i also think people and corporations should be able to subsidize solar panels and green energy for low income households for the sake of argument a company has in carbon tax they can buy say up to worth of solar panels and installation for low income households and receive in tax credits or something along those lines
canada,not_removed,it used to be much more meta people just got butthurt about it then the liberals were elected and it took a hard right from meta
canada,not_removed,the aforementioned ban on israeli citizens is wrong and antisemitic its the principle of banning someone based on their nationality or religion thats inherently wrong that is bigoted whats the source for your claims that of english muslims think israelis are a justified target and is there a source for the other way around ie how many israelis believe nonviolent palestinians are a justified target or a source on how many canadian muslims support hamas either way our muslim population in canada isnt in the double digits wise they dont have that type of political or social capital look as a nonmuslim middleeasterner from an islamic fundamentalist country i understand criticism of islamic fundamentalism and islam as a whole but all chong is saying is that politics based on hatred and bigotry result in extremism like the mosque attack
canada,not_removed,that is a list of all terrorist incidents not just islamic ones the second source is an extremely biased one i hardly think you can cite it as a reliable neutral one
canada,not_removed,canadians are the people that live in canada and have a shared healthcare system shared political situation and generally a shared attitude of kindness that the majority of people living in this country have we can unite on our history as canadians our beautiful landscape a variety of things now it is definitely more hard for us to unify compared to different countries but we must make do instead of race how about we unify on something we can all take part in tolerance and peace we are seen as the peacekeepers of the world why not unify on that
canada,not_removed,i doubt it what are these polls because gallup puts trump at least popular president after the implementation of the ban
canada,not_removed,irrelevant a muslim ban could not happen in this country please see the carter of rights and freedoms if you find the idea of all people even people who practice religions that you dont like having equal status under the law you are free thanks to the same charter to move to another country that has values more in line with your own
canada,not_removed,noname™ trump is similar quality and cheaper
canada,not_removed,we dont have twotier healthcare some services are provided privately mostly ones that are too expensive to run publicly dental or that couldnt be pushed things like eye exams but we have singlepayer universal healthcare if anything the solution to the awful wait times which really only affects elective and noncritical surgery is to double the amount of funding we put in per capita to make it more in line with the bottom half of eu countries
canada,not_removed,his views on quebec are because he comes from a very french region of ontario and they dont want to feel like they have to go to quebec to be french
canada,not_removed,yeah thats right hes also the only conservative mp who voted in favour of restoring the longform census back when harper was in power on wednesday evening conservative mps passed up the chance to correct a serious error their government made almost five years ago when it eliminated the mandatory longform census all but one of them voted against bill a bill that would bring back the longform census and strengthen the independence of canadas chief statistician michael chong was the lone conservative to vote for the legislation introduced by liberal mp ted hsu
canada,not_removed,honestly his political reform bill i the main reason i cannot support him his proposal is basically to turn political parties into public entities based on the us party system think open primaries for party leader and for riding candidates instead of our current private party system as well as leaving fptp
canada,not_removed,the carbon tax is a conservative economic idea if its liberal to embrace climate science then its conservative to be wrong
canada,not_removed,sounds like an actual conservative with ideas instead of a conservative party of canada panderer
canada,not_removed,yes which is why rcanada likes him a lot he should have honestly run as a liberal i think he would have done better
canada,not_removed,the us is moving to go back to coal they are not an example that should be followed or anything even remotely close to one
canada,not_removed,so according the trumpkin we should do exactly what the us is doing ok then
canada,not_removed,the us is the one going backwards in history to coal
canada,not_removed,i dont want my joy to correlate positively with the number of shitty conservative candidates are out there so i dont think ill be joining in
canada,not_removed,really i would love to have a capable and true red tory pc party here that wont fuck everything from the greenbelt to our transit infrastructure over kathleen wynne can go away and the liberal party can do a massclear out of all their corruption and start fresh
canada,not_removed,i never put two and two together before that post the more i think about it the more i would love to see this happen
canada,not_removed,but large elements of the party who will play a role in choosing who will lead them refuses to see the importance of inclusivity of their message
canada,not_removed,oh i agree i dont think that leitch has a shot in this campaign but her political future isnt over and trump didnt his start in he started in
canada,not_removed,authentic characteristics of trump plus she is a lady how can she appeal to macho men vote for me and ill cook for you hmm better send that to kouvalis
canada,not_removed,based on my personal conversations its a toss up between bernier and chong that being said my personal conversations arent indicative of the rest of conservative voters
canada,not_removed,i actually feel no particular urge to convince them of anything it was only through gross apathy and a system that values some votes more than others that allowed trump to win im far more concerned that the opposition will follow suit down the path of populism are you sure you want to be calling them human garbage ive yet to interact with a trump supporter worthy of respect show me one
canada,not_removed,you call them degenerate failures but it could be anyone in your entourage that supports trump it might even be the ones you least expect everyone in my entourage that support trump are painfully obvious and all of them fit quite comfortably in the degenerate failure category
canada,not_removed,the beaverton posts their one pretty often when there is a shooting in the us
canada,not_removed,antifa are antifascist in name only
canada,not_removed,antifa are hard to distinguish from nazi punks
canada,not_removed,my entire family generally votes conservative theres nothing wrong with voting conservative you vote for who you feel like will do the most for you
canada,not_removed,just like bernie wasnt able to win the primaries
canada,not_removed,how did immigration cause them and can you identify the problems specifically so that there might be a rational discussion
canada,not_removed,httpsdonateconservativecamembership but must pay before march
canada,not_removed,my main argument is it would be a bad thing for it to get to that point source for the percent seeing jews as a justified target done by the guardian about muslims in canada
canada,not_removed,just google islamic terrorism this is all public information
canada,not_removed,save it man these td trolls arent canadians and dont want to be
canada,not_removed,god youre dense im not supporting it or talking about the legality im saying i think there is a large nonvocal portion of the population that are in support of reducing immigrants and that may as well be the brown ones well see in years just my hunch
canada,not_removed,we dont have twotier healthcare some services are provided privately mostly ones that are too expensive to run publicly dental or that couldnt be pushed things like eye exams dental and eye care are still health in my opinion there is a lot of socialists that want to push for this to be universally covered as well to which i disagree what i am saying from my comment that we already have two tier healthcare is that rich people can cross border to get better care we can even have insurance for it but we have singlepayer universal healthcare if anything the solution to the awful wait times which really only affects elective and noncritical surgery is to double the amount of funding we put in per capita to make it more in line with the bottom half of eu countries dont ever forget that the singlepayer ends up being the taxpayer im not opposed to having some extra services that are expedited with some sort of user pay i do still think that everyone who is a canadian should be covered and entitled to the best possible care however if i want knee surgery i shouldnt have to wait for months i should be able to have it next week and be able to have insurance to pay for it
canada,not_removed,that sounds great actually why do you not like that proposal
canada,not_removed,chong doesnt support changing our election process if thats what you mean by as well as leaving fptp not really clear
canada,not_removed,an actual conservative with ideas its been so long since weve had one of these we had all forgot they existed
canada,not_removed,which is exactly what oleary is edit a conservative party panderer
canada,not_removed,the us and china will rely heavily on coal and they are the leading economic powers by orders of magnitude a puny canada will be a bare husk if it dogmatically insists on being redundant
canada,not_removed,you make it seem like canada has a choice in the matter
canada,not_removed,if the us decides coal is the new alternative energy than the world moves to that standard canada is intent on becoming an economic backwater
canada,not_removed,correct
canada,not_removed,sorry it came across that way my support isnt based on this or any tweet but on my own research that ive done into the cpc leadership race
canada,not_removed,what on earth are you talking about
canada,not_removed,wynne is terrible but brown wont win hes the religious arm of the conservatives which wont hold enough base to win in ontariohowever chong is a fiscal conservativethe hero we need
canada,not_removed,the conservative party is fucked not all conservative are complete morons but a significant chunk of their base is unfortunately you know the people who say dey took err jerbs and love to spout baseless xenophobia yeah that makes up a lot of cpc voters and many more are voting for a reality tv star whos professed many fucking times that his only goal in life is fortune and fame and he is currently leading the polls by the way so yeah cpc is a complete mess
canada,not_removed,sure but someone else is more likely to take up the canadas trump mantle at the federal level kellie leitch is just weird and super unappealing
canada,not_removed,yeah but media polls make it seem like oleary is a sure win i agree though that bernier chong and possibly raitt are most likely to win leadership the problem with leitch is that cheeto benito was running on a platform successful business man here to clean up the government populist looking to put the minorities and foreigners back in their place she doesnt satisfy the successful businessman part like oleary does and honestly at least in ontario that seems like the more popular of the two stances
canada,not_removed,fair enough it really isnt your responsibility to convince them to change their minds or their views however the voting system isnt going to change in the next election and the same people give or take will be lining up to vote then keep in mind that the vitriol youre directing towards them isnt that dissimilar to what your opponents say towards their enemies minus of course the racist rhetoric be careful when you fight the monsters lest you become one
canada,not_removed,it appears that you are the one not worth respect if you can not be open to alternate view even if you do not agree then you are worth no more then the ones you purport to insult think they and there ideas are dumb by all means but realize they are people too who have their own convictions and beliefs
canada,not_removed,god i could fill that in without even trying
canada,not_removed,said the nationalist
canada,not_removed,never said there was but generally mentioning that here or in rtoronto results in downvotes and people following me around reddit
canada,not_removed,that is one way to do it i vote for who i think will make the earth a better planet for my children
canada,not_removed,which things specifically please explain how canada did not exist before these things
canada,not_removed,well prepare for more terrorist attacks from both sides in the coming decades i personally hope it wont happen but its pretty much statistically guaranteed isnt it theres also economic problems and advantages associated with immigration but immigration isnt what makes canada canada what a bizarre thing to say
canada,not_removed,and that makes them rtd tier forever and always it was a good place to poke fun at the harperhitler crowd
canada,not_removed,the second source you cite has absolutely nothing about canadian muslims supporting hamas in it but about canadian muslims viewing islam to be incompatible with western nations or other abrahamic religions this is something that can be helped with dialogue and integration not persecution and bigotry which will only widen that gap the first source does indeed contain a statistic that british muslims view israelis as a justified target in the middle east as well as other prevalent antisemitic beliefs but to an admittedly lesser extent you can find that same antisemitism in other brits as well again i ask what do you believe would be the result of asking israelis if they believe nonviolent palestinians are a justified target in the middle east you do realize that iran uses statistics that israelis are unsympathetic to violence against palestinians to justify their own antisemitic ban on israeli citizens as well should we sink to irans level this comes down to a fundamental question though to you is it wrong to restrict liberty based on religion or nationality additionally i just want to add that trumps ban on those countries applies to all their nonmuslim nationals as well the syrian christians he vowed to aid have been just as screwed even more so
canada,not_removed,i do still think that everyone who is a canadian should be covered and entitled to the best possible care however if i want knee surgery i shouldnt have to wait for months i should be able to have it next week and be able to have insurance to pay for it you cant have it both ways either everyone is entitled to the best possible care and youll have to wait your turn or you can buy your way to the head of the line in which case you are taking a slot that would have gone to someone who just happened to be poorer than you
canada,not_removed,do you see how you can put and together and see that the top medical institutions will ignore and push away public insurance if they could get away with it that the moment you start to chip away you will never get that back
canada,not_removed,well the us is a bit of a dumpster fire at the moment maybe we shouldnt copy their system
canada,not_removed,how would you remove membership status otherwise general vote by the members of the party
canada,not_removed,really because i just looked at his official website and couldnt find a single idea or issue he was espousing other than too much debt and im a business man i thought the dude was an ass on tv as a host and as a dragon quite honestly launching a leadership campaign before you are elected a member of parliament is stupid imo
canada,not_removed,lets talk in say fifteen years about how great going back to coal is working
canada,not_removed,thats total horseshit in every conceivable way china has pushed for massive green energy reform going forward and is poised to be a world leader in sustainable energy the industry creates just as many jobs as coal if not significantly more and is provably an economically viable option when compared to burning fossil fuels
canada,not_removed,except coal isnt alternative the us economy isnt invincible for all time and even china and india are moving towards renewables
canada,not_removed,brown has done a good job imo of keeping his religious background back im way more worried about him cancelling several lrt lines and eliminating the greenbelt act and places to grow act the thought of that terrifies me im a grit myself perhaps on the blue side but wynnes approval ratings are truly abysmal and for very good reason i dont know a single person of any political stripe even hardcore liberals who doesnt fucking loathe her the hydro thing is really putting people in rage and i am fairly sure she lost a good chunk of toronto voters over the tolls issue i can see wynne winning again just because the other option is just so terrible better the corrupt devil you know wynne has my vote for instance if patrick brown goes ahead and calls for the cancellation of the greenbelt act for instance but i fucking hate it
canada,not_removed,you could say the same about the liberals with radical leftists and intersectional identity politic zealots in the wings the nice thing about our party politics is it tends to drag the fringe to the center that broke in the us this past election but the collapse had been telegraphed since the reagan era theyre hitting bottom from which hopefully the political will can be found to rebuild
canada,not_removed,there might be two things to give us some hope concerning the cpc leadership race i dont know how frequently the illinformed xenophobic group vote in the leadership race maybe it takes a lot more effort and something like a general election to really mobilize them theres a groundswell of centrist voters in canada who are starting to be pushed to action and a lot of them are registering for their cpc membership specifically to vote for someone like michael chong as leader depending on the size of the movement in there might actually be a rational leader of the cpc
canada,not_removed,yeah the minorities thing isnt that big of a movement people arent thrilled about the refugees but otherwise i havent heard many complaints i wouldnt run my platform off it not this election anyway
canada,not_removed,and the same people give or take will be lining up to vote then this is what needs to change the of eligible voters need to get off their ass keep in mind that the vitriol youre directing towards them isnt that dissimilar to what your opponents say towards their enemies minus of course the racist rhetoric be careful when you fight the monsters lest you become one sure but the distinction is that they are wrong im not advocating that anyone be silenced i encourage them to speak their mind so that all the world can see what they truly are
canada,not_removed,realize they are people too who have their own convictions and beliefs no i will not subscribe to the wishywashy bullshit everybody wins politically correct notion that all peoples convictions and beliefs are worthy of respect fuck that nonsense some beliefs are better than others some ideas are grounded in fact some are not arguments can be had between people of good faith but cannot be had with trash who invent their own facts to fit a narrative
canada,not_removed,yes and despite what you want to think nationalism is not a bad word
canada,not_removed,its funny because i assume you are supporting antifa yet your comment seems to revel in their fascist behavior im a good guy i only punch nazis im punching nazis so that makes me good
canada,not_removed,you reasons for voting for someone are your own and i cannot say anything about that but i can present you with fact and information and hope to change your opinion to my side
canada,not_removed,canada is built on immigration unless you have first nations ancestry you owe the fact that you are canadian to immigration
canada,not_removed,sorry i must have posted the wrong source to you about hamas no i do not believe israelis would have the same views on innocent palestinians being murdered as british muslims and not even close to the support that palestinians have of any jews being killed which is about percent here is the source i meant to give you about hamas and you can also see many wont repudiate al qaeda and there is strong support for the brotherhood also i would point out that the sources i give from western institutions most likely have more merit and are not even challenged by leftists compared to whatever state run propaganda happens in iran
canada,not_removed,i dont care for convincing someone who is so desperate not to be convinced the guy already provided a link to the wiki page and you made excuses for the terrorism
canada,not_removed,i agree but that doesnt mean everything they do is wrong as for open primaries what is the difference between what we have and open primaries i thought that as long as you had party membership you could vote in the leadership race here
canada,not_removed,sorry meant he was a conservative party panderer
canada,not_removed,quite honestly launching a leadership campaign before you are elected a member of parliament is stupid unfortunately this is exactly what trump did
canada,not_removed,new methods of coal energy generation are extremely efficient coal is essentially chemically stored solar power anyway so think of it as a green alternative
canada,not_removed,looks like your opinion is more like some sort of fantasy httpsenwikipediaorgwikielectricitysectorinchina i like to deal in reality
canada,not_removed,coal is a great alternative to unreliable wind power horrendously inefficient solar less than efficiency or burning dung it is inferior to new generation nuclear fission using liquid phase salt cooling however which imo are the most promising sources of alternative energy
canada,not_removed,it was implied whether intentionally or not
canada,not_removed,everybody does not win in politics but that does not mean that you should not respect the perso their ideas and convictions may be wrong but that doesnt change that they have them if you simply disparage a person and disrespect them then that is how you get extremism if you do not respect your opponent then you are doomed to fall to them facts are being more and more clouded in shadows and misinformation the world no longer will be wholly truthful to you things unseen or not conforming to the left or rights narratives are being unreported and misrepresented you can no longer place the blame on those you say are the enemy you must look at it objectively and understand that their world view is different than your own and that is okay as i said before respect the enemy no matter how despicable and hated you believe them for if you do not respect your enemy you will fall have a nice day
canada,not_removed,white nationalism is against my interests
canada,not_removed,i agree i just like to point out there is room for moralistic political views rather than strictly pragmatic economic ones i would personally benefit financially from a pc government but prefer more leftwing ones as they pursue something i believe in economic equality
canada,not_removed,so what is your point i mean canada was also built on the beaver fur trade so would it be a valid economic argument to say we should invest millions in the beaver fur trade canada was built on the beaver fur trade how about we actually critically think about the effects of immigration instead of using nonsense emotional arguments like the country was built on immigration and another thing you could just as easily say the country was built on european immigration and use that to push a white nationalist agenda the argument doesnt change or the us was built on slavery lets reinstitute it
canada,not_removed,canada is built on immigration what about all the people who were born here did we all just sit around twiddling our thumbs while immigrants built everything unless you have first nations ancestry you owe the fact that you are canadian to immigration the first nations came across an ice bridge from asia many canadians are descended from settlers and colonists not immigrants just because certain kinds of immigrants were beneficial at a certain point in time doesnt mean any immigrant at any point in time provides a net benefit to our society
canada,not_removed,there have been several small ones resulting in deaths actually have you already forgotten about the shooting in ottawa by the way ive never gotten in a car accident but i still wear my seat belt every day
canada,not_removed,as for open primaries what is the difference between what we have and open primaries in the us a far higher proportion of people are registered as members of a political party in a sense parties there are institutionalised and many people only vote for a single party i have american relatives half of them are democrat and the other half are republicans ive asked and none of them have ever voted for the other side ever i like the distance we have from our political parties it means people see things less as us vs them and are way more openminded about switching parties
canada,not_removed,ha though your edit now makes me look dumb i wholeheartedly agree and lets face it i am dumb i just realised that parliament has an a in the middle
canada,not_removed,and the fact that mr oleary is copying him again is a good sign of mr oleary character
canada,not_removed,fuck ive either been arguing with a troll or you are actually incapable of critical thought
canada,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikirenewableenergyinchina chinas renewable energy sector is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear power capacity in china became the worlds largest producer of photovoltaic power at gw installed capacity china also led the world in the production and use of wind power and smart grid technologies generating almost as much water wind and solar energy as all of france and germanys power plants combined are you guys incapable of understanding that the future exists
canada,not_removed,for his first term reagan was a very good president overall but he did bring in the concept of jelly bean journalism playing to the media to manage the message and target specific groups to maintain political appeal arguably this has always been part of the office of the presidency media awareness certainly was a hallmark of kennedys run and nixon too
canada,not_removed,verybody does not win in politics but that does not mean that you should not respect the perso their ideas and convictions may be wrong but that doesnt change that they have them sure and i can respect a liberal an ndper a conservative a democrat a republican some things i cant respect like a trumper the rest of what you say is just wishywashy new age crap respect is earned not given away
canada,not_removed,okay good for you then
canada,not_removed,wow checkmate
canada,not_removed,maybe we should round up nazis put them in camps and gas them sounds good to you
canada,not_removed,white people can be immigrants too
canada,not_removed,ok then we have birthrate that is below replacementlevel and we need an influx of people to sustain the country and our economy further to this diversity is a strength particularly in todays globalized economy
canada,not_removed,the point is that everything that you enjoy about this country today is rooted in immigration you wouldnt be here and have the things that you have without your ancestors getting on a boat wagon train plane etc and building a future here maybe that was generations ago or maybe just one but the end result is the same how can you enjoy all of these things and feel justified in denying them to someone else who also wants to work contribute and build a new future here
canada,not_removed,so you dont want open primaries as far as i can see in open primaries you can select who you would want as the candidate from each party without signing up for membership in each isnt this what we would want wouldnt this reduce the partisanship that america is dying from
canada,not_removed,im sorry but you actually have any argument to respond with
canada,not_removed,growing right if you start from zero and build a single wind turbine you have growth of in renewable energy fact of the matter is of chinese energy is generated by a combination of coal and gravity
canada,not_removed,totes how it works
canada,not_removed,then you are doomed to fail to them if you seek to confront them they will surprise you and defeat you this is a tenant of warfare but it applies to many aspects of life
canada,not_removed,dont worry you alt right scum are also a minority which makes you guys easier to stamp out i hope we meet someday in the flesh
canada,not_removed,ok then we have birthrate that is below replacementlevel and we need an influx of people to sustain the country and our economy yes thats one of the advantages ive mentioned also potentially a disadvantage because you are basically saying to replace the canadian population with immigrants further to this diversity is a strength particularly in todays globalized economy another nonsensical emotional argument brazil and india are two of the most diverse countries in the world the diversity is nice for some cultural reasons but also causes many logistical problems i dont see how its a strength to them at all
canada,not_removed,the point is that everything that you enjoy about this country today is rooted in immigration you wouldnt be here and have the things that you have without your ancestors getting on a boat wagon train plane etc and building a future here you could say the same thing about every single person in the world going back to when the first prehistoric animal climbed out of the sea maybe that was generations ago or maybe just one but the end result is the same how can you enjoy all of these things and feel justified in denying them to someone else who also wants to work contribute and build a new future here the same way i feel justified in preventing some random person from moving into my house even though i moved in years ago were you born in your house were all your ancestors born in your going going back to prehistoric times if the answer is no then you must let any random person who wants to move into your house do so according to your philosophy
canada,not_removed,by a born and raised canadian citizen by an islamic radical the things your side proposes only serve to increase the danger of terrorist attacks more muslims in a country inevitably leads to more terrorist attacks its a statistical reality if you deny that then you are literally antiscience not by being terrible to muslim families for no good reason and making yourself look like the bad guys yeah except i didnt say that we should be terrible to muslim families
canada,not_removed,could you clarify that please
canada,not_removed,america is highly politically polarized so how would making our system more like americas make it less like americas
canada,not_removed,they dont have open primaries right and it sounds like chong is proposing that which would move us away from their system i may have this all wrong though
canada,not_removed,america does have open primaries
canada,not_removed,ah you are right they are it seems like open primaries may have a moderating effect though allowing participation of moderates for example i would love to vote in each of the parties primaries because i would love to be given a good selection of viable candidates to choose from it would make it harder for the fringes of a party to obtain nomination
canada,not_removed,oh good lord yes they have a fundamentally broken democracy and we must be wary of copying them but we cant assume everything they do is wrong
canada,not_removed,before the fare gates the sky train in bc had a honour system
canada,not_removed,sorry to be the skeptic but i have a really hard time believing the caption given is the truthful context of the picture
canada,not_removed,true story a food vendor forgot to lock up a potato chip display overnight at a major montreal municipal train station not one person stole a bag while i was waiting there it was a miracle
canada,not_removed,couldnt you still get a ticket for traveling without proof of payment
canada,not_removed,although there certainly are dishonest people in canada this is a great story to remind us that there are still good people in this world
canada,not_removed,this is better than that payfortheguybehindmebecausetheguyinfrontofmepaidformycoffeeatthedrivethru thing we do
canada,not_removed,makes me warm and fuzzy inside
canada,not_removed,i once saw a mob of about people rush their way through the handicap entrance without paying at kipling station they just couldnt be bothered to pay the fare once they realized that the gate was not locked or guarded
canada,not_removed,the way i see it is skipping my fare is just making the system i rely on poorer
canada,not_removed,free money
canada,not_removed,i rode the lrt in edmonton when i was beyond broke for three years i got caught got a ticket i saved money in the long run its or so a month for a pass
canada,not_removed,lol no way i would pay for the ttcs shite service if i didnt have to this doesnt look like toronto though i dont recognize those tickets
canada,not_removed,quick question for those of you living in ottawa from an american why are your tap cards only available to residents the paper tickets were a hard to get because we had to hoof it km to city hall to pick them up and b inconvenient to use on a bus with a queue of people waiting in a snowbank behind you id have been better off if the driver had an iphone and a square reader
canada,not_removed,taking public transportation leads me to believe this photo is staged to some extent if given the opportunity the vast majority would walk through and not pay those who had an issue of not paying would pay twice the next time however the majority would take the free pass without hesitation i highly doubt someone would leave money and except it to be untouched
canada,not_removed,bullshit this would never happen in edmonton
canada,not_removed,lmao this would never happen in montreal
canada,not_removed,same with calgary the transit police nab you tho if you dont pay at popular stations when you get off
canada,not_removed,this is surprising considering how much the ttc complains about commuters shortchanging or skipping fares maybe the ttc doesnt know how good it is for them try collecting fares in nyc for a week you whiney bastards
canada,not_removed,looks like we got one more big dirty boys
canada,not_removed,for the record that picture is european did noone notice the note is red edit nvm those are s passes
canada,not_removed,it is easy to be honest when you have six security cameras pointed at you
canada,not_removed,fuck that shit ive been cocked over by the ttc enough times that a free ride once in awhile is the least they can do for me
canada,not_removed,my dad has a small farm just outside ottawa and decided to plant and sell pumpkins on a wagon on his farm with a box where customers would just put money in he counted the pumpkins daily and he would calculated the percentage of how many customers were honest for years that he sold pumpkins the average was above that customers would pay for the remaining a large percentage of them would pay my dad on a later date like when he sells christmas trees everytime i lose faith in humanity i remind myself of this stat that only of us are dishonest assholes
canada,not_removed,wow is that
canada,not_removed,hahaha i remember that day scooped it all up into my hat and walked away
canada,not_removed,canada is like the opposite of california where if it isnt bolted down it isnt yours then
canada,not_removed,maybe im an asshole but i wouldnt have paid at least im not as much of an asshole as the guy passing through who likely pocketed all of that
canada,not_removed,does canadas largest subway system use a box that you drop tickets and money into as its main fare collection method no wonder canadians make sure to pay the fare
canada,not_removed,coming from mexico that was absolute madness to see i couldnt believe people would actually stop and pay back then i had more poverty than shame so id skip the gate almost got caught twice but after i started making decent money i figured that money went to infrastructure so i became oneofus i still see people jumping the compass gates though mostly people just following after i walk in some going as far as to grab their own wallet and mouthing a beep its kinda funny
canada,not_removed,edmontons lrt uses the honour system
canada,not_removed,go trains in toronto still do that
canada,not_removed,an honour system that a hell of lot didnt follow everytime i go back to van i still see tons of people jump on the busses for free
canada,not_removed,calgary ctrain still works on the honour system however if you get caught without a ticket youll get a fine
canada,not_removed,still does on the bline
canada,not_removed,now they have fare gates and checks on skytrains
canada,not_removed,i rode those trains for free for about years while in between jobs
canada,not_removed,calgarys lrt is still on an honour system with periodic ticket checks by peace officers for a ticket or if you get caught without one the latest statistics i can find suggest of riders pay their way edmontons lrt is also on the same system with the same fares and fines
canada,not_removed,honour system
canada,not_removed,thats how the go train works in and around toronto im pretty sure thats how trains work all around the world they just have people that might come around to check tickets every now and then
canada,not_removed,damn its not still honor system
canada,not_removed,wow didnt know they had gates now thats sad in germany its honour system everywhere except on buses late at night sometimes
canada,not_removed,i left vancouver when the olympics came hey lets disrupt downtown traffic for two years to build a clamshell over robson square for no fucking reason
canada,not_removed,yeah lrt in calgary is too havent seen a transit cop in months checking tickets
canada,not_removed,lrt in edmonton has an honor system or i have convinced myself it does
canada,not_removed,ive seen it in montreal circa but im not doing it shit if there is nobody at the gate and its open its because its free
canada,not_removed,oh but i have seen it happen
canada,not_removed,the honuor system is still a thing in many areas of canada maybe not for transit now but for other things ive seen farmers leave eggs out with a honoursystem collection bin some bakerys also leave bread out their philosophy is if someone needs to steal this then they probably really needed it then its charity
canada,not_removed,me too if it is then they are just giving money away to the first d bag that decides to take a handful
canada,not_removed,id guess it depends on the area people are culminating for example i saw this happen at yorkdale mall
canada,not_removed,seen this happen many times and in the toronto ttc and have left cointickets myself
canada,not_removed,im the original poster of this see my number top submission can confirm this is true the only thing is there was a workers selling tickets where you could go through but there was a huge line usually the box money is being placed on is open with another worker siting next to it
canada,not_removed,im pretty sure i remember this i believe it was at bathurst station i also remember there being a post in rtoronto at the time with more specifics
canada,not_removed,i certainly recognize the tickets and the gates as being ttc not certain about the context
canada,not_removed,ive seen it at bloor station on the ttc
canada,not_removed,sceptic
canada,not_removed,do you need pop for subways
canada,not_removed,you get pop from a machine inside the station after the fare gate you just press a button and it spits one out so anyone who entered here with or without paying would have proof of payment they only actually enforce pop on streetcars and will soon start with buses once they fully roll out the new fare card system theyll be able to to away with receipts and will use the new presto cards as their own proof of payment
canada,not_removed,i know in edmonton they dont check any tickets to board the trains and when you get on there is usually no one checking tickets but every now and then a transit officer will board a random car and check tickets if you get caught without a valid ticket you pay a fine equal to a one month travel pass
canada,not_removed,this is in toronto im op of this you do not require pop since intrance into system is through paid gates you can get a transfer from a machine after you pay and enter if you need
canada,not_removed,the dishonest people hibernate until november when they wake up to steal poppy boxes from tim hortons and end up on national news
canada,not_removed,you mean paying it forward
canada,not_removed,i did something similiar when i was in edmonton when i was a broke student curiously i never saw anyone being questioned in weekend rides guess officers take weekend off as well
canada,not_removed,they are the old design of the studentsenior tickets the student tickets are now double that length but they used to be squares like that source am student ticket design changes every or price adjustments
canada,not_removed,because presto as a system has been one giant cockup from the start its used here in toronto as well now and its been in the headlines often for being a total shitshow
canada,not_removed,quick question for those of you living in ottawa from an american why are your tap cards only available to residents i dont think they are the only thing i can find that is restricted to registered ontario residents is the which is for residents of ontario who board the bus in quebec before
canada,not_removed,its not that theyre only available for residents ottawa just hasnt installed the infrastructure to widely sell them yet toronto and the gtha uses the same tap card system presto and here you can purchase them at any go transit commuter railbus station up express airport train station and a good portion of subway stations soon they will be available at every subway station via ticket machines that will also dispense single ride tickets for those who dont want to pay the for the presto card ottawa will also have machines that sell presto cards at every lrt station when the system opens next year including stations convenient to downtown and tourist areas the tap card readers installed on the buses and future lrt are also capable of handling tap debitcredit and smartphone nfc payments but as in toronto that functionality has not been turned on
canada,not_removed,the presto card tap card is a nightmare that spawned from toronto it also takes hours for the funds to load so if you add money to it its not valid until the next day very stupid very inconvenient very expensive ottawa is a city with major urban planning failure regarding roads an transit resulting in heavy reliance on carculture just peruse rottawa and youll see lots of rants about the roads and buses its a tourist city but very centralized and inconvenient
canada,not_removed,yes it is you can see toonies loonies and a bill
canada,not_removed,thats what i though till i notice toonies and loonies the plastic cards threw me off
canada,not_removed,it looks like a combo of canadian coins and transit tickets
canada,not_removed,well never pull it off because one of the stupidest fuckgiraffes in the dumbdumb salad quit the show
canada,not_removed,this self suckoff for canada honestly fucking brilliant phrase will use self suckoff now that you taught me ps fair point patriotism is an easy trap that we do better to avoid on principle except those few times we genuinely exceptionally deserve major credit from others at which point canadians often have honestly earned their reputation by still being hesitant to accept the praise freely given and well deserved the rest is self congratulatory wanking
canada,not_removed,we can probably afford to have free travel way to demonstrate your understanding of politics and legislative budgets thanks for being salty please play again
canada,not_removed,yes it is one hundred dollars percent
canada,not_removed,its like you forgot what you were saying halfway through your sentence and switched to a completely different one
canada,not_removed,so california is essentially like in an adventure game if it aint bolted down its going in my pants every adventure game character ever
canada,not_removed,no it doesnt it uses a combination of magnetic strip passes monthly coinstyle tokens cash and is currently in the middle of an nfc payment rollout
canada,not_removed,since been upgraded to reloadable tap cards
canada,not_removed,the ttc isnt canadas largest subway system
canada,not_removed,they do this in montreal during rush hour
canada,not_removed,i took the train maybe twice a week for years i was checked oncee
canada,not_removed,that last part made me giggle out loud ive never seen this happen here in montreal usually here in montreal bus drivers will just tell passengers to skip paying if the machine is broken when it comes to our metro system you will typically see the turnstyles unlocked if the attendant isnt in his booth or something similar
canada,not_removed,same with calgary the transit police nab you tho if you dont pay at popular stations when you get off
canada,not_removed,unless youre a wheelchair user in which case you had better not be alone because even the accessible gate well isnt
canada,not_removed,i think most people paid the people who use transit often all have bus passes it is those who ride like once a month that tend to bot pay and heat the system
canada,not_removed,same here ottawa you can hop in the back doors of the larger buses but they check now and then i got dinged once about years ago with a ticket never again
canada,not_removed,u scumbag s
canada,not_removed,nope now you gotta swipe your card and the gate will let you through you can like jump over it if you really wanted to though
canada,not_removed,ive been taking public transit daily for over years and never seen it there are a lot of unsavory characters that would swipe that money up in no time if you leave a bill or a toonie anywhere in a busy public transit station it will be gone in seconds to think there is a huge pile of cash just sitting on top of a turnstyle unattended and nobody touched it is a tad naive i think it is far more likely that transit officials had just dumped out one of the payment collection bins or something
canada,not_removed,north america skeptic rest of world sceptic
canada,not_removed,both seem appropriate to me we got it from french which got it from latin which got it from greek the original greek would have been a k but it was latinized to a c before getting passed down to us english speakers
canada,not_removed,well every square inch of the airport is monitored and the vast majority of people there have flights and are thus easily identifiable through their ticket information
canada,not_removed,you didnt in the past but apparently now you do since they have fucking ads in the subways saying you can be stopped at any time and asked for pop i asked a ttc worker about it since ive never seen anyone take pop unless they need a transfer and his convoluted mostly gibberish answer added up to a weak yes you need it i think its incredibly stupid since you cant easily get into the subways without paying to begin with but now i take the stupid transferwhatever just in case adding to more pollution and useless bs in my pockets which i have to remember to throw out
canada,not_removed,in vancouver yes youll get transit police request your pop and pop you a fine if you dont produce it
canada,not_removed,no and anyone saying otherwise is incorrect proof of payment is only required on streetcars on the ttc in toronto source httpswwwttccafaresandpassesfareinformationproofofpaymentjsp it may also be required if youre transferring from a subway to a surface bus route but only so that the bus driver may let you on without paying not having proof of payment would not result in a ticket but rather you wouldnt be allowed on proofofpayment is required on all streetcar routes
canada,not_removed,yes since they started to use coupons with a chip inside
canada,not_removed,your proof of payment is a transfer you grab from a machine once youre in the station so youd be fine i still dont believe the picture though
canada,not_removed,montreal already has these cards they have magnetic strips for the single use cards the transfer datetime is added to the ticket itself the opus cards rechargeable passes basically are plastic with a chip inside
canada,not_removed,i knew it
canada,not_removed,i think this is situation is called paying it behind
canada,not_removed,ahh thanks ive been here years and have never seen one
canada,not_removed,fuck giraffes
canada,not_removed,you sound like my roll up the rim cup yesterday
canada,not_removed,rthathappened in case you dont know the reference
canada,not_removed,internet points are important
canada,not_removed,bruh i got a back pack that can hold stacks
canada,not_removed,you mean downgraded
canada,not_removed,its not an honour system in montreal though most people have paid to gain access to the metro the nannies just like to interrogate and intimidate
canada,not_removed,the amount of times ive been late for work case of those pricks
canada,not_removed,i find it kinda hard to see how you can get into the montreal metro unless you blatantly jump the gates in front of the workers
canada,not_removed,ive been here a while but never figured this out if the gates are openno attendants is it supposed to be free like we know were not here just go ahead i feel dumb paying now
canada,not_removed,actually the vast majority of wheelchair users have no problem using the accessible gate its a very small minority of individuals whose situation seems to be incompatible with the design of the accessible gates
canada,not_removed,they actually have numbers and studies going back years on this very subject for vancouver transit the amount of money lost was always fairly minimal and less than the cost of building turnstyles or gates until recently when they decided to build them anyways
canada,not_removed,im sure the vagrant looking homeless people or shifty as fuck looking people are all law abiding citizens edit sorry to break the circlejerk that canada is only filled with law abiding people with their only vocabulary being sorry
canada,not_removed,i know im a terrible human
canada,not_removed,yeah im pretty dubious about this were nice but were not crazy
canada,not_removed,actually i feel like if there was a pile it wouldnt be touched just like in the movie clerks he leaves a few dollars and some change on the table and a sign that says just pay there then everyone who comes in kind of put there money there and just left because theyre under the impression that people before them followed this unspoken rule if theres a pile of money and no one stole anything then its probably being watched or theres too much risk to it id just say if a pile got started by having enough good people in a row then i think itd be safe
canada,not_removed,i once had a junked out homeless man ask me for change while he was pissing his grey sweat pants waiting for the sky train in vancouver i dont think he wold have left his change there
canada,not_removed,the systems they have keep the money separate from the workers
canada,not_removed,sceptic just looks like it means something about scepters or sewer systems
canada,not_removed,we may have evolved to use it more because of american influence but we still use british spelling officially depends if you think common usage trumps that i was making a light joke because of the sub were in is all
canada,not_removed,in montreal this rule is being challenged because it assumes people without a pop are guilty of not having paid and the way the justice system works is youre supposed to be innocent until proven guilty the pop rule puts the burden of proof on the accused and not on the accuser which is backwards in the canadian justice system
canada,not_removed,youll never get inspected while in the subway only while on or while exiting a streetcar this will change when presto rollout is finished though
canada,not_removed,thats not true you only need pop for streetcars not on the subway the ads explaining the pop system are a little confusing in that they say you need pop while at a subway station but that only applies if youre getting off a streetcar in a fare paid area and there is a good chance there will be a fare inspector to check that youve paid like at union spadina dundas west and broadview but again only if youre riding or getting off a streetcar and if full pop ever does come into effect across the subway system having it is a lot easier with a presto card once you tap your card becomes your pop inspectors have handheld devices to see if youve paid or not so there is no need to take a transfer and no need for pocket bs or pollution
canada,not_removed,ya know people like gumby and pefuckio
canada,not_removed,link nvm its been a long day
canada,not_removed,amt trains are honour system with random ticket checks on the trains and in the stations
canada,not_removed,thats still an honour system httpsenwikipediaorgwikiproofofpayment just not a total honour system
canada,not_removed,here in ottawa they do it while the bus is running its route so nobody gets overly delayed and fare dodgers dont have anywhere to go
canada,not_removed,why because they can make you miss your train i mean another one will come two minutes later honestly if youre going to be late for work all because of something that will take a couple minutes to get over with then it is you who is doing it wrong
canada,not_removed,during rush hour its easy you just have to reverse the turnstyles a bit and squeeze through
canada,not_removed,yeah you would typically be allowed through theyll open the red gates for this purpose it might be rare to see it nowadays because even if the attendant isnt there youre still able to buy a ticket from the machine
canada,not_removed,source
canada,not_removed,i thought so few bad apples ruined it for all of us i dont like these new gates also dislike the compass card kinda a hassle
canada,not_removed,ive seen more than one vagrant walk in and either pay or sweettalk the driver its not always maliciously going in and avoiding the fare ive also seen drivers telling them to fuck off and they do thats how nice canada is hobos ask for permission also one time i forgot my wallet and i asked the driver for a ride up the hill three stops up a hill he was more than happy to let me ride
canada,not_removed,idk how transit works in other cities but if youre drunk and not like bothering people the transit guys in winnipeg are suppose to let you ride for free to encourage people to not drink and drive
canada,not_removed,eh its obviously in a subway station i imagine theres just too many witnesses to the point where one wouldnt feel comfortable trying to swipe the pile itd be a low value crime with a lot of witnesses and likely cameras
canada,not_removed,i dont think he would have left anyones change there
canada,not_removed,we dont use british spelling officially canada has its own variant of canadian english which takes some rules and spellings from american english and some from british english eg american and canadian use realize while uk uses realise
canada,not_removed,haha fair enough i dont think anyone would actually use the cameras to catch a chip thief its probably just a good deterrent in general the airport is one of the last places id want to be doing something illegal or causing a ruckus
canada,not_removed,does the justice system actually apply to things like that id think mass transit fines and stuff would act more as private company rules and not need to meet the standards of a court of law you dont get a criminal record for being caught riding the metro without paying the fare do you
canada,not_removed,thats some quantum shit right there
canada,not_removed,i laughed way too hard at your username
canada,not_removed,ive met cats and dogs smarter than corey and trevor
canada,not_removed,its not an honour system if there are checks
canada,not_removed,they do the same in vancouver or at least used to a few years ago when i lived there
canada,not_removed,that solves that problem but the way montreal does it they can check everyone thats taking a specific route between time x and y with only the cost of officers it slows you down a bit but not much its more like just having two machines to swipe your card on instead of one
canada,not_removed,the metro and bus comes by often but actual trains are usually apart or more
canada,not_removed,now i dont know where vancouver sun gets those figures from and id be curious to know their sources that being said it anecdotally makes sense that only the most severe forms of physical disability such as quadriplegia would cause issues when using the accessible gates keep in mind that these individuals still need the ability to operate the elevators to reach platform level im fully in support of making vancouver as accessible to people as possible i just think its a story that got blown out of proportion because people wanted to continue being mad at the issues with the faregates a common complaint that ive heard is why was this mistake made when we could look to how other cities around the world do it and the truth is a lot of cities just arent that accessible to people with disabilities
canada,not_removed,i loathe the new gates and think theyre a ridiculous boondoggle but overall i think the system is pretty incredible so i try not to complain about the skytrain
canada,not_removed,why would it be a crime people willingly threw that money away
canada,not_removed,httpwwwseoskepticcomseoskeptologyskepticorsceptic shows which the government of canada uses
canada,not_removed,nonmobile link helperbot rhelperbot i am a bot please message with any feedback andor hate counter
canada,not_removed,any american spelling we use adopted from americans i really dont think its so black and white there are still purists that argue about this
canada,not_removed,the way i understand honour system is trust but verify but i get your point i have not ever encountered however a transit system with no checks anywhere in the world that i have been to would love to see an example of such a system
canada,not_removed,honour system according to the httpsenoxforddictionariescomdefinitionhonoursystem you are entirely correct you may ignore the haters
canada,not_removed,yes it is the idea is they trust you to be honorable about it so if they should randomly check of commuters those people will have paid for tickets and can be on their way
canada,not_removed,sure it is how often do you run into a transit officer checking on tickets once in a blue moon because that is about how often i see them occassionally they show up but of the time to a point its well within the margin of error for probability of running into a transit officer checking tickets in my admittedly limited perspective sharing only from my own personal set of experiences it is very much an honour driven sense though technically relying on more then just honour
canada,not_removed,ah yeah thats understandable and unfortunate
canada,not_removed,arguing that money placed on top of the fare box for when the ttc person returned is thrown away is ridiculous and theres no way you could claim such theres just no expectation that you can take that money so its pretty straightforward theft
canada,not_removed,not really that website did a google search and found times as many search results on government sites however at the same time it shows cbc uses skeptic more cbc is government owned so it doesnt really say much either way im not saying every spelling is so black and white in canadian english my only problem with your previous statement was the implication that canada officially abides by british spelling which is not true
canada,not_removed,next will you argue the use of marihuana as the standard when pretty much every canadian uses marijuana
canada,not_removed,thats a tricky one because bags are so generic and it seems completely normal for someone to grab a random bag and walk off with it im surprised it doesnt happen more often
canada,not_removed,oh i agree it makes sense im just wondering at the guy above me saying pop was challenged because of the way the justice system works i dont think the metro has any particular requirement to follow presumption of innocence even though it makes sense here afaik even in the justice system presumption of innocence in canada is only when charged with a criminal offense not a civil one
canada,not_removed,seeing honour spelled correctly in this thread over and over again warms my heart
canada,not_removed,this is what vancouver was like there were no turn styles you just walked through hence the reason hes saying that it was an honour system
canada,not_removed,there isnt an example because no one would pay or a very small percentage of people would pay
canada,not_removed,and theres no way you could claim such yes there is if it was intended as payment it would be in the fare box dont you think the way its depicted on the picture it might as well be on the floor
canada,not_removed,cbc is funded largely by the government they are still operated separate from the government whereas usage on actual federal sites goes by a spelling guide
canada,not_removed,it was supposed to be a joke people sure are passionate though
canada,not_removed,it is allegedly in mtl though we have a lot of funky laws in qc
canada,not_removed,i dont know if you can read in french but this article sums up what i was talking about also another example of ticketing is that police bare the burden of providing proof that you were speeding and if they do not have this proof you cannot be ticketed because as ive said above the burden of proof in canada is placed on the accuser not the accused due process is a constitutional right and has nothing to do with criminal or civil cases
canada,not_removed,yeah calgary is still like that
canada,not_removed,it would make sense to distinguish from a system that makes you pass through a gate that unlocks once you have paid versus one where you could use the transit as much as you want without circumventing any checkpoints or gates or crossing any barriers even though there would be checks from time to time in both cases honour system is as good a term as any how many people would pay or not i could see differing greatly from place to place i could see something like that working fairly well in a place like japan where the sort of shame of not paying would keep a lot of people in check and only the poorer people that dont care what society thinks of them would hop on for free i think tokyo actually does work on a kind of honour system as well but i didnt stay there long so i might be wrong you had to pay different amounts for different destinations but it was an open metro like in montreal so i think that probably worked on checks or something idk it made travelling a bit rough though because you had to figure out which symbols were where you were going some stations had english but some didnt
canada,not_removed,exactly or else the money would likely disappear at most metro stations é
canada,not_removed,its not really different the idea behind the ruling is that innocent people are being unfairly punished because they dont have a pop with them for whatever reason and that there are reasonable controls like at costco the dude checking your receipt when you leave before you enter the metro for this to be avoided if i threw away my receipt before leaving the costco it would still be on them to prove that i stole it wouldnt be on me to prove that i did not steal
canada,not_removed,i think tokyo actually does work on a kind of honour system as well but i didnt stay there long so i might be wrong you had to pay different amounts for different destinations but it was an open metro like in montreal where you had to pay to enter and leave on on the trains i took it could suck since you couldnt leave the stop you entered apparently
canada,not_removed,honour system is as good a term as any not really youre not paying because of any sense of honour youre paying to avoid being caught in an inspection and fined
canada,not_removed,in the tokyo subway system not the train system you had to use machines like they would have the destinations on the map and you would need to select which one you wanted on the screen
canada,not_removed,in the tokyo subway system not the train system you had to use machines like this they would have the destinations on the map and you would need to select which one you wanted on the screen all the gates were closed unless you put in a ticket would it accept it at the end if you paid the wrong amount i use a passmo so it knew how far i went
canada,not_removed,or the machine which gave you the ticket for the value you paid im sure it is not an honour system its still ticketedusing passes
canada,not_removed,i dont know i didnt stay there long and i dont remember that maybe thats it theres a gate on the way out that makes sure you paid the right amount all i remember is trying to figure out where we had to go and paying that amount i never tried testing the system
canada,not_removed,the controversy surrounding monsefs background is far from over i wonder why that is next week well be hearing how she uses iranian saffron and the toronto sun will dedicate a column and op eds to the matter i hope nothing happens to her just so they can blow a gasket
canada,not_removed,so sun hates state media when it is cbc sun gives credibility to state media when it is foreign got it
canada,not_removed,mike duffy
canada,not_removed,oh come on how blindly partisan are you all the toronto sun and many canadians want this government to do is treat her the way countless other canadians have been treated who have committed fraud on their refugee or citizenship applications the liberals and their blind supporters should not be above the law say what you want about harper he did not protect conservatives not mulroney not duffy when they were merely suspected of wrongdoing afterall sunny days sunny ways should not be a shiny thing used to provide teflon cover to liberals
canada,not_removed,not duffy youre right he was definitely not informed about anything about that
canada,not_removed,i hope she doesnt go anywhere just to keep you folks upset and irate
canada,not_removed,never said he wasnt informed just said he did not offer special treatment or protection
canada,not_removed,good old liberal maturity i hope they screw the law to make people mad
canada,not_removed,what laws have been broken exactly because all i see is speculation on the behalf of one news organization
canada,not_removed,lying on her birth place to immigration people in this country are getting deported for the exact same thing at the very least she should step down until her immigration status is cleared up but shes a liberal so its your duty to defend her no matter what
canada,not_removed,who lied year old monsef or her guardian youre making a whole swath of accusations without any evidence
canada,not_removed,this is going to keep happening and to larger and larger targets
canada,not_removed,any organization affected by ransomware has no one to blame but themselves ransomware is easily remedied by restoring from a backup taken before infection is peanuts compared to the value of the data a fire wouldnt give you the option of getting your files back for a few theyre lucky this can be solved by throwing money at it
canada,not_removed,i think this raises a good question about the perception of privacyoriented currency like bitcoins does the small minority using bitcoin for nefarious means taint the image of regular private conscious people who use bitcoins for legitimate purchases
canada,not_removed,oh like mr robot except evil
canada,not_removed,ironic how the information that is normally held behind an extortinate paywall is now behind another extortinate paywall whats behind that paywall you ask another paywall omfg my mind is blown here its turtles all the way down
canada,not_removed,this happened to the university of calgary not too long ago since the uoc couldnt be arsed to have backups they paid
canada,not_removed,common wisdom in security spheres is if you absolutely need what is locked up by the ransomware you pony up the cash there is no decrypting those files without the key
canada,not_removed,the criminals currency strikes again
canada,not_removed,they should really just pay the its not that much money considering how much that school rakes in
canada,not_removed,still no word on where exactly all that tuition money is going at carleton u so far we have ruled out the it dept ftfy
canada,not_removed,my sisters smart tv got ransomware on it once couldnt do anything without getting a message asking you to call a phone number to unlock your pc had to call tech support to get the secret factory reset code spawned an entire investigation by kaspersky labs and everything
canada,not_removed,cant it just lie in wait and not activate for many backups though and then if you restore to a backup or two ago it will just be active then too as you restore serious question
canada,not_removed,good ransomware waits a few backups
canada,not_removed,i was hoping it would raise good questions as to why this stuff isnt on a versioned backup solution fta those issues were said to be impacting email and carleton central an information hub for course registration admissions payroll and other administrative services seriously
canada,not_removed,bitcoin transactions are completely public though theyre not anonymous at all every single transaction can be traced from start to finish by anyone anywhere in the world how does this work then the issue is the final conversion of bitcoin into cash if bitcoin were gone it would be some other altcoin cryptocurrency is here and is not going away already most bitcoin exchanges in the west abide by antimoney laundering laws whether bitcoin ever becomes more of a thing then it already is is up in the air but what is not up in the air is whether public ledger cryptocurrencies exist and work people misunderstand the issue and this cat isnt going back into the bag if it werent btc it would be ltc and if it werent btc it would be evo and if it werent btc it would be x public ledger exchanges like btc literally have the potential to shave percentages of transaction costs across all transactions around the world in every currency if you were really to do an indepth analysis there are billions and possibly trillions in savings available if a public ledger system were adopted the question is whether it is bitcoin that does this or something else and when it will happen whether btc does it or not a cryptocurrency will eliminate all sorts of middlemen in any sort of financial deal across currencies organizations countries which one it is and when it happens is the question i had an eye opening moment when i spotted a bitcoin transaction link in the broweser bars of some recent nigerian immigrants for international monetary transactions its already started real people real world real solutions they were using bitcoin to send money back home its not just darknet markets anymore although at one point the price of btc could be traded at a phenomenal profit based upon updowntime of silk road not that i would know
canada,not_removed,yes no doubt gotta catch the terrorists and pedophiles is the politicians favorite excuse for censorship and invasion of privacy there will be a big fight about it but the biggest difficulty the politicians will have is that bits dont care for borders and probably it will be impossible to make a global treaty that imposes regulations to all countries in the world
canada,not_removed,i think it doesnt really matter what bitcoins image is not much you can do to stop it individual companies can refuse to accept it but then the people that collect bitcoin ransoms probably werent planning on spending them on steam gifts anyway
canada,not_removed,at this point i would have to say bitcoin is still majority used for nefarious purposes
canada,not_removed,you read the article too
canada,not_removed,what is the appropriate backup structure to prevent this sort of thing from being too damaging online cloud continuous backup not mirroring would also be effected wouldnt it does this type of virus sit in wait because if yes then it could be in the weeks ago weekly off line hard backup and every subsequent backup couldnt it so i am very confused at what a proper backup system to specifically protect against ransomware is
canada,not_removed,not enough people consider computers to be dangerous wrong hands or not
canada,not_removed,good pc hygiene and awareness i floss my harddrives daily and always check my cpu for lumps
canada,not_removed,life sure was much nicer before you had to worry about hackers locking you out of your tv this is pretty much of reasons i wont buy a smart tv the other being that it is just something else to go wrong that cant be easily fixed like having an external android box which does more than a smart tv ever could
canada,not_removed,god damn internet of things
canada,not_removed,when was this and what brand of tv just curious
canada,not_removed,it could but the data itself is still being backed up in nonencrypted form and if youre aware that there may be malware present in the backups you can scan through your data without executing anything if you identify some malware you dont have to restore that part of the backup but rather you could just remove it not unlike how if you scan an infected file with a virus scanner it can identify and remove the malicious code without actually executing it
canada,not_removed,unless the ransomware is somehow encrypting the files as theyre being backed up and no one notices it can wait as long as it pleases unencrypted ie not encrypted by ransomware files on my backup are still unencrypted files on my backup and if the malware itself is in those backups we can deal with that fairly easily without compromising file data
canada,not_removed,much less safe ones though much easier to track methods
canada,not_removed,infrastructure redundancy security and the people to work on it costs money the business side of an organization doesnt often understand or appreciate its value
canada,not_removed,yup someone in it needs to get fired or maybe hired
canada,not_removed,read the article naw this is the internet who reads the articles i heard the story of how the u of c didnt know how to use backups on cbc radio a few months back s
canada,not_removed,i will always recommend a rule three copies of your data two differant storage mediums hdd cloud and one off site air gapped copy
canada,not_removed,ken m
canada,not_removed,i work in tech and most people i know in the industry would never buy a smart tv for these reasons most smart devices are very unsecure and you can easily get a more secure solution that simply plugs in to your tv it wouldnt even necessarily be that you get locked out but what if someone if accessing your tvs cameramicrophone to spy on you without you ever knowing what if you tv is compromised and is used in widespread internet attacks the largest ddos ever happened couple weeks ago was performed by tons of hacked smart devices smart devices are a lot of risk for little convenience at this point and most consumers will deploy these devices in the least secure way possible simply because they dont know better
canada,not_removed,most backup data is probably limited to nonexecutable anyway i know in my work if i do a data migration or backup from an infected pc i always purge the common executable types for specifically this reason
canada,not_removed,paysafecard buy cash boom
canada,not_removed,until they lose everything to an attack like this and management cannot comprehend why it is unable to simply fix the problem with a few keystrokes
canada,not_removed,chances are pretty solid someone in it protested for months to management about the issues and it fell on deaf ears money carries a far disproportionate weight in evaluation and i dont mean that for reasons of nobody should make money but rather shortterm poundfoolish pennywise strategies are preferred business puts a lot of stress on an executive to have that bias
canada,not_removed,what is end point protection and those other terms
canada,not_removed,first day of grad school my advisor told me that if your data doesnt exist in three distinct locations it doesnt exist at all
canada,not_removed,we are all cryptohackers on this blessed day
canada,not_removed,working on the lowest level of tech support this truly is it what we do is magic to of people and many business types never got their hands wet in it on their road up it is truly as simple to them as waving a magic wand
canada,not_removed,any recommendations for the providers of endpoint and next gen
canada,not_removed,it makes me sick to my stomach at the amount of taxes we payalmost to the point of poverty only to have it misused like this the sad thing too is that its the same story under any government we are destined to continue to be screwed no matter whos in power
canada,not_removed,third bailout enroute i think were on maybe
canada,not_removed,you know what would of worked better dont give them any money tell the execs give it your best if the company goes under we will compensate your employees with the cash youre asking for bam every employee now has a nice nest egg and saved from your greasy dealings instead these few people can now make their cash silos slightly bigger what a bunch of asshatery can some petition be started to get the money back that was invested by canada if youre cutting jobs how did you get more money did the company need the money or did these ever important executives we all know that doing the paperwork and making decisions is truly how things get done the manual labor grunts if you will dont do anything god help if they are union oh man if they are union i feel so sorry for these executives man what next you spill your starbucks hot damn so seriously when is enough money enough their bonuses for year are more money than i will make in years working at my job why not let me be ceo for a year or two for a couple reasons one why the fuck not go retire and go live on an island or whatever you want to do two if i fuck it up canada will bail me out and ill still get those sick bonuses
canada,not_removed,i no longer like trudeau initially i thought he was on the right track but now defending bombardier lame
canada,not_removed,executives mismanage a company requiring a bailout proceeds to get a raise and a pat on the back but hey what do i know im just a go train rider who doesnt even have the qualifications to run a multibilliondollar corporation s
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,of course trudeau has to defend thats what he is paid to do
canada,not_removed,we respect the free market and the choices that companies will make trudeau said but we also have a responsibility to ensure that the investments we make with taxpayers dollars are leading to good jobs and growth the government should of tried to held out for shares of bombardier instead of a loan the interest at the end of the first year basically pays for this at least its going to be repaid back in years
canada,not_removed,this society belongs to the sadly were just living in it
canada,not_removed,bernier has promised to end corporate welfare and seems highly devoted to it
canada,not_removed,how can we go about triggering it early
canada,not_removed,the government is incompetent we need more government you guys are strange
canada,not_removed,from what i remember from the civics section in high school history because they have a majority government wed have to convince enough liberal mps to vote against a budget or other critical bill which triggers a vote of no confidence
canada,not_removed,no the wealthy elite are entilteled to thier money not ours if your business chooses to ship jobs elsewhere and is not a sound investmwnt for a private investor you should go bankrupt keeping pouring cash into an inefficient shitpile like bombardier is pandering to quebec and killing expansion in transport and areospace companies countrywide alberta got federal money for lrt and inmedietly announces bombardier will be making the cars think that wasnt a condition on recieving the money many shops in alberta could build those cars but are sitting empty the shop i work in switched from structural steel to bridge building to keep ourselves viable in the downturn we could easily pump out traincars a month if that was our focus with little to no government support but the work goes to bombardier even with their ttc toronto fiasco ongoing
canada,not_removed,have you tried working harder or saving more that does it for most people
canada,not_removed,unlikely communistssocialists are always looking to blame someone else for their problems
canada,not_removed,you two goof balls are attacking the poster instead of being upset with this give your head a shake top execs give themselves bonuses and hard working people get their job cut
canada,not_removed,says the trump supporter with a user named based off of a campaign slogan used for misdirection from trumps own failings
canada,not_removed,has the type of gun actually been confirmed
canada,not_removed,several legal weapons strongly resemble the there is no confirmation on what weapon was used in the attack yet
canada,not_removed,im curious too its not like you can go on craigslistkijiji and ask to buy one
canada,not_removed,kalashnikovs can be made in home workshops by anyone who knows how to work with metal and maybe wood the information on how to do it is available freely online hell ive seen a guy make one out of parts of a shovel you can buy the ammo for it easily enough as well its common and cheap
canada,not_removed,same place any criminal doesother criminals there is a huge underground market for guns in canada its all very easy to find on the darknet haha im getting downvoted by kids angry at not being able to easily get their own fullauto assault rifles
canada,not_removed,there are non banned ak style rifles that are available that most canadians wouldnt be able to distinguish from an actual so its either that or he bought the gun on the black market
canada,not_removed,of the time when the media says an was usedseen an wasnt actually used or seen the media tends to think wood stock because its a recognizable gun name that instills fear on those who dont know much about guns which is the majority of people basically mention of an is a fearmongering term even if it isnt actually an that was used
canada,not_removed,it was probably smuggled in thats how almost all criminals get their guns but of course some people are going to demand the government to ban everything down to super soakers
canada,not_removed,right question wrong context if criminals can demonstrate that they can get their hands on illegal guns with impunity why do legal and responsible gun owners have to suffer such ridiculous processes to own and operate legal guns
canada,not_removed,if it is outright banned then there was a time when it wasnt guns could have been in the country before the ban it could have also been smuggled into the country these illegal guns have a black market gangcrime areas it would pretty easy to get one nor much harder than drugs theres also some guns that you cant currently get a license for but people who legally owned them can still own them and buysell them since theres not a large market for them they would actually cost less buying a short barreled handgun would set you back than buying a similar gun that people can get a permit for or it could have been stolen from a legal owner it would actually be easy enough to get one of these guns illegally that i could have a real not a clone or even a full auto ar within a week hell last year in lethbridge ab there was a guy who got caught with a ton of weapons he didnt legally posses including a wwii vickers machine gun its a water cooled pound fully auto weapon not exactly easy to hide so a ak or other similar gun could be disassembled and be sold very discretely
canada,not_removed,you can make rifles look like assault rifles too stock mods etc but it is probably the media blowing it out of proportion
canada,not_removed,im a nerd without many friends i couldnt even get weed a year ago thats how sheltered i was then i started seeing hookers and got into some drugs now i can get coke opiates meth hallucinogenics guns are also available through them
canada,not_removed,the gun nuts who live downstairs
canada,not_removed,nope as far as the reports ive seen the suspect was charged with using a restricted firearm so its rather doubtful that it was an ak as they are all prohibited
canada,not_removed,i believe they were using the standard
canada,not_removed,media says ak is media right probably not what was it than and why does the media spit out misinformation yes they are banned and yes they are obtainable but likely very hard to come by in this country since they are big and bulky and have no use here unlike other countries its just a very well known firearm so any that have a wood stock and banana mag are going to be called an ak when an sks is very similar and i wouldnt be suprised if isnt the most popular firearm in canada
canada,not_removed,ive seen a guy make one out of parts of a shovel lolive seen that video
canada,not_removed,dont forget rifles can be modified to be automatic someone could by a non restricted rifle mod it and sell it
canada,not_removed,most people cant tell the difference between an actual a and an sks
canada,not_removed,there arent any in canada never been sold here
canada,not_removed,and the chinese havent even made the theyre going to sell here yet there is precisely one of these guns in the country and it is in the possession of the company that will be importing the rest whenever the chinese finally get around to actually making them
canada,not_removed,i would be looking at the mohawk territory that straddles the ontario quebec and new york state boundaries they smuggle anything that will make them money tobacco drugs computers and of course guns and ammo money is the name of the game jim b
canada,not_removed,the largest issue is firearms being prohibited by name aks built on semi auto receivers should be nonrestricted firearms by our classification laws why are nonrestrictedrestricted based on barrel length and aks still prohibited its nonsense
canada,not_removed,exactly why cant i pay a lot of money for a ma deuce without fear of going to jail
canada,not_removed,so they dont get arrested
canada,not_removed,a dime of coke a ball of heroin a rock of crack etc are much easier to come by then a kalashnikov and you know it i cant go to a trendy or trashy depending on the drug party ask around and pay for an automatic weapon
canada,not_removed,its a legit question and hopefully one thatll be answered
canada,not_removed,dammit this thread was not supposed to make me laugh this morning i mean i pretty much knew what to expect when i clicked on the link but i did not expect to see a flintlock pistol labeled as a glock thank you for this
canada,not_removed,according to the media every dog that bites someone is a pitbull and every gun that isnt a pistol is an assault rifle
canada,not_removed,the type and classification of the fire arm are important if it was obtained illegally it is very important that law enforcement learns how and from where it was procured and how it made its way into the country
canada,not_removed,its the entire subject of this post if it doesnt matter why did you feel the need to comment
canada,not_removed,well it does matter because if the weapon was something thats not supposed to be available then theres the problem it could happen again in the same way it could also be used by people to say that banning these guns really doesnt help
canada,not_removed,and its just that easy to have an untraceable assault rifle scary stuff
canada,not_removed,thats generally pretty difficult to do without access to machining equipment know how and possibly some parts that are prohibited in canada
canada,not_removed,rifles that are too easily modified are not allowed entry into the country by the rcmp so no in most cases they cannot unless they have an extensive knowledge of how firearms work
canada,not_removed,most people dont need or care to be able to tell the difference what probably happened is a witness said he had an like an ak or something and the press ran with it in the end its not really important
canada,not_removed,yes sks cal with large clips used to be legally sold well before any kind of registration and not just banana clips but with the round drums conversion to full auto are easy not saying this is the case just that such weapons are available im old enough to remember walking into canadian tire and buying weapons ammo with nothing but a drivers liscense these weapons are still out there just sayin
canada,not_removed,im not really sure that anyone needs one but it sure would be fun at the range
canada,not_removed,a dime of coke a ball of heroin a rock of crack those things dont cross the border a dime at a time cross border gun smuggling is definitely a thing and many police depts have said that most of the guns they see in crime are from out of the country
canada,not_removed,come party with a gang in vancouver they hook you up with some drugs to take some drugs to sell and a weapon to protect your stash canada isnt all apologies and maple syrup
canada,not_removed,it likely was an assault rifle id guess a sks with a modernized stock which will look like an to a layman also cheap readily available and unrestricted
canada,not_removed,not to mention useless id rather be running away from someone shooting at me on full auto than someone shooting a semi auto rifle
canada,not_removed,nah all you need is a cnc machine and you can just machine cut part at a time say its for a piece of old car you are replacing and they wont bat an eye as long as they get paid
canada,not_removed,just a correction rifles the rcmp say can be easily modified often require large amounts of machining and specialty parts to function properly the rcmp dont know their ass from their elbow when it comes to firearms
canada,not_removed,sounds like you dont know what your talking about if you think sks rifles were ever sold in and that full auto conversions are easy then you know nothing
canada,not_removed,nothing you just said makes sense
canada,not_removed,i want to see this cal sks because i sure as hell have never heard of them and my love for commie guns borders on erotic
canada,not_removed,thats the point of the majority of legally owned firearms in canada fun at the range you can buy a semi auto calibre rifle for about tax but noone will ever really use it outside of a range its just a fun and harmless way for people to spend money for the million gun owners in canada
canada,not_removed,except the crown laid a charge about using a restricted firearm so possibly a short barrel most non firearm people to look at one would default to thats an ak
canada,not_removed,people died the entire thing is morbid yes this post is stupid and a little pointless but my interest is simply in finding out what report details had been confirmed since the type of weapon was one of the things that came from early reports im sorry my question bothers you but talking about the incident at all is morbid but i dont think thats a good enough reason to ignore it and not find out what really happened
canada,not_removed,do you honestly think that answer is satisfactory to police or crown attorneys dont you think a good chunk of the public would like to know their findings
canada,not_removed,especially most of the easy converted full autos people talk about will just make it uncontrollable slam fire once its loaded with no trigger press thats just gonna end up sending rounds into the ceiling or blowing the gun up with an out of battery detonation
canada,not_removed,they also spend like months doing it they seem to think that if it takes them six months with access to great machining equipment and all the parts they need that its easy thats ridiculous
canada,not_removed,i had one converted it sorry about that old school and all
canada,not_removed,youre reply is minimal to the point of being useless please put more effort into it next time
canada,not_removed,its of chinese manufacture
canada,not_removed,making it slam fire isnt converting it unless you actually machined a new trigger mechanism and altered the bolt carrier then you didnt actually convert it to full auto
canada,not_removed,k
canada,not_removed,i know what you mean i asked if the kind of weapon was confirmed which i didnt think was a matter of opinion and ended up getting a lecture on the macabre
canada,not_removed,not talking slam fire talking a kit and it is a full auto conversion
canada,not_removed,i have never heard of a full auto conversion kit for an sks before even require moderate modification to the receiver to fit full auto parts and the modification is illegal to do do you have a link to an example of such a kit on hand
canada,not_removed,of course its illegal to do and no i do not nor am i really claiming i know any more about the matter other than coverting a legally purchased cal semiauto sks of chinese maufacture to a single rose vase but you might want to check out the history of certain biker groups or even david koresh and the branch dividians did you used to read cabelas in the mid early before the intertubes and youtube you seem very capable im sure there is a way
canada,not_removed,sure given enough time its possible to convert literally any firearm to fully automatic capabilities see prototype conversion kits from for the lee enfield to suggest its easy to do or common in any way is silly at that point you have the tools and skills to straight up manufacture machine guns from scratch with even less paper trail such as
canada,not_removed,whatever you say hoss
canada,not_removed,would be nice if they posted what these actual amendments are
canada,not_removed,the trudeau government is acting exactly like the harper government craft bad unconstitutional legislation and refuse any and all amendments that would make it constitutional already two courts and have made rulings that de facto find bill unconstitutional yet the trudeau government pushes forward with a demonstrably flawed bill that courts have shown will be struck down just like the harper conservatives i had what i thought was an understanding why the harper government passed bad legislation it was to appeal to the conservative base and improve fund raising i have no idea why the trudeau government is bent on passing bad illcrafted legislation with physicianassisted death all the trudeau government had to do was craft legislation that conformed to the supreme court ruling in carter v canada it chose not to do that why i fear its just pure incompetence and now pure perverse irrational arrogant obstinance this does not bode well for future legislation
canada,not_removed,two of the nine measures im aware of one was to no longer require a person to be near death to get assisted dying a second was to allow for people with mental illnesses that degrade like dementia to be able to have some sort of fast track into assisted dying
canada,not_removed,both of which are necessary to have a reasonable assisted dying law imagine if a doctor said sorry i know you have terminal cancer your quality of life is abysmal and youre a drain on your family financially and emotionally but theres a chance you just have slightly too long to live for me to ethically end your life or yes im afraid the alzheimers is progressing aggressively and your mind will be completely destroyed long before your body gives out but the government says you cant consent to have me end your life no matter how bad it gets send the bill back until its ready
canada,not_removed,one was to no longer require a person to be near death to get assisted dying seems like a reasonable requirement otherwise you get assisted suicide a second was to allow for people with mental illnesses that degrade like dementia to be able to have some sort of fast track into assisted dying seems questionable you want fast track to get rid of people deemed mentally below some predetermined threshold that is severely subjective i never expected assisted dying bill to be about getting rid of people with mental issues wtf how did we get from initial concept of terminal incurable suffering to get rid of anyone as fast as possible
canada,not_removed,the main thing id want assisted dying for is dementia other diseases there are good meds for pain dementia is terrible though you have years of degrading faculties until you cant even eat or control your bladder or bowels
canada,not_removed,the idea would be that you can sign your life away when you have a sound mind my grandfather in law yesterday told me he wants to die with dignity he passes every test being of sound mind but his terminal disease wont kill him immediately
canada,not_removed,stole gets years in prison and will probably only server of that fine and in restitution so profit of sign me up
canada,not_removed,aaaand shes out on bail pending appeal
canada,not_removed,hope they confiscated everything she owns and will come out nice and broke
canada,not_removed,i know a few people who got caught up in this scam as it was very close to home the most horrible part of the story is that people were put into this fund by the financial advisers at the local bank as a safe investment the returns were not particularly high about which was pretty common when this happened they did everything that youre supposed to do when investing and still got burned sadly theyll get pennies back despite how much she stole its all gone the fine will not be paid i think years is getting off pretty lightly
canada,not_removed,id do years in the clink for half that
canada,not_removed,lol how does this make any sense oh you stole well well need back ok go away for years which youll probably only do years and go think about what you did what what about the other sure its not great to spend years in prison but when they come out of it theyve got how how is this happening i might as well do the same no isnt years of your life and a criminal record worth
canada,not_removed,sounds like the ideal gen z retirement scheme wonder where she stashed the lootnevermind just ask the judge
canada,not_removed,yep shell probably be out in a couple of years or less and then all the money that she managed to steal and hide will be very generous compensation for her time behind bars
canada,not_removed,wait shell actually keep the proceeds of the thefts i guess she hid it well
canada,not_removed,yup id do it
canada,not_removed,fines and restitution are on top of a requirement to pay back the
canada,not_removed,i love canada truly the greatest country in the world to commit crimes in
canada,not_removed,she didnt profit
canada,not_removed,in addition to the million fine the panel ordered that samji pay to the commission the amount determined to be the difference between the monies deposited by the investors pursuant to the fraud and the monies paid out to them
canada,not_removed,offshore accounts
canada,not_removed,sure if the money left canada what is the government going to do
canada,not_removed,you would think that but thats what restitution is the recovery of monies lost so yes is the penalty
canada,not_removed,the financial advisers were acting outside of the rules of the bank they have been fired lost their licenses and may face criminal charges too im under the impression that the banks will be on the hook for some of the money as they are certainly being sued for allowing their employees to recommend something that was not authorized but they obviously claim ignorance and say it isnt their responsibility theyll settle for pennies i assume
canada,not_removed,how ever much she has managed to get offshore is hers once she gets out
canada,not_removed,put her in jail until she reveals where it is seems fair no
canada,not_removed,in addition to the million fine the panel ordered that samji pay to the commission the amount determined to be the difference between the monies deposited by the investors pursuant to the fraud and the monies paid out to them basically she had paid the investors back about already she was ordered to pay the diff and then is her punishment so i was off a bit just the is on top of the she wont profit will likely be bankrupted
canada,not_removed,should be but we both know thats not how the law works
canada,not_removed,good luck collecting
canada,not_removed,sadly
canada,not_removed,so you want the government to be able to detain people indefinitely until they produce whatever the government alleges they should be able to produce thats not a good thing at all i wouldnt trust the government to wipe my ass right why would i trust it with that kind of power
canada,not_removed,good point
canada,not_removed,of course youre right indefinite detention is not a good thing objectively nevertheless it would be great to prevent this person from enjoying the stolen money but indefinite detention is not a good way of going about it
canada,not_removed,canadians have been growing selling buying and smoking pot perfectly fine for many many years without any help from the government we dont need a task force of clueless morons who hate pot to tell us how to do it
canada,not_removed,why the fuck are we having such a hard time when its just rolling through the states
canada,not_removed,just like when we were all eagerly awaiting the report from the ledain commission too for all the good that ever did
canada,not_removed,i guess this took a bit of a back burner to pushing through all those pipelines
canada,not_removed,this comment really hits home with me id rather not see pot turned into the shitshow that is the beer store or the lcbo in ontario did you get all you black friday deals make sure you check out our staff pick of shit that we cant sell honestly with all the bullshit surrounding this i dont trust the government to get it right im hearing stories constantly about psychoactive thc wont somebody think of the children and how todays pot is better than the pot in the no shit so are bananas thats called farming you think people smoked less back then because the pot was less effective they smoked more
canada,not_removed,a task force of clueless morons who hate pot you know one of the top guys on it has been studying and speaking on the benefits of medical cannabis for like years yeah httpqprncaenlargeststudylongtermsafetycannabistreatmentchronicpainpublishedteamledmarkware
canada,not_removed,the goal is to write convoluted regulation to insure that only wealthy investors politicians their friends and global investors own the entire market from production to distribution creating no new wealth all under the guise of protecting us this takes time
canada,not_removed,seriously im so sick of waiting gosh
canada,not_removed,how many years did it take to get those states to legalize it
canada,not_removed,because it was basically a bullshit campaign promise that they have no issue dragging their heels on
canada,not_removed,it took those us states years to get those laws written and passed too and thats just a hodgepodge of state laws not the whole country if and when the us government tries to legalize as a nation it will prob take a long time too
canada,not_removed,personally i love the thc concentrates are more potent than marijuana which is extremely dangerous i guess these idiots have never compared the alcohol contents of whiskey vs beer or assume that someone will have a few pints of whiskey in one sitting
canada,not_removed,id rather not see pot turned into the shitshow that is the beer store or the lcbo in ontario me too unfortunately were outnumbered in this province
canada,not_removed,no shit so are bananas thats called farming actually the old bananas were better they had more flavour than the modern ones have httpsenwikipediaorgwikipanamadisease oh well
canada,not_removed,and then theres bill blair
canada,not_removed,oh fuck
canada,not_removed,but they changed according to how growers cultivated them yes
canada,not_removed,bill blair isnt part of the task force hes an elected member of the government go do your research before you bitch and moan
canada,not_removed,no they were wiped right out and replaced entirely by a totallydifferent banana cultivar the cavendish
canada,not_removed,httpwwwmacleanscapoliticsbillblairaformertopcopinchargeofcanadasmarijuanafile
canada,not_removed,yes and if youd bothered to read the bloody article or pay attention at all youd know that the task force are not government employees bill blair is a parliamentary secretary and not part of the task force
canada,not_removed,youre welcome
canada,not_removed,and this has what to do with canada
canada,not_removed,jew hate cool
canada,not_removed,privilege or success
canada,not_removed,you could at least go the full distance and tell us exactly which jews you think are running it all since thats where this kinda stuff usually leads anyway
canada,not_removed,people still believe the mainstream mediawhat a brainwashed bunch we have become
canada,not_removed,when you think about it the media should be run by less than of the population like any other industry of the population wont be working for it take the auto industry i doubt more than of the population works in the industry
canada,not_removed,oh wow what about the cbc
canada,not_removed,you know the way the people millenials consume media has change hell i listen to podcasts like pi for more thoughtful news than anything on this list
canada,not_removed,when you think about it the media should be run by less than of the population like any other industry of the population wont be working for it take the auto industry i doubt more than of the population works in the industry
canada,not_removed,that colour legend islegendary
canada,not_removed,do you not feel that our own media has been pushing several very specific agendas ones which line up with what were seeing in europe and the us with respect to demographic change all in the name of globalism case in point
canada,not_removed,what
canada,not_removed,how about nepotism and cronyism
canada,not_removed,the names are right there friend id also encourage you to look up the names of any news authors whose articles are pushing for globalism mass migration sjw interests gender dysphoria etc there are a lot of coincidences
canada,not_removed,for generations now a very long game is being played against the people of the free world
canada,not_removed,and thats great a lot of us are utilizing alternate forms of finding news information one of the gifts of the internet and something we need to fight for if it is to maintain its integrity and truth however as im sure you know there are a lot of people who still rely on and trust the mainstream media to provide the truth it may have in the past when they were younger however in the last few decades as you can see from the infographic they have almost all been coopted that is a significant amount of influence on otherwise wellmeaning people and it is not something we can simply disregard
canada,not_removed,any suggestions thanks
canada,not_removed,youre legendary
canada,not_removed,good thing it also points out who the gays are too
canada,not_removed,its an antisemitic infographic of the variety commonly associated with people who identify as altright
canada,not_removed,did you know that ceos in canada are disproportionately white males when compared to the general population is it nepotism or cronyism watch out they are trying to control you lets break free together
canada,not_removed,coincidences like what maybe that educated people from families who have the resources to educate their children tend to favor reasoned policies that involve social equality normalizing socially marginalized groups and policies that benefit society as a whole but are difficult to understand with simplified idealized economic thinking that many believe to be true
canada,not_removed,radio lab wait wait dont tell me bbc news star talk radio this american life
canada,not_removed,hows it antisemitic to list facts about media we all agree is too powerful if it were arabs would you feel the same
canada,not_removed,so that it selects specific to a minority ethnic group are you making the argument that jews are some kind of superior race perhaps even chosen by god as the talmud explicitly states
canada,not_removed,hmm now that you mention it i am circumcised
canada,not_removed,it certainly feels like it and there are many parallels to what led up to if you go back and look into the jewish dominance of banking news media law courts etc what we are seeing is the repetition of a cycle that goes back many hundreds of years
canada,not_removed,oh ok hahaha i was thinking that was really weird
canada,not_removed,well it would probably be easier to mention what isnt antisemitic about it for starters the term goy is a dead giveaway that the writer identifies as altright it means nonjewish white person essentially as a whole this is an attempt to espouse the classic jewish question conspiracy theory its about perceived jewish control of the media
canada,not_removed,perhaps just the first culture that built itself around the importance of education and reasoned debate still enjoys an advantage from their choice
canada,not_removed,glad to help
canada,not_removed,i dont get it hows it conspiracy when in fact they do run major media companies if someone told me all media companies in canada have chinese in charge would that be antichinese or just a piece if important information for people to know
canada,not_removed,thats an affirmation if i ever heard one
canada,not_removed,valuing education and reason isnt a racial trait but a learned one unless you think other races arent capable
canada,not_removed,virtually none of that even touches the racial vs cultural question if had an african culture that selected for intelligence based on the cultural definitions of attractiveness it would likely be a single generation to reach parity meaning its not that anyone is lacking potential but its what you value in mating that makes the difference in outcome
canada,not_removed,im still not hearing anything beyond jews are better because they work together to achieve power couched in flowery distracting language
canada,not_removed,or is it jews have been disproportionately successful due to their disproportionate investment in education and debate as a cultural value
canada,not_removed,then why do we not see this distributed evenly across all possible trades fields etc why is it specific to usury banking legal systems and mass media not just now but all throughout history and always leading up to expulsions pogroms etc
canada,not_removed,because the trades dont reward training in debate but media does negotiation does
canada,not_removed,i mean yeah isnt that how its always worked this just seems to be reaffirming the standard to be reasonable doubt rather than beyond the shadow of a doubt not some sort of new decision by the supreme court like the title makes it sound
canada,not_removed,the high court ruled unanimously that the crown does not have to disprove any other possible explanation for how child pornography ends up on a computer owned by an accused for anyone who knows anything about how computers work and the infinite myriad of ways a file can end up on a digital storage medium this is fucking terrifying other plausible theories or other reasonable possibilities must be based on logic and experience applied to the evidence or the absence of evidence not on speculation so this clarification is good but when a law is so powerful and so pivotal to someones life the threshold for conviction should be higher not lower
canada,not_removed,the lesson here is dont piss off your computer repair guy
canada,not_removed,oh man some people must be looking forward to buying hacking teams incriminating data implanting software right now
canada,not_removed,agreed the headline is pretty clickbaity making it sound like the standards are all of a sudden relaxed or theres anything dramatic in the courts holding for those who want to go straight to the source
canada,not_removed,when i worked at future shop back in the day we received a few computers over the years with kiddy porn on them of them actually had a virus on them that turned them into a relay for kiddie porn the owners were suspicious when their phone bills were suddenly dollars a month and they were calling europe every night yes this was in dial up internet days
canada,not_removed,you do have to look at all the circumstances involved if the images were found in some obscure folder or internet cache you could plausibly argue that you didnt knowingly possess it or even intend to access it in this case a the files were clearly named b were in his itunes c on his computer to which no other person had demonstrable access its the difference between offering a plausible explanation when caught redhanded versus i dunno aliens maybe as a defence on the basis that the crown hasnt disproven that extraterrestrial lifeforms froze time and accessed your computer the crown isnt required to negative every possible explanation and reasonable doubt can exist if theres a competing sensible theory
canada,not_removed,yeah this is pretty fucking terrifying even a false accusation of possession can destroy you life your family and your career it doesnt matter if someone is found innocent
canada,not_removed,its still requiring the prosecutor demonstrate a plausible evidence chain and be able to defend against reasonable objections if you are found to be in possetion of stolen goods and you were an employee of the store that had those goods stolen from the state doesnt need to disprove every possible scenario for you possessing those legally just the likely ones
canada,not_removed,i know everything thats on my computer ive never had anything even remotely resembling cheese pizza on any device ive ever owned i know how to find and get rid of anything that may end up on my computer without my knowledge and i am barely computer literate this isnt scary to me if its scary to you than youre probably some kind of pedophile
canada,not_removed,its huffpo its been basically a tabloid for a few years now
canada,not_removed,the problem here is that even a false accusation will still destroy you and follow you for the rest of your life it doesnt matter if the prosecution fails to convict your life is basically over
canada,not_removed,i know everything thats on my computer ive never had anything even remotely resembling cheese pizza on any device ive ever owned i know how to find and get rid of anything that may end up on my computer without my knowlege and i am barely computer literate the dunningkruger is strong with this one this isnt scary to me if its scary to you than youre probably some kind of pedophile and ad hominem in one comment solid argument there
canada,not_removed,so you know every single image thats in your browser cache right because all it takes is one dickhead posting an image on some site you frequent absolutely invulnerable to malware too if youre barely computer literate its no wonder youre so naive about this sort of thing
canada,not_removed,whatever watch me never get charged delete the browser cache then dipshit
canada,not_removed,deleting doesnt actually remove the data from the hard drive easily recoverable with free software
canada,not_removed,oh honey you should prolly not talk about things you dont know about the grown ups are talking ive seen enough war games where putting pictures on someones hard drive is a win to know that this is terrifying
canada,not_removed,its off to a slow start but feel free to add to it because you never know when youll need to know where an aed is located
canada,not_removed,first aid attendant at work trained on them amazing devices i hope to hell i never have a need to use it
canada,not_removed,i believe the idea behind it or at least the part around why it might pay for itself is because the people who would qualify for it lower income people who travel less and likely dont have homeslives outside the country to stash extra money would likely spend of their income in the country thus contributing both to local businesses and local municipal provincial and federal taxes whether or not this is the case i dont know but i would like to believe it would be self sustaining to a certain extent better than propping up large corporations that can just take that money and use it outside the country which does not benefit canada at all
canada,not_removed,canada isnt broke the country is running a deficit but thats not the same thing
canada,not_removed,as a primer and also only new mothers and teenagers worked substantially less mothers with newborns stopped working because they wanted to stay at home longer with their babies and teenagers worked less because they werent under as much pressure to support their families which resulted in more teenagers graduating in addition those who continued to work were given more opportunities to choose what type of work they did forget found that in the period that mincome was administered hospital visits dropped percent with fewer incidents of workrelated injuries and fewer emergency room visits from car accidents and domestic abuse additionally the period saw a reduction in rates of psychiatric hospitalization and in the number of mental illnessrelated consultations with health professionals httpsenwikipediaorgwikimincome with links to the report by evelyn forget important while it was a notable experiment and relevant to bi discussions mincome basic income for more info on basic income check httpswwwredditcomrbasicincomewikiindex very good resource or visit rbasicincomecanada
canada,not_removed,hey friend ive been working with basic income canada for a few years and maybe i can help i think ive got a pretty convincing argument for why the basic income is not only affordable but wed have to be totally thick not to go for it one of the main things to remember is that it costs us lots of money to maintain poverty policing emergency care shelters social workers and food banks are not free and all together blow the cost of eliminating poverty out of the water a few examples to give you an idea how true this is across the board many states have already shown that it is vastly cheaper to house homeless people then keep them homeless the canada food bank has stated that it would be cheaper to just give poor people money directly the canadian medical association has stated that the leading cause of medical issues is poverty httpswwwcmacaassetsassetslibrarydocumentfradvocacywhatmakesussickenpdf and all of this is before we add in the idea of eliminating redundant programs and folding them all into the basic income so its important to remember it is costing us more to maintain poverty then it would to eliminate it the evidence shows it and the experts say it the question now is not one of affordability but will
canada,not_removed,easy just print more money
canada,not_removed,follow up question i may not have been paying attention but what would that minimum income be in dollars
canada,not_removed,its basically an inheritance for the work your ancestors did building the economy its meant to make up for the effects of interest on buying power they tried it in alberta look up social credit
canada,not_removed,tldr free shit bruh
canada,not_removed,basic income is meant as a way to deal with automation basically as production becomes automated people lose their jobs and thus stop making money but this also means that these people cant buy what is being produced so the product of automation cant be sold to anyone basic income fixes this basically automation combined with basic income is meant to bring an emancipated of the population allowing it to pursue other goals and careers basic income without automation is a disaster waiting to happen however look at venezuela i covered that in this post
canada,not_removed,what if we pay people to manage their own government supplied money and if they dont spend much of it on services they get a bonus at the end of the year
canada,not_removed,if you spend more money than you have i wouldnt consider you doing well
canada,not_removed,poverty hasnt even really begun costing us not at all that is going to look like chump change when automation and ai destroy hundred of thousands and possibly millions of jobs the absolutely realistic near future involves massive numbers of people who have no real utility in this world they still need to eat and still need a place to sleep its a problem frankly i think the biggest challenge is not going to be providing them a basic income ie they can eat healthy enough food and sleep safely enough they can have clothing and toiletries and cookware and stuff its going to be keeping them from rioting out of boredom
canada,not_removed,the problem is that that doesnt actually explain how you afford it it just says that poor people are bad mmmkay
canada,not_removed,gee a left wing website supports basic income what a shock
canada,not_removed,its really hard to cite mincome from the with a straight face this is a town that was provincially and ultimately federally backed the participants knew the experiment was going to end and it wasnt done long enough in reality you need a federal roll out for at least generations to have an effective study
canada,not_removed,i kinda feel bad for evelyn when asked for her first and last name she basically would be saying in broken english that she forgot
canada,not_removed,it would increase every year but who knows what they would start at
canada,not_removed,it would be about enough money to keep someone fed and housed but not much more if we used the the mincome experiment to estimate this a minimum income might look like this how mincome cheques were calculated everyone was given the same base amount per cent of statistics canadas lowincome cutoff the cutoff varied depending on family size and where they lived but in a single canadian who was considered lowincome earned on average dollars individual family of two dollars individual family of two base amount was modified cents was subtracted from every dollar earned from other income sources
canada,not_removed,are you actually saying that the collapse of venezuela is the result of automation venezuelas problem is the result of unmitigated socialism
canada,not_removed,then there would be an incentive to underfund government services including essential services
canada,not_removed,the economic model that best represents the movie human centipede is trickledown economics for obvious fucking reasons
canada,not_removed,how does that strike you as human centipedeesque but a large corporation taking all the money and shitting on everyone doesnt
canada,not_removed,i hear you but this really doesnt apply on a national scale
canada,not_removed,it really depends on the context for a country deficit spending can be a positive thing for the economy as a lot of government spending feeds back into the country in some form so cutting spending in attempt to balance the budget can lead to a weakened national economy which leads to a decrease in tax revenue which gives you a deficit on a now reduced budget also when the interest on government debt is low running a deficit with an eye on growth can be the best thing to do in the long term thats not always going to be true but the point is that a country having a budget deficit can be the preferable course in some cases
canada,not_removed,ever bought a house
canada,not_removed,mfw loans arent a thing
canada,not_removed,depends on what youre spending it on not that i agree with the jt budget not all deficits are bad things tm
canada,not_removed,if you spend more money than you have i wouldnt consider you doing well you didnt even take econ you
canada,not_removed,can someone give a good argument for basic income without bringing up a futuristic star trek world
canada,not_removed,according to estimates of jobs in canada will be automated in two decades needless to say in the not so long term its millions of jobs that will be cut that also doesnt include outsourcing which will more than likely continue to rise
canada,not_removed,people that are not required are usually killed expect a war of depopulation in our lifetime
canada,not_removed,millions of jobs in no time soon will automation cost us millions of jobs
canada,not_removed,if everyone gets the money no matter what there isnt much to manage no more filling out and processing ei applications no more checkups and reports no more regional offices the list goes on all that money spent on those things can then be distributed directly to people for them to spend
canada,not_removed,mincome is in fact easy to reference with a straight face in basic income discussion it ran for five years and has plenty of examples of what something like bi might do for society if implemented of course if you have a better study on an actual case where something like basic income was tried out id gladly read that link
canada,not_removed,and this is why economics is such a contested science you cant exactly do controlled experiments in many cases youd need a scifi setup with boxed in isolated districts all over the planet running different systems shit someone should make that a movie
canada,not_removed,i feel like its probably pronounced forjay
canada,not_removed,american
canada,not_removed,no the collapse of venezuela is the result of people not working
canada,not_removed,until it does all at once a la the wienmar republic greece zimbabwe and vietnam
canada,not_removed,clearly you havent because mortgages have an end date this government has no plans to ever pay off our debts
canada,not_removed,heres the argument weve already gotten to the point as a society where we arent willing to let people starve to death die in the streets die of lack of medical care etc its not going to happen what is happening is that we arent willing to just properly support people by offering a baseline standard of living preferring more expensive solutions that feel better because they dont allow people to freeload it costs more to keep people on the streets in the form of enforcement increased healthcare costs public safety issues property damage and the like than it would to just house and feed everyone further housing and feeding everyone would mean fewer people end up in the horrible poverty trap of addiction mental illness and homelessness and more people would end up just being productive members of society the absolute cost of letting people be poor is nothing compared to the opportunity cost so if we accept that we arent going to just let people die from lack of ability to pay we arent and we can show that its cheaper and better to just set a baseline standard of living we can then basic income is one way to set that standard its probably the simplest way to do so since the other way would involve a total overhaul of the welfare system including reams of new policy and probably thousands more administrators and even then it probably wouldnt be anymore effective than just letting people spend money the way they choose to spend it history shows that theyll likely spend it on things like shelter and food because without those things life is shitty its not a star trek reality its just all of us getting our heads out of our asses and recognizing that we as a country are rich as fuck and have long since passed the point where we can easily feed and house our population as well as reap the benefits of doing so
canada,not_removed,having a guarantee to allow for people to sustain themselves without having to stave or be put onto the street this would effectively merge ei and welfare should there be work people could simply opt to make more by having a job this would essentially create no lack of need not to work as minimum income would be received regardless of current job status nbsp additionallyit all depends on how much were willing to provide per citizen should a star trek era dawn on us that would remove the need for human interaction or should we burden gdp output simply by involving people we could simply increase how much individuals get with basic income
canada,not_removed,its not futuristic its the past this has already begun its been happening for years according to the american trucker association there are million professional truck drivers in the us and an additional million people employed within the truckdriving industry who dont drive the trucks thats million truckingrelated jobs we cant stop there though because the incomes received by these million people create the jobs of others those million truck drivers driving all over the country stop regularly to eat drink rest and sleep entire businesses have been built around serving their wants and needs think restaurants and motels as just two examples so now were talking about millions more whose employment depends on the employment of truck drivers but we still cant even stop there because all those people are consumers in their own local economy httpwwwfinancialpostcommwpbloghtmlbbusinessfinancialpostcomnewsenergyhowcanadasoilsandsarepavingthewayfordriverlesstrucksandthethreatofbiglayoffs for suncors roughly heavyhaul truck operators however the prospect of driverless trucks has raised more immediate fears of significant job losses that will take people off our site cowan said of the trucks at an average salary of per person you can see the savings were going to get from an operations perspective and then the company has been rolling out the automated vehicles for the past three years three years this is not futuristic star trek this is the past
canada,not_removed,well to be fair job losses due to automation has been a thing for quite some time now and are on the rise all you have to do to see machines that replaced humans is type how its made into youtube beyond that humans need not apply by cgp grey is a good watch on the subject of automation and technological unemployment
canada,not_removed,no people will cry about social assistance and support for those who dont have money but cutting them a check isnt going to solve their life problems just have to look up north at the reserves to see that
canada,not_removed,no
canada,not_removed,it already has
canada,not_removed,wow and people thought that technology would free us lol but it has freed us the reason we dont need so many people to work is because weve become so efficient at doing the things that really need doing basically we can be fed and sheltered at next to no cost for example other than maintenance and energy source costs automated potato and dairy farming is going to give us buttered potatoes at essentially no cost it isnt the most varied of diets but you wont starve to death on it the movement of labour has always been toward concentration and specialization farming once required a tribes worth of people busting their ass to turn over a field for planting and then we used oxen and so it only took a couple people to turn over a villages crop and then we used tractors and those two people now feed ten million people and next well use technology and no one will need to work to get fed we are being freed the problem is we dont know what to do with freedom i think a lot of people are going to be useless lumps i think a lot of people will be free to be creative and are going to produce astonishing unexpected and extremely valuable things i think a lot of people will be free to learn and are going to use that knowledge to produce new technologies new solutions or come up with inspiring new ideas when youve got unlimited buttered potatoes your dreams become attainable
canada,not_removed,i think youre missing the point entirely our economy doesnt run on money it runs on goods and services and is driven by consumption of those goods and services money is just a tool we use to facilitate trade with machines doing the actual work of providing the goods and services we consume humans have more time to spend doing what they want to do consuming things in the process and keeping business profitable and the machines working the problem is with distribution of the goods and services created by mechanical labour if the people who lost their jobs to machines lose all of their income they wont be able to consume which is what would cause economic collapse one solution is to provide a guaranteed income that way everyone is guaranteed to remain a consumer driving economic demand which of course would be met by machines
canada,not_removed,i understand your concerns for a lack of educated people but education is unlikely to leave this century as it being taught now nbsp virtually reality will allow for ° pre recorded speeches allowing universities and educators alike to make tailored and engaging learning processes engaging education will let people to get involved that otherwise wouldnt have wanted to invest in a degree and allow for people to learn what they want to at their own pace nbsp canada could have world class educators in those fields teaching providing unprecedented cost efficiency and education to everyone of all ages nbsp the future of education is bright when you can teach a person from kindergarten to university for the cost of a gaming rig and headset in comparison to the costs associated with the infrastructure and the staff to operate these facilities
canada,not_removed,lets use my current economic situation as an example i work hour weeks and make about per year i can feed and clothe myself barely i can pay rent and bills barely and i can put gas in a truck that i dont even own occasionally i havent accrued any significant savings in the past three years and in fact i currently have about in debt my bank account says like so im the generally accepted minimum income seems to be about which is great if you are a single parent and you need to stay at home with your kid but i mean im an unmarried dude and i can barely make my ends meet granted that there are probably a lot of financial inefficiencies rampant in my life that i have been thus far unable to remedy as it is if i didnt have to work and i could just recieve i would probably still work or more likely i would put time in to get a degree i like to pretend im pretty smart a student etc so i could probably do pretty well with an education even in a world with a microscopic job market so that hopefully i could get a job that pays more and is significantly more satisfying than the bullshit im currently employed doing and im basically the laziest motherfucker that i know there wont be people just dropping out of the work force because people cant afford to ive been down around the make per year like a filthy beggar zone too and it is not a lifestyle to be envied or to dream about people will still work except for the people who specifically cant work due to lack of skills or because of medical or family reasons and instead of starving on welfare etc theyll have enough money to survive which they will then inject into the economy and so forth when you say huge debt youre probably not thinking of the same canada im thinking of my sister has a masters degree she paid for by herself and shes in her with no debt couple this with the fact that you could now be a student focus on your education and pay for it and housing with that basic income or whatever of i dont know why that number is the magic number but it seems to be the one everyone is throwing around so imma keep using it
canada,not_removed,aha porn and pot the sticky situation solves itself
canada,not_removed,they will definitely still have some sort of regional offices someone has to know who to give the money to and where to put it granted the cost of managing would be reduced but to say there wouldnt be any would be disingenuous
canada,not_removed,mincome in the had problems if i gave you cash each month and told you in years this cash will stop youre more motivated to do something with it that is productive if i tell you i will give you cash each month for the rest of time then there is no rushpressure to use it wisely
canada,not_removed,just run the math the reason we means test social programs is because otherwise the costs would be enormous
canada,not_removed,i sincerely hope so as i can see her name being used for insults when she was younger
canada,not_removed,i know people with the last name forget its more like forjet but with that fancy french j sound it still has the t sound
canada,not_removed,not working not having the opportunity to work
canada,not_removed,exactly
canada,not_removed,those countries did run deficits youre right with that however canada has a much better economic presence than those countries that you listed we are running a controlled deficit to more or less jump start our economy not just spiraling into uncontrollable debt
canada,not_removed,my parents voiced the idea to me that even if all of what you said in the above were true there will always be people who work less because of the increased work flow and of course those who wont work at all i tried to explain to them that it just doesnt matter those who work less are freeing up time to spend with their families or spend time on something they enjoy making things maybe hobbies but how do you answer the obvious one that some people are just going to free load you cant just ignore that some of us can sure but most people hate that a lot i said welfare gets abused anyways but what do you figure
canada,not_removed,do you think throwing a lump sum of money at people who have never had money beforedont have proper financial educations is suddenly going to solve their problems it wont history has shown that time and time again
canada,not_removed,the problem is ubi is costed joke as being a replacement for all social programs so you have to throw housing medical benefits utilities assistance etc in there when you multiply through the of rate payers in canada you end up with north of in new expenses even if you subtract out the or so we spend now on social programs its still a huge fucking burden on the middle class
canada,not_removed,they are using automated trucks in mines yes but they drive along a very set path same with other automated vehicles they are operating in a very limited fashion its not something that will be upon us in a year or two and when it does come along i can see there being a lot of resistance to adopting it people not trusting computers to drive them around and such
canada,not_removed,except thats always been the case its not new
canada,not_removed,found the guy who read the martian
canada,not_removed,he said there isnt much to manage he did not say there would be nothing your comment actually agrees with him
canada,not_removed,if i show you a study that was actually carried out and facts collected on that study than we can discuss facts as lovely as your lets guess peoples motivations thought experiment is you havent presented any facts if you have a better study on an actual case where something like basic income was tried out id gladly read that link
canada,not_removed,the start of a spiral seems like a nice controlled circle yes
canada,not_removed,ive found that most people that think along the lines of well some people will just take the money and not work wont accept any reasoning that will make it seem worth it to them ive also noticed that most of those people have never been in a position where a universal income would actually apply or help them the best solution i have found is to try to relate it as best you can to them
canada,not_removed,freeloading is awesome for me because my skills will be more in demand by employers and i will earn a better wage idc if i have to pay more taxes because the current state of getting a job sucks and im willing to pay more taxes to get people who dont want to be in their jobcareer out so i can take there place i think mincome will turn canada from a labor surplus market to a labor shortage market which is good for me
canada,not_removed,poors laws no one should be allowed to leave school without understanding that case study
canada,not_removed,what if it was a daily allowance people could save it up for large purchases but would always get their daily perdium they couldnt spend it all on the first day or whatever
canada,not_removed,do you think throwing a lump sum of money at people who have never had money beforedont have proper financial educations is suddenly going to solve their problems what it worked with the indians s it wont history has shown that time and time again oh you brought that up well played
canada,not_removed,oh thats a good point i cant believe no one ever thought of that before
canada,not_removed,ha the computers are already driving better than humans do i dont know what rock youve been living under but this is happening now not in years
canada,not_removed,i guess you missed the parts where google self driving cars have logged millions of miles already dealing with human traffic both on the highway and in the city or the fact that self driving trucks are on the road with human traffic in nevada and have been for some time that is to say a lot of self driving vehicles that do not follow a set path and this is just trucks its not even the other kinds of automaton from manufacturing to mcdonalds nor do you comment on how this is going to destroy the economy
canada,not_removed,not on this scale
canada,not_removed,if youre struggling with the concept that httpsenwikipediaorgwikieconomy runs on httpsenwikipediaorgwikigoodsandservices you may want to learn what httpsenwikipediaorgwikigrossdomesticproduct is
canada,not_removed,you showed a study but youre trying to draw some conclusions from it science doesnt work that way all the study proves is that in a tiny community if you tell people the well will dry up in a few years they will overall use the money for good but the town was funded by the province the province by the feds and the study only ran for a short period of time from this youre stating that mincome for people forever is a good idea that doesnt follow
canada,not_removed,weve run many deficits before to kickstart the economy generally the cycle goes economic boom recession deficit growth economic boom that is a very simplified version of what our economic cycle looks like but to dismiss myself and other users by acting entitled or elitist especially when we are trying to help you and have constructive discussion doesnt help anyone and turns comment sections into bias half informed fear mongering left or right wing opinion pieces
canada,not_removed,not to be dryly sarcastic but skills at what freeloading what is so desirable about you if you have no experience at all regardless of how talented you are
canada,not_removed,care to provide a link for those of us that never encountered this study and want to learn
canada,not_removed,aside from that administrative nightmare that would inevitably be i think handing people a day per diems would increase the likelihood of them using it for stupid purchases people dont save now and they have to work hard for that money they arent going to save money that is just being given to them
canada,not_removed,and yet here you are somehow ignoring all of the evidence that lies in your face and saying that minicome is going to solve the issues with the poor
canada,not_removed,i guess i better quit my job now and just wait for automation to fill my every need
canada,not_removed,um ya look at textiles for instance
canada,not_removed,what is your alternative
canada,not_removed,you showed a study but youre trying to draw some conclusions from it science doesnt work that way if this study isnt good enough show me a better one
canada,not_removed,help me proponents of this are literally trying to rob me and you dare call me entitled youre scum
canada,not_removed,point is that if others in their field quit working their work will become more valued
canada,not_removed,im a licensed power engineer if more people enjoy leisure hours and less work through this basic income program id imagine there would be more chances for employment sorry my post was a bit confusing after reading it its hard to get entry level experience and there are a lot of people that would rather freeload as your post suggests i rather not compete against them
canada,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikienglishpoorlaws it was a system of social relief in england over several centuries a lot of our thoughts on social social support policies are informed on these experiences the ultimate challenge with poor laws was human macroeconomic behaviour population would migrate from one jurisdiction to another over periods of time to maximise benefit this resulted in huge amounts of effort in later years to standardize benefit across boroughs which then led poor migrating to neighorhoods which had the lowest cost of living to gain the most economic benefit from their assistance an explanation of the problem in a microcosm is provided here the implementation of the poor law
canada,not_removed,not to be that guy but neither of us has offered any evidence right now this is just a wet noodle fight between two people who have opinions
canada,not_removed,yeah im sure theres robots to dig your grave for you s
canada,not_removed,industrial revolution people thought machines would be the end of a human work force even then guess what it created different jobs for humans to do
canada,not_removed,ha but hes right gdp is converted to a common denominator we could easily replace it with water or barrels of oil but a fictional form of money is easier to manage because it isnt a physical resource that has its own elasticity
canada,not_removed,logic doesnt work that way either
canada,not_removed,proponents of this are literally trying to rob me yeah there definitely wont be a productive discussion from here on out maybe tone down the absurdity
canada,not_removed,ah i get ya now wasnt catching the emphasis that is lost in text not your fault after reading this reply your original one makes a bit more sense one thing i want to point out is that what the government found back when they did the original test in manitoba was that the results were wildly different from peoples expectations that is that people would just freeload what the case turned out to be though was that while a minority even among other minorities would actually just freeload many others used the extra income to their own benefit that would mean that mothers would be able to make more money if they wished or spend more time at home which was often the case or teenagers who should be staying in school would actually do so of course as put briefly already some people would actually just freeload but those people who did were only people who already were andor intended to and never intended to ever do otherwise in the first place in other words the only ones who are going to be true freeloaders are the lost causes everyone else who might are people who might be using this to help them find time to further themselves in other ways maybe financially possibly spiritually or even to spend time with family those kinds of things that pretty much everyone agrees that we all need more time for
canada,not_removed,kinda my point
canada,not_removed,it largely was the end of physical work as a percentage of the workforce this is now happening in the services industry essentially we have used machines to replace physical muscle we are now using them to replace mental muscle which leaves us with
canada,not_removed,im mainly concerned that so many have embraced this idea so quickly there has been very little analysis as to the downside of a minimum income this is not new not quick the idea has been floating around since the industrial revolution the first concrete experiment was over years ago if were so flush with cash as a country and a government why dont we consider giving some bright people some interestfree loans to start businesses it would create good jobs wealth and productivity thats another way forward what jobs how many what guarantee is there that these bright people will go against conventional wisdom because thats the problem conventional wisdom says reduce your costs replacing a worker with a machine that has no breaks no family no sleep no complaints no salary and no benefits that saves you a lot of money and these bright young minds will do that its fucking moronic otherwise its already happening httpwwwfinancialpostcommwpbloghtmlbbusinessfinancialpostcomnewsenergyhowcanadasoilsandsarepavingthewayfordriverlesstrucksandthethreatofbiglayoffs for suncors roughly heavyhaul truck operators however the prospect of driverless trucks has raised more immediate fears of significant job losses that will take people off our site cowan said of the trucks at an average salary of per person you can see the savings were going to get from an operations perspective that is what bright minds are coming up with and the effects theyre having so what jobs are these people going to come up with also this plan is revenue neutral its paid for by scrapping the overhead associated with all the other programs it replaces like cpp and oas
canada,not_removed,i am fully aware that the mincome study is an imperfect representation of basic income partly because it was not a basic income program some conclusions can be drawn from it within the limitations of the scope of experiment if you are aware of a study with fewer flaws that is a better representation of basic income you have every opportunity to present it if you do not have better information than logically we would work with what we have until new information added to our pool of knowledge
canada,not_removed,the only absurdity is me working to pay for those that dont
canada,not_removed,then we just need a few world wars to thin out the working population
canada,not_removed,so mcdonalds uses kiosks now and modern machines still cant reliably replace humans in a lot of different jobs
canada,not_removed,k
canada,not_removed,i wonder who really wrote that article for mrs wente
canada,not_removed,loveinmaggie dear your age is showing youre using hippie language from the sixties its about time the globe and mail sourced a millenial and dumped this out of touch shill for everything richoldpeopleholddear
canada,not_removed,no constructive criticism just naysaying
canada,not_removed,what could possibly go wrong we could listen to some hack and do nothing
canada,not_removed,we get it she got caught plagiarizing she is a pretty shitty columnist now can we get back to discussing the content of the article itself rather than having this be the top comment in every thread its an interesting topic to discuss
canada,not_removed,its more about who didnt a newfoundlander herself
canada,not_removed,the globe panders to older demographic they do need to ditch their baby boomers and replace em with gen x though
canada,not_removed,you think she wants to do anything besides burn the country down she is far gone
canada,not_removed,full decision
canada,not_removed,this is ridiculous the lawyers pushing this garbage and the judges ruling in their favour should be subject to a taste of the lash because any idiot that has been paying attention knows the supreme court has already ruled on a parallel case involving trinity westernand the university won in an eight to one decision trinity western university is a private university with a christianbased curriculum the university started a teachers training program and applied to the british columbia college of teachers for the proper certification the college rejected trinity western on account that the schools policy that prohibited homosexual behaviour violated the colleges antidiscrimination policy in an eight to one decision the court held that the college was wrong in rejecting trinity western on the basis of discrimination the court concurred with the lower provincial courts stating that there was no basis for the bccts decision httpsenwikipediaorgwikitrinitywesternuniversityvbritishcolumbiacollegeofteachers
canada,not_removed,yes but that ruling was years ago and both case law and statutory law have moved in that time it predates school district no north vancouver v jubran the corren case the civil marriage act etc it also predates all current justices except mclachlin i wouldnt count on getting the same ruling now
canada,not_removed,years is hardly much time at all in the common law plus twu has been upheld numerous times since then as well if the civil marriages act was binding its not its federal then it has a provision that says you cant withhold a privilege or benefit just because a person or entity like twu holds a belief in traditional marriage
canada,not_removed,well imho if the scoc does not defend religious freedom in this case they have proven themselves totally counterproductive i have to say i would not be surprised
canada,not_removed,blaney just assumes that all asians living in canada are immigrants its almost like the conservative are trying to drive away fiscal conservatives
canada,not_removed,generation of immigrants from two different nations successfully positioning themselves in canadian society in political corporate academic or other roles is a model of integration hes entirely correct
canada,not_removed,somedays people ask me what country do i come from each time i say canada people arent being offensive on purpose but still it can be annoying to many for example many chinese people in calgary are actually generation canadians and the prairies many chinese families are older or as old as the town itself
canada,not_removed,its these issues that make them unelectable i have no choice but to vote lpc until the socreds get tossed or ignored
canada,not_removed,was a great series too bad it had a short run
canada,not_removed,oh yeah havent seen this in a while
canada,not_removed,no we dont blatch is not worth reading
canada,not_removed,this is atleast years old
canada,not_removed,ahh mr mandela a true statesman
canada,not_removed,the falls were loud that day so loud you couldnt damn well hear yourself think that summer had been cold and the autumn colder still his mind wandered to a happier time hed once taken a vacation a family vacation to canada niagara falls had been their first stop the falls tumbling down and down until the water below churned like so much laundry in a tub standing at the railing the sound came again his thoughts thoughts of the happy past crashed to a halt mr freeman can we take a selfie why yes of course and how are you today the falls crashed dark and cold strong and mean they always had
canada,not_removed,it would seem even the rich and famous are tricked into drinking shitty beer for free swag
canada,not_removed,also the maid of the mist is not on the canadian side
canada,not_removed,i loved him in pulp fiction
canada,not_removed,it does go through the canadian side though maybe worded wrong but might have been implying he met morgan freeman when they were going through the canadian side not that its from there
canada,not_removed,youre a russian im a russian were all russians
canada,not_removed,wonderful president putin would nyever do such thing
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,the radicalized right has been weaponized by russia so they dont really need bots they have white nationalists working for them for free
canada,not_removed,perhaps when the russian people realize their leaders have stolen all their money while they sleep in corpse of donkey
canada,not_removed,is the rebel banned on rcanada if so we have to start taking a long hard look at vice if we are trying to have as unbiased news as possible
canada,not_removed,vice uses the terms facing heat and under fire even though it only references a single prof at u of t who is upset by his comments while a shitstorm is likely to happen soon it appears vice wants to drive the narrative rather than report on it
canada,not_removed,i havent read it yet but i can just imagine how vice will spin this story to make the professor look like an evil homophobic trumplike bigot what utter garbage vice news has become shame because i used to like their documentaries
canada,not_removed,he isnt under fire he is being celebrated for standing up to this crap
canada,not_removed,i agree with this either everything is free game or ditch both extremes unfortunately i think cbc would go right along with vice and thats like half our postings
canada,not_removed,another article vice article is slanted httpnewsnationalpostcomnewscanadauoftprofessorattackspoliticalcorrectnessinvideorefusestousegenderlesspronouns
canada,not_removed,even a few years back a lot of their news coverage was the shit other people wouldnt touch that was usually pretty interesting now its like the hire ever sjw journalist that just finished school
canada,not_removed,cbc would go right along with vice oh get real they are not even remotely comparable
canada,not_removed,cbc has been absolute garbage the last few months
canada,not_removed,free wifi in tim hortons
canada,not_removed,people are people not brands please dont buzzfeedify our political system
canada,not_removed,branding trudeau is a great idea the brand should read liar and be heated until redhot before being pressed into his flesh
canada,not_removed,brand has already been undermined by the sale of weapons to saudi arabia
canada,not_removed,its been more than a year since your guy lost not to be rude but get over it already
canada,not_removed,calm down grandpa
canada,not_removed,quebec police often wait to release names until people are formally charged if only people on reddit last night could understand that but then again a lot of the people jumping to conclusions were probably american judging by their post history
canada,not_removed,great article not sure why its being downvoted
canada,not_removed,there must have been dozens of people who said that last night thankfully for every person who invoked coulters law and made things up there was somebody saying theyre still investigating hold your horses
canada,not_removed,thedonalds have been focusing their attention on canada a bit more lately for sure it was to be expected
canada,not_removed,likely because the article itself is using a tragedy to push a political agenda cbc is all over using this to connect trump his policies and his supporters to terrorism and white supremacist theyre painting everyone with a broad brush in an attempt to alienate and isolate them its a little hypocritical if it had of been obvious from the start the shooter was some white kid the media would have been tripping over themselves to plaster his facename everywhere as they did the second it was confirmed there was only one shooter and the other person in custody was a witness when they thought there were two shooters they pulled bs lines like cbc doesnt release names until the accused are brought to court which is why people were citing coulters law well its interesting that cbc is using the guys name now but hes not in court yet and people are cherry picking and speculating things about him based on his rightwing facebook likes when he had a pretty wide range of left wing likes as well including the ndp and feminist groups when something doesnt fit the cbcs preferred narrative or the narrative on the left in general the media holds the facts until its undeniable and theyre the only ones not reporting it if something does fit their agenda they dont even hesitate to put potentially false information out im not saying the right and the rights media doesnt do this as well note im not a conservative or a trump supporter im a liberal that clearly sees flaws on the left and the liberal media and thinks its more defusing to point it out rather than rationalize and excuse it were in the mess were in because its easier to point fingers at our political opponents and saddle them with all the blame which in turn causes them to push back equally as hard we need to start looking at what we are doing and how we can fix our behaviour first and stop pretending our political allies can do no wrong while alienating people we disagree with which only causes them to do the same
canada,not_removed,the evolution of the posts from the altright coulters law i got ten bucks says it was a muslim see mohamed time to deport all the muslims then they got really quiet after that for reasons i cant possibly comprehend
canada,not_removed,lighten up snowflake youre beginning to see altright everywhere being antiislam or even antiimmigration does not mean altright do your homework and look things up before calling people racists nazis or altright
canada,not_removed,im pretty sure what i saw last night was a whole lot of people jumping on an antimuslim racist bandwagon sorry i triggered you
canada,not_removed,if you call everyone that disagree with immigration policies or islam racists and nazis or altright youre either misinformed which can be helped by doing proper research and educating yourself or stupid which is harder to find a solution for its as stupid as saying that all the left is communist or causing a white genocide and only serves as shutting down any possible discussion there were two bandwagons last night and both were trains leading to nowhere
canada,not_removed,so please show me where i said those things or are you just drawing assumptions since i used the term altright or were all those people jumping on the name mohamed last night just misunderstood little angels just trying to protect their culture
canada,not_removed,yeah i jumped to that conclusion because you used the term altright and tried to blame only one side of the argument when both sides behaved like school kids were both guilty of jumping to conclusions i guess just like many did last night on both sides
canada,not_removed,the article didnt expressly mention but where is the toxicity of the ash coming from burned out homes or it naturally occurring
canada,not_removed,will the rcmp break in and steal everyones guns like they did during calgary floods years ago
canada,not_removed,the rcmp already said they have not entered any homes
canada,not_removed,no liberals in fort mac
canada,not_removed,election year
canada,not_removed,another great move by wynne she keeps this up an shell have an impressive record to run on for the next election the conservatives are walking into another disaster
canada,not_removed,unless i am misunderstanding the article this change is actually a good one liberals are trying to fully ban mpps from political fundraising events under the cashforaccess system – first reported by the globe and mail in february two weeks after kathleen wynne was sworn in as premier – corporate executives union leaders and lobbyists paid up to apiece for private time with ms wynne and members of her cabinet typically over cocktails and dinner attendees included companies that are affected by government policy and contracting decisions as this is basically bribery and all too close to the shenanigans that goes on in the us the less of this activity going on in politics the better when the house resumes in september we will be introducing an amendment to ban fundraising events for all mpps mr naqvi said in the statement while political parties would still be allowed to seek contributions under the new rules the statement said politicians would be prohibited from attending events to raise money –
canada,not_removed,nope read the comments about brown still plenty of folks grabbing their ankles for the beloved olp
canada,not_removed,why because shes fighting for ontarians retirement security minimum income stopping cashforaccess by mpps free tuition for lowincome students the fucking nerve people hate that
canada,not_removed,liberals are trying to fully ban mpps from political fundraising events were the about face is that they are going to continue to allow them
canada,not_removed,dude fuck the olp no way in hell they win the next election the fact wynne isnt behind bars is unfathomable
canada,not_removed,sorry i will never vote for a social conservative like brown so its ndp or strategic voting
canada,not_removed,why because shes fighting for ontarians retirement security theres no retirement security here it was a cash grab where ontario would be positive for a long time as dues would pay more than we pay out in benefits its just an attempt to balance their budget minimum income the new cpi attached minimum wage is actually pretty bad on both sides its bad for those working minimum wage because minimum wage increases historically beat cpi so its actually worse flipside the new measureable cost of minimum wage will kill jobs stopping cashforaccess by mpps youre confused about the article they were going to ban this they have no aboutfaced which means its now allowed free tuition for lowincome students her recent change was actually nothing the systems were already in place doing exactly what she claimed success over unfortunately the huge debt means we cant afford to actually pay anything to students
canada,not_removed,you cant be serious gas plant ehealth ornge bribing teachers smart meters wind power sudbury byelection and on and on and on oh and the orpp was heavy handed extortion to help trudeau get elected
canada,not_removed,ontarios liberal government is promising to ban provincial politicians from attending fundraising events – a dramatic policy uturn designed to contain a cashforaccess scandal roiling queens park in a surprise statement on monday afternoon government house leader yasir naqvi pledged to amend bill a package of campaignfinance reforms making its way through the legislature to bar mpps from going to fundraisers the about face was that they currently allow them
canada,not_removed,i dont know yo the bc liberals are still probably gonna get voted in again next year even after the hst fiasco and the real estate crisis you just never know man
canada,not_removed,with you the comments baffle me i hope theyre not old enough to vote
canada,not_removed,youre confused about the article they were going to ban this they have no aboutfaced which means its now allowed no read the article
canada,not_removed,the opposition was going to cancel the plants who cares about the plants half those scandals are just banal bureaucratic fuckups youd see with any party in charge not sure what bribing teachers involves
canada,not_removed,youre very confused there was a vow to ban them which was good they needed to do this their bill to do it months ago failed to actually fix the problem their new aboutface is that they are giving up on blocking it
canada,not_removed,not sure what bribing teachers involves something i wrote on the matter there are few extra thoughts extraneous to the bribes when it happened for your reading pleasure after i wrote this the governments handling it was such a sight to see their story changed daily was utter and complete ridiculousness and in all honesty with the answers she gave during qp i dont know how liz sandals kept her job ok a few thoughts this is in response to the news that the ontario government our lovely ms wynne and liz sandals brain trust secretly paid unions money for their negotiation costs please see link to story its a complete and utter clownshow paid for by our tax dollars when i was in elementary school grade i can remember teachers indoctrinating us students about the evil mike harris and the evil conservatives that this went on in my school in canada is absolutely disgusting ask anyone my age about harris and the conservatives and they all instinctively think he was the devil i wonder why now we are in our and voting scary thought as im guessing most of them were indoctrinated well this is a refundpayment for the money the unions spent campaigning for the libs borderline illegal in my books par for the course for wynnes libs the levels they will stoop to this was all done thinking that these deals would never leak what other deals have we not been privied to hey what a fantastic question to be asked by patrick brown the money used to pay for teacher raises was taken out a program that was set up to help struggling students stay in school liz sandals claims it is not needed as it was successful im sorry how can something like this be successful to the point where it is not needed there are struggling students every year until the end of time another dodge that makes no sense the woman is incompetent it was never about the kids unions have become so powerful in this province that we may never see another nonliberal government until bankruptcy they all are ordered to vote and are told who to vote for in work for the government throw in their spouse and the number is only of the total population votes we are completely held hostage by this i am in complete awe of the path this province has taken the lack of accountability the collective heads up rear ends and the lemming uninformed voter churchill was right the best argument against democracy is spending minutes with the average voter we are soon coming to that point the inevitable conclusion to socialism they are running out of other peoples money slightly off topic may post about separately but wynne introduces a pension plan tax for ontarians that most disagree with will invest in infrastructure with no explanation on how money is paid back clearly a terrible idea then she says vote for trudeau and i might take the orpp of the table how is this extortion not realized blatant and heavy handed we are ruled by a mob boss wynne is our tonyfuckingsoprano
canada,not_removed,so to recap from the two articles referenced in may liberals proposed bill to put caps on political contributions however this proposal did not provide any governance or restrictions over private political fundraisers pay for access events public subsidies will be provided to make up the loss government house leader yasir naqvi tabled the election finances statute law amendment act in the legislature on tuesday the legislation would ban corporate and union donations cut the limit a person is allowed to donate to a political party from to and cap thirdparty advertising the new rules also contain provisions for donors to give more than the nominal maximum contributors will be allowed to give to the central parties but can also donate up to annually to individual riding associations and up to to individual candidates in any election or byelection campaign this means that in a year with a byelection a donor could give in total in years with two byelections and a general election a donor could give premier kathleen wynne promised the clampdown after a series of globe and mail reports on the liberals smallscale private fundraisers at these events people with a financial stake in government decisions paid thousands of dollars to have dinner and cocktails with ms wynne and members of her cabinet a practice that could constitute unregistered lobbying but the liberals did not include any provisions in the new act to discourage such activity at a news conference mr naqvi refused to answer directly when asked why the government chose not to take action on this front in august the liberals now want to amend bill to add the ban of all political fundraising events in addition to the original bill campaign finance caps when the house resumes in september we will be introducing an amendment to ban fundraising events for all mpps mr naqvi said in the statement which another liberal mpp read out in the middle of a fractious meeting of the legislative committee reviewing bill banning fundraising events is a significant change that will affect both parties and riding associations while political parties would still be allowed to seek contributions under the new rules the statement said politicians would be prohibited from attending events to raise money – effectively barring them from offering oneonone time to people who want to influence government policy in exchange for campaign donations the liberals had long refused to ban cashforaccess amid mounting pressure from the opposition and campaignfinance experts while ms wynne has been the main voice and primary decisionmaker on the issue mr naqvi is the minister steering the bill still to me this reads that the liberals previously were silent on the ban of private fundraising events and now are proposing to completely ban them which is a positive move there are still issues with the caps proposed under bill which have been raised by opposition eg it will be hard to track individualcorporate donations and disclosure requirements etc but this by the liberal party is a good move
canada,not_removed,you seem unhinged
canada,not_removed,not an argument
canada,not_removed,neither was your rambling
canada,not_removed,that article is full of so much bullshit they are young and dont have much money so they buy an house their lawyers quit and he had to talk to more its hard to find a flight from beijing garbage story
canada,not_removed,no sympathy here they have a choice the stupid propaganda has started they are talking about hardships of this couple who are not canadian citizens but how about hardships of local canadians displaced from their hometowns working homelessness on the rise poverty rate up why not show pictures of those people oh right who cares about locals no news there they deserve the suffering also she is pregnant and conveniently came at this time im sure knowingly that if baby is born here he or she gets citizenship right away they also found a way to make the deal happen by flying the owner back so there were ways to avoid tax i had no doubt they would find a way good to see tax working well extra for the province we can definitely use assumed canada was a very nice place for immigrants and minorities and that is why we would like to be here and raise our family here oh please canada is nice too nice its been taken advantage of for way too long and now its time to pay up they are welcome to move to trumps usa noone is forcing them between exploiting birth tourism loophole and using our province and country to launder money we have been taken advantage of for way too long if anything the tax should be in range on foreigners followed by annual nonresident tax on empty houses with jail time for those that try to sneak out of paying it now i thought i say i have nothing against chinesecanadians or any other immigrants who come here and become citizens hell i am also an immigrant all of the people who work and do well here and actually live here i applaud their hard work and contribution to canada however those that screw up this wonderful country by exploiting it good nature sorry no sympathy here sorry if you are a foreigner and not a citizen we will always put our citizens interests first
canada,not_removed,in january shinna zhang and her husband moved to metro vancouver from london england they entered canada on her husbands work permit no mention of their citizenship so chinese no sympathy crying about poverty when theyre jetting around the world and buying an house too bad so sad i am pretty sure there are similar buyers out there just like them i am very disappointed with the provincial government for making a decision in the manner like this such a typical response they might as well say clearly this is the correct decision however i am personally negatively affected because this negatively affects me the positive benefits to other people mean nothing i will fight to the bitter end
canada,not_removed,anybody else know recent graduates who dont have a lot of money that are buying dollar homes
canada,not_removed,will the extra these parasites pay actually cover the cost of their baby getting free healthcare for life
canada,not_removed,no citizenship no sympathy
canada,not_removed,whats the hurry just take advantage of the workarounds and loopholes that are already being drawn up in real estate offices throughout vancouver
canada,not_removed,why as many people suggest are we supposed to feel bad for corrupt chinese money launderers
canada,not_removed,why pay the extra when you dont have to if you get it done a few days earlier
canada,not_removed,the fact that this is happening just shows how much of a negative effect foreign buyers have on the housing market
canada,not_removed,i believe its over
canada,not_removed,david fleming one of our prominent real estate agents in toronto believes that this tax could have repercussions on the real estate property in the toronto area he thinks that these investors want a safe place to invest and toronto is one of our major city centres and that they may invest in toronto real estate that could result in our real estate prices skyrocketing he may very well be right
canada,not_removed,they are young and dont have much money so they buy an house this is quite typical actually the media isnt talking every day about how a large number of people participating in this market and therefore helping push it to new highs are people who should not be in it because theyre massively overleveraged shes pregnant and theyre on one income they put down on an house they dont even have permanent resident status they took huge risks here sometimes it doesnt go your way thats life
canada,not_removed,i mean depending on career you could be young with no money and get a house for that price if both are software developers salaries in some places can be over starting and with a small down payment you could afford that mortgage
canada,not_removed,this exactly this i mean im sure for some people its a racism thing i wont speak for them but for me it really isnt about race its about being a foreigner i dont care if youre chinese or indian or cuban or american or swedish or whatever you are not a citizen of this country if you want to immigrate do it properly through the proper channels and leave your dirty money at home
canada,not_removed,exactly fuck these people they are not welcome
canada,not_removed,we will always put our citizens interests first then why did we allow the banks to offer ridiculously low interest rates this situation wasnt created by scary foreigners it was created and is still being perpetuated by mainly three major canadian banks
canada,not_removed,well said
canada,not_removed,and worse is that they screw their country of origin as well they are evading taxes from their home country and hide that money in canada the only people that win are the real estate developers home owners who depend on ever increasing housing prices and the wealthy elite stashing their money out of the country everyone else gets screwed if we canadians want to pretend to care about the rest of the world then wed support measures that actually help other poorer nations develop is taking all their skilled labour which is often subsidized to a level significantly higher than in canada and laundered money actually helping them develop for instance do we help south africa or india when we offer their physicians trained on south african and indian tax money triple the salary here why invest in producing our own skilled labour when its much cheaper to just import them from nations where locals demand lower salaries thats probably why the racist narrative is pushed so much it becomes much easier to get canadians to support immigration policies that harm poorer nations while simultaneously increasing cheaper competition for their own jobs a quarter of our physicians are trained abroad which really is a nice way of saying poached physicians from developing nations at the expense of locals
canada,not_removed,father is here on a work permit so yes they pay in to the system
canada,not_removed,actually we are in hell
canada,not_removed,it really is too high doing nothing for our country but increasing urbanization and driving old stock canadians out of the cities they grew up in
canada,not_removed,yeah everyone is so quick to be up in arms about this with a fuck foreigners attitude the dude has a job hes clearly paying taxes and is a working part of the economy if he was an investorclass immigrant having moved here from quebec with no active business i could understand the outrage but it really just seems like hes some working dude who is getting unfairly fucked
canada,not_removed,so far in bc the tax has only been implemented in metro vancouver so relatively close cities like abbotsford and squamish dont have the tax they might see a lot more increased pressure than toronto at least if those investors are still more interested in west coast property
canada,not_removed,ontario government said they are looking at the bc tax i bet its a high priority file
canada,not_removed,if both are software developers salaries in some places can be over starting thats incorrect is more on the money you can do much better in the us but not so much in canada
canada,not_removed,low interest rates are used in weak economy we need to encourage borrowing but it would never get to these levels if we didnt have foreigners come in and pay over asking price for property borrowing is the only thing locals can do to compete with foreign capital
canada,not_removed,the point of the law is to disappointed the people who come to the provincial please dont come to the provincial to buy the housings please keep the dirty money in the chinar
canada,not_removed,work permits dont last forever why not give work to canadians
canada,not_removed,if hes not happy in canada hes quite welcome to take his little leaching family elsewhere or back to china i have no sympathy for him hes part of the problem
canada,not_removed,doubt they are using real estate and a quick cash grab andor to launder money so squamish or abbotsford might be a not quick enough rising in prices for them toronto is a much better investment
canada,not_removed,cmhc doesnt even allow down on properties over anymore with the new rules this year
canada,not_removed,it does depends where you live some people make over for first job and no experience
canada,not_removed,no it is correct ive had friends get offerred in vancouver and in toronto fresh out of school does it happen to everybody no i know like people that get these offer it is possible
canada,not_removed,the low interest rates along with the fact that canada is a safe place to invest created this entire situation it lured foreign and domestic buyers in alike we need to look very very closely at the actions of these three banks their role in creating a situation where half of our gdp suddenly lies in real estate transactions should not be ignored
canada,not_removed,based on what exactly is he bring in massive amounts of cash artificially inflating housing costs and contributing nothing to the local economy i mean im not saying that he isnt but theres no info here and everyones immediate response was fuck these people so quick to make an emotional judgement
canada,not_removed,is ontario collecting any numbers related to any of this would be interesting to see a beforeafter
canada,not_removed,im pretty astonished to hear this are you talking bachelors grads or mastersphd grads most engineers i know in vancouver years into their careers are still working towards the wage range youre quoting the only new grad from my year that would up with that kind of pay went to jp morgan in chicago or boston and led his own course on acm problem solving at any rate even supposing you do know these cases why is this relevant in this discussion does the presence of outliers such as these actually demonstrate the point youre trying to make
canada,not_removed,agreed i hope they raise interest rates but i fear that its the only tool that locals have to compete with foreign investors who have millions of equity to invest
canada,not_removed,simple hes not a citizen so he has no right to complain and i have no sympathy for him hes here purely as a visitor you know what we normally say to guests who complain about their host go elsewhere
canada,not_removed,it can be the case in any of those cities i am not saying it is common but it happens
canada,not_removed,what you believe is irrelevant to what happened people can and do make that much even entry level ¯ツ¯
canada,not_removed,masters or higher
canada,not_removed,if the banks offered domestic buyers different rates than they did to foreign buyers then the situation would be different
canada,not_removed,what do we call a host that fucks over a guest thats seemingly done nothing wrong a shitty host
canada,not_removed,ohhhhhhhhh i see that makes sense we were clearly talking about two different things
canada,not_removed,we are moving in the right direction we start with tax go up to implement nonresident tax on empty or otherwise property increase interest rates for foreigners getting mortgage i guarantee you that the market will correct itself if we get it all done
canada,not_removed,if you want i dont really care the onus is still on the unhappy guest to gtfo
canada,not_removed,yea even fresh grads it is not common but happens
canada,not_removed,i guarantee you that the market will correct itself if we get it all done no it wont you yes you are part of the problem perpetuating bad ideas that satisfy peoples feelings rather than objectively examining whole picture you dont have shit to say other than blame foreigners like a broken record as evidenced by your constant bleating to everyone except the people that call you out
canada,not_removed,the tax wont have the effect many people hope it will have theres no way that the government is going to risk actually crashing the real estate market the tax is meant to placate the general public even if they raised the tax as you suggest it wont have an effect as always those rich investors will find loopholes and there will be gigantic deliberately created loopholes because the government really doesnt want to discourage foreign buyers if the banks offered high interest rates to foreigners and low interest rates to domestic buyers then it would give the domestic buyers the leg up that you were saying they needed to compete with foreign investors but even that wont really change the reality of the situation this is a supplydemand situation its far more complex than just foreigners and interest rates i still suggest we start by going after the banks
canada,not_removed,the bankers and media waving the flag of the scary foreign speculators has certainly distracted many from the fact that the banks are responsible for creating perpetuating and profiting from this situation
canada,not_removed,what a clean cut i usually outline or draw in sharpie so it looks terrible in light but yours looks amazing well done
canada,not_removed,im impressed that you used a pocket knife rather than a dremel and pumpkin carving kit
canada,not_removed,do a marijuana leaf next
canada,not_removed,good work although it could have been improved by only handing out ketchup and alldressed chips real smarties and coffee crisps but nice pumpkin carving
canada,not_removed,that is some scary shit
canada,not_removed,i always print out something i can use to outline pin it to the pumpkin and cut through the outline like that as long as i go slow and am careful it usually comes out clean
canada,not_removed,i did use a template i just did not show it it would take a really skilled artist to free hand something like that
canada,not_removed,i outline and draw with a washable marker because any left over ink wipes right off
canada,not_removed,can you really not just appreciate all my hard work and not comment on every last detail
canada,not_removed,why
canada,not_removed,sorry
canada,not_removed,whooooooooosh
canada,not_removed,i dont think it counts if its not funny
canada,not_removed,ive never claimed children on my taxes so if someone could explain to me why this couple needs letters from their daycare provider and all the other stuff they outlined is a copy of a birth certificate not sufficient
canada,not_removed,gotta step on the little people to keep us in line need to justify the enforcement budget meanwhile at kpmg and cra there is a sigh of relief that no one will be held accountable in the isle of man scam
canada,not_removed,i suspect that a small group of people have been claiming children that are not in their possession or dont exist in order to get benefits and deductions and that the cra does audits every now and again i dont know how they pick the people though i am very interested to find that out is it some computer program that just flags families after x y z is listed on a return
canada,not_removed,as opposed to making czechoslovakian maple syrup why does the maple syrup have to be canadian anyhow canada isnt the only country that has maple trees you know

canada,not_removed,salut moi jhabite à toronto et bien que le pourcentage de francophones ici nest pas très haut en comparaison avec celui dautres groupes linguistiques nous avons une assez grande communauté francophone cest toronto toutes nos communautés sont assez grandes je ne connais pas des cafés francophones ici mais je sais quil y a une crêperie francophone

canada,not_removed,ça pue le nationalisme canadien manufacturé par le gouvernement fédéral à plein nez cest comme le de montréal cest une excuse pour donner des contrats aux amis des politiciens pis essayer de jouer sur le sentiment dappartenance des gens pour gagner des points politiques
canada,not_removed,certains pans de lhistoire de canada ne sont pas très jolis comme nimporte où malheureusement le père du canada john a macdonald est une des pires pourritures à avoir marché sur terre et contrairement aux étatsunis où les gens vont admettre que leurs fondateurs avaient certaines vues franchement dégueulasses comme lesclavagisme ici on fait semblant que cet homme était admirable mélanie joly a déjà donné le ton en se lançant à fond dans le révisionnisme historique en ce qui concerne ce personnage célébrer le canada cest bien mais jaimerais quon célèbre le progrès que le canada a fait et doit encore faire plutôt que de prétendre quil a toujours été et composé de personnes de la plus haute moralité si vous voulez fêter le canada comme il est était et sera je vous lève mon chapeau mais à ce que jai vu à date je suis franchement dégouté
canada,not_removed,je ne suis pas sur si cest le cas mais je pense que vous devriez faire attention de ne pas dire sentir quand vous voulez dire feel parce que ca veut dire smell mais un francophone devrait me corriger si je suis mauvais desole pour ne pas utiliser des accents je ne suis pas devant mon ordinateur de ma maison
canada,not_removed,je pense quil pourrait être un évènement important et amusant mais les canadiens ne semblent pas être très heureux si il y avait des célébrations comme pendant le centenaire du canada je pense quil serait un évènement beaucoup plus important

canada,not_removed,thanks
canada,not_removed,thanks alot just understood these are called flairs and can only be added to certains subreddits have a nice day
canada,not_removed,its really unfortunate that food irradiation has not been widely adopted it would render food refrigeration almost entirely unnecessary such refrigeration is a major part of the cost of providing these foods fresh to consumers and also adds up to considerable environmental impact something like of all energy in the world goes into keeping food cold and refrigerants in use are mostly powerful greenhouse gasses and they do leak into the air it would probably be safer and less wasteful too failure of refrigeration at some point during the supply chain is a common source of food spoilage and poisoning dairy meat and some kinds of perishable vegetables could be provided sealed and would keep at room temperature for weeks to months without the nutritional and taste changes that come from the kind of heat andor chemical treatment which allows things like precooked bacon or uht milk at room temperature now unfortunately when you say radiation people lose their minds half of the american public for example actually believes that food which has been irradiated itself becomes radioactive and so for more than half a century one of the most important advances in food storage and safety since we have invented since fire and the ceramic pot has been rejected by the public
canada,not_removed,yay for this i spent some time with an aafc scientist who was doing research on this like years ago yes thats how long it takes to make it to market it turns out you may as well worry about the radiation youre getting from a banana milkshake than the ground beef the amount of potential to ingest radioactive material that would be harmful is minimal unless you eat like lbs of meat every day until youre then well the warranty simply doesnt apply i hope we can do this for sushi grade fish sushi grade fish raw that is widely available and hopefully cheaper yaay radioactive man the goggles they do nothing
canada,not_removed,yes please
canada,not_removed,while your argumentation is accurate allow me to be skeptical about this news everything comes with a downside while the food industry has seen impressive new technology like gmo and newer processes for food do not disregard the fact that people are never been this obese in history i strongly believe there will also be some kind of downside with this new process that the industry will ensure to keep quiet further investigation is required to make my mind but i wouldnt believe health canada really i do not think they cannot be corrupted and hide facts if the industry pays enough for them to shut up
canada,not_removed,yeah or we could educate people to recognize that literally all wavelengths of light including visible light radio waves infrared light uv light and xrays are all radiation and that irradiation does make make things radioactive relabeling is somewhat dishonest i think better education is the way to go
canada,not_removed,well one thing thats perhaps alarming is they could get away with a lot more shoddiness up stream in manufacturing before their customers start dying of food poisoning
canada,not_removed,the process isnt new its been around for decades gamma rays xrays electron beams or microwaves in fact almost every single provider of nonelectronic medical equipment syringes scapels tubing that kind of stuff uses this process they vacuum seal tools in plastic and then blast it with high energy radiation
canada,not_removed,ya but thats hard id rather have better results and safer people over something that is somewhat dishonest
canada,not_removed,that makes sense i didnt know that thanks for the heads up
canada,not_removed,lying to people over educating them doesnt really justify the ends in this case the meat supply chain is safe enough without irradiation i would rather wait to educate the populace or let hc approve the process and just require labeling idiots can avoid the irradiated stuff and maybe it will even drive down the cost for those of us less superstitious my parents already makes money selling antibiotic free beef at a premium price to people who think that a shot of antibiotics to save a calf at an early age somehow has a nasty impact on the beef when the animal is slaughtered months down the line as an aside there are certainly other selling points for their beef it is grass fed and organic in every way other than actually being certified organic its just that the fact that antibiotic free just a natural product of low crowding and lack of disease issues is a selling feature for some people is a bit of a joke
canada,not_removed,the fact that antibiotic free is a selling feature for some people is a bit of a joke hmm people concerned about the overuse of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance are a joke you should be a lobbyist
canada,not_removed,not exactly but i am glad that you know enough about the issue to understand its nuances from the conversations i have had people are more concerned with traces of antibiotics ending up in their beef which is very very silly treatment must be withdrawn a certain number of days before slaughter depending on the drug and antibiotics tend to be reasonably easy for the body to metabolize and remove most drugs have a wellcharacterized halflife in mammalian systems the other point is we do treat a certain few of animals with antibiotics but they are usually treated within the first month after birth and we basically do it to save their lives from infection of course these animals dont go into the same food supply chain antibiotic free customers still get beef from animals that have never been treated with antibiotics we dont even retain antibiotic treated heifers for breeding in subsequent years but with the number of animals we treat in a given year antibiotic resistance isnt an issue the problem really is the feedlot system and the practice of treating every animal with an absurd and in some cases repeated dose of antibiotics its a practice that has even spilled over into other parts of the industry because feedlots encourage producers to start their animals on programs of vaccination and antibiotic treatment growth hormone injection or implants can also sometimes be wrapped into the same program well before the animal reaches the feedlot by offering higher prices for treated animals
canada,not_removed,and here liberal voters thought justin would take all that taxpayer money and invest it in canada and canadians
canada,not_removed,talk about putting all your eggs in one china
canada,not_removed,is this code for well give you money if you can guarantee canadian firms get the contracts
canada,not_removed,given the liberarl party was yo a extent bankrolled by chinese money from politically connected chinese expats this comes as no surprise
canada,not_removed,im not a fan of china but this thing could be huge and it would be stupid of us to not get in on the ground floor of this getting in early could be enormously beneficial to canada
canada,not_removed,im honestly just glad this is an actual investment he has just been handing away our money like its nothing lately edit also it helps get canadian companies into the chinese market so there is that
canada,not_removed,he had to give them something so they would postpone the new china regulations on canadian canola this was just a huge something and he got very little for it
canada,not_removed,but expect the contracts to be fulfilled years behind schedule
canada,not_removed,gotta give out those humanitarian money to show how kind canadians are who cares if canadas infrastructure is severely lacking
canada,not_removed,im honestly just glad this is an actual investment he has just been handing away our money like its nothing lately he still is hed rather have canada become a chinese colony than have it a free country
canada,not_removed,hes diversifying were probably tied too much to the usa spread it around and they have less bargaining power over us
canada,not_removed,investing in another world bank this time run by china is not diversifying it is a way for china to use our money to give out loan so they can own developing nations and hold things over them this is not helpful or good policy he is trying to use our money to buy off china so they dont hurt our canola imports
canada,not_removed,hes diversifying thats not diversifying
canada,not_removed,yoho
canada,not_removed,i didnt even notice it wasnt in the port coquitlam yard anymore

canada,not_removed,still going to jail the laws the law
canada,not_removed,last week i didnt pay the cent fee to print two pieces of paper at the local library better haul me away into solitary
canada,not_removed,hey guys as a year medical student i feel like i can shed some light on this specifically the inaccuracies regarding cardiovascular disease in men that are presented in this article while the overall reasons they list for decreased lifespan in men are all very relevant more men have dangerous occupations more men engage in dangerous hobbies men are more reluctant to seek medical care early men get heart disease sooner than women the reasoning given for in the article is not quite true even if men live an equally healthy lifestyle to women their life expectancy is still shorter the primary reason for men getting heart disease almost a decade sooner than women is not because we all eat less healthy or are less active but because estrogen is highly protective against atherosclerosis which in essence means it is highly protective against ischemic heart disease women are almost never affected by ischemic heart disease until they are postmenopausal when their estrogen levels plummet whereas men tend to become affected about years sooner given that heart disease is the cause of death in most western countries this inconvenient biological inevitability actually contributes substantially to why men have shorter life expectancies than women the earlier onset of heart disease in men is not primarily a result of lifestyle differences between the sexes as this article baselessly suggests but rather physiological differences an additional potential reason that comes to mind is that womens health issues tend to receive more attention and more funding than mens for example prostate cancer kills more almost as many men every year as breast cancer kills women yet breast cancer receives roughly twice as much government funding for research as prostate cancer to me this is more the sort of issue that we should be discussing
canada,not_removed,it can be argued that across all three major causes of men dying earlier than women—accidents suicide and heart disease—men are wholly responsible for their own early graves male life is cheap because thats how they act this type of reckless behavior is also why men make more money women at my job are allowed to work what ever task they want when asked to build a pallet by placing pound boxes on it they all refuse to do it instead they want to do quality assurance which is important also if im going to work myself into an early grave i want to be payed well for it
canada,not_removed,males dying earlier than females also happens in primate
canada,not_removed,i dont understand this need that both genders need to be equal in everything even in death we are different we will never be truly equal one gender will always be better at certain things than the other gender and vice versa
canada,not_removed,im not a huge fan of the way this article is written i think there is a subtle bias against feminism but i tend to agree with the overall message where is the outrage about mens health issues and mens issues in general my issue is that you cant frame the discussion in terms of feminism every time you do so is a disservice to the cause the two can and should exist together because they are both important and are fighting for different but related things if you make it a men vs women argument nothing will ever get done because it is too easy to dismiss the loud misogynistic voices that tend to dominate the discourse right now we arent even allowed to discuss mens issues because it immediately gets framed in this light and the pc police come out in full force calling people sexistwhich frankly most of the loud mre voices are until we can have an adult conversation without making it a comparison nothing will change
canada,not_removed,but i thought gender was a social construct only
canada,not_removed,honour duty and sacrifice—all components of manliness eeeeyeah what components of being a decent human being imho i went in to read this hoping for some sciencey insights and all i got was an antifeminist diatribe not that that perspective particularly perturbs me but it took away from what could have been an interesting read
canada,not_removed,fuck me you compound that with the younger generations issues boys doing worse in school low postsecondary enrolmentgraduation also higher suicide rates and we have some strong warning signs what pisses me off the most here is the mras id love to have real compassionate discourse about what to do with canadas menboys but these dickheads muddy the waters im sure there are a huge group of them who genuinely want to address the social issues but there is a loud group who seem to just want to do battle with feminism then that radicalises a loud minority of feminist who shut down any discussion of malerelated issues its seems like militant aholes from both of these two groups would rather hurl jugs of piss at each other than actually help anyone all the while both genders are the worse off i wish we could discuss maleissues outside of some competitive context of whos got it worse men vs women obviously women place in society needs more attention but that doesnt mean we should focus exclusively on womens issues were grown ups we can do two things at once
canada,not_removed,a crucial component of any turnaround says bilsker is reversing the assumption that traditional masculine characteristics such as competitiveness aggression and highrisk tolerance are dangerous flaws that need to be corrected rather they should be understood as reflections of positive traits such as honour duty and sacrifice—all components of manliness
canada,not_removed,and when men are in their prime theres a shortage of women due to boys being born for every girls this is the natural number gendertargeted abortion can widen it considerably there are currently million more men in the world than women im as feminist as they come but can certainly admit that men have it harder in many ways than women and aging is one of them we need better healthcare and just an overall change of attitude directed toward our lads
canada,not_removed,if we adopt standard feminist analysis that considers the mere existence of any gap between the sexes to be prima facie proof of overt patriarchal discrimination the significance and permanence of canadas gender death gap suggests some monstrous unseen matriarchal conspiracy to kill men before their time hoooly shit this is so utterly ridiculously wrong its absolutely hilarious the standard feminist analysis is absolutely not that there is a patriarchal conspiracy to keep women down the standard analysis is that there is a vast array of social and some biological factors that leads to women earning less than men on average things like that women want to and are expected to take care of children and thus work more parttime that tradionally femaledominated fields pay less etc these factors are all influenced or caused by subtle sexism in society and actually there are biological reasons why men die earlier than women indeed there are social and behavioural reasons but its been well documented that hormones that women have more of than men are generally beneficial to cardiovascular health this gap exists around the world in societies with vastly different social and behavioural makeup its pretty much accepted fact in the medical community that women are in general biologically ever so slightly more sturdy than men its really sad because of course its a serious problem that men face certain risks more than women due to social pressure inducing risky behaviour and its of course true that feminism has always pointed out that these social pressures are bad for both men and women but this article is just using the age gap as a means to put down feminism the article just screams reeeee feminism bad what about men id be much better if it would say this is a problem that needs attention within feminism next to all the other legitimate issues like the wage gap
canada,not_removed,thanks for some useful info regarding do you know if there is much research and adequate funding for the research
canada,not_removed,men are more reluctant to seek medical care early this is a big one from my experience regular check ups lads
canada,not_removed,men also receive less funding for male specific diseases so
canada,not_removed,yea this is correct edit the part about breastprostate is wrong prostate cancer is much more common than breast but kills fewer men than breast cancer kills women even after all the research and funding poured into breast cancer screening and treatment in short prostate cancer while common is not as deadly as breast sources
canada,not_removed,well there is a physiological difference there women have to work harder than men to gain and maintain the same level of physical strength testosterone is a thing so its not surprising they avoid heavy lifting work
canada,not_removed,we dont need equality of age opportunity we need equality of age outcome
canada,not_removed,this is the kind of regressive thinking that a trump presidency has brought forth s
canada,not_removed,you do know you can hate feminism and love women at the same time right
canada,not_removed,still dont understand why gender which is synonymous with sex is confused with gender roles by leftist intelligentsia that essentially has marketed the term as personality type
canada,not_removed,honour duty and sacrifice—all components of manliness eeeeyeah what components of being a decent human being imho theyre components of humanity and women have them too but i think the point being made is that society is far more strict about expecting and demanding these things from men
canada,not_removed,good luck discussing it regardless of how you self identify mras came about long after this discussion was categorized as off limits
canada,not_removed,what pisses me off the most here is the mras what pisses me off the most here is the feminists im sure there are a huge group of them who genuinely want to address the social issues but there is a loud group who seem to just want to do battle with mras
canada,not_removed,what pisses me off the most here is the mras id love to have real compassionate discourse about what to do with canadas menboys but these dickheads muddy the waters this is exactly the damn issue when you frame the discussion around mens issues to be about men vs women you immediately lose what should be the entire message the two things can and should exist perfectly well together because they are two completely separate but related things
canada,not_removed,you lament these mens issues then at the same time lambast the one group thats trying to get anything to change hopefully this edit is less rabblerousing whatever that means
canada,not_removed,obviously women place in society needs more attention why
canada,not_removed,im an mra how do we muddy the waters mras are the ones who made the red pill make up most of bloodstainedmencom hold talks for suicide and suicide prevention i dont see how any of that is hurting relations between men and women
canada,not_removed,its a sign of the current zeitgeist when victimhood became equivalent to sainthood why is anybody surprised people want part in that theyre merely following the times if feminists can claim women are oppressed in the modern western world as they do and have done for some time now so will mras claim men are too being a victim is after all valuable social currency the most valuable some would argue just wait a few seconds thats the nex thing thats going to happen what with the infantilizing the infantilizing i was talking about is going to happen men will say if women can go to the dean if theyve been felt upward im gonna start complaining too everyone is going to start complaining being a victim men would want a share in the victimhood business it will be unstoppable and completely negative and i think very boring quite prophetic if you ask me
canada,not_removed,you sir get to be first in line to give up years of your life with all the identify politics plaguing us in the media these days i would hope things like life span would get some play the only thing i would say is more important that an issue such as this is the plight of our native people also doesnt get of the attention it should
canada,not_removed,but this article is just using the age gap as a means to put down feminism the article just screams reeeee feminism bad what about men yeah i was surprised that macleans published such a snarky article however were bombarded with articles about the wage gap that are overblown and based on an overly simple look at the statistics on the other hand we have a mens issue that is literally a matter of life or death and pretty much no one gives a shit id be much better if it would say this is a problem that needs attention within feminism next to all the other legitimate issues like the wage gap history has shown that men would be pretty foolish to expect feminism to do anything for men feminism looks after improving the lot of women we need the equivalent for men to deal with menss issues
canada,not_removed,this is a problem that needs attention within feminism next to all the other legitimate issues like the wage gap yes what men need is more women lecturing them on how to behave properly
canada,not_removed,woah there the standard feminist analysis is that there is a vast array of social and some biological factors that leads to women earning less than men on average this is generally the nonfeminist analysis the feminist analysis has always been that the wage gap is primarily due to sexism despite all the evidence showing that its not if feminists believed it was due to biological and social factors then why wouldnt they just acknowledge those factors and work to mitigate them rather than ravenously protesting to demand the mystical patriarchy snap its fingers and give them equal pay to men as though sexist oppression is the reason for the pay disparity rather than obvious lifestyle and career choices
canada,not_removed,i dont have exact numbers for you but heart disease is fairly well funded because of its prevalence and significant impact on mortality our treatments and interventions have come a long way in the last couple decades but id like to a see a funding shift toward preventative medicine where the focus becomes how can we prevent people from getting cardiovascular disease rather than how can we help people with cardiovascular disease to live a bit longer both questions are important but i think it is just so much more beneficial and costeffective in the long run to tackle the cause of the disease rather than the complications of it
canada,not_removed,going in for a full physical next week i used to never do stuff like this but a couple years ago a monkey bit me while i was vacationing in thailand so i figured might as well be tested for everything so i signed up for a full physical now here i am a couple years later and i think to myself probably wont hurt to do another one of those full physicals im going to try to make it an every couple years kind of thing so that any major issues that might come up can be identified earlier
canada,not_removed,no they dont as ops elegant analogy points out there isnt necessarily more work involved in higher risk work theres just more danger women are more adverse to risk end of
canada,not_removed,work places have to be equal to all employees and not discriminate based on sex there are rules around what is and isnt safe to lift in the workplace and i believe that is set around i would assume they factored gender into that equation to be able to allow employers to create job descriptions that would not disqualify women based on their physical stature even doing a quick google search of what can the average woman lift yields the following when it comes to the deadlift an untrained pound woman should be able to lift around pounds after training for to months about pounds at an intermediate level after a year or two of training pounds i know that is referencing the deadlift but if the average woman can deadlift they can surely pick up a box your point about women having to work harder is kind of moot thats not to say there wont be women who just cant lift but there are also guys who cant lift if thats in the job description and you cant do it then youre not qualified for that job regardless of your sex
canada,not_removed,to the dedicated feminists not liking the ideology is tantamount to hating women
canada,not_removed,im a feminist i dont argue with mras because i think it is a waste of time i want to get stuff done im the equal rights for everyone feminism if we do feminism right it also helps men the slogan womens rights are human rights comes to mind if you believe this slogan youre a feminist thats what im going for no discrimination towards anyone based on gender but also race religion nationality sexual orientation ect i care about human rights first and foremost im angry that my brother is more likely to end up in jail than graduate high school he is a native male with fasd im angry that my brother gets assaulted in clubs by women and the women are shocked he is upset about unwanted groping and kissing im angry my cousin was abused physically mentally and sexually by his girlfriend for a year and then criminally harassed by her for another years after breaking up and he felt that he couldnt file a police report or complain because he was a man and bigger than herhe did the police did take him seriously things need to change for the benefit of everyone most feminists agree with this my issue with the mras is they dont seem to get a lot done and the rhetoric of course maybe they should take a page out of the feminist playbook start support groups write your councilors and mps about the issues and propose solutions mras and feminist groups could both stand to be a lot nicer nobody can read minds so lets have some rational discourse
canada,not_removed,nobody talks much about movember but isnt that kind of proof that a mens only charity works just do something positive without making it a pissing match and both genders will support
canada,not_removed,that damned patriarchy ruining everything
canada,not_removed,for real
canada,not_removed,physicals suck but theyre necessary a lot of my friends myself included dont like going because theyre worried about what theyll hear from a doctor you need to do more of this work on lowering this not eat hot dogs three times a day etc or owning up to bad habits to a doctor smoke uh yeah when i drink oh i drink pretty regularly did i mention the hot dogs thing if i had to guess women are more used to going to doctors because theyre encouraged to get things checked regularly breast exams pap test etc as a result i think youre probably more likely to get other things checked out as well i realize im generalizing here but this is the case with the women in my life i think men get encouraged to get their prostate checked out around and checked out for colon cancer at some point and to see a doctor if youre pissing blood bladder cancer were probably more likely to go to the doctor when there is something urgently wrong than in a preventative maintenance way i dont want to make more sweeping claims just see the doctor every once and a while boys stay healthy if not for the people who love you but for yourself
canada,not_removed,my point wasnt about work as in workplace it was about the amount of effort they have to do to create or maintain muscle mass im not saying there are no women who can lift and im not saying all guys can i certainly cant but how easily they can achieve the same result
canada,not_removed,maybe they should take a page out of the feminist playbook start support groups if only it were so simple fourthyear politics and governance student kevin arriola launched a new ryerson mens issues awareness society on reddit last month and tried to get it certified by the ryerson students union the ryerson feminist collective was quick to condemn the group saying it unequivocally denounces any organization that makes students feel unsafe the student union agreed rejecting the initiative for the second time in two years in its decision the union said it was unclear whether the society would acknowledge systemic privilege and voiced concern about its association with the canadian association for equality cafe a prominent mens group affiliated with more than mens issues societies on canadian campuses including carleton university and mcmaster university the organization has come under scrutiny for being associated with antifeminist groups and activists
canada,not_removed,can you link an instance of mra groups violently protesting for shutting down a feminist event im serious btw
canada,not_removed,my issue with the mras is they dont seem to get a lot done and the rhetoric of course well its hard to get things done when opposition is wellfunded and their ideas are far more readily accepted by society at large ill try to find his name but i believe back in a man who wanted to open a shelter for male victims of domestic abuse was ostracized to the point of committing suicide and you should really watch videos of the uot protests
canada,not_removed,if nobody talks much about it how is it raising awareness
canada,not_removed,some people talk about movember in less positive terms the mcgill daily november new statesman november the scavenger november duncan k affectus volume issue
canada,not_removed,exactly i was pretty damn scared of what the doctor was going to tell me i do not eat well i dont get a ton of exercise and i have many other bad habits that cant in any way contribute to good health but turns out i have perfect health or at least i did a couple years ago even my blood pressure is down and that used to be a problem so maybe im just hard on myself and my daily habits and my lifestyle choices and so on not taking it for granted either im probably going to continue being paranoid about my health and feeling nervous when i go in for a physical but im totally doing a full physical every couple years the benefits could be huge and lifechanging
canada,not_removed,my point is that the average woman with no training can lift lbs so the argument that they have to work harder doesnt fly whether it is inside or outside of the workplace the context of the comment you replied to was lifting lbs boxes in the workplace if the average woman can lift lbs with no training that means there is no extra effort needed by them to do so if they are refusing to do that work its because they dont want to do it and not because they cant do it while i agree with you that it is physiologically more difficult for women to gain and maintain muscle mass than men it just isnt relevant in the context of the original comment thats really what i was trying to point out
canada,not_removed,untrained women have roughly half the upper body and grip strength of men i believe the difference is smaller after training but it is still huge a woman can pick up a backpack but that has a strap up lifting boxes off the floor does not sound like a smart move for a woman it would be easier if they have handles part way up
canada,not_removed,sorry i meant more nobody talks about it as a successful charity and therefore something to model after whenever i see this type of reddit discussion googlewikipedia tells me it raises a lot of money for good causes prostate cancer testicular cancer mens mental health ive donated myself a number of times had lots of friends coworkers and family growing moustaches over the years etc
canada,not_removed,man some people are downers lots of male authors in that mix too i dont know what to tell you honestly almost every charity has detractors anecdotally we run one at work every year and it seems to go over well my big accounting firm is super cautious about potentially offending anyone about anything ever and theres never been any controversy
canada,not_removed,you didnt have to do that but appreciate it
canada,not_removed,fair enough however keep in mind that lifting lbs boxes when your maximum is lbs is a much greater effort than doing the same when your max is say perhaps i should have added this as part of my initial point its not my intention to move the goal post
canada,not_removed,yeah i just wish i could grow facial hair worth a damn d
canada,not_removed,i totally agree with you on that one heck im not a strong guy by any means and ive taken on a few physical jobs that first week is always brutal and leaves me sore as can be but i do find my muscles adapt and the job gets easier after that first week given the differences in the way men and women build muscles perhaps the adjustment period for a female would be longer i really like that we have been able to have a civil conversation here

canada,not_removed,current year
canada,not_removed,ill be a woman if it gets me their break on insurance
canada,not_removed,lol
canada,not_removed,this is stupid
canada,not_removed,why not just identify the trans people with the gender they identify themselves with like if you got someones id then theyre standing right in front of you so you dont need the card to identify their gender
canada,not_removed,question to any medical professionals around i am curious to know this issue probably doesnt affect me or most people if at all is having your gender important on health cards would not stating gender affect the quality of medical treatment in any way positively or negatively edit added word gender to make sentence work
canada,not_removed,yeah its not valid id if its missing information like that thats why your ontario health card isnt considered valid id it doesnt have enough information on it
canada,not_removed,something no one asked for but many will be talking about anything to distract the masses i guess
canada,not_removed,heres the thing the overwhelming majority of sjw will tell you that theres sex physical and that gender mentally is a spectrum because gender is mostly a social construct i think the best compromise is to display sex on things and completely ignore gender because the snowflake people are doing it through gender identity and in the real world only your sex matters let them believe they change genders every day or that they have no gender it affects no one but force them to stick to a sex people with genetic abnormalities that makes rhem indistinguishable from male to female are very rare
canada,not_removed,youre like factually incorrect
canada,not_removed,well for one thing a critical mass of people are medically intersex and dont actually have a clear gender take that factor in the thousands of people in ontario whose gender doesnt neatly map onto m or f and youve got a compelling justification to get rid of the box entirely
canada,not_removed,huh the whole point of this is that they are saying that some people dont feel either male or female you know basically theyve gone full sjwtard
canada,not_removed,just to be clear neither card currently lists gender at all
canada,not_removed,yeah its not valid id if its missing information like that thats why your ontario health card isnt considered valid id what are you even talking about your health card isnt considered valid id by the government because your health card contains information pertaining to your medical records which the government is forbidden from collecting or disseminating unless theyre using it for legitimate medical purposes or recordkeeping purposes directly related to medical treatment never mind that many nongovernment organizations do accept health cards its got nothing to do with completeness of information and what are you even supposed to do with information about someones gender on a piece of id yank down their trousers and check
canada,not_removed,i think the best compromise is to display sex on things and completely ignore gender because the snowflake people are doing it through gender identity and in the real world only your sex matters the current cards do exactly that
canada,not_removed,good thing the current cards didnt list gender at all then eh they are adding gender to the card
canada,not_removed,its amazing how much cheaper data plans are in other countries i think i read on here not too long ago that in the uk you can get up to gb of data on your phone per month for the equivalent of im paying with koodo for one gig and thats one of the cheapest options
canada,not_removed,absolutely fuckin not theyll charge us more if anything im tired off dollar a month cell bills man
canada,not_removed,remember a time when people said paying for an mmo is a waste of time well for bucks a month you can probably save money make friends and have a fun hobby thats far more cheaper than a bell or rogers phone or you could just jump to wind like i did i dont mind their services actually a little inconvenient but still better than for the same plan
canada,not_removed,no
canada,not_removed,simple answer is no not until we make regulations limiting the exorbitant fees these companies are making from it also fuck huffpo
canada,not_removed,because they cant argue that overage free ratings should be higher then data cap ratings the official argument for putting overage fees at a specific price set is based on the price cap for which data caps are allocated at in dollar value ie since everybody was using they rated the data cap to the price cap and found that was the reasonable for the current price per data block even though our big three cite costs well in excess of triple any other country for expense of transferring data as such if they argue that overage fees need to be higher then the cost for data either needs to become less available or more costly they cant request to raise the overage charge without first raising the base price of our internet dont forget they raised prices something like times this year and some companies altered the transmission rates so they can recalculate the data cap ratio now too also rogers has their rocket stick set up to autoexpand to the next tier service instead of the legally required limit set as such they can charge in overages in lieu of the legal cap limit set by the crtc ruling edit i would probably define terms as data cap consumer salepoint of data consumption price cap technology pricepoint of cost of data transfer
canada,not_removed,not if theres even the slightest hint of a chance to continue gouging us for every penny until every consumer is riding the brink of bankruptcy oh get a grip ffs
canada,not_removed,bell ended up with a release of their claimed estimates of their cost for data and their best claim for the expense of transferring data was about the cost of every other country i had to tweak the information in their favor ie bullshit the facts in realized data costs they are orders of magnitudes more expensive then any other country ie i took the facts and did the calculations without adjustments
canada,not_removed,heads up public mobile has a promo for for and its on the telus network
canada,not_removed,im in hong kong and paying about cad a month for unlimited lite speed data and is fast enough without a contract too canadian companies are gouging beyond belief i hate going back buying plans
canada,not_removed,i just looked fido up minutes canada wide gb for if you bring your own phone
canada,not_removed,would get you mb last i checked a year ago they may have a double data promo on right now edit gbmb
canada,not_removed,no the new plans dont even have unlimited at that price it is horse shit and when i asked the reason was the difference in the canadian dollar makes it difficult for fido bell or telus to offer us cheaper service like they did before
canada,not_removed,just went to look is it a joke about the brand name that their website looks like dog shit im on chrome and half of the labels are overflowing their boxes and the top menu is concealed by the banner
canada,not_removed,i think you mean my eyes exploded when you said gb lol
canada,not_removed,i dunno i tend to look more at content than design most of the time it has a simplified layout and i like that also im on chrome and had none of those issues personally
canada,not_removed,in their defense their old site made an appearance on the daily wtf so its technically better
canada,not_removed,ah dammit
canada,not_removed,oh snap you probably have another cellular provider than the big
canada,not_removed,we need to build a wall and make the us pay for it
canada,not_removed,are we really accepting immigrants from the us because they entered us illegally we have literally no idea who these people are
canada,not_removed,im thinking tents and blankets if we can discourage anymore from crossing illegally im for it
canada,not_removed,everybody hug
canada,not_removed,its definitely going to get better now that the saudis started restricting extraction
canada,not_removed,just shows you how shitty the country is actually doing this is what happens when youre a two trick pony natural resources and real estate oh yeah dont forget about the high cost of living and pretty low median wages which force young professionals to move down south or to the uk
canada,not_removed,pretty easy to compete with a lack of able competition
canada,not_removed,good maybe theyll shut the fuck up and stop their whining about how they lost their goldplated hot tubs
canada,not_removed,yep at least this downturn has demonstrated to the rest of the country just how fucked we are without an energy industry pumping money into the economy we have been able to avoid the hard truth of our utter uncompetitiveness in the global economy the excuse has always been dutch disease and blaming alberta but now its clear that we just cant compete with china mexico and many us states
canada,not_removed,how them equalization payments treating you bud i pay more in taxes than you make in a year
canada,not_removed,care to elaborate no opinion on this myself thanks
canada,not_removed,i pay more in taxes than you make in a year lmao i doubt that looks like stereotypes run both ways there buddy
canada,not_removed,thanks
canada,not_removed,pretty much a big ol game of tug o war with the population holding both ropes from the middle
canada,not_removed,can everyone please fuck off with posting articles from the beaverton
canada,not_removed,yes i love how this sub has become a toilet filled with their turds of satire ujesusporkchop better keep checking their rss there might be another hilarious headline waiting there to be shitspammed to rcanada already
canada,not_removed,no
canada,not_removed,i just got home from work ill have a look thanks for the reminder
canada,not_removed,not sure if this has been linked somewhere heard an interview by him on cbc radio thought it was honest and real the interview is at the bottom of the page
canada,not_removed,its not a subject for the faint of heart but harold covers it in a frank and honest way theres no quick fix but i feel like books and interviews like this are a start
canada,not_removed,the article wasnt very deep on the issues at hand and focused on the author putting out a book
canada,not_removed,alcoholics always want to talk about their issues they never ask if anyone wants to listen
canada,not_removed,youre not a man youre a child
canada,not_removed,what point on the doll where your father touched you
canada,not_removed,this showed up on my up and coming threads i laughed hard thinking someone paid to ask that
canada,not_removed,lol try metacanada the crass humour wont go over well with the anemic populace of rlimpwrists
canada,not_removed,its hard to imagine the selfish attitude of someone who knew that they were going to blow up their neighborhood you wanna take yourself out fine go start the car and shut the garage door you idiots but six months later people are still out of their homes and several have been torn down having dealt with the foot dragging insurance companies ill bet its a full years til everyone is settled back into their refubished and rebuilt homes what an asshole thing to do to your innocent neighbors
canada,not_removed,its really sad these two individuals got to the point where they felt suicide was the answer and i feel bad for their friends and family im wondering though why did they feel the need to destroy half their neighborhood and put dozens of other people in danger there has to be more to this story
canada,not_removed,mississauga mayor bonnie crombie previously said homes in the area remain empty six months after the explosionsome homeowners are facing both mortgage and rent payments according to fonseca as some insurance coverage has run out its too bad these people didnt live in the basement of an insurance company
canada,not_removed,this article has some additional information written in july it talks about nadlers previous murder conviction and his apparent mental issues it also talks about some weird notes found in the debris httpnewsnationalpostcomnewscanadahefooledalotofpeoplesaysbrotherofmansuspectedofblowingupmississaugahouse

canada,not_removed,im just trying to start a rap beef before the years over
canada,not_removed,youre looking for professionalism from a random internetter who volunteers to keep spam out of a small sub

canada,not_removed,you should have tied a board to your ass held your nose and went for it
canada,not_removed,calls someone a virgin incessantly then says its his sister when he posts tits dude my wedding is in june in niagara if you can get bus fare youre welcome to show up and witness my heterononvirgin marriage shit even watch us consummate if thats what youre into

canada,not_removed,yeah gonna pass on all of that thanks
canada,not_removed,eah i stand by what i said idiets a cancerous troll and rtoronto mods protect him
canada,not_removed,serious question tho why did you invite me to fuck your wife at what point did i express any interest in fucking your wife not sure where that came from tbh none of my posts are talking about fucking your wife or anyones wife are you having problems at home theres pills for that or like tie some weights to your wang and walk around for a bit till its longer idk talk to your doctor but dont take it out on me
canada,not_removed,aww but i already told my family you were coming my nans going to be devastated
canada,not_removed,itll be historic afterwards
canada,not_removed,you talk like weights on my wang isnt a regular thing in our house
canada,not_removed,alright sounds like your sex life is interesting enough already but honestly where did that come from is that just a thing you do when you ban people hey man i know youve got some free time now how bout a few inanouts with the missus eh
canada,not_removed,ill be broadcasting in for those who cant get tickets
canada,not_removed,sure whatchu want something that makes your life less pathetic just in response to that line cuck is a favoured word of many expats of rtoronto
canada,not_removed,when i was in my early teens i was obsessed with scratching my rectum i eventually figured out that if i leave a thin layer of shit on my anus and let it dry over night i would be more itchy and i would have a fun surprise that i could peal off my butt hole in the morning i cannot describe how wonderful the feeling of pulling off that thin simi transparent sheet was after pulling it off i would smell it and then toss it under my sink after a week or so the smell was too much for me to handle so i began to spray febreze down there every once in a while this went on up until i started growing hair down there i stopped for a while because i would end up pulling hair with my shit in the mean time i would toss my finger and toe nails along with my heel skin and occasionally my sun burn skin what a treat that was under the sink i eventually began to miss the sensation of peeling so i decided to shave around my anus shaving it made it more itchy sadly for some reason my shit wouldnt come off in a single layer thats when i decided to take some elmers glue and lightly apply it around my rectum and let it dry my god the feeling was times better than before not to mention that my anus was super smooth after peeling the worst day of my life happened three years ago today while i was out shopping my next door neighbors house caught fire and engulfed my house with it my beautiful collection went up in smoke after the ensuing trauma i sought professional help for my disorder talking to that shrink was the most embarrassing part of my life i was diagnosed with ocd and excoriation disorder i no longer peel or pick at my body i have a few pictures of my collection on my old phone i will upload them when i get off work edit i am now home from work like promised i have the pictures for you sorry for the darkness of the photos they were originally intended for me to look at when i was on trips wasnt expecting to share them also the sink is bigger than it appears httpimgurcomapwylp
canada,not_removed,and yet by typing seven words into google i can prove your headline is bs
canada,not_removed,when i was a kid i would watch adults curl after hockey at the local rink every single curler had a lit smoke at all times it was like bingo with bumpy ice
canada,not_removed,wait i thought the point of the brooms was to do exactly what they said in the video
canada,not_removed,rnotthebeaverton
canada,not_removed,i would say those pants are more of a controversy
canada,not_removed,more of a comment of the times than curling isnt it
canada,not_removed,yes but the science behind them have gotten to the point that the thrower can have almost no skill and still have the rock end up where it needs to go this removing an aspect of skill from the game
canada,not_removed,it is that is why the do it in the first place seems kind of a nonissue just pick a material the head must be made of and put it in the rules
canada,not_removed,now the scientists wont reveal their results awesome reporting there
canada,not_removed,somehow i doubt it makes it that easy
canada,not_removed,your rcanada submission was removed rule multiple post
canada,not_removed,awesome
canada,not_removed,disgusting
canada,not_removed,this is great news for our economy cant simply go green overnight when the silver bullet answers just arent there yet gotta ease into it over the course of the next few decades
canada,not_removed,oh deal i mean dear
canada,not_removed,air horns they cant resist themselves great news for the og industry and albertans as a whole dare i say canada as a whole
canada,not_removed,how so
canada,not_removed,you mean great
canada,not_removed,subtract the corporate welfare our governments give to oil companies the billions in damage caused by climate change and the public cost of oil spills oil companies sell a whole bunch of crude in the us and asia at rockbottom prices nbsp how will this benefit canadians besides some temporary jobs for a short period of time honestly curious
canada,not_removed,agreed good for us which means good for the country
canada,not_removed,sell a whole bunch of crude you answered your own question also laughing at the corporate welfare bit as if the taxes these companiesemployees pay isnt a huge plus for the government
canada,not_removed,how will this benefit canadians besides some temporary jobs for a short period of time equalization payments to poor eastern provinces who overwhelmingly voted for trudeau
canada,not_removed,the international monetary fund estimates that oil and gas subsidies in canada are billion each year in direct support to producers and uncollected tax on externalized costs nbsp thats laughable what could canada do with an extra billion a year
canada,not_removed,thats certainly half of a net equation i wonder what canada could have done with all of the auto subsidies its dolled out over the years the bailout alone cost them net after selling their stake that is a net calculation btw profitcostnot just cost
canada,not_removed,we still make like more than the subsidies given we come out ahead
canada,not_removed,its hard to believe someone when they paid for cbc to write up some story and disable comments on the front page it seems like its all about now thats the truth
canada,not_removed,she has no case
canada,not_removed,im partial to the way cbc didnt mention their involvment too much
canada,not_removed,this happens all the time i know people will say its a he said she said situation but that just goes to show that our justice system is failing and needs to be updated to conform to the reality that canadian women face regarding sexual assault and sexual crime rapists are getting away with their crimes because the courts are not taking womens testimony seriously and disregarding it against a mans testimony canada needs to step up
canada,not_removed,step up how she accused a person of doing something with no proof other than her word i read the entire article and several times it mentioned that she wanted to be like the other women in highprofile cases shes also conveniently looking to get her prenup waived hes been legally declared not guilty yet shes slandering him in the countrys biggest news outlet im not saying it did or didnt happen i have no idea but if youre suggesting we just take accuser testimony as truth then youre incredibly biased this and many other cases like it are important examples that if you actually are raped then you need to go to the police immediately
canada,not_removed,you should be thankful that you live in a country where ifwhen someone falsely accuses you of a crime that you did not commit that person must bare the burden of proof while you benefit from the presumption of innocence witch trails are so medieval and false rape accusations from emotionally scorned woman sadly are much more prevalent that youll ever choose to admit
canada,not_removed,protip if someone throws a mug at your head stop dealing with that person forever
canada,not_removed,we need to trade with china its the largest country in the world who in their right mind thinks we should stop trading with china of course theres going to be negotiating
canada,not_removed,good because our main trade partner will be ruled by an unprepared demagogue with the ego of a banana republic dictator they are unpredictable and we are too much dependent on them already china is our second trade partner makes a lot of sense to include them on our diversification strategy also if they want access to north american market the orange idiot down south is actually a leverage of our own we couldnt hope for a better moment
canada,not_removed,hopefully the chinese are sympathetic to the waterworks in general the focus of our trade agreements should be with other developed nations
canada,not_removed,this is just a formality trudeau already sold canada to china
canada,not_removed,oh good i long believed trade was a good thing in theory but in practical terms i guess it all depends on who is doing the negotiating doesnt it and the quid pro quos doesnt it its been years now since nafta and globalization and on the face of it i have to wonder if the people we put at the negotiating table arent a bit easy either that or the govts that put them there at the table arent especially capable or adept at managing the new dynamic of world trade somebody is surely screwing up so who is it on the brighter side i still see some parts of our economy arent in tatters and some folks and communities havent been decimated yet so this final fire sale will leave us with nowhere to go but up
canada,not_removed,its a trap
canada,not_removed,i hope chrysta sarah palin is a true feminist role model freeland doesnt cry this time
canada,not_removed,the same woman who broke out in tears after trade negotiations with the eu stalled smh
canada,not_removed,its those tears she cries and deals get made make it happen
canada,not_removed,we should be trying to make a deal with india not china
canada,not_removed,yes we need more dollar stores in canada
canada,not_removed,look for any deals she makes to be unhelpful to canadians except the very very rich ones trudeaus cabinet picks all look good on the surface butdo you think youd ever meet one at the pub theyre all senators in waiting
canada,not_removed,if you think china is a better partner than the us you are quite naive and have let your own antius bias consume you saying you dont like donald trump yet you dont say anything how china has committed genocide against the tibetan people looks the other way with poaching animals who die in pain for no reason lack human rights such as free speech and dont allow proper foreign investment into their countrysure encourage chinese trade but realize they really only want our natural resources our manufacturing industry has been hollowed out at least the americans are fighting back now if trump grows the american economy by a year it can only benefit us we are children of a common mother and share the longest undefended border in the world
canada,not_removed,this the headline seems to imply this is news of course china is part of trade negotiations
canada,not_removed,trade should be a twoway street what do we sell to china that would be helped by a free trade deal more to the point china is an untrustworth trade partner just look at their actions in the wto their unwillingness to protect intellectual property and copyright and their blatant copying
canada,not_removed,sure but trying to increase trade with china isnt something new its something canada has been working on for years now heck the article barely even mentions china odd choice for a headline
canada,not_removed,can we delete comments like this i watched the video not a single tear was shed this is just straightup character assassination
canada,not_removed,hey it was effective the deal was nearly dead before she intervened
canada,not_removed,she is going to get eaten alive
canada,not_removed,wow he had a busy year
canada,not_removed,remember the deal harper made with china a couple years back cant be any worse
canada,not_removed,we should be trying to make a deal with india not china deals with every country that matters ftfy
canada,not_removed,i truly believe the orange demagogue is an idiot it has nothing to do with dont like him he is their president not mine however one trade partner doesnt exclude others putting all our eggs in the trumpistan basket is not even risky strategy it is just no strategy at all we need to find more partners
canada,not_removed,nobody said anything about free trade
canada,not_removed,lol fuck free speech if i dont agree with it right i also love my free speech but when people disagree with me i wish they were moderated more ps she did cry and lots of articles about it
canada,not_removed,yes our glorious mods must delete comments that insult our great minister
canada,not_removed,oh the chinese communist party freaks out when a woman become president of taiwan imagine what they are gonna do to freeland
canada,not_removed,selling canada to china and giving away all our money to third world dictators
canada,not_removed,butbutbut harper as much as you want to scapegoat trudeau harper didnt sign a trade deal with china but rather an investment plan
canada,not_removed,while in the there may have been truth to the thought of cheap labour abroad takin errr jerbs the reality today is those jobs are taken by robots globalization is just an easy scapegoat
canada,not_removed,and a ton of articles claiming yo boy trudeau stripped himself naked and is a hysteric mommy boy such a shiny pony just not ready yet that doesnt mean its true especially when we have video evidence of the event and doesnt change your intent which is to ridicule a public figure rather than engage in any substantive discussion and again there is no free speech in a private forum there are rules that you agree to in order to participate here
canada,not_removed,its just the rules dude if were allowed to make substanceless false statements about politicians with the intent of mocking them then excuse me ill get right on that that damn justin trudeau is such a girl did you hear about the time he threw a hissy fit over the camera spotlight not being centered on him i hear he gets up to those hysterics all the time oh and did you hear about angry tom he had a little breakdown on the ottawa end of year press conference last year he totally smashed the mic on the floor and was steaming out the ears shouting profanity at the press completely out of control people were afraid that hed given in to full rage oh and dont get me started about dead fishskinned harper that man ran the country proud too bad he never had a single emotion in his office i hear his friends and family even his wife must have thought he was a robot so heres the thing why do you think you are allowed to make substanceless groundless attacks on female politicians accusing them of being emotionally out of control when calling harper a robot trudeau a hysteric mommy boy and tom a rageaholic maniac gets us a oneway ticket to bantown
canada,not_removed,better than definitely totally withoutadoubt dead
canada,not_removed,the deal may still be dead fingers crossed privatizing healthcare and more public services would be bad news
canada,not_removed,and also forcing us all to wear burkas and follow sharia
canada,not_removed,i didnt know serving your country by expanding the economy doing deals with the largest economy was liberal corruption
canada,not_removed,youre right i made a mistake in referring to it as a trade deal its not scapegoating its showing equality a foreign investment deal has a lot more room for corruption than a trade deal
canada,not_removed,fair enough but is the government in incentivizing or promoting hi tech initiatives in canada to offset it or benefit from it school curriculums dont seem to be changing it investments arent getting tax breaks communications costs in canada are amongst the highest in the world
canada,not_removed,tell that to the bell inc it department that has been outsourced to india through cgi hell they are they ones who fucked up the government email transition get a job in tech they said it is the industry of the future they said
canada,not_removed,i read recently two stats that back you up first jobs lost are from automation from international labour second america is manufacturing more than ever before but employs far less people manufacturing didnt leave it just became heavily automated
canada,not_removed,and now the rich robots that took our jobs are buying all our real estate those bastards
canada,not_removed,robots can barely assemble a car id love to see one assemble an iphone
canada,not_removed,to quote the great donald trump wrong a lot of good labour and manufacturing jobs are still being done by people they just get paid a lot less to do the work in places like china
canada,not_removed,the fact that you get so upset about it is exactly what the above is trying to do pretty funny actually
canada,not_removed,because her public behavior does not inspire a lot of faith in her negotiating skills edit let me add belgian walloons broke her emotionally god save us when she has to negotiate with chinese party members prediction we get fucked
canada,not_removed,theres video of her crying false statements no more
canada,not_removed,female politicians why does her gender make her any more or less a fair target for political commentary
canada,not_removed,privatizing healthcare and more public services would be bad news what part of ceta promises to do this
canada,not_removed,ya then we might start getting better healthcare like the uk france sweden norway germany or any other european country
canada,not_removed,not yet
canada,not_removed,when you take donations from china when you just happen to get a lot of work in china after you retire when you have exclusively chinese fundraising dinners you just might be corrupt
canada,not_removed,so now you change the goalposts first it was harper bad for making trade deal now its harper bad for making investment deal
canada,not_removed,sure we should be doing more but thats a separate issue
canada,not_removed,i believe this problem is solved if we can get some sort of basic minimum income system happening i run a small tech company and for us starting out we cant afford to pay an hour for a canadian tech support furthermore we only need people for maybe hours week at this point so whos going to do that enter help from bangladesh now if we had a mincome where we got rid of minimum wage and i could pay someone then that job could stay in canada
canada,not_removed,those stats are nonsense hundreds of millions of jobs were created in china by taking our jobs a whole middle class was created
canada,not_removed,they can drive cars and soon well be seeing them assembling your cheeseburger at mcdonalds year after year more and more industries will fall
canada,not_removed,this crying is a sign of weakness i dont care what the gender of the politician is its fucking embarrassing
canada,not_removed,again clearly is not shedding tears i see some emotion but just like calling harper an emotionless robot is a gross overstatement of the actual facts of his reserved persona
canada,not_removed,what part of ceta promises to do this httpswwwgooglecaqcetaprivatizationhealthcare
canada,not_removed,yah your government loves this deal if it gets killed it will by socialist in europe i have no expectations that the current or previous federal government is looking out for our best interests both parties have a rich history of fucking over canadians to better serve corporate interests i think the european parliament is set to vote for it at the end of feb this gives me some hope
canada,not_removed,ya then we might start getting better healthcare like the uk france sweden norway germany or any other european country yes im almost certain thats why theyd be interested in privatizing our healthcare system to provide superior service
canada,not_removed,whos getting this retired work in china
canada,not_removed,the contents of that foreign investment deal is what i am referring to i literally said i made a mistake in calling it a trade deal you may not remember that far tho
canada,not_removed,its not really a separate issue economists have long said that trade deals with countries with minimal wages pollution and safety standards will results in jobs moving to those countries and therefore it is the governments responsibility to support displaced workers however bay street only cares about their piece of the pie so our captive governments say let the market figure it out and they left countless workers hung out to dry
canada,not_removed,what you are describing is dealing with the symptoms not the cause and when you describe gmi like that it sound like government subsidy of companies not people and that wont sell well what you are really describing is a delta between the actual cost of production and the artificial cost of production based on lowest common denominator of labor regulations and economic conditions i would argue price discovery has been distorted and it has caused the normalization of unrealistic unsustainable cost expectations maybe an iphone should cost twice as much there is an assumption in economics that more access is always better and that may be true with the time horizon is long enough but if the horizon is long enough all the victimizes of collateral damage are dead and long done their suffering which would be unyealding until death btw i had a factory job paying an hour in high school if you want someone to set up a printer fine buck might cut it but if you have systems that require actually it youll be getting what you pay for
canada,not_removed,hundreds of millions of jobs were created in china by taking our jobs and you have nonnonsense stats to back this up
canada,not_removed,selfdriving cars have a looooong way to go there isnt even an industry standard yet soon well be seeing them assembling your cheeseburger at mcdonalds oh goody i sure cant wait for my shitty food to become even more shitty and preprocessed plus what happens if the machine breaks down during lunch hour the restaurant just lost thousands of dollars you futurists are bat shit insane
canada,not_removed,ah yea she is believe what you want but the entire world reported her as crying because she didnt get her way the entire world
canada,not_removed,jean chretien jesus keep up
canada,not_removed,so what corruption came out from harpers foreign investment plan
canada,not_removed,what you are describing is dealing with the symptoms not the cause well yeah the cause being improving technology leading to less workers needed to complete a task how would you recommend we stop that
canada,not_removed,its called china where have you been for the past years they didnt go from dollar a day to middle class by having a bunch of robots with jobs automation is a brand new phenomenon
canada,not_removed,he did a good job dont mind him getting a good job after serving us by the way whats jean have to do with the current government working with china towards a trade deal to expand the economy again
canada,not_removed,as far as im aware none the deal itself was not so hot however unless you consider the quick sale of a canadian company to a chinese firm happening right around the same time as the fipa deal was going through or what harper ratified the agreement before courts finished looking through the deal feel free to read more about it i remember it like it was yesterday
canada,not_removed,automation is not a brand new phenomenon in any way look at any assembly line or chemical plant today vs one in vs one in years ago an operator with a radio controlled a single valve in a large plant when somebody monitoring the plant told him too now that valve is controlled by air or an electric motor which is controlled by a control system built to control and monitor the plant in a large plant thats hundreds or thousands of jobs replaced by a system that can run itself more efficiently and productively and thats only a small component of that plant all of that has occurred over the course of the last years and an astounding rate when people talk about automation they assume its limited to robots or self driving cars but it will extend into everything we do from medicine to sport to manufacturing to everything else
canada,not_removed,automation is a brand new phenomenon yes as i said in my original reply still curious how the of millions of our jobs went to china
canada,not_removed,he did a good job no he didnt he just had no opposition to speak of dont mind him getting a good job after serving us the problem is chretien entered public life a poor man and left office a multimillionaire because of the business ties he developed while prime minister chretien used his public service to get filthy rich it is the very picture of corruption by the way whats jean have to do with the current government working with china towards a trade deal to expand the economy again the connection is raymond chan a former chrietien cabinet minister corrupt as they come worked with a corrupt chinese billionaire wanted by the chinese authorities to setup the truyouth political cult inside the lpc was disowned by trudeau during the election because of his corruption but is now back on the inside orchestrating the current illegal fundraising scheme and who knows what else
canada,not_removed,why didnt he do a good job we had good growth stayed out of iraq when the opposition wanted to be involved on the first part of your paragraph sure making money because of your time in power is wrong ive never saw proof that that was the case with jean however the last paragraph seems a bit tin foil hat like to me
canada,not_removed,funny how you focus on my incorrect word over the issue we are discussing im done trying to educate you dont expect a reply my mistake for getting it confused with a trade treaty lol
canada,not_removed,why didnt he do a good job he broke his promise to eliminate the gst and balanced the budget by massively cutting transfers tot he provinces also adscam we had good growth the planet had stellar growth canada had good growth by being on the planet stayed out of iraq when the opposition wanted to be involved practically the only good thing to happen under chretien sure making money because of your time in power is wrong ive never saw proof that that was the case with jean however chretiens business ties to china are on the public record those ties were developed while he was prime minister a proof is a proof is a proof amirite the last paragraph seems a bit tin foil hat like to me then you have never met raymond chan i have and i have known he is corrupt since the justin trudeau knew he was corrupt during the election when he supposedly cut ties with him and all the other facts i mentioned are true
canada,not_removed,okay fair enough i appreciate your fair and civil response and i see i have things to learn about a government i was too young to vote for thanks for real
canada,not_removed,youre welcome but im confused this is the internet arent you supposed to call me a racist or something
canada,not_removed,yep you can feel how divided people are when you cant even debate with civility i just try to be civil
canada,not_removed,in my opinion this is long overdue and we are fortunate that this is getting out before the big one hits well hopefully itll be finished before the big one hits some scoffers in the comment section of the article ask what can i do in seconds about the most ridiculous thing ive heard you rig up the sensors to an air horn warning system across the pacific coast this gives you enough time to get out of your house before it collapses in the earthquake its enough time to stop the skytrain so that when the earthquake hits they dont derail and cause a severe death toll its enough time for a school to march their students out this is million wellspent
canada,not_removed,why now why not anytime prior to now
canada,not_removed,i feel like if youre on the skytrain youre realistically fucked either way

canada,not_removed,how do toronto police know whos a real witch do they test if they float in water
canada,not_removed,how is this different than any psychic aura reader or homeopath
canada,not_removed,ill remove your evil spirit for
canada,not_removed,oooooh so thats why we banned pretending to practice witchcraft that makes more sense now that ive seen the law in action
canada,not_removed,a fool and his money are soon parted
canada,not_removed,no thats not objective enough they weigh you to see if you weigh as much as a duck
canada,not_removed,theres a simple test if you claim to be able to do magical things or command supernatural forces youre full of shit ok thats not how the law handles it but its still a great real world rule of thumb

canada,not_removed,i call
canada,not_removed,i know a lot of brilliant people who dont have to drop on witch removal services
canada,not_removed,chiros actually do shit though edit or do they
canada,not_removed,its pseudoscience with no evidence to support its effectiveness its based on nonsense called subluxation which the founder of chiropractic theory claimed he learned of from conversations with the dead httpsenwikipediaorgwikivertebralsubluxation

canada,not_removed,med school will be in the territory for a nonresident youd need to have insanely good mcat scores to get in the country also prioritizes residents over international students for med school due to limited seats psychiatry in particular is years of med school then a year residency and a one year fellowship if you want to subspecialize
canada,not_removed,i think that you need to do a lot more research about the costs and the time period to get to that level of medical expertise before you can be qualified as a psychiatrist in canada you need to first be a medical doctor than go on to further years of training to finally be recognised as a psychiatrist second problem costs as a non canadian you are going to pay at least or times more than a canadian citizen will be charged canada has a small number of medical schools less than and the competition for that small number of seats is very very high scholarships for foreign medical students are rare the cost to become an md in this country is the highest of any university course by far way before you worry about where to live in canadayou need to find out if you will even qualify to come here as an international student never assume that what you want to do is going to be what happens canada has a annual student visa limit of about from all the countries in the world it is a gamble feel lucky final questionwhy dont you do this in your own country i am sure that there are excellent medical schools there and you wouldnt have to leave home answer that please
canada,not_removed,its very difficult unfortunately academically you need to be a medical doctor for this you need excellent grades and i mean really excellent mcmaster university currently gets applicants a year for a class of thats less than mind you those are grades from an undergraduate degree ie a or bachelors as a foreign student youre fighting an uphill battle because not all med schools accept foreign students and the fees are crazy in tuition fees alone after that comes actual psychiatry training which is years but you cant get in as a foreign student without a permanent residency in canada which brings me back to square one i recommend doing medical school in israel and going through that path to becoming a psychiatrist in parallel apply for immigration to canada if and when you get immigration done and receive permanent residency status then you can look into the pathway of getting licensed in canada which is hard but not as hard as training for medicine in canada as a foreign student
canada,not_removed,no thanks
canada,not_removed,a bit of a correction canada has way more than medical schools just off the top of my head theres u of t mcmaster university of western ontario university of ottawa queens university northern ontario school of medicinethats just in ontario
canada,not_removed,the living cost in israel are also extremely high also insanely high grades are required i was hoping that canada wont have these problems thus this thread but as you say they do exist there maybe ill check for studying info security instead the main reason i want to immigrate is that i hate it here we are one of the most expensive countries in the world and for no real reason also very hot and im a winter guy studying is mostly a way for me to get a citizenship somewhere that is not israel
canada,not_removed,its interesting working with so many medical students and doctors i see the problem first hand medical students have to complete vigorously for residencies some are high in demand some have only a couple of seats per year family practice is sorely needed yet one of the least paid physicians in ontario at least the oma has been capping specialist ohip billing fees and funneling that money to increased fees for family physicians a year residency so attract more family practice physicians
canada,not_removed,canada also requires insanely high grades to get into any of our medical schools i like that idea lets be clear herethe only path to getting canadian citizenship is to become a permanent resident first that is the hardest immigration class to get approval for obviously check this link to the canadian government immigration information site look at the long list of requirements to just apply for that type of immigration visa and of course applying does not mean approval will follow we canada get at least million applications a year but we only accept about people you do the math link httpwwwcicgccaenglishimmigrateindexasp jim b
canada,not_removed,cost of living here isnt exactly cheap either
canada,not_removed,no insanely high grades will be required for any medical school in canada
canada,not_removed,medical schools here have a rejection rate the average grade for acceptance usually starts in the high you also will have to have an impressive mcat score and a good extracurricular profile ie leadership roles hospital experience etc edit idk if this source is still correct but canadian medical schools seem to require similar or more commonly higher grades and mcat scores httpwwwstartmedicinecomappmedstatisticsaspiinyisoal
canada,not_removed,i see thats a different issue altogether look into immigration to canada ircc website is a good start find the programs for which you qualify or programs that you would qualify for in a couple of years and work towards achieving their requirements skilled worker programs are your best bet find a job that ircc is looking for and that you think you can do and would enjoy and do it then apply for immigration and wait in the meantime maybe also apply to other immigrant countries australia new zealand us and see which one has the most favourable terms to someone in your position medicine in canada is sadly very difficult for people not trained here or dont have immigration status already we actually have a problem of doctors driving cabs
canada,not_removed,depends where you live its pretty cheap in saskatchewan compared to vancouvertoronto but you have to live in saskatchewan
canada,not_removed,i am not looking for cheap but israel is one of the most expensive ones and for no good reason its almost impossible to get more then just barely finish the month in this cursed land
canada,not_removed,the problem of doctors driving cabs is due to their inability to communicate in english or french at a university level both written and spoken if you cant communicate with the patient or with your peers you have a problem thats why they are driving a cab because of an inability to speak read and write at a university level of ability jim b
canada,not_removed,issue for his career is that its probably hard to find work outside the big centers
canada,not_removed,nice try but no lookup the carms canadian residency matching service statistics for imgs international medical graduates to see how we have a backlog in the thousands for a few hundred spots every year we very much favour our own grads over immigrants with md equivalents we dont even allow them to prove their worth in an impartial test note im not saying this is a bad thing or a good thing simply stating it as a fact im a doctor and im involved in selecting medical school applicants and soon i will be involved in selecting specialty trainees so i know the system inside out if people tell you its a language problem you can laugh at them because it very much is not i mean think about it those immigrants have graduated medical school and worked as practicing physicians if theyve done all that do you really thing they cant learn a language especially at a time when medicine is taught internationally in english its not the language its us that wont give them a chance to prove their worth of course my colleagues will oppose this because it would have the immigrant physicians competing with us for jobs
canada,not_removed,they do need psychiatrists in saskatchewan so should be fine
canada,not_removed,i find this especially egregious given that the organization lists evidencebased programming as one of their values httpwwwchildrensautismcaindexphpourmissionandvalues
canada,not_removed,ill let dr chopra have the last words i in fact dont believe in the existence of time thats one thing i have to tell you and the other is that i dont take myself or what i am doing seriously source httpskepdiccomchoprahtml unbelievable that they would have this con man speak at a conference for autism
canada,not_removed,god is a nonlocal field of quantom incontinunity inherent to cosmic consciousness see anybody can string together a bunch of random spooky sounding science words to sound profound wheres my book deal
canada,not_removed,autist here i cant take the whole neurodiversity thing seriously because of shit like this i mean on one hand aspergers is one of the things that makes me who i am but on the other hand i know about autists and theres only about three aside from me who arent complete fucking wallflowers who barely know how to function socially and professionally because they had to memorize all the cues at this point i actively avoid anyone who willingly associates with the whole autismacceptance crowd theres a good chance that if they have the social wherewithal to actually do things like this they arent autistic and if they arent autistic but theyre involved in autism acceptance theres a chance theyre either quacks like this guy out to make a buck or literally tumblrites there to signal virtue autism isnt a curse but its certainly not a blessing and wed all be better off if most of the people who had it didnt because then maybe they could flirt with someone without having to make
canada,not_removed,i wrote a letter of complaint to the organization pm me if you want to use it as a template to write your own
canada,not_removed,you could not find a bigger asshat than this guy to speak on a serious issue like autism whats next tickle me elmo shares his wisdom on open heart surgery
canada,not_removed,this is upsetting i work with other people who would be more qualified than this guy and actually understand the science behind different treatments of course i only really know about behavioural therapy but from my experience talking with parents of my students their main struggles are with their childrens behaviour and not having any strategies to help manage it fuck this guy
canada,not_removed,deepak offers a unique perspective yes the view from having ones head up ones own ass would be a unique perspective chopra will be speaking to caregivers about a roadmap for higher health based on the latest findings in both mainstream and alternative medicine ah so hell be pitching homeopathy or eh
canada,not_removed,were going to see more and more of this horseshit going forward i see this guy quoted in facebook memes constantly with some profound sounding garbage in the text people believe what they want to believe science be damned
canada,not_removed,i hope he will talk about his plans for working with cupw when their contract expires iknowwhohereallyis
canada,not_removed,if you need advice about what crystals to use in your living room redesign then you should ask deepak chopra for advice or if you want to learn about chakras or healing music sure but not autism
canada,not_removed,temple grandin must be booked solid shes an amazing speaker and a person with autism as well
canada,not_removed,whom ever is in charge of recruting speakers at this event needs to be grabbed by the shirt collars shaken and asked what the fk are you thinking
canada,not_removed,hes a complete moron and a quack
canada,not_removed,what does he have to do with autism why was he even invited
canada,not_removed,chopra is a piece of shit
canada,not_removed,httpwisdomofchopracom
canada,not_removed,dr oz of canada
canada,not_removed,why the hell should this guy be allowed to speak here if he wants to spout his views let him do it at his own events
canada,not_removed,i thought this was another story about the cocksucking sonofabitch that is doing his best to destroy canada post so his pals at the hedge fund can buy it for a nickel and then sell it back to us for seventeen billion dollars but not by the way fuck canada posts deepak chopra and his fellow traveller the odious hubert lacroix working hard to ruin cbc so that can be replaced by fox news as our national broadcaster
canada,not_removed,people with autism tend to dislike newage stuff for whatever reason theyre a lot more likely to subscribe to the skeptic crowd deepak chopra has nothing to do with autism and is a hack generally so why have him at an autism conference
canada,not_removed,although this comment will obviously be downvoted im curious to know if anyone here as looked into the research on meditation as a tool to help individuals cope with autism though chopra may not have been the best choice the practices for which he advocated may be beneficial
canada,not_removed,well they dont seem to stick to that too aggressively as theyre also having john elder robison who is a neurodiversity proponent and total quack
canada,not_removed,someone on the board must have fallen for some kind of woo
canada,not_removed,then how does he schedule appointments
canada,not_removed,i in fact dont believe in the existence of time actually this is probably one of the least harmful things that he has said since time itself is difficult to conceptualise and the actual existent of time is debatable further philosophical musing of time has no relevance in a scientific approach to healing its the talk of quantum healing as an alternative to medicine that is scary i dont take myself or what i am doing seriously if only dr oz would be this honest
canada,not_removed,i would say he is the poster child for autism then again that would be an insult to the autistic
canada,not_removed,deepak chopra destroyed by sam harris
canada,not_removed,httpwisdomofchopracom
canada,not_removed,im pushing my credit card against your comment on my screen but nothing is happening
canada,not_removed,he is more dangerous than religion a prime example that eliminating religion wont get rid of extremism
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,a delicious word salad you got there
canada,not_removed,deepak chopra is technically an md so its not enough to trust someone because they have a degree parents and leaders of organizations need to be informed and skeptical
canada,not_removed,i hope you know that there are people out there who really do care and want the best for your children i work as a behavioural therapist at a school for children with mid to low functioning autism we all make shit money but still wake up happy to go to work to see the kids and to watch them grow overcome their behavioural issues and see them really start to find their own independence even if it is with small things like helping out with household chores i definitely agree with you about some people one of my students parents flew some doctor from china to canada paid him for him to tell them that putting him on roller coasters would help cure him that poor year old boy was forced onto a roller coaster that was terrifying for him his aide told me that she felt like the worst person in the world after but when you have a parent standing there telling you to do something what else can you really do thank goodness his parents have moved past the bad advice that was given to them and have really become quite involved with our aba style therapy
canada,not_removed,it is nice to hear someone comment on autism and not just consider the whole spectrum to be an aberration that needs treatment and curing many people with slight autism simply function differently with many benefits my dad has aspergers and is very intelligent not the best with reading social cues but no worse than a selfcentered person
canada,not_removed,its nice to hear from someone else who dislikes the nurodiveresity movement rautism is full of people that support the movement and i just dont get it
canada,not_removed,yes please andthank you
canada,not_removed,or parent
canada,not_removed,an untestable hypothesis is about as useful to a working scientist as a liberal party membership is in alberta
canada,not_removed,alternative medicine he knows white people will pay a lot of money to listen to an indian guru preach hinduistic bullshit
canada,not_removed,parents mother especially have been disadvantaged by not being called out on their bullshit over the last few decades now we have this attitude that you cant tell me im wrong because im a woman and a mother its awful
canada,not_removed,i blame rightwing politicians for destroying education which inoculates intelligent people from this psychobabble
canada,not_removed,pretty sure the ceo of canada post would be a better fit than this snake oil salesman
canada,not_removed,im pretty sure chopra will gladly spew his bullshit in regards to any medical topic he might also have been invited in the hopes that his name recognition will attract attention to the event but if they wanted name recognition even a celebrity guest with no scientific experience would have been a better choice chopras history as a purveyor of pseudoscience reflects very poorly on the organization
canada,not_removed,ive written about my sister on reddit before shes very much into reiki and homeopathy and access bars nonsense its very hard to be patient and understanding sometimes stories like this make me appreciate my sisterinlaw and brother all the more they take sciencebased medical advice very seriously when making decisions on the care of my new nephew aint no woo in that household
canada,not_removed,from what ive read i get the feeling his speech is more about how parents can cope with the challenges of raising an autistic child but his history as a purveyor of pseudoscience should preclude him from speaking on any topic at an event like this
canada,not_removed,i havent looked into the research about meditation or mindfulness but i would not be very surprised to learn that it could have positive effects but chopra goes way beyond meditation talking about quantum woo detox making baseless claims and speaking against conventional medicine read real medicine if they wanted someone to speak about meditation hes still not the guy for the job
canada,not_removed,yoga as well basically you are just teaching your child life skills life skills help if you or anyone can self regulate using meditation or yoga thats a huge net benefit in life
canada,not_removed,thanks for mentioning this id not heard of it before
canada,not_removed,i didnt know he was considered a controversial figure what are your issues with his positions
canada,not_removed,seems very common in the autism community unfortunately just viewing the whole wakefieldantivaccchelation thingnot an illness or disorder community i mean this is a community that forgives a man for experimenting on mentally disabled children in a cruel and non approved manner that included things that caused tremendous harm and suffering like unnecessary spinal taps all to make a buck off his own vaccine
canada,not_removed,for those of us who have never heard of the term woo httpskepticoblogscomskepticowoowoohtml
canada,not_removed,i agree i was just pointing out the one quote that casts shade on everything he says
canada,not_removed,hes gotten far more angry with chopra than that this was chopra ready to attempt to make dawkins look silly and of course he does look silly because hes debating a man who makes money saying fooling things
canada,not_removed,i mean ben carson is a fucking idiot and even hes a qualified brain surgeon
canada,not_removed,any subreddit devoted to some specific movement or other is going to be a hugbox for that movement rtalesfromtechsupport for example is united in cursing stupid all users
canada,not_removed,oh great racism
canada,not_removed,i dont know canada posts chopra is a pretty big asshat in his own right
canada,not_removed,its very weird the movement puts a good face on the idea so i can see its appeal but its much more harmful and ridiculous than much of the pr presented by proponents its common to refer to a cure for autism as a kind of genocide they treat autism like a gift and ignore the fact that its often disabling even in high functioning sufferers and basically think that if society were just more accommodating we wouldnt really need to treat autism or a whole spectrum of other mental illnesses and disabilities its essentially a radical form of antipsychiatry dressed in the clothes of openmindedness and equality
canada,not_removed,heres just a few quotes from a single article he wrote just to give you an example to me neurodiversity is the idea that neurological differences like autism and adhd are the result of normal natural variation in the human genome this represents new and fundamentally different way of looking at conditions that were traditionally pathologized its a viewpoint that is not universally accepted though it is increasingly supported by science that science suggests conditions like autism have a stable prevalence in human society as far back as we can measure we are realizing that autism adhd and other conditions emerge through a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental interaction they are not the result of disease or injury the same could be said of schizophrenia or any number of other debilitating illnesses its dangerous to talk about something that is often a profound disability as if its merely a slight variation on normal human brain development or function they look at the pool of diverse humanity and see – in the middle – the range of different thinking thats made humanitys progress in science and the creative arts possible this is fairly typical thinking it seems amongst the neurodiversity community that autism or other mental disabilities or mental health disorders are responsible for human genius that theyre a gift to many neurodiversity proponents talk of cure feels like an attack on their very being they detest those words for the same reason other groups detest talk of curing gayness or passing for white and they perceive the accommodation of neurological differences as a similarly charged civil rights issue if their diversity is part of their makeup they believe its their right to be accepted and supported asis they should not be made into something else – especially against their will to fit some imagined societal ideal this needs no explanation or rebuttal imo its both a straw man and a crazy position to take on a disease that for most people is not some minor inconvenience or gift but a constant struggle there is no question that neurodiverse people have brought many great things to human society if those achievements were indeed facilitated by neurology it logically follows that an attempt to cure future disability by eliminating our differences would be tremendously harmful to humanity again referring to autism as a gift to humanity and alluding to totally unproven contributions by people essentially appropriated from history by the neurodiverse movement its revisionist and baseless instead of spending most of our budget on basic genetic and biological research lets shift the priority toward applied research to help the people living with neurological difference today another straw man
canada,not_removed,seems very common in the autism community unfortunately sadly when people get desterate for an answer and science is telling them that there isnt really a good answer then they will often grasp at whatever straws they can find and that too often includes getting sucked in by any number of charlatans or wellmeaning pseudoscience pedlars
canada,not_removed,for clarification woowoo is a more serious form of woo in fact theres been a move by general conferences on weights and measures to standardize woo units
canada,not_removed,well hes an excellent brain surgeon just a shitty statesman
canada,not_removed,there is a lot of in betweens for therapy it isnt aba or giving your kid bleach water in fact where i live aba seems to be losing ground to things like rdi or floor time as the science is starting to show that it can be much more effective
canada,not_removed,yup pretty much
canada,not_removed,i assume parents of children with autism will do almost anything to see a decrease in their symptoms
canada,not_removed,this needs no explanation or rebuttal imo its both a straw man and a crazy position to take on a disease that for most people is not some minor inconvenience or gift but a constant struggle its not a crazy position to take for people who have autism or aspergers for them its a personal issue they identify as autistic or aspergian as part of their identity the idea of curing it to them is offensive and they are in their right to be offended by their idea just as being gay is part of the identity of lgbt people it doesnt have to be in the past societies lgbt people did not necessarily make being gay part of their personal identity it wasnt a big thing to them in our society it is and yes the man is completely correct part of the way that people with autism and aspergers are perceived by popular culture is extremely offensive to people with aspergers and autism you dont need to believe that all mental health issues are fake to think this there are many people with aspergers and autism who have depression comorbidity rate of the two are extremely high those people dont think depression is fake or just something that is part of their identity most of them take antidepressants the issue is for a lot of people with aspergers they dont see how it hurts other people and yeah it hurts peoples feelings but they beleive that hurt is because our society is predisposed to say you are not a complete human if you do not act this way or do this parents may cry over their child with aspergers because they are not as socially active as a normal child but parents also cry over their daughters not getting married or deciding to not have children or anything that deviates from the standard expectations of american society that does mean that those deviations are wrong or that the condition needs to be cured curing aspergers and highfunctioning autism is just as big of a can of worms as curing homosexuality for the people who have it the comparison is valid
canada,not_removed,this doesnt seem patently absurd to me or anything does he say this about the entire autism spectrum if so then id be pretty concerned too but if he is just pointing out that forms of autism like his own arent necessarily conditions that we should be attempting to treat then that seems like a reasonable perspective to offer to people interested in autism research i dont know a lot about the details of the stances this guy takes but it doesnt seem like hes advocating anything so controversial that his views arent worth giving an audience to especially given that he has autism
canada,not_removed,but it really makes the parents feel better to believe they have an indigo child instead of a child facing severe deficits functional issues and who cares if these beliefs prevent ameliorating the harm the child suffers not the parents hell it helps them to ignore any risk factors they may feel guilty about or just cruel fate there is a plan a reason nothing is wrong
canada,not_removed,chopra is worth kilowoos
canada,not_removed,you have no idea ive met parents that give their kids bleach water change their diets drastically ignore them completely put them in therapy for hrs a week in their room with a therapist and thats just scratching the surface ive seen and been told about a lot of fucked up shit that is just crazy but for some reason seen as totally normal because their kid has autism
canada,not_removed,id say that repeatedly referring to autism as a kind of intellectual gift and appropriating historical figures to propagate that baseless claim is a pretty dangerous position and no he weakly recognizes that autism in its more extreme forms is a disability he doesnt go much further than that and it appears he is still opposed to any kind of cure for such a disability but if he is just pointing out that forms of autism like his own arent necessarily conditions that we should be attempting to treat then that seems like a reasonable perspective to offer to people interested in autism research he wasnt diagnosed until he was in his and by his own admission didnt have any major hurdles as a result the reality is that as a society were not employing any disruptive treatments for people like that but that level of function is also not necessarily typical of autism and of people with autism have some kind of learning disabilty and a further have significant difficult with verbal communication i could go on but the point is that its a serious illness and we shouldt pretend its not that doesnt mean we should disparage or disrespect autistic people but thats a lot different than changing the entire way medicine and society views the disease and addresses it what neurodiversity seems to require like so many ideas from far left ideology is a kind of willful collective delusion
canada,not_removed,parents of autistic children are the biggest opponents of the neurodiversity movement actually they dont need to be convinced that what theyre dealing with is not gods gift to humanity the biggest proponents tend to be high functioning autistics or self diagnosed autistics whove never had any significant hurdles from their mild autism this is not unusual for an antipsychiatry movement the us and uk movements in the and were also lead by people with mental illness in one case one of the most prominent voices was a violent schizophrenic who abused and terrorized her family this continues to be the pattern and the movement tends to find support on the radical left which is why there is overlap between radical feminism and antipsychiatry movements its a big fucking mess of ideologies
canada,not_removed,ive met parents that give their kids bleach water change their diets drastically its infuriating coworkers of mine deal with it on a regular basis with intakes ignore them completely usually chalked up to poor training for the parents ignoring problem behaviours is taught with behaviour modification but usually they just go steps further put them in therapy for hrs a week individual therapy as in behaviour modificaiton is extraordinarily effective when children are young
canada,not_removed,i guess i basically agree with the fact that autism is debilitating in lots of cases and we should try to help people in those cases but i just dont see a good reason to dismiss this guy as a quack given that hes speaking largely from personal experience the fact that he went undiagnosed is also quite possibly due to the time he grew up in he might very well have been diagnosed if he had been a child today
canada,not_removed,attempting to discredit this guy using arguments that are invalid isnt doing you any favours youre making your own position sound very shaky some of the quotes youve highlighted indicate that chopra simply has a different view of autism personally this resonates with me because i always try to find the basis of why specific traits genotypes and phenotypes are passed down mild autism individuals are likely to be credited with finding answers to difficult problems throughout human history simply because they capable of dedicating so much brainpower to specific tedious problems also i think a couple of the statements you make are also strawman arguments like who cares if you say he is opposed to a cure there is no known cure and how would there be if its hereditary there may be symptom suppression or prepost fertilization genetic manipulation but its unusual for expressions of genes to have cures you can criticize the guy for not supporting gene therapy but thats stupid because so few people would be able to afford it that its a moot point i think youre hung up on the empirical method maybe you want to see conclusive results based on empirical tests and thats fine probably there are thousands if not millions of people who want that as well but those conclusions dont suggest anything other than what we already know so then what are you going to do put a scientist up on stage and tell the conference that everyone with autism is autistic and its conclusive that they are suffering from it that doesnt help anyone but mindset does help people and thats why chopra was chosen if youre stuck dealing with this type of disability or genotype then some rehash of lab results wont help you worth shit but what will help you is understanding that there were others before you shared your condition who were able to strive despite the setbacks and who were able to make a difference no lab coat goggle eye is going to be able to create that vision for the audience
canada,not_removed,autism isnt a behavioral issue autistic adults overwhelmingly see aba as a negative it can be helpful but it misses the mark in so many fundamental ways
canada,not_removed,i think youre getting swept up in the tone of the message rather than the message itself the basic claim of neurodiversity is that the problem of autism is the way society perceives autism that we dont really need to have any kind of intervention or prevention we just need to look at it differently and build society around the perceived problem this is typical postmodern nonsense and its dangerous the next thing that happens is that medicine and psychiatry are blamed for the pathologizing of what is merely a healthy difference this is simply not true and the only evidence given in support is that metal illness and disability have always existed the same can be said of cancer it doesnt mean its something we should allow to persist or that a cancer ridden body is merely part of the spectrum of healthy bodies i urge you to do some reading up on similar movements like the earlier antipsychiatry movements as they follow a similar pattern and also claim the problem is merely one of perspective and not a genuine health problem edit i should qualify some of that because the basic premise has some merit if we were talking about something like adhd which neurodiversity proponents tack onto their movement likely because its an easy target the idea that the problem is with the construction of our society and what we deem normal behaviour is not entirely lacking merit that probably is true to an extent the problem with applying the same logic to autism is that unless youre talking about very high functioning autistics its a ridiculous claim and without question self harm an inability to communicate verbally or at all and the plethora of other symptoms associated with autism is a disability and something we should do our best to eradicate with ethical curative therapies
canada,not_removed,were not even talking about chopra so i am not even going to engage with all that shit you just wrote
canada,not_removed,autism isnt a behavioral issue correct but that doesnt mean they are exempt from the principles of behaviourism autistic adults overwhelmingly see it as a negative which is why individuals with autism adult or child would engage in that behaviour less frequently because they dislike being ignored
canada,not_removed,i admit im not very knowledgeable about this but i think saying that his claims can be equated to calling cancer a healthy difference arent really appropriate people who have autism can be proud of their autism and see it as a vital part of their identity and not want to be treated this is not a thing with cancer also cancer is a fatal disease its also worth pointing out that psychiatry does actually have a history of pathologizing conditions which we absolutely dont any more diagnosing women with hysteria or viewing homosexuality as an illness for example so its not like the type of claim hes making doesnt have any historical precedent this being said i will look more into the neurodiversity movement in general i can definitely sympathize with the concern that it could have nasty consequences if taken to an extreme
canada,not_removed,man quit being so hung up on the empirical method
canada,not_removed,ah i meant see aba as a negative many autistic adults feel it is very abusive and that by focusing on behaviors traumatized them as children not totally my opinion but i dont feel hrs of aba therapy helps more then other approaches which dont focus purely on behaviors
canada,not_removed,well depression seems to run in my family should i be proud of that hey while were at it my dad brother and i all have adhd maybe adhd is just part of who we are blegh im not ashamed of either of those things and people with autism shouldnt be ashamed of their condition but their minds and my mind does not operate in a healthy optimal fashion
canada,not_removed,people who have autism can be proud of their autism and see it as a vital part of their identity and not want to be treated sure and i am not saying otherwise but its entirely different to suggest that we should divert funding away from finding a cure for what is often an absolutely terrible disease or suggest that the problem with the autism is simply how we look at it this is not a thing with cancer also cancer is a fatal disease i was using an extreme example its also worth pointing out that psychiatry does actually have a history of pathologizing conditions which we absolutely dont any more diagnosing women with hysteria or viewing homosexuality as an illness for example so its not like the type of claim hes making doesnt have any historical precedent absolutely but lets not throw the baby out with the bathwater either i dont see any compelling arguments being presented for why autism fits the pattern of medicine inappropriately pathologizing healthy behaviour as was the case with homosexuality conversely there are also examples of movements to depathologize clearly serious illness or behaviour schizophrenia being one and more recently there has been an effort to manipulate scientific findings about pedophelia in any case do look into it there is lots to see and much of it is concerning imo
canada,not_removed,is there a better method you have in mind other than the one that has lead to the vast majority of human advancement
canada,not_removed,many autistic adults with autism feel it is very abusive ftfy this is also why informed consent and person first program plans are important and that by focusing on behaviors traumatized them as children what should they have focused on then but i dont feel hrs of aba therapy helps more then other approaches i havent seen many evidence based approaches that work close to as well as aba
canada,not_removed,im not telling anybody to be proud of anything i just noted that its a fact that some people with autism are proud of their autism and dont want to change it i fully recognize that for a lot of people their autism is also debilitating i was only pointing out that when a man who has autism claims that he doesnt believe his autism is a pathology that needs to be treated then i think thats a legitimate perspective that deserves to be heard i suffer from depression personally and im neither proud of it nor do i view it as some essential part of my personality so im sorry if i offended you somehow with what i said i didnt mean to do that as for your relatives with adhd you should probably ask them if they like it like i said i dont want to be in the business of triviliaizng other peoples illnesses
canada,not_removed,oh im not offended it just seems to me that whether someone is proud of their disorder or not the truth is that in the end its a disorder that needs to be fixed if possible people can be proud for who they are and the obstacles in life theyd conquered im proud that ive mostly got my depression under control just like im sure lots of people with autism who do the same are proud of themselves and they should be this world is not kind to people who have any sort of problem physical or mental

canada,not_removed,one plaque to rule them all
canada,not_removed,i like how they misspelled duchess on the plaque and totally ignore prince william
canada,not_removed,how could queen elizabeth have put up a plaque in when she didnt become queen until i call shenanigans
canada,not_removed,sillyness ensues
canada,not_removed,im not sure what policy would even change tbh
canada,not_removed,i think if this shooting leads to any policy changes it will not resonate well with canadians already neutral on or skeptic of refugees and muslim immigration or worse it could be the last straw for antirefugee canadians explanation needed with the vast influence from recent events from the south canadian ideologies are too delicate at the moment explanation needed i think not reacting is the best thing we can do besides affecting our collective views it is absolutely unnecessary unproductive and counterproductive those are contradictory to react it is dumb to let one moron affect our countrys society and political state i just edited because some of it is confusing as hell to read
canada,not_removed,there is no policy that will stop random act of violence from happening what we need to do as a country is show our support for the local community effected by this event
canada,not_removed,i agree with you on this one after the montreal shooting back in the day magazines were limited to to somehow reduce the damage done at a shooting not working well is it but many legal gun and rifle owners are inconvenienced because some politician had to look good and make a loud statement torontos mayor tory had ridiculous and uninformed comments on the gun topic a few weeks back there are more people dying from alcohol and tobacco related deaths drug overdoses both illegal and prescription yet guns are the real evil people are fear mongered by media on behalf of politicians to make them easier to control divide and conquer is the reason canada likes diversity voter turnouts and results are a good indicators
canada,not_removed,i dont think that there is going to be any policy changes because of this shooting but i dont think we should ignore this hate inspired attack just because it might make other hateful andor ignorant people feel persecuted
canada,not_removed,put money into campaigns targetting the alt right we need to win the culture war decidedly these diversity is our greatest asset type of campaigns do nothing but appeal to people currently with those values they need to study the rhetoric and shut it down give cbc their requested budget increase to achieve it
canada,not_removed,jesus just prosecute the bastard and move on you know what he wanted attention you know what were not going to give him any more attention let him rot the rest of his days in some forgotten prison somewhere
canada,not_removed,already sceptic or neutral canadians on refugee and muslim immigration or worse it could be the last straw for antirefugee canadians the shooter was not a refugee he wasnt even muslim why would this be the last straw
canada,not_removed,so hes a racist thats a big charge
canada,not_removed,you cant stop a lone gunman there is no practical means short of complete control over the population
canada,not_removed,except neither of those things would have impacted this shooting the shooter was a born and bred quebecois and it appears he had legal access to a gun which is perfectly legal and then illegally modified it if at all
canada,not_removed,as if changing either policy wouldve impacted things
canada,not_removed,keto is the real deal is about to get sexy
canada,not_removed,rebel media gets a few hundred thousand views on their videos ever look at comments on any news site all filled with extreme racism facebook is filled with fake news and conspiracy theories pol is a highly visited board even look at rcanada and the strong alt right presence on here its not just some small problem sure not many people actually consider themselves alt right but theres a lot of similarities in viewpoints i dont mean only insulting them either someone has to stop their disinformation campaigns
canada,not_removed,i have no inherent distrust fear or hatred of guns i respect them for what they are like i do fire but i would never proclaim them contraband hell id like to own a gun a solid a gun close to my heart but its banned and we are not to be but honestly my point is moot by all accounts as far as we know he was just a normal dude dude with a chip on his shoulder but normalish likely would seem socially feral but in an ignorable as another dweeb looking for attention online kind of way
canada,not_removed,i know emotional response
canada,not_removed,can you link the gun info thats what interests me right now
canada,not_removed,i only made a huge neon sign that called them racist
canada,not_removed,either way never outright accused him of it dude you totally did
canada,not_removed,at a certain point there is really not much more screening that can be done without talking about minority report type stuff or other forms of profiling that no one wants
canada,not_removed,there is no site saying what gun it was but this is what has been reported it was reported that he had an ak though it is unlikely since that gun is illegal that it was a restricted weapon meaning not an ak that he hasnt been charged with possession of a firearm meaning that it likely wasnt illegal for him to have one
canada,not_removed,millions of assholes are now trolling the fuck out of each other on the internet one of them with a gun murdered people there may be no definition that could have prevented his hand from touching that weapon
canada,not_removed,i really hope they come to us with full details soon logical thorough and truthful facts this is a god damn mess and it needs clearing up
canada,not_removed,old people be fuckin
canada,not_removed,jesus christ cant you people wear goddam condoms
canada,not_removed,is this why my ass itches
canada,not_removed,theres even a website plentyofsyphcom
canada,not_removed,so thats where grandma gets her aches and pains
canada,not_removed,condoms arent all that effective against syphilis
canada,not_removed,when all else fails blame the millennials
canada,not_removed,i use it as well as my roommate in canada so i pay per year for unlimited texting and calling as does my roommate i also have a gig a month tablet data plan that costs a month that i use in canada and when im at our south east asia office i use a local plan that comes out around a month my roommate has wifi at his work as well as at home and doesnt bother with datacalling on the road full ghetto you can get buy for around a month but if its possible to find a a month tablet plan or an extension to a friendfamily plan giving you to a month id do it
canada,not_removed,the real question is is there any accountability
canada,not_removed,i dont get these agreements whats stopping future govenrments of those countries to just not follow the agreement
canada,not_removed,yay we get to hear again how our hero jt agreed to do nothing
canada,not_removed,im not sure if the timing of this will make it less effective the us election is coming up so obama doesnt have much time left to get started on his end of the deal before he steps down and if trump wins i doubt this agreement will be something hell be interested in making good on
canada,not_removed,virtuesignalling
canada,not_removed,and i have decided to loose by next tuesday
canada,not_removed,no
canada,not_removed,nothing at all other than bad press also the chance of another deal like or similar to this being promised before is almost just obama continuing his exit legacy of being mrgreen energy rather than mrdrone strike
canada,not_removed,i think they all expect the agreement to be broken but for now they can jerk eachother off about how much theyve done to save the world just by talking about it and not taking any action its like when the liberals agreed to kyoto took no action whatsoever left the cpc with impossible targets and then blamed the cpc for breaking kyoto
canada,not_removed,considering that canada already has more than clean energy sources jt has in fact nothing to do to reach that goal
canada,not_removed,as beaubbe says he did in fact agree to do nothing in that respect as were way above that mark according to statscan data cansim table between hydro nuclear wind solar and tidal were already at about
canada,not_removed,true but the benefit to making these agreements in obamas position is the next leader then has to actively back out of them this draws attention and makes it more of an issue
canada,not_removed,if its not a legally binding agreement with significant penalties for failing to meet goals and ratified by the governments of all three nations by the time obama steps down then this is just a glorified photoshoot
canada,not_removed,and if trump wins god help us all
canada,not_removed,which leg you cutting off
canada,not_removed,all this virtue signalling is fucking batshit crazy when will our government take the economy seriously and realize that all this environmental regulation well good at heart does absolutely nothing for are massive carbon sink of a country
canada,not_removed,isnt that what i said
canada,not_removed,isnt that what i said
canada,not_removed,chance baby
canada,not_removed,you did but this is reddit and you need to spell it out s
canada,not_removed,i think you replied to the wrong person
canada,not_removed,its crazy they went missing in the cyprus alpine area the snowshoeing and cross country trails are extremely well travelled they must have gotten very very lost
canada,not_removed,very sad but good call shutting down the search to avoid further risk to searchers nsr also has frequent searches and being volunteer staffed the sooner those searchers are available for other operations the better condolences to the family
canada,not_removed,sad but its been a search for their remains for days now
canada,not_removed,if you are serious about going out in the backcountry have a plan for if you get into trouble please carry a radio a sat phone or a plb no rescue agency that is worth their salt does cost recovery dont wait until the situation gets dire to ask for help some good radio frequencies to know if you have a marine band vhf radio chanel is the emergency chanel if you are carrying a radio that you program by freq is the airborne emergency frequency all aircraft are supposed to monitor the frequency and all commercial aircraft automatically do it the ultimate weapon of choice is a plb your plb has your info attached to it and rescue authorities can detect you location anywhere on the planet via satellite
canada,not_removed,if you do a lot of backcountry activities plb are pretty affordable these days
canada,not_removed,if they kept looking theyd have found them in may
canada,not_removed,why do they seem to think its likely they are dead or in grave danger it says theyre very experienced outdoorsmen couldnt someone with proper training potentially survive indefinitely in the wild
canada,not_removed,and now they are very very dead im willing to bet they went they had no pack no plan and never looked at a map of the area take notes and learn from their deaths i guess
canada,not_removed,they started on holyburn and ended up sighted on the howe sound crest i dont even how
canada,not_removed,yes but very experienced outdoorsmen would have made themselves found by now if they werent dead or severely disabled and if theyre seriously disabled its highly unlikely they could keep themselves alive in this weather
canada,not_removed,five days means something very bad has happened
canada,not_removed,where does it say theyre very experienced outdoorsmen i didnt see anything about that in the article
canada,not_removed,learn from their deaths i guess never leave your house
canada,not_removed,harsh bro
canada,not_removed,why are you so certain they are dead if they had warm jackets hats gloves etc they wouldnt die from exposure and they could get water by drinking snow someone could easily survive a few days with no food and plenty of water so what do you think killed them sorry if these questions seem obtuse im a cityslicker through and through cheers
canada,not_removed,reportedly they are part of a hiking group and they were out scouting new trails
canada,not_removed,thats the nature ofwellnature
canada,not_removed,even if they had good equipment and food if you get wet theres no way to dry out without a fire the most minor of injuries out in the wilderness can also take you out its tough to have hope at this point
canada,not_removed,six days where they have had to stop the search once before because of weather conditions and yeah they could very easily die of exposure on the first night if they dont have a clue what they are doing
canada,not_removed,eating snow just isnt efficient enough for humans to successfully avoid dying of dehydration or lowering their core temperature a fist sized snowball wont yield more than roughly of water at a very large cost of energy to warm up the issue is the snow to water transformation has a large energy barrier you need to over come also when youre playing in snow nothing is ever waterproof by design otherwise youd be drenched in sweat so its a matter of when not if
canada,not_removed,warm clothing only gets you so far the thing that keeps you warm is your body which means food and water temperatures are below zero so theyre burning lots of calories just to exist nevermind the frostbite they likely have as for drinking snow it takes more energy for the body to melt the snow than you get from the water it produces from the melt
canada,not_removed,if theyre like many of the hiking groups around here that means they hike together on fairly easy trails while being poorly prepared they were probably prepared to be out in the cold for max hours yeah theyre dead
canada,not_removed,well that would help explain how they got lost if thats the case hopefully said hiking group will invest in some in reach units for their members
canada,not_removed,is scouting new trails legal i thought you were not supposed to go off trail in parks
canada,not_removed,know how i know youve never spent a day out in the coast range in winter
canada,not_removed,goretex doesnt stay waterproof yes water will bead up on it but in time it gets wet both from water slowly seeping into it from outside as well as sweat from the inside in short you still get wet
canada,not_removed,its hard not to sweat in nearzero highhumidity conditions if youre actually planning to overnight in the winter you have to move slowly enough that you dont sweat people out for a recreational snowshoe probably arent being so careful
canada,not_removed,short answer most gortex is water resistant not fully water proof longer answer creating something waterproof is really very simple one could just wear a garabage bag the trouble is if your exerting yourself water vapour cant excape and you just get wet from sweat gortex uses a membrane that allows vapour to escape while being able to block most outside water however in order for it to be breathable there is always the possibility of outside water being able penetrate the barrier since this barrier is negatively affected by dirt and not very durable it is often lamented with an outer fabric this creates a problem if and when the outer fabric becomes saturated with water as the pooled water will be able to move across the membrane especially where there is already moisture on the inside of the mebrane durable water proof coatings out side this fabric help to keep water away from the outer fabric but when wet heavy snow sticks to it and melts it can only hold out so long personal experience will confirm i have soaked an gortex jacket from the outside in

canada,not_removed,ughmeaningful full time whatever that means might not be a type of work anyone should be expecting anymorebut keep in mind that canadian unemployment rate is still well below that of many developed countries and once unemployed you do have a social network that not many other developed countries do
canada,not_removed,hiv is tricky to detect because what we detect is your bodys response to the virus not the virus itself your body can take a while to respond months is the mark the blood sample is also much more reliable than the quick test most clinics who use the quick test will also draw a sample for the lab because the quick test can give false negatives and false positives another major thing a lot of people dont know is pep if you know youve been exposed to hiv you got hours to start the pep treatment and it can keep you from getting infected every hospital has it
canada,not_removed,ive travelled through winnipeg and wanted to kill myself i cant imagine what morale would be like playing hockey there every away game would be such a welcome escape
canada,not_removed,i got the full meal deal my family doctor got bloodurine samples and fondled my balls got the results days later so there is still a chance i could have hiv ps thanks for the tip about pep
canada,not_removed,when was your last unprotected vaginalanal intercourse the idea is that if it were months before the test youre virtually certain you dont have hiv but if youve had sex every day until the test then it doesnt mean much but you cant go insane over this i mean if youre with your so and no one cheats youre safe also gay men are of new infections so if youre a straight man your chances are low just dont obsess over it
canada,not_removed,straight man and it was thailand so there were a few hookers and some tourists only vaginal and all but who wasnt a hooker and claimed to be clean with a condom im not obsessing or really worried at all i just didnt know about that
canada,not_removed,once youll be tested months after your last experience youll be good its good youre not worried its easy to start obsessing when you find out youre never sure which i do all the time lol
canada,not_removed,this is fineif prices rise like or a year you knowlike inflation or your salary does anyone thinking the rises weve seen in some areas will continue for a decade or more are complete fantasists or mortgage holders
canada,not_removed,greed is never satisfied and continually wants more
canada,not_removed,this idiot is delusional but then again hes a real estate guy so he has no credibility prices have skyrocketed while incomes have stayed flat the entire thing has been fueled by debt and chinese buyers interest rates cant go any lower so the debt tap is turning off its just a question of when china clamps down on the money laundering toronto prices will drop by within three years
canada,not_removed,and then the big short
canada,not_removed,apparently someone forgot their history you know how much toronto real estate valuations grew between and nothing it was stagnant the turned into the there was massive growth in the and thenbupkis for a decade i highly doubt well see a crash if alberta hasnt fallen off a cliff then the rest of canada wont either what well see is ten years of stagnation maybe even more
canada,not_removed,i love how all of these problems talk about house prices yet the real bubble in this country are auto loans httpwwwmacleanscaeconomybusinessisthereanautobubbleonthehorizon is going to be what sets the economy tumbling and housing will be collateral damage companies are making bank on packaging and reselling highrisk auto loans the same way they did in the us with mortgages yet we have virtually no regulations surrounding these types of loans
canada,not_removed,wow i really just need to sit here for a moment and realize is that did i fuck up in my life that i cannot afford a car or house at with kids or is the cost of living just wayy to high for what it should be
canada,not_removed,i claim bullshit on this article there is no way for prices to go higher without lowering the interest rate or going into negative interest rates if negative interest rates do become a thing that will only prolong the problem for maybe years and you wont see much of a rise
canada,not_removed,many houses are getting multiple offers prices can rise rapidly on a house because of this whether this price exceeds the real value of the house is debatable are there any stories of banks declining increases in mortgages because the value of the house does not support it
canada,not_removed,i get those points too but theres a lot of particularly special circumstances that create the housing prices in sf bay area like all youve suggested however the relatively high wages have also contributed to those prices la isnt as expensive and still has real estate with average prices i believe op at the top of the thread was suggesting that toronto prices are what they are purely because thats how much big cities cost the nyc boroughs arent as expensive as the gta and theyre far more transit accessible la is far bigger in population than toronto and has real estate options cheaper than us even one user here pointed out zillow prices in chicago chicago is our closest representation by size etc and it also our sister city re options there are also not as heated even in better off areas the point here is that toronto isnt expensive because thats how big cities are there are bigger cities with more affordable re options were not on the same level as the nys and londons of the world
canada,not_removed,imagine the nightmare scenario that is paying for a condo thats barely living room size i guess thats a growing canadian economy for ya
canada,not_removed,food and housing costs are up since but they dont include that in the inflation index why because it reflects actual inflation the reality is that our money is being dramatically reduced in value by low interest rates and bing lending the truth is found in gold housing land and anything that actually exists in the real world
canada,not_removed,think the market may be overvalued in several metropolitan areas particularity those in the toronto area and western canada
canada,not_removed,bullshit were in a housing bubble thats going to crash very soon then the housing prices will fall
canada,not_removed,amen as a strong proponent of high real estate prices i hope the trend continues
canada,not_removed,depends on whether or not we continue to permit foreign cash to buy real estate
canada,not_removed,agreed the avg million houses will not hit million in the wages dont exist in canada to make this sustainable and we still have plenty of land in southern ontario there has to be a saturation point especially with boomers the largest population reducing in numbers even manhattan had a saturation limit in their explosion which was fueled by very high salaries and little space
canada,not_removed,fyi the year average even counting crashes is well above i remember right its closer to
canada,not_removed,you speak like someone who cant see the past
canada,not_removed,you sound like trump i would suggest you study demographics and immigration levels to see how important they are without them the workforce would be shrinking and taxation would dry up the real estate insanity is not from them but from excessive debt ie stupidity chasing prices driven by chinese investors it will end soon and not well for homeowners
canada,not_removed,so youre saying that spec buyers are the real issue because i live quite close to downtown toronto and all the new owners ive met have kids and are in for the long haul
canada,not_removed,people pouring in is a classic sign of a bubble in any investment category this will collapse soon
canada,not_removed,upwork is one of the better ones but try and phase it out as a primary source of income if you can unless youre making bank right now
canada,not_removed,ive had a lot of real estate agents pitch me the the next big idea that will revolutionize the world to me and in return for doing of the work i will gain experience and get a cut in the company i hate when people who dont code come at me like theyre steve jobs sorry im done with my rant
canada,not_removed,this sounds delusional prices have skyrocketed with flat incomes but affordability carrying costs has not skyrocketed in most places in canada only in vancouver and toronto has it really increased and torontos isnt even at record highs the entire thing is fueled by cheap money available in canada not debt from chinese buyers the us used quantitative easing to put money into their economy while in canada we used the housing market interest rates can go lower like they have in europe and japan toronto has real demand for housing and single family homes within the city are not at risk of decreasing by condos are more vulnerable however real demand exists for them as well
canada,not_removed,you didnt fuck up anything the cost of living has gotten higher especially in toronto and vancouver and real estate has boomed youre part of the generation that is going to either have to make that work or live outside the city and transit in the good news and my guess is that within ten years the government will have made massive investments in transit so the trip to and from work will be faster and easier were going to start to emulate more of a new york city model where owning a home with a yard means a train trip in to penn or grand central and back home again so you can make the money to pay for the home right now were not there yet our go trains are almost as crowded as subways sometimes but its going to have to happen
canada,not_removed,prices are going up every day and interest rates have held steady for the last little while
canada,not_removed,congrats and it will sounds like you bought for the right reasons too
canada,not_removed,assuming you have a mortgage you actually need it to double just to break even in the end
canada,not_removed,are immigrants not allowed to buy homes now
canada,not_removed,the thing is prices have fallen a number of times in nyc its not immune or a special place where prices just always go up big time
canada,not_removed,southern ontario has plenty of land but land within the greenbelt is getting more and more scarce reasonable commutes to toronto have limited housing options for most people entering the market
canada,not_removed,its a pretty easy calculation is the house priced at beyond times average income for the cityregion if so its overpriced
canada,not_removed,i speak like someone who was there for it united kingdom edition if you look at the indicators its coming here too needless to say im staying comfy in my rented apartment that benefits from government rent controls
canada,not_removed,you need to factor in ridiculously low interest rates and unsustainable wages if you want to get into the immigrant debate the real problems isnt those who come in on the points system and bring their skills at market value its those are used by corporations willing to work lower wages and longer hours to drive down working conditions for all that is closer to bernie sanders than trump
canada,not_removed,i was with you here you sound like trump and here the real estate insanity is not from them but from excessive debt ie stupidity chasing prices driven by chinese investors it will end soon and not well for homeowners people really are using the chinese as the go to instead of pointing to an out of control central banking system and the same fininicial instruments that brought down the american real estate markets being in canada cdos and so on people want to believe that because the government has raised the down payments on housing that that will correct the shitty problems being brought about by shitty interest rates which shitty rates are discussed here in this article no economist is going to deny how foreign ownership is having a part in raising real estate prices but from what i see going on bnn no one seems to be claiming it as the biggest part of the problem from my own observation of my child house and town there is no foreign money here and if there is its very slight im about minutes outside of the gta and there is no transit system to get to the gta like there is in guelph barrie newmarket ect my house has gone from in the mid to just under of that rise in price has been over the last to years with housing prices like that you would expect people moving into my neighbor hood would have bmws or merks nope they have junker old civics why because theyre leveraged to the hill and are house poor i feel like i can actually see the problems of household debt where i dont agree with you is the workforce and taxation would dry up without immigration but thats a topic for another day
canada,not_removed,people pouring in is also a classic sign of a booming industry the fact that there are so many developers building and yet prices continue to go up indicates that demand is strong and stable
canada,not_removed,im sorry im new to the mortgage game and am not especially bright can you explain what you mean here
canada,not_removed,with money they earn working in canada sure
canada,not_removed,you can also find many pieces of property in boroughs like brooklyn or queens that arent ridiculously expensive and are transit accessible
canada,not_removed,commutes from mississauga vaughan richmond hill or markham are already near hour it makes no sense for these cities to have housing over million where these communities are still surrounded by farmland in the north even outside toronto housing is getting insane and out of control
canada,not_removed,im curious where the came from isnt house price also many factors including population ranking etc for example a house in tokyo can be the average income without being overpriced while a house in the midwest usa might only be
canada,not_removed,theres a dif between value and price
canada,not_removed,most major cities london nyc sf etc are more like salary holds true for small cities not for world leaders
canada,not_removed,so like london new york chicago and san fransisco
canada,not_removed,how does price to income measure affordability price to income is going to be completely different in a interest environment than it is in a interest environment
canada,not_removed,theres no evidence whatsoever that house prices need to be tied to average income
canada,not_removed,ok u do that the difference is toronto and vancouver are driven by the supply side of course ill informed people like u have been taking shut for ten years
canada,not_removed,people pouring in is also a classic sign of a booming industry it depends on which people developers build in response to demand until they overbuild on speculation and it collapses see japan us greece italy spain ireland china toronto when average people are leveraging themsleves to the hilt and everyone and his dog is into flipping its a bubble the boomers are retiring and will want to sell canadas workforce peaks in get out while you can
canada,not_removed,avoid freelancer like its the black death guru is okay if i were you though id start looking at alternative job boards linkedin and possibly ways that you can earn a passive income just dont rely on marketplaces
canada,not_removed,when you factor in the legal fees interest associated taxes and maintenance the cost of a house is way more than just the mortgage amount so in effect to break even youll actually need the house to go up in value quite substantially if you view a house as somewhere to live this isnt really the be all and end all for you it might not be important at all youd just view it as a cost of living in a house you hopefully enjoy a lot of people though view their houses as a nest egg investment or piggy bank which they strip equity out of as necessary for these people just breaking even after years is probably a crap investment
canada,not_removed,so if an immigrant moves here and uses their savings to buy a house we shouldnt allow that i know tons of immigrants living here that werent citizens when they bought their homes
canada,not_removed,where are you finding this easily accessible and reasonably priced housing in brooklyn
canada,not_removed,im curious why where the came from its what most people find an affordable expense assume your income or your household income is after taxes youre probably taking home ball park figure somewhere around or a month a mortgage for years at historically low rates is about a month or about of your available income thats just on the mortgage we havent even factored in the associated costs like property taxes insurance or maintenance etc of course if you skew the market by basically turning properties into casino chips for wealthy overseas multimillionaires then yes some condo in downtown vancouver or toronto or ny or london for x millions of dollars is absolutely affordable back in the real world however youre more likely to an actual local resident and be mr blue collar or mr white collar and youre probably not sitting with a few million bucks in your back pocket doing nothing
canada,not_removed,canada has none of these world leading cities toronto is our best shot but its in the third tier overallalong with chicago a city ive dealt with in other comments as noted there is plenty of affordable housing in that city there is no city in canada where housing needs to cost beyond what a quite well paid local worker can afford unfortunately we know thats an increasingly alien idea even in the small cities here
canada,not_removed,sf is only expensive because of the tech sector there it has none of the qualities that nyc or london have property is expensive because average wages are incredibly high there
canada,not_removed,chicago a useful reference as its a city ive actually lived in average household income there is about you can easily find homes in chicago in the area and you dont even need to go south of river never go south of the river
canada,not_removed,indeed it is if people think interest rates will be close to zero forever theyre also complete fantasists central banks everywhere are storing up a world of pain by doing anything they can to keep rates at rock bottom why well how many people when going to sign on the dotted line for years considered how different a mortgage payment at is from one at even not many theyre already basically beyond maximum even at see the related explosions in tapping home equity credit card or credit lines debts a lot of people are basically cooked if they have so much as months out of work in the next several decades
canada,not_removed,well yeah if you let in rich foreign buyers and open the gates on handing out year mortgages at low interest to fuel out of control bidding wars in nycsf wages have gone up with housing prices keeping it sustainable
canada,not_removed,jesus dude your anecdote does not mean anything when there are actual statistics that tell us the truth and the truth is that the majority of people aged – are living in their parents home doesnt fucking matter about you and your friends you are not representative of the norm
canada,not_removed,okay that makes sense thank you im trying to not view the house as a get rich plan but its hard to ignore that mentality here in bc
canada,not_removed,yeah but its an investmenta place to live you act likes its one or the other most people live in the houses they buy for longer than the term of their mortgage you can start making use of that equity in your retirement or you can leave it for your kids let alone the facts that a mortgage opens up all types of credit options that wouldnt exist if you were simply renting plus with the money you dont need to pay the bank right away you can invest in stable funds and get way highers returns than your interest payments making it worth it to defer payment plus if youre getting into a variable rate mortgage youre getting an even lower cost than a year fixed mortgage although you do need to make sure you can really afford your payments if you take on a variable rate loan because of the interest rate risk
canada,not_removed,that is the extreme end of the spectrum the middle ground may be limiting the amount of foreign wealth a permanent resident can spend on real estate to reflect say the average house price in a given city the ultimate point being do canadians want to regulate the market so that theyre not out bid by foreign wealth
canada,not_removed,but just because a house is unaffordable by the majority of the population doesnt necessarily mean its overpriced right the majority of renters living in london tokyo manhattan etc will never afford a house in the city however housing prices in those cities dont look overpriced to me considering theyll probably never fall to a income or anywhere close in my lifetime at least
canada,not_removed,toronto and vancouver are consistently ranked in the top world class cities
canada,not_removed,also the bay area doesnt have much room for expansion being water locked unlike southern ontario and its vast farmlands
canada,not_removed,sf prices were pretty high even before the tech boom degree weather year round stuck on a peninsula with no room to expand political climate that makes building higher density almost impossible and further constrains supply close to the ocean mountains the best agricultural land in the country its not only because of tech
canada,not_removed,you can easily find homes in chicago in the area what s the crime level in those areas
canada,not_removed,in the core or an el ride away think we both know the answer to that
canada,not_removed,actually central banks around the world are having problems increasing interest rates at all the us false started again this month the problem is that since they have all pumped up their economies with new money and now the economies are saturated with so much new money that the interest rate tool from the banks is virtually powerless so i would say those that expect to see rates near again may be living in the same fantasy world this is a that describes the problem central bankers face
canada,not_removed,wages go up naturally with inflation and economic development the real question is have wages in those cities gone up portional to real estate value i dont have the data at hand but i would wager they have not
canada,not_removed,so a rich foriegn person wont move here because they can only live in shit houses cool sure limit home buying by those buying homes and not living in them but dont act like most foreigners arent buying their houses for the sake of legitimately moving to canada
canada,not_removed,id say it does if i told you a bag of milk was going to cost you starting tomorrow youd probably think that was overpriced doesnt matter than is nothing to someone with millions of dollars
canada,not_removed,look for yourself fire up a site like zillow go to chicago and filter it to say and look at hundreds or thousands of options all inside the city limits there are even condos for that sort of money on michigan ave
canada,not_removed,larry summers and good my skepticism bell is ringing
canada,not_removed,is not the majority idiot
canada,not_removed,again under the extreme end of the spectrum said immigrants could use whatever they earn in canada to buy a home if they have jobs great if theyre not working in canada then they can rent now im not saying we go that far but i recognize the premise that real estate should be priced based on local wages so its not as if the policy has no underlying logic
canada,not_removed,milk is different because its constantly produced and its value is based on the cost of production and profit margin land is valued based on how desirable the area is i wouldnt consider something to be overvalued if its value is never likely to fall
canada,not_removed,you avoided the fact that house prices are high in those cities despite being out of reach for most of the population
canada,not_removed,youre right i just took your advice and fired up zillow saw a bedroom bath condo on east for its bigger than my fucking house i stand corrected and now transfixed with zillow for the remainder of my evening appreciate the reply
canada,not_removed,i mean look at that chart the only cities in the study with cheaper house prices are johannesburg cape town and istanbul and people in chicago make way more money theres probably no city in the entire world that is simultaneously as important as chicago and as cheap
canada,not_removed,heyyy this one got published in foreign affairs
canada,not_removed,why should real estate be priced on local wages does that mean every summer home should be cheap as dirt because all the rich people that own those homes live in the city real estate should be priced like every other good based on how much money people are willing to give up to get it the logical reduction of your argument is that we shouldnt allow anyone to buy property anywhere they havent been living because they didnt earn that money in the local area so i shouldnt be allowed to move to new brunswick and buy a house because my wage is different than the people living there and i didnt earn my money in new brunswick
canada,not_removed,but there are also essentially limitless numbers of consumers for milk you can often export it too if local demand isnt high enough while housing is more limited so are the amounts of people able to access it increasingly so the whole market relies on both sellers and buyers being available prices going up a year when the actual salary of people buying the houses doesnt go up anywhere near this amount means you have a fantasy market based on completely unrealistic economics someone or some institution ends up being left holding the bag eventually you run out of chinese multimillionaires or people taking on mortgages for or or their lagging income suddenly the house is functionally worthless if youre trying to flog it people all the around the world have experienced this take your pick of comedy markets in the likes of the us uk ireland or numerous others unfortunately when the shit clogs up the fan and it stops spinning its often the taxpayer who is called upon to shore up the system or bail out those who were basically speculating in a ponzi scheme it is in no ones long term interest to have a housing market like we see in many areas in canada
canada,not_removed,dont forget to look at fallujah otherwise known as the south side there be dragons and cheap boarded up houses you could buy an entire block for
canada,not_removed,its not really an outlier the issue in chicago is that about half the city resembles the third world in the parts of chicago that most people would define as habitable the pricing is somewhat more standard
canada,not_removed,real estate should be tied to local wages if the majority of voters want it to be so
canada,not_removed,the majority of voters dont understand anything about economics
canada,not_removed,and ignorant voters may perpetually support policy that is not in their best interest
canada,not_removed,hilarious we best bell when it comes to fibre but they win in manitoba fucking joke
canada,not_removed,oh good i really hated having to chose between so many options all that needless research to best meet my needs at an affordable price this will really streamline my internet service choice at a marginal increase to my current bill by removing the option that kept the bigger companies like shaw reasonably priced thank you bell you are the true canadian media provider and your cravetv is hands down better than nothing even if not by a lot
canada,not_removed,welcome to nationwide prices manitoba friends
canada,not_removed,dear manitobians get ready for higher prices love the bell empire
canada,not_removed,if the takeover is anything like the aliant one not a whole lot will change we hadhave the best fiber in canada and bell didnt ruin it
canada,not_removed,canadian border guard asks supervisor and senior superintendent if he can accept free concert tickets from elton john told no asks for tickets anyway and is now in trouble ftfy im genuinely curious why hes fighting the suspension when he had two superiors tell him not to take the tickets and he took them anyway a two week suspension doesnt seem that bad compared to punishments like being fired
canada,not_removed,a two week suspension is a pretty fair trade here hes lucky they only suspended him
canada,not_removed,good he should be in trouble ethics aint complicated two week suspension is fair
canada,not_removed,when you start your job as a cbsa officer you are explicitly told that accepting gifts could get you fired he knew this was unacceptable two weeks is more than fair
canada,not_removed,civil servants are generally not allowed to receive gifts at all whether theyre in a law enforcement role or not the fact that this officer is fighting over a slap on the wrist when they would have ample grounds for termination shows how detatched he is from reality
canada,not_removed,took a bribe didnt get fired wtf kinda shit is this and then he has the gall to complain to the labour board what a piece of shit
canada,not_removed,damnit kyle why you gotta be that guy all the time
canada,not_removed,to be fair second row tickets to that concert are pretty cool
canada,not_removed,ask and ye shall not receive but nooooooo but stupid takes them anyway
canada,not_removed,is this a bribe did the boarder guard let in elton because of the tickets would elton not have got in otherwise
canada,not_removed,its pretty difficult to fire a public servant source federal public servant
canada,not_removed,imagine what cash can get you i would start sniffing around where theres smoketheres fire
canada,not_removed,agreed its not really a huge deal probably embarrassing more than anything what is he saying that he thinks he should be able to accept gifts
canada,not_removed,civil servants are generally not allowed to receive gifts at al christmas time must be particularly shitty for them
canada,not_removed,im not entirely sure it was a bribe more than just a gift but because it can be interpreted as a gift by the public theyre told to just not accept anything assuming i read it correctly
canada,not_removed,theyre watched electronicallyif they let someone in too many times without checking them even the same license red flags go up its happened a number if times hes a typical dumb cop though so yes he bears watching
canada,not_removed,but sir my kid spent all day making this for me out of cardboard and macaroni doesnt matter no gifts pack your shit
canada,not_removed,yeah giving someone tickets so they dont search you
canada,not_removed,i think you mean as a bribe rather then a gift
canada,not_removed,yeah sorry i wrote it on my phone didnt pay much attention p
canada,not_removed,says the man who took the bribe all we know is that a civil servant received a present and then lo and behold the person who gave the present was cleared through customs with nary a problem
canada,not_removed,is the source advertising recruiting services to people in these occupations and using this data to attract them i am curious about his methodology salary raises of across the board at a time when our economy is tanking strikes me as wishful thinking
canada,not_removed,a median would be better than an average for statistics of this nature in my opinion
canada,not_removed,well my friends in the financial sector is not buying this one just had a department axed so shes happy to be on payroll
canada,not_removed,probably from rises in minimum wage
canada,not_removed,is supposed to be good that should be expected as a minimum
canada,not_removed,im willing to bet its due to minimum wage increases most province from have had min wage some increases exceeding since this is the average raising the floor has a large impact
canada,not_removed,not useful for pushing an agenda
canada,not_removed,meh for relative comparison it makes little difference
canada,not_removed,front line call centre work is it it is largely within the range most would consider minimum or near minimum the same can be said for basic accounting and pay roll your looking at the positions you want to not the one which are within the spectrum
canada,not_removed,ban them
canada,not_removed,is this part of the muslim contribution to canada that justin was talking about
canada,not_removed,the liberals should take heed from their australian counterparts and move a little to the right more conservative policies on security immigration and multiculturalism and that means stop being so politically correct and loose that we get situations where government is facilitating crime and antisocial behavior
canada,not_removed,for half a second there i was wondering about the mother then i realized just how stupid i was
canada,not_removed,so who did they let in the room mik jagger castro
canada,not_removed,its pretty gross i wouldnt recommend it
canada,not_removed,their citation is a justin trudeau quote in an article from last year can we find any actual evidence of this
canada,not_removed,it never ceases to amaze me that pierre at courting an year old margaret while he was a federal minister gets glossed over so much that would sooooo not go down these days
canada,not_removed,til that trudeau has a halfsister that he doesnt talk about ever
canada,not_removed,ugh fathers fathers
canada,not_removed,just in time for castro to get away with it ayyy sorry
canada,not_removed,he truly is the chosen one
canada,not_removed,am i supposed to give him credit for this
canada,not_removed,fidel was there in spirit edit its a joke people
canada,not_removed,but castro wasnt there in the birthing room
canada,not_removed,his name is justin castro please fix it thanks
canada,not_removed,since when is it banned for fathers to be in birth rooms the doctor let my dad deliver the baby and cut the ombilical cord himself for each baby my parents had
canada,not_removed,valid concern women have notoriously tormented storks
canada,not_removed,oh honey
canada,not_removed,what no mother isnt it
canada,not_removed,dr doofenshmirtz
canada,not_removed,yeah it was the speed he shot out after the top half got free was disconcerting
canada,not_removed,to each their own but i thought it was an incredible experience being able to hold my son when he was just seconds oldi cant compare that to anything ive ever experienced i was squeamish about cutting the cord but even that was a pretty emotional moment
canada,not_removed,seriously they could reinstitute the ban any time
canada,not_removed,now trudeaus daughter has led a private life which appears to be the way she wants it asked to speak to the star on the anniversary of her fathers death she replied simply i have no comment thank you for your interest it was perhaps a response to be expected from the daughter of the man who took the state out of the publics bedroom a private man with a publicly adored persona he rarely spoke to the media after retiring from politics in i dont talk about my private life in public deborah coyne told the star in she appeared briefly by her mothers side when her mother sought the liberal nomination for the don valley west riding in but when her mother bowed out of that race she reclaimed her privacy shielded from the spotlight throughout her childhood few details are known of sarah coynes relationship with her father kinda sucks nobody is respecting her right to privacy except her family good for them
canada,not_removed,k
canada,not_removed,wow never heard of her duchebag didnt even mention her in the eulogy
canada,not_removed,the original special snowflake
canada,not_removed,no the moral of this story is you can be a dick to almost everybody except the wealthy or connected the powerful always get their way
canada,not_removed,seems like the castro meme stock has crashed sell now
canada,not_removed,better find a way to tell everyone how much i hate trudeau
canada,not_removed,you forgot to pay import taxes on that rthedonald meme friendo
canada,not_removed,pierre elliot trudeaus ghost just fucked your mom
canada,not_removed,you mean teddy kennedy
canada,not_removed,how old are you
canada,not_removed,did you read the wiki it says it was banned but it ended in
canada,not_removed,fffpfflloooop airtime plop
canada,not_removed,trudeaus daughter oh man this is gonna make old articles really confusing
canada,not_removed,what is that supposed to mean
canada,not_removed,it was very likely in line with her wishes
canada,not_removed,ha looks like it i thought it had a lot more to give
canada,not_removed,thanks for that
canada,not_removed,ha thats so true
canada,not_removed,pet banged andrew coynes cousin
canada,not_removed,noice
canada,not_removed,so youre saying that your ideas are so bad the only defense you can give for them is that they are not illegal plenty of things arent illegal its not illegal to be illiterate that doesnt mean you should try to be illiterate
canada,not_removed,as a matter of fact he does have the right to tell anyone else what they can and cant talk about in your words this is canada we have free speech you dont have to do what he says though feel free to bring up how sjws are ruining the world in whatever unrelated threads you want to
canada,not_removed,if you claim the right to talk about whatever you have to respect everyone elses right to tell you to fuck off seems the most obvious of common sense to me
canada,not_removed,i didnt realize that sjw was such a trigger for some people
canada,not_removed,but you just told someone what to do
canada,not_removed,as a kid i always giggled because it sound like she is saying and if your family starts to wonder what the fuck its all about
canada,not_removed,pams in the kitchen messin with the pots and pans
canada,not_removed,i found it truly ironic that the court found the law societys decision was reasonable when no reasons was in fact given by the law society to support that decision the law societys justification was that had invited the public to present submissions and then had a vote on the matter after all presentations have been made the reason for their conclusion was the society voted against twu if the supreme court bench decides in favour of twu and the only reason given was because we voted would anyone still find that conclusion reasonable surely the supreme court came to that decision after hearing submissions but which logic was adoped would have been completely opague to rest of the world and the funny part is does this really need be explained to a bench of lawyers
canada,not_removed,this is ridiculous the lawyers pushing this garbage and the judges ruling in their favour should be subject to a taste of the lash because any idiot that has been paying attention knows the supreme court has already ruled on a parallel case involving trinity westernand the university won in an eight to one decision trinity western university is a private university with a christianbased curriculum the university started a teachers training program and applied to the british columbia college of teachers for the proper certification the college rejected trinity western on account that the schools policy that prohibited homosexual behaviour violated the colleges antidiscrimination policy in an eight to one decision the court held that the college was wrong in rejecting trinity western on the basis of discrimination the court concurred with the lower provincial courts stating that there was no basis for the bccts decision httpsenwikipediaorgwikitrinitywesternuniversityvbritishcolumbiacollegeofteachers when i pointed this out on another thread someone correctly responded that was years ago and one should not expect the court to rule the same way well i do it is obvious if the court does not follow precedent and rule in favour of religious freedom then it has proven itself counterproductive imho i would not be surprised religious freedom would follow free speech and the right to keep arms into the trashcan of canadian history
canada,not_removed,someone forcing students to go to twu seems like when you go to a university some of them have rules and others have other rules dont like it dont go there
canada,not_removed,when no reasons was in fact given by the law society to support that decision the benchers are not a judicial panel who hears cases and then issues judgements they are more like a legislature elected to govern and voting on proposals for doing so the law society does in fact have executive and judicial arms as well as the court of appeal pointed out and as courts have accepted across the country its not reasonable to require that a legislative body provide a coherent set of reasons for the decisions it makes thats entirely out of step with the process by which it makes decisions
canada,not_removed,people who ask how christians are persecuted in canada here is one example these christians arent imposing their values on anyone instead of insisting public universities change to accommodate them they decided to just create their own school and said hey if you like and share our values come to our school you are all over the map with this one no one is persecuting christians they have been allowed to open their own school in bc and have not been prevented gaining students with their criteria bc nova scotia and ontario are under no obligation to give the school accreditation you are basically arguing that the school should be allowed to do whatever it wants but the provinces should not have the same freedom i hope the supreme court rules that bc nova scotia and ontario are not required to give the school accreditation
canada,not_removed,the law society is deliberately refusing to certify the students the law society is not being asked to certify the students which is a pretty significant distinction
canada,not_removed,the only reason it might be decided differently is because the case had to do with specific legislation in bc and the regulation of teachers under that legislation this case has to do with the legislation that binds lsuc and could have slightly different wording or parameters that changes how they are allowed to regulate their profession so while the principles that will be argued are exactly the same today as they would have been in the legislation may allow the scc to come to a different decision i dont think it likely but it is at least a small possibility
canada,not_removed,someone forcing students black people to go to twu the white school seems like when you go to a university school some of them have rules and others have other rules dont like it dont go there do you see why your argument is bullshit
canada,not_removed,you r mistaken the parliament of canada is also a legislature and elected to govern and legislate all of canada but if their laws violate the charter the body that executes the law the govt becomes liable to offer reasons and telling the court cause the justice minister says its ok and that parliament voted yes is not considered reasonable likewise while the court has not demanded the bencher to give their reasons the court is required to demand the law society the body charged with executing the lsa to give their reasons the lsuc have not presented any valid reason to this date they implied it which is not sufficient as it does not offer how they arrive at the conclusion
canada,not_removed,twu was a different regulatory agency performing a different set of tasks under a different statutory regime years ago under a whole different set of administrative law precedents twu is certainly relevant but its hard to see how its directly controlling
canada,not_removed,also there are very limited law school spots for students in canada you often go to whichever place accepts you something like of applications to each school get accepted you go where you get in whether you like the school or not it isnt like university where you get accepted to most school you apply and then pick for most applicants you are lucky to get into one school the vast majority of people get wait listed or rejected
canada,not_removed,do you see why your argument is bullshit nope not at all last time i checked you choose what university to go to nobody forces you to go there
canada,not_removed,as the ontario court of appeal pointed out here that is simply incorrect
canada,not_removed,that was exactly my point the basic arguments will be the same i think but the statutory regime regulating teachers in bc and lawyers in ontario could be vastly different i havent read either yo know for sure if that is the case the point is that is how this will be distinguishable from the arguments about who is discriminating against who who is to be protected what the harms are etc will all essentially be the same
canada,not_removed,if you dont see it then youre just being willfully ignorant unfortunately i cant help you with that
canada,not_removed,as the ontario court of appeal is clearly wrong and that is why the scc should strike down their decision cause the ocas faulty logic could have been used by any other legislature most notably the parliament the oca interpretation is simply too wide and broad that any govt agency could have used it to massively expand their jurisdiction cause public interest
canada,not_removed,indeed i dont disagree with you
canada,not_removed,i feel like youve massively misinterpreted what the oca is saying there
canada,not_removed,i feel like oca made massive mistakes in several areas in general terms allowing the authority to liberally interpret their own areas of power the oca treated this as a legislative issue rather than administrative issue the oca itself demonstrated discrimination and hate towards twu by unnecessarily comparing the issue to bob jones i feel the judgement should be tossed on this ground alone
canada,not_removed,after dinner the group is expect to watch elf the story of a naive manchild who is thrust into a new life and must win over his new friends with nothing but his earnest smile and curly locks the beavertons savagery is a national treasure
canada,not_removed,there is nothing more beautiful than seeing their faces light up on christmas morning seeing what santa brought them said trudeau of his three children and the executives of lemine energy anbang insurance group and bmo rofl
canada,not_removed,bet ya he got hair products in his stocking
canada,not_removed,this is gold
canada,not_removed,well the lobbyists are like his children except they give you presents you really want for christmas
canada,not_removed,funny how all my conservative friends are pretending this wasnt a thing during harpers time in office
canada,not_removed,well technically people were complaining about the tax payer funded spending trudeau was doing now trudeau is raising his own funds and we still complain
canada,not_removed,you do realize that christmas passed already and its almost new years right
canada,not_removed,right lol i was laughing out loud at just how clever it is haha
canada,not_removed,hahaha harper did it bro so why even pay attention to it or even try to change it everyone does it
canada,not_removed,no im sure they dont realize that
canada,not_removed,triggered
canada,not_removed,it is important to change it i think it is deplorable that any prime minister would be involved in something like this but at the same time it does highlight the hypocrisy of some people and its important to point that out too
canada,not_removed,im not saying it isnt a problem im pointing out the hypocrisy also sarcasm is the recourse of a weak mind just sayin
canada,not_removed,the article is a week old ops timing is off
canada,not_removed,it seems a lot more like making excuses than it sounds like pointing out hypocrisy
canada,not_removed,ronas just out of step with canadians on this
canada,not_removed,he just approved pipelines in one day are you saying rona ambrose was complaining about that i assume mulcair would complain but rona ambrose should be dancing on her desk
canada,not_removed,as an albertan i thought ronas remarks were petty is a win get over yourself
canada,not_removed,i do kind of think its in rona ambroses job description as temporary leader of the official opposition to bring up the negatives of the sitting government in every situation
canada,not_removed,thats the problem with conservatives they never want to bargain on anything they want of everything of the time thats not how democracy works this was good news for workers struggling in ab and yet theyre still unhappy its despicable
canada,not_removed,every time i hear rona speak i think to myself gosh she sounds pretty i bet thats why they elected her
canada,not_removed,i couldnt find a reference to what you are quoting anywhere i plugged it into google plugged parts of it seems like you just made it up rona ambrose has only so far made this statement her accusation is that he approved a pipeline that will never be built the northern gateway pipeline was approved in with conditions the conservatives worked with enbridge to speak with various bands to try and find an accommodation however the liberals and ndp obstructed these efforts so now trudeau has gotten two pipelines approved that doesnt mean they will happen he has laid out over conditions of his own that have to be met all very similar to what harper asked for northern gateway to be built given these conditions there is no reason to believe that these pipelines will be built once a tender becomes available i think there is room to be excited but right now we havent even heard anything from the pipeline companies who will now have to work to get these conditions met is trudeau going to throw his weight behind these projects or is he just going to leave them in a vacuum being part of the opposition means your job is to get the best deal for canadians the government presumably covers their own ridings the opposition covers theirs she is just doing her job and if government representatives from alberta think it is appropriate to criticize opposition in any form than we should worry less about turning into america and worry more about what happened in cuba
canada,not_removed,jesus christthe ndp and liberal party love to call out conservatives for their support of pipelines and yet its not cool when cons get upsey when jt approves multiple projects after campaigning against them
canada,not_removed,well the way i see it trudeau was probably never going to approve either one rona coming out with these remarks forced his hand on the pipeline projects which in all honesty will never see the light of day
canada,not_removed,ronas just out of step with canadians on this reality ftfy
canada,not_removed,she knows that if trudeau gets a solid foothold in alberta the cpc is in a lot of trouble the wild rose party is trying to downplay this as well to diminish the provincial ndps win on this and this is a huge win for notley
canada,not_removed,rona ambrose should be dancing on her desk should be but a trudeau win is an ambrose loss
canada,not_removed,she says his approval of kinder morgan is pointless because it will probably never get built anyway no clear explanation given for why and that actually northern gateway is the pipeline that really matters so by rejecting it hes killing jobs grasping for straws id say
canada,not_removed,she didnt complain but she wasnt happy said something along the lines of not believing it will ever get completed and approving it was only the first step
canada,not_removed,ambrose is just plain disagreeable like a typical opposition faux leader shell like whine when you dont drink her koolaid and shell whine when you drink too much of it or use a wrong cup really i cannot stomach her
canada,not_removed,they approved a pipeline that will directly benefit her constituents being the opposition doesnt mean just blindly oppose anything that is exactly what the republicans did for the past years if you can find points to agree on then you wont get anything done edit cant
canada,not_removed,rona ambroses job description as temporary leader of the official opposition to bring up the negatives of the sitting government in every situation i thought the role of the official opposition was to improve the government policies
canada,not_removed,its in rona ambroses job description correct she is the leader of the her majestys loyal opposition it is their role to point out the holes in the governments cloth no matter what the ndp in alberta calling this a win is one for the history books they must be having an existential crisis right about now
canada,not_removed,nice hair though
canada,not_removed,campaigning against them wrong
canada,not_removed,it is a win for her after all she can say she made climate concessions for the pipeline trade off which is what she said when she started office of course i think her concessions had nothing to do with it but it does help when you are willing to work with the government especially after the vancouver spat about km i dont think it would greatly effect her rating in alberta unless the economy can do a unbelievable change in direction overall she would have been more popular in alberta if she waited till trudeau launched carbon tax instead of taking the initiative herself we know that the carbon tax is something notley and trudeau talked before even mentioning it to the country and albertas carbon tax is what the government had in mind i feel very neutral about her government like meh not bad or good but i wish there was another alternative out there the irony out of this is from reading facebook some people are beating the western alienation drum in vancouver saying vancouver complains pipeline gets built and montreal complains and everything gets stopped just want to say that no legwork or legislation had to be done to build km since it was on existing land and no conflict of interests despite what native groups say i did feel northern gateway would have been the better choice especially if it is parallel to the lng line that spans over half the province
canada,not_removed,it doesnt matter if they oppose it or not they have very little power to actually do anything in parliament all they can really do is point out the negatives
canada,not_removed,the liberals have a majority no doesnt really matter what the opposition does
canada,not_removed,that is exactly what the republicans did for the past years wrong country buddy
canada,not_removed,by applying critical review and judgement of them otherwise the government must have just served up the perfect solution and even the pm said he had not
canada,not_removed,right
canada,not_removed,trudeau would not have been able to approve tmx without the agreement on carbon pricing that notley had already signalled that would have been political suicide this is the compromise his voters will accept without the one the other doesnt cant happen and harper is the proof of that
canada,not_removed,a few months ago they almost got a bill to fail it came down to just one vote the liberals had too many people out and couldnt cover the vote of the official opposition
canada,not_removed,like to keep it that way pal
canada,not_removed,link plz
canada,not_removed,and rejecting all of them would have been economic suicide and would have come to roost right as he has to fight the next election approving those two projects was always the pragmatic decision udarkprinny is right notleys actions were immaterial to the actual approval of these two lines it would have happened under a pc or wildrose provincial government as well however notley and trudeau do get to work the politics and spin and brag about how awesome each other are which is fair ball after all the carbon tax is deeply unpopular in alberta and will be so in many other provinces they both need to try and sell some sort of positive about it to the populace
canada,not_removed,you say voters will accept this but you actually have no clue if they will or not harper isnt proof of anything in this case nothing here is proof of anything the only proof here is that pipelines were approved and there are still protests about the two approved
canada,not_removed,youre doing it wrong
canada,not_removed,notleys actions were immaterial to the actual approval of these two lines trudeau could not have done this at all not in ontario or quebec let alone bc if the carbon pricing were not agreed to in advance this is mainstream liberal voting thinking taken from it was the only way a federal liberal party that campaigned its way into power on a promise to be environmentally enlightened was going to be able to justify a pipeline in the process it makes mr trudeau look like he is rewarding a jurisdiction that introduced bold see unpopular reformist environmental measures in the name of the greater good i suppose you can think otherwise but had a brad wall figure been in power in alberta i very much doubt that tmx would have had as rapid approval if indeed at all the federal government would not have been able to get movement in bc or the buyin from eastern canada that they have so far been getting
canada,not_removed,if you think discouraging obstructionist politics is wrong not sure who is in the wrong country man seems like all they know down south
canada,not_removed,i agree that getting tmx approved is crucial to notleys career given virtually everything she has done as premier has been unpopular and a lot of it seen as damaging i doubt even this will save her government in but without it she had no hope however trudeau has already announced his own carbon tax scheme and his billion on ocean protection and the like the lack of a tax in alberta under a different government would have made no difference as trudeau already gave christy clark what she wanted
canada,not_removed,no im actually talking of your obsession for all things america
canada,not_removed,were jason kenney or brian jean etc to be in power and completely against the idea of caps or carbon pricing i dont think trudeaus carbon scheme would have worked a province can block a federal initiative particularly if it holds the cards that alberta does on resource management buyin from alberta was crucial a conservative and recalcitrant alberta could very easily have made trudeaus carbon schemes ineffective and simply turned this into a stand off and then tidewater pipelines could never have happened
canada,not_removed,in that regard pragmatism would have ruled in alberta just the same as it has in ottawa a conservative government would have weighed the options and ultimately realized that it was more important to get the pipelines moving what would truly change in this scenario is the political spin the carbon tax would be argued as an ottawa based initiative and trudeau planted as the bad guy
canada,not_removed,as clarks five conditions blocked harper for her own political benefit im certain a motivated conservative peddling jobs first rhetoric would have argued against and stalled carbon pricing clark had a lot fewer cards to play but she had made it clear that even if the fn lawsuits had come to nothing she would have made the eng approvals process ie clearing the conditions in the years prior to operation hellishly expensive and likely impractical its telling that shes reacted neutrally to this announcement trudeau boxed her in with both the coastal strategy announcement or whatever its called this week and the tanker moratorium she was defanged look at the idiocy of walls carbon capture nonsense which as far as i can tell is a con the coal companies are running on sk the previous provincial conservative was totally down on that scam too i dont see how a conservative government in alberta could politically have allowed the federal government to impose a carbon tax over their objections it would have been so i disagree without a cooperative partner in alberta even to get this far would not have been possible and i dont think a pc government a kenney government in particular could have been a prentice one perhaps if he could have restrained his tongue but not a kenney one the politics that kenney has to manage dont work
canada,not_removed,i dont see how a conservative government in alberta could politically have allowed the federal government to impose a carbon tax over their objections it would have been exactly and it would be the trudeau liberals eating the fall out for that provincially the provincial government would demonize trudeau for being like his father while attempting to take all the credit for the pipelines anyway its all about the spin
canada,not_removed,and that would have stopped the pipelines why would trudeau do anything for a provincial government that would not have played ball why expend political capitaland this may yet lose him a good chunk of bc to the ndp for a generationfor no gain saying no to everything would be very popular with most of his base as killing keystone was for obama
canada,not_removed,sorry i should have been more clear i would suggest in this scenario that the carbon tax would be accepted but demonized the unwanted tradeoff to get the pipes built fwiw of decided respondents even a majority of british columbians httpangusreidorgtransmountainpipeline tmx certainly trudeau will lose some votes but if there is one thing he does generally excel at it is image management it will be interesting to see how he handles the very loud minority
canada,not_removed,i think its sexist to tell other women how to think and feel personally ive lost friends to this dumb tripe if youre not always agreeing with feminists youre to be condemned by them no room for grey areas or debate if you disagree youre out these women are the real sexists
canada,not_removed,i think its sexist to support someone because theyre a woman i think its sexist to call someone a sexist for choosing to consider other factors than genitalia look its simple hillary supports a nofly zone in syria with top military officials saying this could lead to war with russia hillary broke protocol and sent highly classified information to people not authorized to receive them emails were also deleted after a subpoena by congress amount to obstruction of justice hillary was monumental in supporting aggression against libya but had no plan for stabilization leading to deaths and displacements of hundreds of thousands of people hillary received million from the king of morocco and wikileaks emails state that he expected an audience with her with the money hillary received millions of dollars from the chairman of uranium one and hillary was part of the committee that approved the sale to a russian firm giving of the uss uranium to russian control leaked emails reveal the term friend of bill where clinton foundation donors received preferential deals and contracts in haiti i could go on and on
canada,not_removed,if you dont agree with feminists you are a woman hater awesome logic if you dont agree with people against assisted suicide you are a killer
canada,not_removed,right hillarys a liar a corporatist texts in drone strikes has taken millions in donations from fundamentalist theocracies and her party stabbed the only good candidate in the race in the back and its sexist to point this out i wonder if kim campbell thinks its sexist when someone accuses her of eating the last slice of pizza or farting in the car
canada,not_removed,i believe it same with obamablack and jfk non wasp
canada,not_removed,hillary was perfectly trained for the president position just like previous one to bad people realized the that skillset is not what they want or good for president women cant catch a break once their trained the people realize thats not skills that people want womenleft behind
canada,not_removed,to be fair it was her friend brian who farted and jumped out of the car leaving her to take the blame
canada,not_removed,and there are no criticisms of trump that are incredibly crass misandrist and downright vile seems its more a public figure thing than a woman thing
canada,not_removed,jill stein doesnt understand how money works printing money will cause the money supply to be devalued such as hyper inflation germany after goverment bonds is the exact same as money its derivative of a dervavtive of gold standard that can not be switched one of her platform is cancel student loan debt and free college is the money going to come from resources and labour arent free dreading value is not good canceling debt owing means the money they are expected to use it for where is that money come from when creating debt there is good and bad the ones that can be paid of have value id good debt the ones that dont is bad debts
canada,not_removed,i mean hell theres a mainstream cartoon that is dedicating an entire season to belittling him
canada,not_removed,south park so am i everyone is fair game for a joke or no one is
canada,not_removed,hopefully all their shitty brands start to go away and the independent craft beer industry continues to grow fuck them
canada,not_removed,is our usual experience with blue canadian coors light and bud going to change will the new mega corporation have to eliminate a few brands to avoid overlap like gm did a few years ago eliminating pontiac are beer reps going to be impacted
canada,not_removed,usual experience i havent drank that piss in years
canada,not_removed,me neither i love mill street but now that mill street is part of labatt and labatt is going to be part of this takeover im wondering how bars will be impacted by this deal
canada,not_removed,molson owns creemore which has continued to be an excellent beer even if not quite the same as the microbrew used to be so there is hope
canada,not_removed,i think eventually there will be consolidation or at least some more formal alliances among craft breweries that will help them reduce expenses without sacrificing their craftiness that could free up some cash for those alliances to provide some sponsorship of pubs and bars similar to what the global shittybeer conglomerates do
canada,not_removed,inhuman slime
canada,not_removed,kills his mother and brothers speechless
canada,not_removed,once again reddits deep understanding of prison culture hes a previously convicted armed robber which is a solid boost among prisoners he killed three adults nothing sexual not children for all you know hell say its because they testified against him or betrayed him in some unforgivable way either way murderer and armed robber whatever his motive in prison its his biz hell be playing cards and watching tv in general like an average con i think reddit always seems to confuse civilian reactions with prisoners oh killed a cop just wait till hes in gen pop etc
canada,not_removed,one at a timeface to face hes goin down
canada,not_removed,prisoners oh damn he killed his family with a crossbow that gangster gets extra cornbread

canada,not_removed,regardless of your viewpoint on canada taking in refugees the feds really need to step up and address this when we took in the syrians we had a plan we knew how many we were getting and we knew who they were with the guys crossing the border we dont right now we are struggling to find places to house them food to feed them and ways to give them the medical care they need even if you personally are accepting of refugees the current situation is not acceptable we need a clear answer and response from the feds on this either open the welcome mat and provide the assistance and services that is needed to those crossing or close up the loophole and make it known that we are only accepting refugees that apply and not those that cross illegally
canada,not_removed,if trudeau continues to ignore this hes really playing with fire and im sure he knows that we took a substantial number of syrian refugees from the getgo were doing our part but we cant be the new home for every dispossessed person on the planet more than altruism there are practicalities at play as former new brunswick premier frank mckenna wrote in the globe and mail last year newcomers need a home atlantic canada needs people indeed in new brunswick had more deaths than births the same goes for nova scotia perhaps this helps explain the intertwining of these two variables atlantic canadians are taking the highest relative share of syrian refugees and theyre also the most enthusiastic about potentially taking more just oneinthree per cent say that the governments targets are too high – seven points below the canadian average of per cent thats oddly encouraging i wouldnt expect maritimers to be that open to new arrivals
canada,not_removed,i think that is what democrats in the us and people who were against the brexit doesnt get i think the media is so stuck on the idea that if you are for trump or for brexit you are bigot ignorant of immigration and refugee a racist but what they the media and democrats dont get is that it isnt immigration or refugee the racist dont like it is the lack of control there is they want control they want to control who gets in on how many i am pretty sure some republicans dont mind some illegals but they just to control how many they want how many the system can handle if you tell a republican that only illegals will get in and the rest will be deported ok they could live with that because you tell them what is going on you get a government telling if you dont like illegals immigrants and refugee you are ignorant and stupid of course they arent going to hear you of course they are going to arm up and make as much noise as possible thats how trump got elected
canada,not_removed,for years mr warsame had aspired to the american dream and risked his life for a chance to make it in minneapolis but he struggled to find a job these are the people were taking in
canada,not_removed,there is one thing that i still dont understand about refugees my expectation would be that if we as a nation accept refugees into the country because they are fleeing a war zone in which they faced immediate danger we would accept only those that can be properly vetted as any immigrant would be before allowing entry i think we do this ask that they return to their home country if and when there is such a time when it is safe to return i dont think we follow point which makes no sense to me if somebody is here to flee an immediate danger we can harbor them until such a time that immediate threat is gone i understand this could be years and they could begin to establish a life here thats fine and nothing should stop refugees from applying for immigration as anyone else if your application is successfully processed before you are asked to return of course you stay this is the only process that makes any sense to me refugees being fasttracked to citizens and being kept here indefinitely as a defacto standard however does not
canada,not_removed,why does the only solution to this issue seem to be to take in tens of thousands of refugees and why are countries taking in millions of refugees around the world why doesnt the un or us go into syria and stabilize the country what is the purpose of the un anyway thats whats happened in the past iraqis didnt flee to canada during the fall of saddam or afghanis during the taliban so why is it that today the only answer seems to be refugees across the world why isnt anything being done in syria i can appreciate that its complicated but we have systems and peacekeeping military in place exactly for this type of thing what are they doing and if you were a refugee wouldnt you want to return home canada is great and all but its cold expensive you cant speak the language dont know the culture why would you want to stay here why does taking in refugees this time seem to be the only answer
canada,not_removed,this is what happens when you expand the definition of refugee to any brown or black person who wants to live here and has the means to make it here meanwhile the expectation of what we will provide them has gone from temporary safety until the situation is resolved and they can return home to permanent resettlement in the top country of their choosing complete with housing and free money and on top of that most of the ones who will force our borders are not the syrian families of our choosing but a bunch of single young muslim men combining their toxic brainwashing with all the problems that single young men bring its madness and ive become a single issue voter in my desire to end it
canada,not_removed,im reminded of the joke typically misattributed to winston churchill churchill madam would you sleep with me for five million pounds socialite my goodness mr churchill well i suppose we would have to discuss terms of course churchill would you sleep with me for five pounds socialite mr churchill what kind of woman do you think i am churchill madam weve already established that now we are haggling about the price every person will have some limit for refugees the issue is how many is reasonable and under what conditions its not like theres value in unlimited numbers of refugees too many too fast would have hugely detrimental effects obviously millions would be far to many as that would be a massive economic hit in a short term we also couldnt properly vet that many in any reasonable amount of time which means increasing risks that size would also have a significant effect on social behaviours culture and policy and remember they are refugees because of the fighting in their culture its not like they come from a peaceful culture that shares liberal democratic secular values that would immediately adopt canadian values even a smaller number could have a significant effect on elections and policy when they can vote for example abortions are illegal in syria if people are raised in a culture of illegal abortions and support that what does this mean for canadian policies when they vote here will they vote for people who aim to outlaw abortion in canada how many swing votes are necessary to make such policy a risk too much too fast of just about anything is destablizing and a problem this seems obvious to me but then im an expert in system dynamics so maybe it isnt obvious to others still i dont think the idea of a reasonable limit is controversial the issues are mostly around the vetting process and haggling over the exact number
canada,not_removed,somalians were a pain in the ass when we let them in last time canadians remember you liberal apologists can moan and wail all you like but allowing in people who are a net drain on your countries intelligence and financial coffers is not a winning move build an electrified fence on the border deport everyone
canada,not_removed,i am all for people coming in the front door especially from war torn regions front door only
canada,not_removed,tolerance for articles about refugees has its limits too globe
canada,not_removed,tolerance is limitless resources arent sure we should clarify the restrictions on our border but what we shouldnt do is resort to being reactionary cocks about it thatll create more problems than it solves
canada,not_removed,yup this is why we deport person per day on average and most are failed refugee claimants
canada,not_removed,but bc is also taking in a lower relative share – refugees for every – than its western neighbours where do they think bc is located
canada,not_removed,so atlantic canada takes in the most refugees per capita and they want more seems to me that if you are actually exposed to these people you know they are human just like you the people who are the most critical of refugees are not exposed to them i am not saying there arent valid criticisms but maybe talk to these people to gain a little perspective guys
canada,not_removed,theres a lot of love in these comments
canada,not_removed,why not just move disadvantaged people that already live in our country to areas that are more prosperous like bringing first nations people from north winnipeg and putting them up in housing in nice neighborhoods around the country good schools and good neighborhoods will help them thrive anything else is just racism
canada,not_removed,yep current situation is totally unacceptable whether you are pro refugee or not
canada,not_removed,what problem do people have with the current process theyre questioned and their background determined then theyre turned over to see if their claim is valid and if not theyre sent back i feel like people think that we just let them stay indefinitely or something note im just speaking of those coming across the border because it seems like thats what youre referring to at the end there
canada,not_removed,i can think of a solution build the wall
canada,not_removed,what allows one to stay if they claim to be a refugee
canada,not_removed,no one is crossing into canada illegally these people are reporting to the cbsa border crossings to seek asylum in canada
canada,not_removed,especially if they are dumping them in montreal or toronto only the montreal ones leave as soon as their month bit is up and we have a large swath of country that could use low skill workers problem is they dont want to move there and we seem to care about that if you want in go where youre needed
canada,not_removed,except you know everyone wants to go to vancouver city or toronto
canada,not_removed,atlantic canada doesnt need more people the east coast governments need to stop shooting themselves in the foot and make the east coast economically viable so that the people from can actually stay and make lives for themselves theres nothing to keep immigrants there at all
canada,not_removed,he hired a muslim somalian weeks ago to become the immigration minister of canada i think trudeau likes what is going on
canada,not_removed,yeah canada is nearly full s
canada,not_removed,every country has a legal right to limit immigration as they see fit period end of story it has nothing to do with racism to prefer to allow people with similar cultural experiences and values over others whose culture and values seriously clashes with ours and yes sometimes those cultural differences involve religious beliefs just try emigrating to or even just visiting other countries especially the muslim countries and impose your cultural biases on them and see what happens some people inherently believe that nonbelievers of their religion are akin to second class citizens or even on the same level as cattle and have no rights those are the people that can stay where they are in their own culture and work to make their country of origin a better place for them sharia law does not and should not apply in nonmuslim countries and also our western countries can stop bombing the hell out of those middle eastern countries and stop creating millions of war refugees that might help trudeau may want to consider that aspect of this mess
canada,not_removed,and the argument that locals commit more crimes canadian problems are problems external countries problems are threats the former is our fault and things inside our control the latter is not and is best not to take the problem in and if you sell me on it by using compassion without even a hand wave to assuring the safety of your citizens size of the issue notwithstanding dont be surprised if my surprise is to tell you to fuck yourself
canada,not_removed,we already control who gets in and how many
canada,not_removed,meanwhile the control is here we deport dozens daily obama deported more people than any other president whats happening is typical fear of immigrants was used to sway the vote as part of the political cycle in canada its not nearly as big an issue but it is definitely being conjured into one lately this will continue along with our own political cycle
canada,not_removed,so they believe lies like there is no vetting process and that obama wasnt deporting a record number of people trump said that there is no vetting for refugees getting into the us thats just completely false but thats the narrative
canada,not_removed,i think the media is so stuck on the idea that if you are for trump or for brexit you are bigot ignorant of immigration and refugee a racist trump provided a lot more ammunition for claims of racism and bigotry than just wanting to control the flow of immigrants
canada,not_removed,i wouldnt be so quick to dismiss the racism and general antiimmigration sentiment this is not a new phenomena certainly not in american history while america has taken in enormous numbers of immigrants in its history there has always been a vocal nativist segment of the population today while some may very well accept immigrants through a closed and controlled system like we find in canada yay for being the hardest place to get to ever others have racial and economic concerns about new immigrants there is still a serious misconception about job stealing crime rates and the social welfare burden imposed by illegal immigrants in the us the important line in your comment was mentioning not liking illegals refugees etc what trump has done is jumped on a preexisting prejudice that many in the us have he doesnt have moderate rhetoric just about controlling borders hes demonized those who come to the us hes tapping into the longstanding but rarely mentioned racism and xenophobia that his base supports this isnt about control its about fear and hatred
canada,not_removed,i think the issue with trump isnt so much his policies but more so the way he explains his policies makes him sound like a child having a tantrum
canada,not_removed,this is a case where i think the response far outweighs the concern im one of those who believe any immigration is basically a net gain anyways but electing a trump or exiting the eu is just a silly for lack of a better word reaction to what is at worst a minor problem especially in canada
canada,not_removed,this argument falls apart when you actually listen to the man talk he actually is a sexit racist bigot i cannot respect anyone who supports him because support for that man comes from one of two places only ignorance of what trump has said and done or indifference towards his toxic attitudes towards minorities other religions and lgbtq people
canada,not_removed,oh is that the excuse were making for racists now why is it that scotland a part of the uk that had no emotional attachment to being british was the strongest supporters for stay why is it that africanamericans who have been in the us for centuries continue to vote for the democratic party at a clip why did trump poll so well with every voting bloc of white americans with the exception of college educated white women but so terribly with every voting bloc of people of colour you ever notice that the people who racism affects the least are the ones who defend it the most also you ever notice that racism is not a deal breaker for these people they always seem to rationalize it its kind of like how some people rationalize supporting chris brown i find it oddly comforting though how that milo dude was finally taken down because of pedophlia comments congrats for having morals on that i guess alright great random trump supporter over here had never called anybody a nigger ill be sure to give him a cookie but fuck him for voting for a racist anyways youre a piece of shit if you voted for trump end of story
canada,not_removed,okay so feels reals then the facts show that immigrants and refugees commit fewer crimes than native born citizens people are rightly called bigots when they continue to want to restrict refugees and immigrants from mostly nonwhite nations in spite of these facts
canada,not_removed,they are dishonest people looking for loopholes in the system and people think they will be civilized here they will drain our resources and food banks and have kids so we cant deport them anymore
canada,not_removed,the article is referring mostly to syrian refugees the kind screened by the unhcr and then screened and selected by canadian officials they are neither economic migrants nor criminals
canada,not_removed,who arent the article is about polls of refugee limits and the statistics of syrian refugees you seem to be referring to people crossing the border illegally which the article is not about
canada,not_removed,i believe you are incorrect on a bunch of fronts i think the temperature gets turned up unnecessarily in these discussions so i will keep my comments civil and to the point first the poll is mostly about syrians and it seems like your post is about the recent border crossings second the people crossing the border are claiming asylum and it sounds like they are making it through the preliminary screening process so they are at least refugee claimants that is simply a matter of fact you can call them economic migrants just like you can call a horse a dick but that is not what they are third refugee claimants are specifically exempt from prosecution for irregular border crossings so they are not technically criminals they are not criminals at all in any sense of the word if you think canada should withdraw from international agreements on refugees deport people to places they would certainly die or prosecute people for exercising their international human rights that is a different conversation altogether we can have that conversation but you need to be frank and informed about what you are asking for
canada,not_removed,economic migrants so if i was poor and looking could i claim asylum in america
canada,not_removed,if hes struggling to find a job in the states then what makes here any different its not like mcdicks or tims has standards theyll take you as long as you show up on time and dont piss in the coffee
canada,not_removed,thats a very good point
canada,not_removed,of course if you look on twitter all the pro refugee people are the ones in the maritimes ive seen quite a few from halifax living miles and miles away from everyone where migrants will never step foot
canada,not_removed,did you read the article it says exactly the opposite of that maritimers are the most receptive to refugees and think we should accept more and also have accepted the most refugees per capita in the country its only bc where theyve accepted the fewest per capita and think we should accept more
canada,not_removed,the definition of a refugee has not been expanded there might be a minor relative cost increase to deal with increased applications im not sure why this would be anyones top issue that will determine their vote what you like to see happen as opposed to hearing refugee claims through the normal process
canada,not_removed,i was with you until the to last paragraph im sick and fucking tired of cbc pro syrian hogwash but i bet the crime rate amongst syrian refugees is lower than some other identifiable groups in canada
canada,not_removed,but a bunch of single young muslim men combining their toxic brainwashing with all the problems that single young men bring i agree that there should be a limit but idk how based in reality this viewpoint is i see it all the time and idk it seems like a bit of bullshit to me
canada,not_removed,well to be fair im more worried about the sons of generation refugees all those cute and adorable kids that came to canada that trudeau held and hugged those are the scary ones in about yrs time
canada,not_removed,of the somalians in the netherlands are on welfare they continue their practice of fgm go back to somalia for holidays and dress year old girls up in headscarfs theres precisely zero that they have to offer im sorry their country is a shithole but bringing them to the west is a horrible idea
canada,not_removed,you dont go in for these backdoor shenanigans
canada,not_removed,really you thinking bringing in a bunch of people from war torn regions is a good idea helping them in some way is probably a good idea but bringing them here is not
canada,not_removed,harper brought in more muslims than any prior pm were you just as tired and upset then
canada,not_removed,your tolerance is limitless until it starts affecting you you probably live so deep in the suburbs it takes you minutes to reach a highway
canada,not_removed,ive seen this claim float around yet nobody ever links a source edit ive found it httpwwwneverhomeca i wouldnt trust this site at all they are a typical social justice organisation with obvious marxist leanings that believes a wide range of outlandish things that is if you care to read their about page
canada,not_removed,convicts are human would you want to room with one being human doesnt instantly mean equal to everyone else
canada,not_removed,the people who are the most critical of refugees are not exposed to them you mean like the french germans or the swedes seems to me the voters are turning things upsidedown because of this exposurebut not in the direction youre describing
canada,not_removed,yes for canada and its borders
canada,not_removed,damn you are a highly skilled troll had me going pretty good and i usually dont fall for it respect
canada,not_removed,im brown and so is everyone in my family am i a bigot against brown people lol im concerned about their ideology not their skin colour
canada,not_removed,yall taken the
canada,not_removed,im glad to see youve expanded outside of rcringeanarchy
canada,not_removed,how many have you taken into your house
canada,not_removed,its not the color its the religion this is birmingham the town where jkk rowling was born httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrgxfzaugwogfeatureyoutube let that sink in
canada,not_removed,it is unfair to those that are airing their turn in far away camps or their legitimacy unsafe home countries these border jumpers were in some cases in the usa for years they are simply opportunists
canada,not_removed,there is a un convention that dictates we should allow them to stay so the bleeding heart liberals feel we have a duty to let them stay and quite often they do
canada,not_removed,you are misinformed there are currently people crossing the border at undesignated places and getting arrested by the rcmp
canada,not_removed,months thats when the benefits are done
canada,not_removed,its impossible to find a job here unless you speak french and speak it well even under the table jobs
canada,not_removed,we should just force them to do shit work they want to come here so bad fine we make them into slaves the next generation who is born here can live free but the first generation lives in servitude
canada,not_removed,you assume they are all low skilled workers though
canada,not_removed,yeah canada is nearly full s no but toronto and vancouver are
canada,not_removed,because all they need is some vacant land right no services employment education health care or anything s stop being purposely obtuse
canada,not_removed,and also our western countries can stop bombing the hell out of those middle eastern countries and stop creating millions of war refugees that might help eh which war are you referring to the syrian war is a civil war started entirely locally and spreading outward perhaps you mean afghanistan or iraq which were indeed western invasions but they didnt produce much in the way of refugees to canada canadas since have nothing to do with western invasions columbia china sri lanka pakistan haiti mexico india and even the us that list stops at the top spots dont have much in the way of western invasion countries afghanistan appears around most years at a few hundred iraq shows up in with a few hundred accepted given the civil wars and ongoing internal turmoil around the world and not much in the way of invasions from western powers i wonder why youd think western invasions have much to do with war refugees
canada,not_removed,no one is arguing that we should let in femaleabusing political revolutionaries immigration policies arent racism but saying that everyone from a certain part of the world is out to overthrow our society is simply false
canada,not_removed,it has nothing to do with racism to prefer to allow people with similar cultural experiences and values over others whose culture and values seriously clashes with ours the point though is that people are people furthermore there is currently a wave of islamophobia that is emboldening white supremacists who are the real enemy fortunately theyll meet the same type fate that our grandfathers had for them when they went to europe to fight the axis
canada,not_removed,the former is our fault and things inside our control the latter is not and is best not to take the problem in how are domestic criminals more under our control than immigrant criminals that doesnt make sense if the rate of crime among immigrants is lower than among locals then wouldnt it make sense to allow more immigrants in as they have an overall downward impact on crime rates compassion is also important and since immigrants and refugees are overall a low security risk why all the fuss
canada,not_removed,yup you can only call so many people hitler until they just post pepe memes and make jokes about it
canada,not_removed,i think you meant the eu not brexit
canada,not_removed,wages are falling in the uk for multiple reasons its labour force is extremely inefficient and uncompetitive which limits the capacity for higher wages the typical firm lacks specialised software or robots in any significant quantity to boost productivity british firms do not invest enough in research and development it has liberal labour laws which make employment more unsecure and limits the effectiveness of collective bargaining its economy is structured around industries of rent such as property markets that have great difficulty in recirculating capital into productive investments meaning wealth is hoarded in stores of value rather than being disbursed to wages and because its undiversified economy is sensitive to market volatility and it was hit hard by the international financial crisis according to the bank of england net migration has a neglible effect on wage growth with the exception being a small reduction in lowskilled service industry wages considering that the same immigration policies were in place before the financial crisis saw increases in wage growth it seems unlikely that the influx of cheap labour was the cause behind falling wages that alone is reason enough to be suspicious of it as an argument for brexit but combined with the fact that the british government was well capable of significantly reducing immigration according to its own prerogative and did not do so the idea that britain had to leave because they were being constrained is simply ridiculous
canada,not_removed,i think you are confusing immigrants with totally uneducated fighting age male economic migrants you would be hardpressed to find a typical canadian of any background not fearful of this i welcome the families and women and children but send the single men home like now males who leave their wives and children back in a supposed war zone the also miraculously have the exact same story
canada,not_removed,isnt the obama deportation statistic just a meme as far as i know it was inflated by turn aways at the border and catch and release
canada,not_removed,immigrant or illegal alien possible violent jihadistgang member hmmm seems like two very different things try again
canada,not_removed,we deport dozens daily im curious how many were deported in calendar edit i meant calendar
canada,not_removed,we deport dozens daily obama deported more people than any other president rcanada would you happen to know anything of our situation tamil tigers the foreign programs at timmies etc
canada,not_removed,if you talk to europeans outside of internet forums though you might be surprised i dont think its a minor problem over there anymore though perhaps brexittrumpmulticulturalism has failed is not the correct course of action to correct it id rather not get where they are and have to face such choices so our own social structure warrants some study
canada,not_removed,im one of those who believe any immigration is basically a net gain like when jordan took in palestinians and theyvrepaid them by throwing to overthrow their country or the civil war in lebanon
canada,not_removed,people were willing to live with that because the alternative was so much worse in their mind hillary had severe problems too but nobody talked about them because trump held the spotlight while trump is unsophisticated and crass he did play on legitimate concerns that white bluecollar americans were facing which the democrats didnt give two shits about so you tell me why bob in ohio should vote for a party that thinks hes a racist sexist homophobic bigot simply because hes a white man with conservative leanings
canada,not_removed,your a piece of shit if you voted for trump end of story theres no nuance with you people all you see is us vs them
canada,not_removed,fuck you buddy
canada,not_removed,you probably just won him another supporter
canada,not_removed,i wonder what the natives would have done if they had the power to stop them
canada,not_removed,i believe that liberals like to call this tactic what aboutism when other people do it
canada,not_removed,the natives fought a couple of wars to keep them out so im guessing they didnt think to highly of the white folk
canada,not_removed,norway here i come
canada,not_removed,because theres pushback in the us about throwing money at refugees who cant contribute and just soak up benefits theyre fleeing to canada because they think the tap will shutoff slower here
canada,not_removed,wonder if those maritimers will be so keen when refugees are taking up the oil rig jobs out in alberta so many of them head west to work
canada,not_removed,read the article maritimers have accepted the most refugees per capita and also have the highest proportion of people who think we should accept more
canada,not_removed,im from a small city in southern ontario and the community here has been accepting and welcome tons of syrian refugees i havent met too many people against the immigrants
canada,not_removed,well never know because its forbidden to make statistics based on race here almost as if theyre afraid theyll find out what the us did that of the population black males commits upwards of of the violent crime
canada,not_removed,why is it not a good idea
canada,not_removed,i live in midtown toronto and attend school in hamilton though judging by your comment history you dont really seem like the type of person whos here to make reasoned political discussion
canada,not_removed,i saw that and came to the same conclusion however other sources back up the math so it is what it is roughly per year
canada,not_removed,but the media told me that sweden doesnt have a refugee problem
canada,not_removed,sounds like you have a classic case of internalized white patriarchy you hate yourself and go against your own best interests fortunately white people like me exist that know what is best for you
canada,not_removed,i have taken six its a family of one father and five teenage boys their story is very tragic their mother was killed by a drone strike in somalia hopefully here in canada they are safe from the us and isis
canada,not_removed,who exactly is changing their tune ive never encountered canadian support for illegal immigration whether here or in america and even as someone who leans to the left ive never understood the enthusiasm among american leftists for illegal immigration
canada,not_removed,because of three reasons really these are not the same people and pretending there seems to be some massive social agreement on anything in any country is silly donald trump made a massive campaign slogan of build that wall and get them out out out among other deliberately inflammatory comments his attempts were not some measured response to a sudden surge of problems they were a sudden rash of anger over a problem that had genuinely been in decline the last few years it felt like he was looking to find some easily accessed vein of anger to tap into to coerce votes more than he actually cared about a real problem there exists a spectrum between all refugees are great and is too many most people here are being reasonable and not polarizing over the issue
canada,not_removed,there is a difference canadians feel like the second choice its insulting in a way because they didnt pick canada first they picked the us and when the us said nope they said lets go to the next best thing they are leeches of society we know that now we know they wont work here they will just use up our welfare use our food banks and work under the table these are not honest people meanwhile there are plenty of hard working intelligent educated wealthy immigrants still waiting to get in and these scum of the earth are taking their spots
canada,not_removed,no one is actually crossing illegally into canada i dont know whyhow the op came up with this and why it gets reinforced these people arewhere asylum seekers in the us and are now reporting at canadian border crossings to seek asylum in canada because of that clown of a president
canada,not_removed,i would be perfectly okay with our government considering where they originate from before sending them back in some cases these immigrants are indeed coming here because they risk being deported to some downright unsavory places if they stay in the united states
canada,not_removed,what un convention everything ive read indicates that unless some exception applies to them theyll be sent back
canada,not_removed,not if usa pays for it
canada,not_removed,syrians spoke little to no english either part of taking refugees is giving them skills to succeed and language chief among them if the government is committed to taking these people they need to teach them english or french more taxpayer dollars spent
canada,not_removed,i lived in montreal for years i know tge struggle
canada,not_removed,im not sure if youre serious or trying to caricature the rightwing position either way its not funny or clever
canada,not_removed,doctors dont refugee they immigrate syria doesnt have the infrastructure for technical high skilled peoole yo trsin and thrive plus we arent exactly friendly to them either look at the hoops doctors have to jump through for recognition in canada some are driving cabs
canada,not_removed,getting elected as an mp didnt automatically make him immigration minister trudeau still had to offer him a job in cabinet when you offer someone a job and they accept that is commonly known as hiring them for a job
canada,not_removed,cant speak for toronto but greater vancouver has plenty of room to grow east and up
canada,not_removed,because cities like toronto are all about multiculturalism and the diversity is our strength rhetoric the rest of canada is less willing to accept nonwestern immigrants
canada,not_removed,more people more need for sevices and therefore job opportunities stop being purposely obtuse
canada,not_removed,refugees contribute more than they will cost in the long run
canada,not_removed,more people bigger workforce more tax revenue did the us suffer compared to canada from having more rapid immigration in the late century
canada,not_removed,the syrian war is a civil war started entirely locally no the syrian war that was started by outside forces just like in libya afghanistan and iraq also the change in govt in egypt none of those would have happened without the western countries interfering
canada,not_removed,it absolutely isnt most of my friends subscribe to heavy identity politics ive lost a couple myself
canada,not_removed,i been to toronto and it seemed like an nice city toronto is probably the worst city for identity politics in north america outside of san francisco and maybe portland check out the toronto broadcast of cbc radio or the rtoronto subreddit if you really want to cringe read up on the toronto chapter of black lives matters you have universal healthcare and can look at immigration sanely we are insanely naive on the immigration front and we wont have universal healthcare much longer based on our sunny ways idealism hell our governments have justified increased migration on the basis that our natural population base would start declining making them unsustainable the government then however decided to allow migrants to face track their parents to canada driving up the elderly population which uses most of the health care also if you ever want to own a home forget about toronto everybody wants to live there and chinese investment is insane leading to staggering home prices
canada,not_removed,i certainly hope its the norm it seems to be in my experience
canada,not_removed,our healthcare is nothing to brag about you get diagnosed with cancer be prepared to wait while it spreads
canada,not_removed,saying that everyone from a certain part of the world is out to overthrow our society is simply false insinuating that a straw man said something they didnt then going on to correct them is simply ridiculous
canada,not_removed,i didnt say that
canada,not_removed,immigration policies arent racism but saying that everyone from a certain part of the world is out to overthrow our society is simply false most people are not arguing for those sort of trumpesque policies targeting certain countries most of us just want immigration to be reduced to a drastically lower level say a year instead of the current we cant close ourselves off to the world but we shouldnt take the other extreme either and becomes strangers in our own country
canada,not_removed,keep telling people that their opinion does not matter because they are white that surely will help to fight racism
canada,not_removed,this wave of islamophobia you speak of is dubious it is mostly fake and exaggerated news the msm spreading their narrative what it is is people seeing the god awful mess in the european countries where they let in millions of immigrants and they are paying the price in the costs of supporting huge numbers of unemployed and crazy increases in property and assault crimes and the rest of us western countries simply not wanting to create for ourselves those kinds of problems supremacism is not a huge organized threat do not mistake the publics push back for white supremicism that is your construct and has no basis in reality and dont bother bringing in references to nazis that shit wont stick
canada,not_removed,control as in a nation state also going to dispute that claim in the other coubtries doing mass immigration down organized crime is up
canada,not_removed,i think you misread the domestic problems in canada are under the control of canada and things that we can directly affect the problems in external countries civil wars tribal wars religious sectarian violence rights abuses etc are not things under the control of canada if we take in large groups from cultures that have difficulties getting along in their homelands moving locations to canada doesnt make those conflicts go away a new culture can change that but it takes time and it takes interacting with different cultures regularly large groups banding together in a short period of time is the more dangerous scenario culturally speaking
canada,not_removed,none of your statements are based on facts sorry productivity growth has increased dramatically and far exceeded wage growth this is a worldwide phenomenon in all modern economies and is especially true in first world countries like britain the us and canada wages and productivity have decoupled decades ago and fyi the brits work more hours per week than the germans versus for the germans
canada,not_removed,according to the bank of england net migration has a neglible effect on wage growth with the exception being a small reduction in lowskilled service industry wages considering that the same immigration policies were in place before the financial crisis saw increases in wage growth it seems unlikely that the influx of cheap labour was the cause behind falling wages labour responds to supplydemand like any other commodity if the supply increases prices end up going down until they touch the minimum wage the countervailing force is the economic pie gets bigger to some extent increasing the number of jobs available of course the competition is more intense in certain sections of the labour market than others the number of polish economists who successfully obtained an economics job at the bank of england is likely astonishingly small coffee servers on the other hand
canada,not_removed,but isnt that what the americans want more vetting and control over illegal immigration so why qualify the statement
canada,not_removed,trickle of mexicans is starting from america pulled the visa requirement and elected trump extremely high probability that it will quickly turn into a flood people that entered the us illegally im sorry i dont have time for if they said we need another syrians or afghani i wouldnt call it out of the question sure lets explore it but we need a plan for success but mexicans that snuck into the us illegally i sponsored the wife to come from a country not long recovered from a military government and special police and the amount of hoops we had to jump through and cheques we had to write people from mexico hungary etc filling refugee claims is just a slap across the face to legitimate immigrants working their butts off to do things properly
canada,not_removed,not sure what immigrants you are referring to we arent taking in single male syrian asylum seekers into the country like the ones that flooded europe only males with wives and children are being brought as a refugee family
canada,not_removed,males leave the wife and kids because its way easier to travel without them they can bring them over safely once they have gained entry and legal status
canada,not_removed,deportation is bipartisan you wont find a political party thats against it the numbers overall have been increasing as our countries adjust their laws to make the process more efficient
canada,not_removed,but the portrait of a steadily increasing number of deportations rests on statistics that conceal almost as much as they disclose a closer examination shows that immigrants living illegally in most of the continental us are less likely to be deported today than before obama came to office according to immigration data expulsions of people who are settled and working in the united states have fallen steadily since his first year in office and are down more than since on the other side of the ledger the number of people deported at or near the border has gone up — primarily as a result of changing who gets counted in the us immigration and customs enforcement agencys deportation statistics the vast majority of those border crossers would not have been treated as formal deportations under most previous administrations if all removals were tallied the total sent back to mexico each year would have been far higher under those previous administrations than it is now from october
canada,not_removed,i posted this yesterday but since its relevant to the discussion ill save myself the time to rewright it i just wanted to point out that when people bring up that statistic no matter if its somebody defending obama or somebody making fun of people who are freaking out over the arrests going on right now they are failing to realize that the vast majority of those run of the mill deportations are people that were captured by the border patrol just after they crossed and before they could get to where they were going when south americans are captured they are detained until they can be sent back to their home country when mexicans are captured on the border they are typically sent back to mexico in just a few days and most who try it once will try it over and over again until they make it its not uncommon for a single person to be deported several times in as little as a year so those deportation numbers are a little deceptive the situation on the border wont change much unless trump makes the us unattractive to illegally enter however what trump is doing is empowering ice to open formerly closed checkpoints and conduct raids well within the countrys interior and theres not much any amnesty oriented state or federal authority can realistically do to stop him and this is just the start he will probably implement laws to make it increasingly difficult to get a job or collect benefits as a non citizen so a lot of illegals who have set up in the us and made a better life for themselves than they could ever hope to in their home country will try their chances at sneaking into canada and hoping they somehow dont get sent packing after all they dont really have much to lose by trying its entirely possible that this could become a very serious issue in the coming monthsyears
canada,not_removed,sorry eh can the us stop sending unwanted migrants over here in the freezing cold please
canada,not_removed,oh its you again the conspiracy theorist that claimed that hilarys policies were gonna lead to an all out war in europe
canada,not_removed,scotland voted to remain a part of the uk before brexit the premise of the stay side was that leaving the uk would mean closing themselves off from the eu market for which scotland relies upon a great deal there is no nationalistic fervor in scotland to remain british it was purely a business decision its not all that different from why quebec chose to stay in canada in now that england and wales already stupidly removed themselves from the biggest market in the world there are calls for another scottish referendum
canada,not_removed,it doesnt thats widely known and understood just because you feel that it is untrue doesnt make it so you do not dictate what is true only the facts do
canada,not_removed,excellent contribution
canada,not_removed,they would have stopped them
canada,not_removed,they actually did in the beginning and many tribes accepted europeans with open arms while both benefitted from trade early settlers relied on the natives for survival in the winters
canada,not_removed,it is actually called httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiignoratioelenchi
canada,not_removed,the law would have to be changed because at the moment there is nothing illegal about these crossings and the refugee claimants are not criminals it is not a matter of a court decisions or interpretations its not about growing a pair i personally disagree with you but i think it is useful to clarify what we are talking about so we may have a civil discussion of some sort
canada,not_removed,thats an even better idea
canada,not_removed,the us throwing money at anyone having any benefits worth soaking up you uh you sure were talking about the same country
canada,not_removed,i think people are mixing vetted refugees from syria and the people crossing the borders who are economic migrants
canada,not_removed,the numbers dont lie
canada,not_removed,for the same reason inviting homeless people into your house isnt a good idea buy them a sandwich build them a shelterbut dont let them live in your guest room
canada,not_removed,why do you think it is war torn
canada,not_removed,statscan
canada,not_removed,are you white
canada,not_removed,ill admit you had me going for a minute there
canada,not_removed,loool well done sir
canada,not_removed,you dont have to be white to be a bigot as you implied nor does the target have to be brown
canada,not_removed,so says the guy with the user name thevirtuesignal
canada,not_removed,damn that ended poorly
canada,not_removed,ive encountered plenty of canadian and international support for illegal immigration in the united states walking the talk is turning out to be a bit tougher it seems edit spelling
canada,not_removed,ive never understood the enthusiasm among american leftists for illegal immigration its pretty obvious to me the democrats need to import voters since the locals wont vote for them
canada,not_removed,when you know illegal immigrants are coming in and you literally see them you act on it they do in the us too what trump is suggesting is hoarding around millions around million illegal immigrants some of whom have been in the us for decades and have built lives and families and to ship them somewhere theres a huge moral difference between scooping up someone at the border to send him back and breaking up families forcefully because we cant assume theyll just hop on a bus when asked to and leave what about neighbors hiding their illegal friends because they have been there for a generation or two the questions behind the scenario trump is suggesting are endless and the answers are potentially disgusting
canada,not_removed,two men lost all their fingers to frostbite a few weeks ago that doesnt happen when you stroll up to a border crossing to claim asylum because of the agreement with the us they cant just report to a border crossing and request asylum that gets them denied and sent back to the us immediately if they get into canada first then report to a border post they at least get a hearing before getting sent back getting into canada before reporting to a border crossing is basically the definition of crossing the border illegally
canada,not_removed,united nations convention on refugees which protects a migrant from prosecution for illegally crossing an international border to make a refugee claim immigration minister hussen has said he doesnt feel the people who have arrived since last april constitutes a trend this essentially means our policy at the moment is amnesty
canada,not_removed,per cent of syrian refugees to canada spoke at least one of canadas official languages
canada,not_removed,french isnt that easy to learn we have people born here who still use broken french
canada,not_removed,we are in a new age now the rule of law is over when will cowards like you realize that we have to dominate and subjugate the inferior peoples of the world in order to maintain our quality of life
canada,not_removed,yeah lets expand into some of the greatest farmland in canada greater vancouver has an agricultural reserve which is one of the reasons why vancouver is built upwards
canada,not_removed,no they move to the big cities because thats where there are already established communities from their home countries
canada,not_removed,in what magical dreamland does more people translate to more jobs thats not how economics works no matter how strong your feels are
canada,not_removed,hey everyone this guy is giving out jobs and opportunity hes a canadian wizard
canada,not_removed,not really they used to back when there wasnt a safety net like today the people who came here had to sink or swim so only the ones who worked to make their fortunes would come here now each immigrant is an expense until they become a strong taxpayer even now doctors from abroad arent reckognized here and end up driving cabs etc we arent using the talent we take in let alone the unskilled talent we dont
canada,not_removed,there is no study that i am aware of that supports this statement and i have seen the opposite side support with studies
canada,not_removed,nope because all contributions zero out since a canadian would fill that role market share stays the same it just changes who has a piece of the pie if there is canadians and jobs work and go on welfare if there is canadians immigrants and jobs you just added people to the welfare its a zero sum game and they have zero benefits
canada,not_removed,thats why we should open our doors for more legal immigration
canada,not_removed,funny you should say that because all personal experience i have with canadian healthcare is the exact opposite of your claim
canada,not_removed,did i tell anyone their opinion doesnt matter because they are white oh right i didnt is stormfront brigading rcanada all of a sudden
canada,not_removed,it is mostly fake and exaggerated news it isnt im seeing it on reddit too what it is is people seeing the god awful mess in the european countries where they let in millions of immigrants its not a god awful mess but antiimmigrant posters are sure trying to portray it as such and crazy increases in property and assault crimes there havent been any such crazy increases supremacism is not a huge organized threat it may not be organized but it is a significant threat do not mistake the publics push back for white supremicism that push back is being encouraged by white supremacists who exaggerate the problems caused by immigration and use immigrants as scapegoats for a variety of problems that is your construct and has no basis in reality it isnt and it is entirely relevant to the situation the real question is why you feel motivated to deny it and dont bother bringing in references to nazis well neonazis are on the rise and they certainly are among those spreading false information about immigrants in order to whip up some hysteria that shit wont stick youre not the judge of that sorry the fact that stormfront is likely to be brigading this thread doesnt change this basic fact
canada,not_removed,control as in a nation state still doesnt make sense in what way are domestic criminals more under our control than immigrant criminals in the other coubtries doing mass immigration down organized crime is up sorry but thats more antiimmigration bs
canada,not_removed,what matters is the crime rate not the total number of crimes
canada,not_removed,if we take in large groups from cultures that have difficulties getting along in their homelands moving locations to canada doesnt make those conflicts go away sure it does these people arent instigators of the conflict they are the victim of it in the case of syrian refugees those who were opposed to bashar alassad wanted more democracy here they have this democracy why would they bring violence here when they were trying to flee it youre starting to sound dangerously close to those who claim people from these countries are inherently more violent which is absurd conflicts in those regions have many different root causes mostly political a new culture can change that but it takes time and it takes interacting with different cultures regularly again you seem to be saying that the problem is their culture when that has not been demonstrated in fact given our colonial past one could use the same logic to claim that our culture is the violent destabilizing one large groups banding together in a short period of time is the more dangerous scenario culturally speaking its not clear what youre referring to here can you give me an example of what you mean by large groups banding together in a short period of time
canada,not_removed,even though you stated that none of my statements were factual for some reason you only address the first point regarding productivity and none of the others so ill just address that i cant sensibly respond to you because your counterarguments are irrelevant or at least you dont tie in how they are relevant to anything all you did was inform me of things i already knew about and then are you really so naïve that you think simply because productivity and wages decoupled from a linear correspondance that therefore there is no relationship i see that your last link is from the ons this should be perplexing for you because the ons argues along with the bank of england and the lse and house of commons briefing papers that low productivity contributes to wage stagnation
canada,not_removed,i too discovered that every hard economic problem can be solved by making an x with my arms
canada,not_removed,literal feels over reals
canada,not_removed,what does the bank of england or the british government know about the british economy and its laws anyways i summarise my opinion on the probrexit types
canada,not_removed,people claiming refugee status from mexico have had a low rate of success over the past years if people are coming here after living in the us for some time then their chances would be even lower it would be a pain if there was a big flood of such people and we had to deal with their claims but i wouldnt expect very many of them to be staying
canada,not_removed,i dont know where those numbers come from ive personally known a few single mothers who were put up in hotels and student residences for a few months until subsidized housing was provided for them and their kids
canada,not_removed,single moms with to kids will be on our welfare systems forever not really they will be for at most years and then we have people contributing into the system
canada,not_removed,ummm you mean like this guy on saturday ahmed decided to take the risk of wintry roads and uncertain fields to find refuge in canada he said his group was driven about five kilometres from the canadian border their driver told them if they went to the border crossing they would be deported ahmed said so they would have to walk through the fields the group walked for about four hours ahmed said before they called and were picked up by police and brought to a cbsa centre already ahmed said he is feeling welcomed canada is a good country it is a friendly country he said i wish we protection because i cannot go back to somalia and i have a wife and kids that i havent seen in like two three years i wish canada that they give me a new life that i can my wife and kids
canada,not_removed,my husband would die before he left us in harms way but very different culture these men have one migrant claimed to not have had contact with his family and children for two or three years he would appear not bothered since he has no clue when the last time he attempted to check on them at all
canada,not_removed,im not arguing against that im just stating that there was evidence that the methodology in counting deportations under obama was different i would think that deportation shouldnt include turning around people at the border
canada,not_removed,strange i dont recall posting that clinton would cause war in europe perhaps you have me mistaken for someone
canada,not_removed,and then smallpox happened
canada,not_removed,nonmobile link httpsenwikipediaorgwikiignoratioelenchi helperbot rhelperbot i am a bot please message with any feedback andor hate counter
canada,not_removed,you invite homeless people to homeless shelters someone has to build those shelters you cant build the shelters while they are being bombed
canada,not_removed,well you seem like an absolutely lovely fellow i am white but probably not white enough for you
canada,not_removed,we all know
canada,not_removed,id be curious about that support illegal immigration in the us is a complex issue so the word support require a context of supporting what exactly i mean it is illegal immigration ive never heard anybody of any political leaning suggesting just to make walking into the country as legal us illegal immigration is difficult because the question is what to do with the large number of illegal immigrants they have and what is reasonable to reduce the number entering particularly from mexico the us situation has logistical issues based on the number theres enormous cost at finding andor detecting them there are economic issues for those that have been in the country for a long time and do a lot of low end labour that reduces prices there are social issues around separating families when parts are legal especially children but other parts of the family are not none of these are really issues with respect to the current situation in canada
canada,not_removed,yes it always is
canada,not_removed,theres a difference between calling for amnesty for those who made it in and clamping down on future visitors
canada,not_removed,id say its completely different the american led drug war destroyed mexico forcing refuges into the united states for a chance at a future canada didnt cause the refuges to come to here out of our own actions
canada,not_removed,so if someone was here illegally for a longer period it is ok you are practically saying that they just need to hide for an x period of years from immigration and thats ok then you are pretty much just jerking in the face of everybody that puts the hard work and effort to come here legally
canada,not_removed,to your first point that isnt entirely true there seems to be a growing number of people who were seeking asylum in the us not listed from the countries that the travel ban was on who are seeking to claim refugee status here because the us is no longer safe while trump is already making most yearn for the bush years the usa is still one of the better countries to seek asylum in these people are scared maybe rightfully so but then illegally crossing our border and then getting services from our government because of a stupid loophole that isnt right and it isnt the same as what trump was doing
canada,not_removed,many of these immigrants came through legal ways into the us they are coming into our country illegally those are dishonest people
canada,not_removed,nothing about that says that they can stay here indefinitely their claim will not be valid because they came to the us and theyll be sent back article shows that basically since they came from the us their refugee claim wont be granted theres nothing in there about amnesty and seems to indicate that the us being a third safe country is actually a barrier
canada,not_removed,which is another way to say that of them the majority came into the country completely unemployable and unequipped to succeed
canada,not_removed,its not the anymore comparing the sikhs immigration of the and lots of my good friends growing up were part of with whats happening today isnt a good comparison the tfw program alone should show that
canada,not_removed,i encourage millennials to become the modern day tech agricultural farmer such low hanging fruit to become a billionaire in their generation too bad money doesnt phase them as it stares them in their face
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,but there is economic growth
canada,not_removed,that simply is not correct
canada,not_removed,exactly this china has a billion people i doubt theres a job for each of them resources dont march in step with population population marches in step with resources that there is actually pretty basic biology follow under the curve or be brought to heel also factor in that these people are almost universally a drain on resources for some time before they become productive studies showing many remain on welfare for long periods so kulukudo evidently has not invested much thought in their commentary
canada,not_removed,actually that is how economics works as evidence by the abundance of economics papers on the topic excess people creates demand for a greater amount of goods and services a surplus of labour drives the creation of new industry to make use of it the uk has an extremely high rate of immigration but the unemployment rate is amongst the lowest in europe you can argue against immigration on other grounds but to suggest theyre stealing your jobs is nonsense
canada,not_removed,in what magical dreamland does more people translate to more jobs no dreamland but reality more people more consumers bigger market more demand more jobs look at germany it has a minieconomic boom the year following the flood of immigrants following your logic the us should have become bankrupt when its immigration far outpaced canadas during the and century and yet the opposite happened
canada,not_removed,think about what you just typed
canada,not_removed,its supply and demand more people means more demand of goods and services suppliers then increase the production of said goods and provide said services to cover the high demand this increase in productivity will require new jobs to cover the surge of demand of course theres automation and other things like that to take into account but overall there will still be new jobs created now people might ask about the quality of those jobs but that escapes the issue of immigration and economic growth if you are interested you could read about what economists call the lump of labour falacy
canada,not_removed,no shortage of unskilled jobs in the vancouver area
canada,not_removed,its not a zero sum game more immigrants means more consumers more consumers means a larger market if what you claim was true then the us would have suffered economically for having much more rapid immigration than canada in the late century instead the us became an economic superpower while canada remained rich but with a relatively unimportant economy i mean we are part of the but our economic clout pales before that of many nations india china brazil etc
canada,not_removed,the number of jobs available grows as the demand for goods and services grow more people more jobs
canada,not_removed,we also should keep our doors open for refugees
canada,not_removed,are the wait times really that bad no not usually there are always going to be anecdotal examples where people fall through the cracks but more people have anecdotes that go counter to it case in point i got bit by a pet breaking up a fight and took care of the wound at home small wound no big deal got infected walked into the er they didnt even let me sit down within minutes i was on a bed in the back with an iv in my arm pumping antibiotics total bill total wait time i guess i had to park the car first so minutes relative had an aneurysm nonburst found by the doctor somehow im not sure in for brain surgery within a month still going strong now years later total bill total wait time i guess a few weeks for an or to open up and routine tests to get done the point is generally if you need care youll get it and the order of precedence is based on how serious it is and how long it can wait basic triage the system works remarkably well given the strain its under it could use more resources and it could be better but its a damn sight better than the nightmares we hear from across the border i dont ever ever want to live in a country where hospitals are less concerned with the health of your body than the health of your bank account edit to add as to your question about paying for canadians to get treatment in the us i think this does happen but only where theres a very special condition requiring very specific and expert care only available in the us im not sure but i seem to remember hearing about this very rare though we have top notch medical care up here and dont really need to farm it out most of the time
canada,not_removed,no there are naysayers but our system is pretty good
canada,not_removed,it honestly depends ive heard of people who got in the next week for important procedures and ive heard of people who have waited months its worth it in my opinion though because at the end of the day you arent going bankrupt because you got cancer and no the canadian government will not pay for canadians to receive healthcare in the us
canada,not_removed,the wait times are pretty bad if you go into my local er you can expect to wait at least hours to be seen my mother waited that long with an open head wound before she saw the doctor if you need to see a specialist or have nonemergency surgery god help you youre waiting monthsyears
canada,not_removed,ask not what our country can do for you ask what you can do for our country
canada,not_removed,lucky
canada,not_removed,denial isnt just a river in egypt
canada,not_removed,hes not wrong immigrant populations often lack the language skills to communicate with authorities or fear retribution for doing so which leaves them extremely vulnerable to exploitation from the criminal elements which there will be this has happened every time there is wide spread diaspora see the mafia black axe gang mexican cartels etc etc its a real problem now im not saying we should stop accepting immigrants or refugees i am very much behind doing whats right even if it comes at a cost however we should be cognisant of these issues and work to minimise the effectiveness of organised crime that will appear in these communities
canada,not_removed,the government doesnt control who is born in the country they dont control who is fucking and what kids arent aborted they dont control that they do control who comes into the country or a least they are supposed to the governments obligation is to protect canadians first not foreigners
canada,not_removed,crime rate is actually a non sequitur the issue with too many refugees or immigrants too fast is shift in culture for example many come from culture and countries where abortion is illegal with them as voting in canada having a large number who can then vote in canadian elections can shift social policy such as making abortion illegal or efforts thereof in grander terms the reasons they are refugees in the first place is because there is fighting within their culture often between cultural or religious groups we dont want them to bring that kind of fighting and violent tendencies theocratic tendencies and intolerance for others that is canada doesnt exist as canada regardless of the make up of the people in canada voting and public opinion guide policy and changes making large enough demographics changes of culture and beliefs has a measurable effect on social policy not specifically policy about refugees but policy as supported by refugees too much change too fast destabilizes culture the issue is then having a small enough rate of entry so as not to destabilize things and absorb them into the greater canadian culture over time
canada,not_removed,as i mentioned for the bankers professionals and generally higher social classes it has negligible consequences perhaps you are included in that esteemed group such snide remarks ring rather hallow for those without such advantages
canada,not_removed,but if the trickle turns into a flood as many are predicting the processing will bury cic and cost millions public opinion will sour just the same this thing needs to be managed
canada,not_removed,or some of them stay on welfare because that is what they learned at home no one can say for sure what percentage will end up as taxpayers
canada,not_removed,if you have kids i have no faith that they will be remotely well adjusted members of society
canada,not_removed,that is an asylum seeker a refugee is something whos asylum application is approved an asylum seeker is someone who is seeking international protection but whose claim for refugee status has not yet been determined in contrast a refugee is someone who has been recognised under the httpsenwikipediaorgwikiconventionrelatingtothestatusofrefugees relating to the status of refugees to be a refugee just because he crossed into canada it does not mean we grant him refugee status automatically we can say a lot of asylum seekers are entering into the country but its not correct to say we are accepting them as refugee
canada,not_removed,i addition to the other reply you got there is a big difference between the refugees that the government is sponsoring from syria and the people who show every day at border crossings airports etc to claim refugee status the syrian immigrants was a decision made by the government while the people who show is not something the government can control we are simply forced to deal with these people because they showed up and made a claim
canada,not_removed,yeah that guy looks like a threat rolleyes
canada,not_removed,the least partisan sources i can find have noted an increase this coincides with logic as homeland security has only broadened its powers and scope since being created if obama and trudeau were really proimmigration openborders types then they would reduce the effectiveness of their border security this will never be the case for any party noting the increased efficiency of border security is par with my point
canada,not_removed,sources
canada,not_removed,and that really did a number on them though the blankets kept them feeling warm inside
canada,not_removed,do you have a source that says it is a mistake or misworded
canada,not_removed,we can run around this language all you want but the people are doing nothing illegal you can call them criminals if you want but you are factually incorrect by any measure or understanding the safe third country agreement was carefully drafted and considered by the harper government just because you dont like people crossing to make asylum claims doesnt make it illegal what you want requires a major shift in canadian policy withdrawing from international agreements and a fundamental change of the immigration act and probably a few other laws to boot thats what we are talking about you want to change the law to keep people from crossing canadian borders to make asylum claims i disagree
canada,not_removed,exactly lets not turn canada into the worlds homeless shelter
canada,not_removed,cant now sorry this has been long discussed with a prominent met an though and he knew this before i did its freely available info and not a point of contention so shove the fake news meme aside on this one
canada,not_removed,and yellow and red and olive and
canada,not_removed,do you know of any examples of anyone ever denying this
canada,not_removed,thank you the united states borders south america canada does not but yes youve pretty much outlined the moral implications of mass deportations after many of these immigrants have essentially become part of local culture were already hearing stories of republican voters being mad because a supposed illegal immigrant had a popular restaurant in the area was deported however i will say that i do believe that our federal govt should and must come up with a plan of action to deal with this whether we decided to take them in or whether we deport them back to their native countries i will say this in many cases especially for south american immigrants they have become very much a part of american culture and it has been largely embraced by most of the population
canada,not_removed,you are correct
canada,not_removed,i suppose it depends if the person is advocating for reasons of justice or compassion
canada,not_removed,its not that its ok its that the state failed to enforce its border and laws for a long enough amount of time for things to become grey morally no healthy democracy wants to start hoarding up people and shipping them somewhere for practical and moral reasons for example they might resist they might just come back because they now have connections to your country their kids are probably citizens of your country etc then there are economic reasons such as the cost of finding all these people rounding them up and the time involved to do this unsuccesfully most likely the immigration reform that was expected to be proposed by a clinton administration wouldve allowed people to get their citizenship making them pay more taxes because they do pay consumption taxes already it wouldve also reduced poverty and by extention violence since those people would now get access to better jobs and a better social safety net
canada,not_removed,i provided a statistic you editorialized
canada,not_removed,im not sikh and i literally spoke about syria in comparison like i said its an entire society not just the uneducated there is a reason you keep hearing about syrians with different skills its the skilled and educated people who are capable of dealing with all the beauracracy
canada,not_removed,its not quite so straight forward as that there are plenty of countries with higher populations that are much poorer than canada that could be how it plays out but its not even close to as simple as what youre saying
canada,not_removed,germany benefits immensely from a weak euro
canada,not_removed,oh i have at length
canada,not_removed,im sure those unskilled jobs pay for that almost free vancouver housing
canada,not_removed,last i heard there is a large shortage of affordable housing so until those unskilled jobs pay enough to make rent or justify the travel im guessing not much actual opportunity there
canada,not_removed,it should be noted my comment was regarding refuges and this is regarding economic migrants who almost by definition are looking for work
canada,not_removed,in the you could have a house and a car and support a family with a high school education the world isnt the same shit anymore what we are doing isnt working in growing thats why our economy is shit
canada,not_removed,what demand when they have no income what demand when there is no disposable income after the essentials theres no jobs because corporations abuse tfws and part time work jobs dont magically appear we been taking in immigrants for years now and our economy is shit job growth is shit people with no jobd is skt high at what point do you realize what we do in aint workin
canada,not_removed,why cant we put that money to first nations hmm
canada,not_removed,yes often there are experts in the us the other example is people with money who are lower priority who want care right away
canada,not_removed,goodness a reasonable post its all about urgency i walked into the er with severe abdominal pain turns out i had appendicitis and i was in the or that night theyre not going to just let you wither away on the sidewalk
canada,not_removed,exactly i went in for a routine pelvic exam and my doctor gave me an ultrasound of my ovaries as a joke i asked him to show me my insides he found a grapefruitsized tumour on my spleen i was fasttracked for a professional ultrasound at the hospital days later and a ct scan weeks later once they determined it wasnt cancer i did fall through the cracks but i did visit with a surgeon months later and i ended up getting everything removed months after my initial doctors visit spent a week in the hospital and my total cost was for a private room and for parking i got great care and they treated it with extreme urgency until they realised i wasnt going to die imminently i have no issues with how they handled my case
canada,not_removed,that which is asserted without evidence can be dismissed in the same way this was true back when you made unscientific claims about global warming and its still true now did you perhaps mistake this place for rconspiracy
canada,not_removed,see the mafia black axe gang mexican cartels etc etc the mafia existed in italy before the mexican cartels operate from outside the country etc sorry but unless you have some hard data im going to have to remain unconvinced on this one now im not saying we should stop accepting immigrants or refugees i am very much behind doing whats right even if it comes at a cost perhaps you should be arguing this with the many people who seem to claim the contrary in these threads as an aside its interesting how this thread appears to be brigaded given the voting pattern over the past couple of hours­
canada,not_removed,so basically the reverse of what the other person was saying then
canada,not_removed,very well said culture is something that is formed over generations when you start having places like toronto where almost half the population wasnt even born in canada let alone the gta you start risking having massive shifts in norms and cultures
canada,not_removed,making large enough demographics changes of culture and beliefs has a measurable effect on social policy how much of this has been observed though for example it doesnt seem as if opposition to abortion has shifted significantly i think you underestimate the appeal of the host culture for immigrants especially when that host culture is based on personal freedoms which has a lot of appeal across cultural barriers of course there are exception such as that afghan man who killed his daughters and exwifebut at the same time those women he killed did enjoy the personal freedom and emancipation of our culture even if they werent from it at some point you have to trust your ideals to be appealing to others no matter where they come from
canada,not_removed,many would probably like to but canada does not have the same tradition of using illegal immigrant labor that the usa has it is much harder to find an employer to let you work illegally in canada that might not stop people from trying though
canada,not_removed,yes it certainly needs to be managed do you think they should manage this according to current rules and procedures or is there some change that should be made
canada,not_removed,it probably varies a bit city to city ive heard of single mothers moving specifically to get into cities with nicer subsidized but ive never heard of any in need left on the street with young children im not saying it cant happen but theyre definitely a priority wherever they are
canada,not_removed,no but it will probably be about the same percentage as any other children raised in canada
canada,not_removed,most people even from poor families are able to find employment and hold down a job so on average most of them will wind up contributing
canada,not_removed,better to go by statistical data than faith
canada,not_removed,as i have explained in other replies i am not assuming that every refugee child will go on to be a productive contributing person most probably will but not all
canada,not_removed,what do you mean
canada,not_removed,on the other side of the ledger the number of people deported at or near the border has gone up — primarily as a result of changing who gets counted in the us immigration and customs enforcement agencys deportation statistics this is what im talking about its not that obama deported more illegals living within the country the stats were largely fluffed by at the border deportations
canada,not_removed,hes talking about the referendum which they voted to remain in the uk hes just neglecting to mention that that vote was based on the fact that the the uk being in the eu was a large part of why it turned out the way it did now that the uk has left the eu scotland believes it was betrayed hes just being intentionally obtuse about it or hes dumb
canada,not_removed,i think you are confusing countries with individual households and buildings they work on different scales
canada,not_removed,how about we let them in and kick you out
canada,not_removed,bruh you sound like youre snorting cocaine through a rolled up page of mein kampf you are directing your anger at entirely the wrong group of people
canada,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikicentralamerica
canada,not_removed,you cant realy think that it would do all of that come on more probably beside them not being deported for coming illegally nothing would really change just making you a legal resident does not make miracles if your education is shit unless you get lucky with your own business you get stuck on the same position you already were most of the times more probably what it would create is a bigger burden on the free handouts and health care
canada,not_removed,extended their visas
canada,not_removed,immigration population growth imagine two countries one has all its growth from births the other only grows by intaking people of the age of all things being equal the second will always be richer because they dont pay for birthing costs early education and dont run the risk of infant mortality another level to this simple model is educational attainment and skills canadas immigration policy strongly favours those with existing skills and education so they get access to those factors without paying training costs another factor is demographics if you look at countries with low birthrates like canada but low immigration they are suffering from prolonged secular stagnation italy finland and japan are the classic examples here now look at their neighbors specifically sweden and germany with high levels of immigration and they have excellent economic growth
canada,not_removed,they do but only because they would be the ones dragging it up the euro is weaker than it should be for germany but far stronger than it should be for greece
canada,not_removed,more people certainly more opportunities even for locals who now have a larger and demanding market to cater to
canada,not_removed,seems to work for the many thousands doing it already
canada,not_removed,rent isnt that bad outside of vancouver proper most of the jobs in vancouver are not in vancouver proper
canada,not_removed,in the you could have a house and a car and support a family with a high school education that has nothing to do with immigration and everything to do with manufacturing going abroad andor automation
canada,not_removed,we been taking in immigrants for years now and our economy is shit job growth is shit unemployment has been going down and our economy is relatively strong are you sure youre not just looking for excuses to harp on immigrants
canada,not_removed,we can walk and chew gum at the same time
canada,not_removed,how urgent are these gall bladder issues is it something thats being managed by medication or special diet or something in the meantime how lifethreatening are the issues im not saying the issues shouldnt get checked out and resolved but its likely that the doctors have assessed them as not immediately life threateningunlikely to progress to a life threatening condition and manageable in the meantime ill bet if things get bad she can go in and get seen almost immediately
canada,not_removed,depends a lot on where you are each province administers their own systems and some areas have higher case loads and varying number of staff etc and type of problems makes a different in terms of urgency
canada,not_removed,yeah excellent example if youve got appendicitis youll be in pretty quick pretty quick might mean a couple hours which still definitely sucks with appendicitis but theres a few moving parts to put in place to make an or and surgery happen so a few hours isnt unreasonable the weirdest shit out of the states isnt just the let the bums die on the sidewalk stuff as crazy as that is the craziest to me is the these hospitals are innetwork those ones arent so go to these ones when youre bleeding to death whaaaat youre supposed to tap on the paramedics shoulder in the ambulance and tell him which companys hospitals youre allowed to get treated in jesuscome on america get your shit together
canada,not_removed,oh boy ad hominem you lose
canada,not_removed,i didnt even imply that they started anywhere else the mafia in new york for example entrenched themselves in italian neighbourhoods at first because it was a population of vulnerable people people who frequently could not communicate with authorities who were easily manipulated through fear of reprisal the primary victims of italian organised crime were the italians themselves until relatively recently more recently has turned up in sicily operating in refugee areas under the approval of the sicilian mafia exploiting immigrant populations perhaps you should be arguing this with the many people who seem to claim the contrary in these threads maybe i just thought the other guy raised an interesting point im not really arguing against you i think wed probably agree on this issue for the most part
canada,not_removed,you can ask other people what other people say im happy to answer any question you have for me though
canada,not_removed,i think you underestimate the appeal of the host culture for immigrants especially when that host culture is based on personal freedoms which has a lot of appeal across cultural barriers i think you overestimate its appeal most migrants are not moving for cultural reasons they are moving for economic reasons migrants usually assimilateintegrate because it is the easiest route to economic success and that they are effectively surrounded by the cultural pressures of the host community once migrant communities reach a certain size though any need to integrate is lost and parallel societies start forming
canada,not_removed,one would hope
canada,not_removed,you can pretend that multigenerational welfare families dont exist all you like but theyre here and theyre sucking the teet dry those kids need to be big earners to pay back the system for the social assistance they received growing up while their parents contributed fuck all
canada,not_removed,got any stats to show then grew up in a house of three and i can tell you children take a great deal of patients and time there simply isnt enough time for five plus kids plus no work model doesnt pan out for imprinting on youth toss in the detrimental effects of single parenting and you get a bunch of fucked up adults
canada,not_removed,primarily but not exclusively so even according to your source it did increase under obama
canada,not_removed,youve already found that leaving a certain amount of illegals within the country is also a bipartisan take that is also logical
canada,not_removed,so making canada a very large refugee camp would be a good thing
canada,not_removed,why dont you just move to syria or iraq instead
canada,not_removed,nope just cant source it now because on mobile feel free to scour my history though as i made a thread about it or dont i dont give a shit and im tired
canada,not_removed,i dunno where youre seeing anger in my comment just calling it like it is what group of people should i direct my anger at
canada,not_removed,you cannot determine from a vote whether someone is denying reality or not i think you are probably making assumptions about what people think based on the popularity of your post
canada,not_removed,interesting the third point especially with regards to the first point it does seem to assume that a year old raised in canada will have the same potential as a year old raised in another country id imagine there are strong opposing views about that some who was a bit of a jerk could use it as an argument about the pointlessness of investing in early childhood education id venture that the second point doesnt quite stick with regards to this article since its about refugees am i wrong that refugees dont come in under the same point system
canada,not_removed,you brought up the century im telling you that time changes so the landscape is different so the results of immigration to america is not applicable to current system in canada
canada,not_removed,unemployment has not been going down they only count the work force not people who dont have jobs so if million people arent looking for work and dont have a job they will not count toward unemployment its just creative book keeping
canada,not_removed,wheres all this money come from
canada,not_removed,that wasnt an ad hominem so that means you lose
canada,not_removed,oh boy ad hominem you lose if you confuse attacking the unsubstantiated claim with attacking the person then logical debate is not the venue for you
canada,not_removed,the point i was trying to make was that these criminal organizations were already in place afaik there is no syrian mafia so im not sure how much pressure syrian refugees would get from criminal gangs for example and yes we probably do agree on this issue for the most part i reacted a bit strongly because a lot of the posts here seem unusually antiimmigrant so im suspecting some sort of brigade
canada,not_removed,most migrants are not moving for cultural reasons sure but that doesnt mean they dont seen to adapt to their host culture second and thirdgeneration immigrants are often completely integrated migrants usually assimilateintegrate because it is the easiest route to economic success and that they are effectively surrounded by the cultural pressures of the host community yes thats pretty much my point once migrant communities reach a certain size though any need to integrate is lost and parallel societies start forming it has little to do with the size of the community and a lot to do with how closeopen their host society is
canada,not_removed,im not pretending such situations dont exist im just going by averages this involves looking at the bigger picture and going by what usually happens
canada,not_removed,canada has an intergenerational earnings elasticity of less than putting near the lowest of any country in the world and there only around of the population living below the low income cut off which would include everyone who is on welfare so you can imagine some terrible situation where a whole family of people grow up to be fucked up adults but situation would not be common if we go by what usually happens we see that most people from poor households are probably going to be normal wage earning contributors to society
canada,not_removed,under obama what was counted and considered to be deportations increased so the statistic is misleading as the definition is too broad its the same logic used when looking at swedens rate of sexual assault people say that sweden either has an increasing sexual assault problem or that it doesnt since the definition that sweden uses for sexual assault is much broader than what is considered the norm
canada,not_removed,im not really sure why youre arguing about bipartisanship im just pointing out that obamas deportation statistics are misleading because the method of gathering statistics changed during his term
canada,not_removed,the filthy rich that hide their taxes overseas the people destroying our environment for profit the politicians looking out for their own self interests instead of their constituency take your pick theyre doing far more damage than refugees legal or otherwise ever could and uh calling it like it is sounds a lot like racist fearmongering to me being impolite doesnt automatically make you correct demagogues are going to try and claim that by banning refugees or treating minorities as something inherently dangerous they can solve all the ills of canadian society dont become a useful idiot to those people by repeating their baseless lies
canada,not_removed,youre right that refugees do not fall under the second point but they are only in the entire program as far as i am aware trudeau also made a point of only selecting families but i strongly suspect there will be productivity issues arising from cultural incompatibilities but it wont affect canada dramatically in the long run just think of it as national scale charity my first point doesnt really apply to canada it was more of a thought experiment to show how increasing population through immigration is not the same as increasing population through childbirth with all other factors being equal a country that matches an exactly equivalent countries population growth purely through immigration would come out on top due to simple savings on childbirth now to explore this idea more fully we have to consider what makes a country rich the single biggest factor is the strength of its institutions you could take for example indonesia and exactly replicate every single policy that canada has on the books and it would still not equalise its wealth with canada any time soon this is not because canadian born people are intrinsically more productive than indonesians it is because canada has a strong rule of law property rights education system infrastructure and so on these institutions are not diminished through immigration so long as severe cultural issues do not arise not a given admittedly so an expansion of the population scales the economy more or or less linearly there are frictional effects such as overloaded infrastructure decreased supply of housing or greater demand on existing education services but governments can mitigate this through effective policy and with the exception of a few failings the canadian government is very good at this even when failings do arise this is the fault of the government not the immigration itself
canada,not_removed,and i suppose they plan to keep every dime they earn and send it out of the country no they buy homes pay taxes etc all that buying is employing someone else
canada,not_removed,thats irrelevant they are a workforce it is up to job creators to take advantage of that increased workforce
canada,not_removed,so the results of immigration to america is not applicable to current system in canada you havent demonstrated that this is true
canada,not_removed,and your qualifications for making those claims is
canada,not_removed,the federal and provincial budgets
canada,not_removed,lol im a conspiracy theorist therefore my argument is invalid how is that not ad hominem
canada,not_removed,the definition has changed but even if it hadnt the number would still have increased though not by as much
canada,not_removed,sounds like you want some sort of fascist to control the country and force these rich folks to do what you want im available
canada,not_removed,then you are projecting your own assumption about other peoples views without sufficient evidence
canada,not_removed,hey at least pizza pops are staying at for pops and not raising their price or anything unlike mccains which are now for pockets and are the same price instead of the discount the size reduction deserves since the only thing different is the size of each pocket otherwise the recipes and ingredients are the same
canada,not_removed,hmmm i love pizza pops and i love poutine and i even loved poutine pizza though the only time i ever had it was when visiting vancouver does that mean ill love poutine pizza pops dare i find out
canada,not_removed,those things are goddamn horrible ive got left in my freezer and just thinking about eating them makes me ill im going to save them until someones here and theyre too drunk to realize theyre about to make a mistake
canada,not_removed,people should be forced to eat the creations they vote on architects should be forced to live in the buildings they create and childrens book writers should be forced to read their books to their kids every night at bedtime
canada,not_removed,you know whats better any actual frozen pizza the nostalgia factor of eating these cardboard encrusted little pieces of shit is the only reason people miss them good riddance you still frozen in the middle little cocksuckers
canada,not_removed,this may be sacrilege here but i always preferred pizza pops over mccains pizza pockets the dought in pizza pops has some taste to it whereas in pizza pockets they just tasted like bland starchy bread ok i better run now before the mob catches up to me
canada,not_removed,did we actually lose mccains cause i have noticed that i cant find them many places why am i just hearing this now this is madness
canada,not_removed,is mccains not selling pizza pockets anymore i realize its been awhile since i bought them but i figured they would be there for people in the zombie apocalypse
canada,not_removed,is no name still making pizza pocket ripoffs
canada,not_removed,wait a second ok iv been away from canada for a while living in europe so i am a little behind on newspizza pockets no longer exist how the hell could this happen without rioting in the streets and the mccain family being strung up in town square am from from mccain plant if i were homw id lead the charge
canada,not_removed,these were out months before mccain messed with the pizza pockets brand there is also butter chicken
canada,not_removed,no wonder ive been having a hard time finding pizza pockets i fucking love those the new pillsbury pizza rolls are amazing though
canada,not_removed,pizza pockets are so much better than pops
canada,not_removed,not correct they are just getting an upgrade we made sure that we did not change the recipes or the flavours because we went and asked consumers said vikram bawa mccain foods ltds vicepresident of marketing we did make the pockets bigger added more protein meat and cheese to make them more satiating
canada,not_removed,what what pizza pockets dont exist anymore those things were vile but its a good old childhood souvenir p
canada,not_removed,these have been on the shelf for months now
canada,not_removed,you want heartburn this is how you get heartburn and probably the shits
canada,not_removed,o shit you mean pizza pockets aka the superior form of pizza pops man that sucks they are changing them other commenters say theyre going to be more expensive i dont appreciate that i can buy a whole ristorante pizza for like bucks i dont need the pockets to be
canada,not_removed,where can you buy these
canada,not_removed,i havent had a goddamn pizza pop or pocket in like years and this viral marketing is pulling me back in
canada,not_removed,pillsbury is owned by general mills which is headquartered in minnesota minnesota is basically american canada so these are basically canadian eh
canada,not_removed,i just threw up in my mouth a little
canada,not_removed,i tried these they nasty
canada,not_removed,saw these in store never thought that poutine could make me gag this did
canada,not_removed,i had to check to see if this was rsubredditsimulator
canada,not_removed,i hope the pc pizza pouches dont change to follow suite i havent bought the mccain version in a while
canada,not_removed,thats a damn good title i wanted to share this too but thought it would sound boring really shows what a good title can do
canada,not_removed,mccains pizza pockets are hot garbage anyway
canada,not_removed,theyre called mccains pizza pockets and theyre not gone
canada,not_removed,you know a perogie is more or less the same thing
canada,not_removed,thats so wrong
canada,not_removed,why are your pizza pockets only
canada,not_removed,i need to know where to buy thesefor science
canada,not_removed,the science of pocketed pizza is going too far
canada,not_removed,i liked the pillsbury ones better anyway not sure how i feel about a poutine flavor
canada,not_removed,i love em
canada,not_removed,not their worst job i know i cant be the only person who remembers a mexican flavoured one in the mid that shit was fucking vile but my dad loving a sale bought shitloads of them when they were discontinued i can still remember the distinctive cuminy horridness and want to try one to see if it was all in my head
canada,not_removed,i would eat it
canada,not_removed,my god the sons of bitches finally did it may god have mercy on our everlasting souls
canada,not_removed,not that i ate them very often but i havent purchased any since i saw a small boy in one of winnipegs poorer neighbourhoods eating a pizza pop that was still frozen
canada,not_removed,ive been looking for these bring them back
canada,not_removed,if you would eat an extragreasy version of a greasy friesandgravy pizza then go ahead
canada,not_removed,no
canada,not_removed,what dark science is this have our people gone mad
canada,not_removed,i will eat the ever loving shit out of these
canada,not_removed,ef me in the eh
canada,not_removed,ive had these theyreokay pretty salty wouldnt buy again but would eat if provided
canada,not_removed,ive had the poutine pizza pops they are literally terrible and taste nothing like poutine
canada,not_removed,im super triggered that pocket pizzas are gone they turned them into bistrostyled bullshit now more expensive while having less food
canada,not_removed,but they are disgustingly but i love poutine so this is weird
canada,not_removed,ive never had pizza pockets before only pizza pop pizza pop doesnt taste as good as they used to though something changed with the dough i think
canada,not_removed,jai le tres grand plaisir de vous presenter pour le premier fois ce soir les petites marché harvest pockets le même goût des pizza pockets mais nous avons marché sur les pockets avant vous manger et nous parles franch
canada,not_removed,urrrggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh sorry about the outburst
canada,not_removed,wife loves poutine she bought some said theyre disgusting like it was any guess i will not eat them lol pizza pockets can still be bought at superstoreno frills edit didnt know they changed pizza pockets damn
canada,not_removed,these are fucking amazing
canada,not_removed,pockets used pepperoni slices and seemed less shitty but pops was just a pocket of relatively tasty goo cant say ive had either in a while ive already hit my quote of eating shitty things without reintroducing those
canada,not_removed,lol oh wow i dont know whether i should be grossed out or if i need to go buy a box like now i will definitely try it
canada,not_removed,that shit is ridiculously salty
canada,not_removed,sowhere can i buy these i kind of want to try them tbh
canada,not_removed,next time the wife is out of town im buying those
canada,not_removed,i loved pizza pops used to eat them all the time the new pepperoni flavour ones are actually inedible for me i tried it was so bad despite being really hungry i couldnt finish it
canada,not_removed,when they make pizzaghetti pizza pops ill rethink my dietary habits
canada,not_removed,fuck it id eat that
canada,not_removed,and a reasonable cents each
canada,not_removed,very drunk me needs these right now ahhhhhhhh
canada,not_removed,so so gross
canada,not_removed,there are some lines that man was never meant to cross we are weak feeble human beings who would be driven to madness by our own arrogance
canada,not_removed,i was never a fan of pizza pockets but ill damn well miss the mini pizzas ive eaten those off and on for years the transition to dr oetker didnt seem to go so well since the purchase they taste completely different
canada,not_removed,please no we already like canada stop shoving down our throats
canada,not_removed,i cant even imagine what the fucking salt content in one of those is
canada,not_removed,butter chicken ones are better
canada,not_removed,whats the market for this do people grocery shop while drunk
canada,not_removed,pillsbury just started making their own pizza rolls too the only other ones i can find in my area are mccains and though delicious you only get a handful at a time while the pillsbury ones come in a bag of like they arent quite as good though
canada,not_removed,mmmm heartburn pockets
canada,not_removed,how salty will these be
canada,not_removed,why would putin make pizza pops
canada,not_removed,i actually love the poutine pizza pops i actually prefer them over the regular flavours
canada,not_removed,itt gross people
canada,not_removed,i actually found them pretty good i liked the gravy
canada,not_removed,fuck those are gross the bread or whatever it is tastes so fucking bad id rather eat dirt
canada,not_removed,seriously havent had a pizza pop in years but now im interested
canada,not_removed,mccains or bust for me
canada,not_removed,welp time for me to go grocery shopping
canada,not_removed,special edition its a collectors piece keep it in your freezer for years and you can auction it off for a fortune
canada,not_removed,frozen poutine think the sthubert poutine ball already showed how well it goes hint dont try
canada,not_removed,we call that empanadas in argentina i didnt know poutine stuffed empanadas ill have to try
canada,not_removed,wait these are gone fuck i loved the deluxe version of these they were great from the microwave just a bit damp without paper towelm not greasy
canada,not_removed,those look like theyd need to be dipped in ketchup to hide the saltiness
canada,not_removed,member burning the roof of your mouth
canada,not_removed,might give it a try i wasnt planning on having a shit this week anyway
canada,not_removed,the poutine ones im sad to say are disgusting however there are butter chicken ones that are pretty good but still the normal deluxe ones are the best
canada,not_removed,pizza pockets fucking suck pops for life
canada,not_removed,i had the butter chicken kind it was ok if a little weird to have rice involved in that whole situation i couldnt bring myself to try the poutine variety
canada,not_removed,poutine pizza pops dont knock em till you try them best pizza pop i ever had
canada,not_removed,wait where exactly is the pizza in this pizza pop
canada,not_removed,mccains is changing pizza pockets they arent gone i dont know why they are doing that because they are fine the way they are even on twitter they said they are making them better not getting rod of them id rather lick a dogs ass than eat a pillsbury pizza pop
canada,not_removed,poutine sounds gross but ive tried the butter chicken one and it was fantastic
canada,not_removed,just looking at any pops makes me wanna vomit its not even food
canada,not_removed,mccains never made pizza pops
canada,not_removed,mccain pizza pockets and anyone who likes them more than pizza pops is a traitor
canada,not_removed,poutine taste like dog food but not the good kind dont trust me on that i found that butter chicken was surprisingly good but poutine you will taste this garbage in your mouth for the next hours as you have gross poutine burps and thoughts of regret edit i mean the poutine pizza pops they are ass inside pastry real poutine is made from angel tears
canada,not_removed,mmmm starchstuffed starch with gravy
canada,not_removed,pockets were actually stomachache mcshit pizza pops taste like acetic acid mixed with gasoline
canada,not_removed,that thing could almost look good if they used a potato outer shell instead of bread crust
canada,not_removed,heh theyre both tasty and all but honestly theyve got nothing to schneiders hot stuffs too bad theyre discontinued
canada,not_removed,i eagerly awaiting the day they remove trans fats
canada,not_removed,i was never a fan of mccains pizza pops their shellbreadcrust was odd
canada,not_removed,you scared the shit out of me implying they were taking away pizza pops fuck pizza pockets pizza pops are dope as fuck
canada,not_removed,pizza pops were always superior to pizza pockets
canada,not_removed,pillsbury masterrace
canada,not_removed,whats with the english in this title i cant get that in a canada driven mad
canada,not_removed,is mccain canadian shame if it is but pillsbury ones are ten times better than mccain
canada,not_removed,those shirty mccain abominations are gone finally
canada,not_removed,who the fuck eats that shit no wonder north america is so fat
canada,not_removed,please fix your title
canada,not_removed,not only that but theyre not actually discontinuing them just rebranding its a bold strategy cotton lets see if it pays off for em
canada,not_removed,pizza pops are made in manitoba
canada,not_removed,oh i used to fucking love these the pillsbury ones suck
canada,not_removed,whoops youre right my bad
canada,not_removed,thank youim living outside canada for a long time nowthought for a second mccains bought pillsbury lol
canada,not_removed,limits of sanity test check am not in an alternate dimension
canada,not_removed,i use to get so mad at my mom for confusing pizza pops and pizza pockets
canada,not_removed,oh my god no
canada,not_removed,there is such a thing as pizza pops not sure if its mccain though how do i know theres still some of those terrible things in our freezer gift from a canadian friend they raved but we cant choke them down i keep thinking if i have some expiring cheese to shred maybe covering them with it to try and add some flavor as shipped theyre just a greasy but dry shell with a gooey sauce inside and tiny cubes of bologna masquerading as pepperoni its like a lower version of dog food
canada,not_removed,this guy pops
canada,not_removed,size they added more dough there isnt any more filling
canada,not_removed,a canadian company screwing canadian consumers par for the course
canada,not_removed,i had a pizza pop about a year ago but before that must have been over years i was shocked at how small they got
canada,not_removed,if you buy the six pack i believe you end up paying almost the same as the old four pack per pocket that is
canada,not_removed,hey at least pizza pops are staying at for pops and not raising their price or anything yet
canada,not_removed,you couldnt pay me to eat that pillsbury trash
canada,not_removed,i still pay it as pizza pockets are king pops are too saucy and the lava inside always destroys my mouth
canada,not_removed,yeah but pizza pops taste like cardboard wrapped fertilizer mccains may only include pockets but they are a huge improvement in taste and texture
canada,not_removed,you can also try out the new poutine flavoured chips theyre selling no but seriously dont its disgusting
canada,not_removed,theyre not bad not good but better than mcdonalds travesty of a poutine ill give them that
canada,not_removed,you should try it and report back to us with your expereince
canada,not_removed,do like onion in your poutine
canada,not_removed,i tried it and the consistency was of vomit as was the smell i know this because they came back up immediately disgusting
canada,not_removed,i was in the same boat until i tried these fucking disgusting dont waste your money
canada,not_removed,dont do it they are gross even my husband who likes gross things didnt like them
canada,not_removed,i tried them and i love poutine the pizza pops however are awful
canada,not_removed,no poutine pizza pops taste like dog food but not the good kind dont trust me on that i found that butter chicken was surprisingly good but poutine you will taste this garbage in your mouth for the next hours as you have gross poutine burps and thoughts of regret edit hes talking about poutine pizza pops and so am i if you think that these taste good and compareble to poutine i dont know what to say lol wife buddy and i tried a box and threw them in the garbage
canada,not_removed,drunk me would fucking love these
canada,not_removed,pure evil
canada,not_removed,the newish flavors theyve been around for a year or so of buffalo chicken and nacho beef are also fucking disgusting
canada,not_removed,i did the same thing then finally one day i took them for lunchthey were actually quite good definitely different though
canada,not_removed,i thought i was the only one i have a box in my freezer that i know im going to throw out i ate one and halfway through the second i felt like throwing up how do you fuck up potatoes gravy and cheese that bad
canada,not_removed,can confirm satan reincarnated as a pizza pop they put big chunks of onion in there and its a putrid mix of horrible sauce minimal actual cheese and said onion
canada,not_removed,i actually threw packages out last week they had been in my freezer for months and i knew i was never going to be that desperate
canada,not_removed,i didnt mind themhowever a day after eating them was still burping them up
canada,not_removed,somehow they actually smell slightly worse than they taste donotwant
canada,not_removed,classic
canada,not_removed,they always make me sick not exaggerating every time i eat them i get a bloated feeling in my stomach shortly later and have to throw up similar with pringles i figure its an allergy or something last time tested was only mold though
canada,not_removed,so how bad are they i would assume the fries are really mushy the cheese is dry and tacky like old chewed gum and the gravy more then likely is chunky please elaborate as i am drawn to try these and inevitably i will be let down so please make it clear why i shouldnt waste my money thanks
canada,not_removed,that would solve too many problems
canada,not_removed,you almost cant even compare them to real pizza they are almost like a completely different food altogether despite their name
canada,not_removed,i think the mccains ones were good in the oven but i would still say no better than a frozen pizza of your preferred brand
canada,not_removed,you still frozen in the middle little cocksuckers you were clearly cooking them wrong theyre supposed to be thirddegree burning on the outside little cocksuckers
canada,not_removed,when i was a kid pizza pops were a common item on dinertype restaurant menus they deep fried them and they were glorious
canada,not_removed,still frozen in the middle means you didnt warm them up long enough if you warm them up properly you cant eat them for another minutes while they cool down
canada,not_removed,you can just throw them in the microwave and have them done in a couple minutes though definitely more convenient than cooking a pizza
canada,not_removed,cocksuckers calm down bubbles
canada,not_removed,fond memories of eating half a box of those little napoli pepperoni pizzas even microwaved they were great better left to memories most likely pretty much all frozen pizza is sodium delivery system shit and youre better off saving your bucks
canada,not_removed,oven baked they are actually pretty good and ive never had an issue with still cold middles cooking them that way but then again the min cook time sort of negates the whole quick convenience factor editi dont mean the poutine flavour my choice would be pepperoni and bacon
canada,not_removed,i love around the corner from a good donair joint dont miss these shitty things one bit
canada,not_removed,even better than frozen pizza pizza stonecooked frozen pizza i bought a pizza stone from walmart that makes their gv frozen pizzas taste goddamn delicious
canada,not_removed,if theyre frozen in the middle it means youre not microwaving right youre supposed to flip halfway through
canada,not_removed,cocksuckers calm down bubbles
canada,not_removed,are the mccain ones the fully round ones the day my parents switch from the round ones to the pizza pops was the best day ever as a child
canada,not_removed,ill stand by you in this war of frozen pizza snacks pizza pops pizza pockets and its not even close
canada,not_removed,fuck that noise they may taste like the worst of pizzapizza in microwaved form aka taste like cardboard but theyre my comfort food pizza pops and pogos were my childhood indulgences
canada,not_removed,how dare you have an opinion have at you
canada,not_removed,me too dont worry ive been living in the us for the past years and every time i go home i eat as many pizza pops as i can i also miss the mini pizzas which i prefer to eat after theyve been cooked and in the fridge for a little while i dont know why
canada,not_removed,youre entirely objectively factually correct
canada,not_removed,and also not entirely true theyre rebranding them but hey if it gets everyone talking about em whatever right now a few people might buy one to see what the difference is it could completely backfire on them though
canada,not_removed,they just rebranded them but for some reason people they they were discontinued
canada,not_removed,frozen foods in the zombie apocalypse you are gonna last a week son
canada,not_removed,the no name ones have always been the best ones
canada,not_removed,can confirm was at no frills earlier today edit letter
canada,not_removed,its just misinformation they got rebranded
canada,not_removed,they didnt
canada,not_removed,you get two in a box instead of four for the same price as before definitely a cost cutting measure under the guise of rebranding
canada,not_removed,ive had the new stuff i wouldnt call it an upgrade so much as an entirely different product more akin to stouffers stuff theyre not awful but theyre not pizza pockets anymore
canada,not_removed,if microwaved disgusting toaster ovened delicious toaster ovened for two hours because someone fell asleep on the couch a passable hockey puck
canada,not_removed,potato and cheese yeah bread and gravy though
canada,not_removed,winnipeg is bad enough poor area has got to be awful
canada,not_removed,the no name ones always had better and a lot more filling anyway and theyre not changing
canada,not_removed,like violent sex with your mouth
canada,not_removed,who cares poutine
canada,not_removed,isnt the dough slightly different this is more like a shitty calzone than an empanada
canada,not_removed,havent you had poutine pizza
canada,not_removed,and double the price since you only get instead of thats whats really going on here
canada,not_removed,pizza pockets are objectively better there is no seal that break mid meal meaning your snack doesnt explode all over your hand like a boy on prom night
canada,not_removed,pockets have better filling but the pops have a better dough
canada,not_removed,love poutine but youre right these are beyond disgusting cooked up all had bites and threw the rest in the garbage
canada,not_removed,burn the heretic
canada,not_removed,no joke when i used to get a littlebacked upid eat a deluxe pizza pop and be cleaned out the next morning it was my goto laxative
canada,not_removed,no theyre discontinued i bought those new and improved pizza pockets and as every time theyve improved them everything got worse a box costs the same as a box used to cost theres only two pouches in the box instead of theyre mostly dough now mccain just handed the market over to pillsbury
canada,not_removed,not just rebranding we saw these at the metro recently and thought of picking them up until i noticed there were only in the box for the same price as the previous i assumed they were bigger from the picture on the box then i felt the box and they only took up half of it the rest was empty
canada,not_removed,it wont nearly half the size for the same price
canada,not_removed,theyve rebranded so many times though remember the blueblack lightning boxes remember those inch individual mccain pizzas those things were fuckin awesome
canada,not_removed,well since they changed the dough to whole wheat they have been awful so they can call them whatever they want
canada,not_removed,i just hope they bring back the hawaiian and cheese flavours it seems like for years all i ever saw were pepperoni or deluxe in stores
canada,not_removed,also for a box of vs a box of before
canada,not_removed,i got drunk and curious one night so i bought some they tasted pretty damn similar to the original
canada,not_removed,mccain market am i translating this right because thats the most boring rebranding ive seen
canada,not_removed,the new name is terrible i find why marche
canada,not_removed,fucking loved jason bateman in dodgeball
canada,not_removed,they are pretty good though id buy them for at the most but not the they have them at right now
canada,not_removed,well for one the naming is off to a bad start just because its canada doesnt mean they need to get all french or quebecois on our ass
canada,not_removed,and it doesnt even matter because pizza pockets are fucking garbage so are pizza pops though so whatever
canada,not_removed,it makes me feel good to know my favourite food on the planet comes from my own country
canada,not_removed,unsubscribe from pizza pops facts
canada,not_removed,i think they originated in winnipeg and the guy who made them got bought out
canada,not_removed,i miss the mushroomgreen pepper vvvveggie pops they didcue the breakdancing
canada,not_removed,bruh pizza pops are just mini panzerottis just like hot dog buns are mini sub buns
canada,not_removed,first of all how dare you
canada,not_removed,they shouldnt even be allowed to call them pizza anything sauce pops might be accurate
canada,not_removed,really the mccain ones are awful and i eat anything
canada,not_removed,i did a science experiment when i was a child on which one had more stuff the results were fascinating but i forget the groundbreaking information i found out i think i got a f for fun also fuck pillsbury pizza pockets with its crusty edges the perfect evenly cooked round pizza pops is where it was at minus the cold middle edit i like the round ones
canada,not_removed,yeah when they bought them out the quality suffered imho plus they stopped making the chili one that one was great
canada,not_removed,they altered the recipe around the crust was much better and less chewy fuck em
canada,not_removed,theyre also not discontinued at all
canada,not_removed,how dare you s
canada,not_removed,i recently moved to the us and pizza pockets is the food i miss the most after poutines the hot pockets were are trash
canada,not_removed,actually dr oetker bought mccains pizza business and they make mccains old pizzas and mini pizzas mccain only makes the pockets now httpwwwoetkercacaenourproductsgiusepperisingcrustpepperoniindexhtml
canada,not_removed,pop pop
canada,not_removed,but its got more pizza stuff
canada,not_removed,the mccain family doesnt give a shit anymorethe company is run by low life show me the money types out of toronto they offshore jobs to india treat their staff like garbage the wholesome family business does not exist anymore and the product trickery is part and parcel of the new mccain
canada,not_removed,maybe you are the one who got bigger nostalgia plays tricks on all of us
canada,not_removed,they used to taste much much better too they used to actually taste like pizza now they just taste like sweet processed crap
canada,not_removed,but the pack was where the value was
canada,not_removed,i found the presidents choice poutine chips to be actually quite accurate to the flavour prefer theirs to ruffles anyways
canada,not_removed,the poutine lays tasted like salt feet a hint of boring gravy and stale mozzarella
canada,not_removed,poutine ruffles are actually quite good
canada,not_removed,that i do have access to ruffles and lays and i dont mind them at all im not sure i need to buy them again but i didnt hate them
canada,not_removed,i dont mind the poutine chips they dont really taste anything like poutine but theyre ok when it comes to these artificial flavourings i find they never really taste like whatever it is it says its suppose to but they still have their unique taste
canada,not_removed,cold and crunchy just about my favourite things about poutine
canada,not_removed,i have pretty low standards when it comes to fast food but the flavour of mcds poutine didnt bother me so much as the small overpriced portion size and their weird inability to have it stay hot for more than minutes
canada,not_removed,alas i think that may be a challenge i just searched all of two grocery store websites with decent search functions of those available here in ottawa and i cant find that flavour in other news id like to note that superstore classifies category this as
canada,not_removed,i work at save on foods and the day those things came off the truck i bought a pack youd never guess it but it actually tastes like poutine not actual poutine youd get at a new york fries but theres actual fries and gravy in there the only qualm i had with it was that it was fairly salty
canada,not_removed,in case anyones interested i was unsuccessful in finding it in any ottawa grocery store including walmart
canada,not_removed,of course only an onion hater wouldnt
canada,not_removed,i tried them and i couldnt tell if that was onion or tiny chunks of french fries
canada,not_removed,i dunno all these people telling me not to try it kind of makes me want to try it even more maybe im masochistic or maybe im just too curious i dont think i even expect them to be good i just really want to try it for myself now i think a trip to walmart is in the books for this weekend
canada,not_removed,and then you would wake up with third degree burns all over your mouth hell its hard to even eat these things sober without getting burnt at least once
canada,not_removed,sober me would fucking love these reminds me of nights that dad was cooking growing up
canada,not_removed,thats exactly the thought i had when i tried them sober me was disgusted drunk me would have been in heaven
canada,not_removed,the triple cheese ones are great though theyre the only ones i get
canada,not_removed,those buffalo chicken gave me mad farts also they replaced the delicious ham in the hawaiian pizza pops with disgusting tasteless baaaaaaaaacon that tastes like nothing i dont want fuckin cheese pineapple pizza pop
canada,not_removed,i thought they were meh not great but not bad either just the regular dough for the pocket and some mediocre gravy and cheese curds
canada,not_removed,i agree these and the new ghostbusters were both surprisingly decent
canada,not_removed,the cheese didnt melt or maybe those were the fries and i couldnt tell the difference the gravy tasted weird and there was too much of it the inevitable leakage onto the plate while being microwaved smelled kinda icky at least the gravy wasnt chunky but i could have accepted lumpy gravy if it at least tasted good in summation it was sadness and disappointment wrapped in dough
canada,not_removed,yeah more of a pizza inspired junk food never had them myself only the pillsbury ones and they werent that great luckily my roommates apparently really liked them as they disappeared fast
canada,not_removed,because theyre meant to be like calzones not actual pizzas
canada,not_removed,those are good in the oven i cant argue with that
canada,not_removed,dr oetkers was the fucking bomb until they merged with mccain theyre still better than most but theyre not insanely good like they used to be
canada,not_removed,the pilsbury ones are good in the oven too
canada,not_removed,they were awesome in the oven
canada,not_removed,i had a coworker once who had worked previously at the mccain plant she told me that on their lunch break they were allowed to take a ration of pizza pockets straight off the line fresh out of the oven before they were frozen apparently that is when they are most awesome
canada,not_removed,pillsbury actually makes little frozen pizzas with a crispy crust that are amazing i actually prefer it to most pizza in my city frozen or takeout
canada,not_removed,oh they could be both
canada,not_removed,whaaaaaaaaattttttt deep fried ive never even imagined that incredible scenario
canada,not_removed,so like a panzerotti or was this literally a frozen pillsbury pizza pop but deep fried this is the first ive heard of frying them haha
canada,not_removed,if you have a big enough microwave you can do that with a frozen pizza too dont though theres a reason there are no microwave instructions on those boxes
canada,not_removed,i still buy those
canada,not_removed,those are the ones they taste like someone ran over a rubber ball on the road and then shoved a piece of pepperoni inside
canada,not_removed,holy fuck pogos i forgot about those its been forever
canada,not_removed,rebranding meaning they got rid of the old product and introduced a new product meaning its a hell of a lot more than rebranding
canada,not_removed,confused american here those look legit like a better version of our hot pockets
canada,not_removed,its not the same thing though
canada,not_removed,whahoooo my wholeworld fell apart there for a little whileand on my birthday
canada,not_removed,thats not rebranding thats doubling the price of your product and hoping no one will notice
canada,not_removed,fuck the cost of food last few years couple years ago you could get a decent steak for and now a salad cost and that same steak is bacon is and for a small container of peanut butter its shit i sound like my grandfather talking about coke for cents compared to when it was cents
canada,not_removed,damn it this is a comfort food for me however i usually only get them once a year and then realize how awful they make me feel
canada,not_removed,preheat in the microwave finish in the toaster oven you get maximum speed and toaster goodness
canada,not_removed,more potato and cheese less bread and gravy
canada,not_removed,but theyre not available at my grocery store
canada,not_removed,i once almost choked on one while home for lunch in a small prairie town watching pmk and my dad saw me and he just laughed because he thought i was faking choking but i did not understand that at the time i did not understand for years that a society such as canadas which enforces such silence breeds only monsters
canada,not_removed,oh i see thanks
canada,not_removed,theres nothing i love more than a hot steam jet to the face when i bite into something
canada,not_removed,hahaha i was the same way the second bite was because i wasnt sure if i was tasting them correctly and was maybe having a stroke i have no idea who was in charge of getting the taste right upon release they should be fired the butter chicken one i found that to be pretty good
canada,not_removed,i meant the poutine pizza pops we threw the rest out absolute garbage
canada,not_removed,new and improved is clearly referring to profit margins
canada,not_removed,yup i enjoyed both before i have no issue buying the pillsbury theyre usually on sale anyways so they end up coming out around a pizza pop im ok with that
canada,not_removed,how can something be new and improved its either new or its improved from something that already existed i hate marketing
canada,not_removed,well if your goal is eat as many grams for less then you are right but if you care about taste the mccains are still vastly superior
canada,not_removed,pizza pops use fake cheese made of potato starch fuck them
canada,not_removed,also tried them not bad but not worth the doubling in price hopefully the price drops or it has good sales id like to try some more of the flavours
canada,not_removed,not gonna buy either now they are just both shit
canada,not_removed,not that either is that great but i always found the pillsbury ones better the mccain ones were nice in that you could eat them with your hands sometimes but pillsbury always had more filling
canada,not_removed,theyve always tasted like cardboard
canada,not_removed,mccains pizza pockets were always vastly superior to pillsbury pizza pops
canada,not_removed,each one weighs more and i can assure you its just of dough
canada,not_removed,they added a french word so they are fancy now
canada,not_removed,according to mccains own website they sold all their pizza products to dr oetker dr oetker is slowly transitioning the mccains name off all its pizza products including pizza pockets
canada,not_removed,and the flavours are different
canada,not_removed,but they look gourmet and delicious
canada,not_removed,lucky i learned there was only two when i went to microwave my lunch
canada,not_removed,the old four pack of pizza pockets was thats each the new two pack of marche pizza pockets is thats each source i work in the grocery industry and i have images of the old and new packaging in front of me
canada,not_removed,im just pissed everyone is rebranding stuff like crazy i mean google is rebranding like of their stuff and now ive gotta deal with this too crap
canada,not_removed,yeah the pops are too runny
canada,not_removed,the mini pizzas are made by dr oetker now
canada,not_removed,yeah but the product is different now the pizza pockets were the same in the lightning box as in the orange one and the mini pizzas are still a thing
canada,not_removed,i have hawaiian pillsbury pops in my local walmart in fact you can see the boxes of them on the left edge of my picture there
canada,not_removed,this times a million no store close to me ever has anything other than pepperoni cheese or deluxe i would like to buy pizza pockets but i cant
canada,not_removed,oh never had this flavor need
canada,not_removed,for the past two years ive boughten nothing but the cheese ones so theyre definitely still out there for as long as they have them anyway
canada,not_removed,something is off about the crust though but otherwise yeah they taste the same well and the fact that they kept the same box size but only give you pockets instead of
canada,not_removed,its a dodgeball joke cotton is one of the announcers during the matches
canada,not_removed,that good feeling might be atherosclerosis from pizza pops
canada,not_removed,mccain pizza pockets are canadian too and theyre better pillsbury pizza pops have awful crust and cheese
canada,not_removed,😙
canada,not_removed,frist of all how dare yuo
canada,not_removed,theyre always frozen in the middle no matter how long you cook them
canada,not_removed,agreed are we the only ones i much prefer the pillsbury ones
canada,not_removed,im confused did you say fuck pillsbury pizza pockets followed by the perfect evenly cooked round pizza pops is where it was at pillsbury makes pizza pops and mccains pizza pockets is what was perfect well other than the frozen center around the molten lava pizza stuffing around the edges
canada,not_removed,it can also be served boiling lava hot
canada,not_removed,theyre pizza pops marie
canada,not_removed,the dough recipe in pizza pockets made them what they were they were more doughey and the pizza pops were more strange flavored crusty
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,i was in college when they came out so its not like i got any bigger and my appetite actually got smaller since im pretty sure they got smaller
canada,not_removed,cadbury tried to use that excuse when pressed about the size of the cream eggs turns out they actually did make them smaller and they just decided to lie about it instead of admitting they shrunk em im sure product shrinking is more widespread than were aware of
canada,not_removed,i loved ruffles poutine ones
canada,not_removed,lays is the shittiest brand of chips of course it was terrible anything of theirs is
canada,not_removed,i have to agree there bro
canada,not_removed,but the lays ones are the worst thing ever
canada,not_removed,thats basically my experience with the wendys poutine like for maybe a small worth of fries that were basically room temp like minutes when i got home
canada,not_removed,should be classified as proccesed pizza substitute like kraft singles are a proccesed cheese substitute
canada,not_removed,because other pizza is totally not handheld hahaha by the way i think pizza hut in ontario still does poutine pizza
canada,not_removed,the op pic appears to be at a walmart perhaps
canada,not_removed,my bfs brother got some as a gift from his gransmother oh god they were awful imagine soggy microwaved french fries drowned in kfc esque gravy with only one pr two cheese kurds
canada,not_removed,calling anyone a onion hater is like calling someone a rock hater its not that i hate rocks but i dont want it in my food
canada,not_removed,in that case i really hope you enjoy it
canada,not_removed,the trick is to get so hammed your hangover makes all your pain into one blurry dehydrated hell
canada,not_removed,cut them in half let them sit for a minute or two
canada,not_removed,agreed i always liked the endscrimps of these since they were more doughy and reminded me more of panzerotti than the other ones did
canada,not_removed,no dude theyre terrible im trying to spare you the pain and disappointment of finding out on your own
canada,not_removed,that is also the only kind i buy its comfort food for me like a warm bowl of chef boyardee on a cool fall evening
canada,not_removed,yeah man those and pep and bacon those were my favorite i actually havent had them in years come to think of it probably for the best
canada,not_removed,the canadian are good pepperoni mushroom and bacon
canada,not_removed,ya there not awesome by far its weird eating a pizza pocket with no pizza sauce but they werent bad to try
canada,not_removed,amazing rexpectationvsreality has this written all over it
canada,not_removed,oetkers frozen pizzas are still leaps and bounds above most presidents choice has a few good ones but the mccain and delissio ones taste like the crust is made out of wood chips
canada,not_removed,yes that is my experience
canada,not_removed,literally a frozen pizza pop dropped in a deep fryer im pretty sure the pizza pops had a thinner crust and a better filling back then when deep fried the crust became light and flaky
canada,not_removed,theyre fuckin shit
canada,not_removed,do they season the breading or hotdogs theyre vaguely spicy also pogo from toaster oven pogo from microwave
canada,not_removed,ya theyre a different product with the same name under different branding
canada,not_removed,the sad thing is every company has been doing it kraft cheese is now from and im sure in another or years theyll be or so
canada,not_removed,bacon is but the pack size is only not too bad though
canada,not_removed,thats inflation its just that wages are supposed to increase as well and sometimes they dont
canada,not_removed,my mom used to buy a bag of chips for
canada,not_removed,id say one of the new ones is about or times the size of the old one the real problem on top of the price increase for less product is that they dont have pizza stuffing anymore just other stuff like broccoli and cheese or chicken pot pie
canada,not_removed,thats because mccains makes the no name ones
canada,not_removed,costco has name brand big ass boxes for
canada,not_removed,you can do the same with chicken nuggets and strips when you have kids youll be very happy know this
canada,not_removed,well we are all just lumberjacks and sealion pup clubbers after all
canada,not_removed,lol i said the same thing havent tried the butter chicken ones yet
canada,not_removed,new and improved is clearly referring to profit margins yes i tried them and aside from a prettier box and being slightly pricier it was the exact same thing back to pizza pops for me
canada,not_removed,selection pizza lunches from food basics are just as good and cheapish
canada,not_removed,i kind of agree but i only occasionally eat hot pockets and its when i feel too lazy or im too short on time for a real meal at that point taste flies out the window so ill go with the cheaper one as long as its palatable
canada,not_removed,always loved mccains as a kid pilsbury was too doughy
canada,not_removed,actually the deli lovers and pepperoni bacon ones were surprisingly good
canada,not_removed,got something like pack of chicken strips now with dipping sauce i weighed it and the dipping sauce was like the breading is probably another
canada,not_removed,dough boys
canada,not_removed,and theres two divots in the top just like in gay paris
canada,not_removed,who is this oetker fellow anyway is he even a real doctor
canada,not_removed,is it the same price as the four box was where you are
canada,not_removed,g suite is g better for g you g
canada,not_removed,google is rebranding like of their stuff you mean alphabet
canada,not_removed,in no universe are those mini pizzas inches nor are they individual in fact it states on the box that there are of them and they are grams each which would make them several micrometers thick if they were inches in diameter
canada,not_removed,dr oetker makes the minis now
canada,not_removed,i meant the superior mccain ones the pillsbury ones arent bad but the mccain one has the betterbreading
canada,not_removed,ill have to look around next time i go shopping i recently moved to a different city and i swear no stores in the city i was living in never had anything but deluxe and pepperoni so maybe ill have better luck here
canada,not_removed,why is wanting those two flavors a bad thing
canada,not_removed,same box size and price
canada,not_removed,which is weird because they have to pay a lot more in shipping due to the larger box i suppose they really wanted to con people that things were on the up and up but you can only fool those customers once and then they are likely not to buy again
canada,not_removed,superstore brand pizza pops pcno name in general
canada,not_removed,whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa gear down big rig in your opinion mccain pizza pockets are better you can take those balls of shitty dough with a thimble of pizza filling and fly them into the sun as far as im concerned
canada,not_removed,pillsbury pizza pops have awful crust and cheese have you tried putting them in the oven and cooking them that way waaaaay better
canada,not_removed,and they smell funny
canada,not_removed,yeah the mccain ones actually remind me of puke
canada,not_removed,i love the passionate battle between the pizza poppocket camps itt
canada,not_removed,the amount of confusion between the two on this thread is sickening
canada,not_removed,yes i may have said that what i meant to say fuck mccains pizza rockets pop
canada,not_removed,meanwhile in the dankest timeline
canada,not_removed,old dutch life
canada,not_removed,im not a fan of lays chips in general so ill have to agree with you there
canada,not_removed,it is yeah i also bought a box because why not regret as soon as the first one belched its putrid contents onto my tongue
canada,not_removed,one blurry dehydrated hell you mean sunday right
canada,not_removed,or be that guy who had no feeling on the roof of his mouth and thought it was normal to shed your mouth skin after eating fresh pizza
canada,not_removed,kcal i think theyre definitely not good for you
canada,not_removed,presidents choice is basically the best store brand ever or at least evenly matched with the kirkland stuff from costco ive had plenty of pc products that are better than the brand name equivalent
canada,not_removed,so it tastes like dominos
canada,not_removed,have you tried the delissio vintage i think thats what they are called anyway not a big fan of the regular delissio and mccain is frigging terrible but the delissio vintage is actually a pretty good frozen pizza imo
canada,not_removed,you should try stromboli by plaisirs gastronomiques its is the shit they made the right decision by having a costco stand for a while because thats all i buy nowadays i have yet to try the dr oetker ones though all i know is that delissio and mccain are nasty
canada,not_removed,huh i mean yeah it sounds good its just that ive never heard of that interesting
canada,not_removed,microwave then toast speed and taste best of both world
canada,not_removed,i guess mccain just has bigger balls
canada,not_removed,i just bought a box of the deluxe thinking that the package was just different the only difference is that you only get instead of the dough was slightly thicker tooso the box is more than half the weight i guess make it less obvious i dont know what your store has but this is nothing more than doubling the price of the same old pizza pockets
canada,not_removed,you can do it with lots of foods really pressure cookers are commonly used to do this with meats as well even from frozen you cook it in the pc for like then throw it in the oven for on broil
canada,not_removed,men of few words but men
canada,not_removed,and you always get too much dipping sauce at least thats the case with one brand of chicken wings at giant tiger not worth buying even when it seems dirt cheap because of how little meat there actually is in a box
canada,not_removed,ingeniousi remember having to poke holes through these things everytime halfway through microwaving to avoid the dreaded cold sauce in the middle
canada,not_removed,i get to explain this to the users its gonna be great
canada,not_removed,rggggg
canada,not_removed,g spot hits the g spot
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,never got the chance to try the mccains hawaiian the pillsbury ones arent bad but i think i prefer the deluxe variety over them
canada,not_removed,agreed they were the best i still look for them everytime the wife and i go to the grocery store but alas no mccain hawaiian to be found ill admit that the poutine pizza pops are pretty good
canada,not_removed,i didnt even know they had a deluxe flavour i thought it was just cheese and pepperoni
canada,not_removed,no no no get out of here with those pockets pizza pops or bust
canada,not_removed,this isnt opinion its objective fact pizza pops are stuffed full of shitty cheese stupid pepperoni that isnt even sliced and awful doughy crust
canada,not_removed,yeah they are better in the oven but so are pizza pockets so it evens out
canada,not_removed,yeah and i prefer the texture of the pillsbury ones too ive never tried the poutine flavour though
canada,not_removed,pizza pop supporters are just as stupid as hillary supporters
canada,not_removed,sixseasons
canada,not_removed,pc makes solid chips too
canada,not_removed,more superior kettle brand for the rest of us
canada,not_removed,old dutch fucked up when they replaced their classic bbq with that new bbq shit that tastes like lays bbq took me fucking years to be able find the classic bbq again but only in those box packaging ie not easily available in convenient stores only in super markets
canada,not_removed,what province are you in i cant find them on the walmartca site but will look next time im in a walmart
canada,not_removed,i actually kinda like them
canada,not_removed,you cant just go around an say something like that and not provide a source
canada,not_removed,pc has quite a few real stinkers but overall yeah theyre my favourite store brand that doesnt require membership in a secret club to purchase i give coop stuff a distant second
canada,not_removed,puffy wood chips
canada,not_removed,ive never even heard of plaisirs gastronomiques according to their website their products are only available in quebec and ontario
canada,not_removed,they think adding marché will make people think its now fancier
canada,not_removed,reminds me i have often wanted a picture of a silhouette of a guy about to club a seal and above it it would read canadian seal hunt and below it it would read join the club
canada,not_removed,i dont think theyre actually going to call it g docs and g drive will they seems to me the only things that changes is google apps becomes g suite and how many times do you say google apps in a week
canada,not_removed,theres cheese deluxe hawaiian pepperoni pepperoni and bacon buffalo wing beef taco and now poutine at least in bc
canada,not_removed,ah to each their own i guess ill generally eat any kind of pizza except anchovies i have yet to let myself try anchovy pizza
canada,not_removed,ha to each their own
canada,not_removed,the doughy crust is the best partttt
canada,not_removed,yeah youre right pizza pops pepperoni is dumb
canada,not_removed,oh its on now motherfucker pizza pockets killed my father and raped my mother but seriously the soft dough and stupid pepperoni cubes are the best part of pizza pops and the liquid cheesepizza sauce combo that basically blend together into one homogenous substance that tastes like neither in fact i just bought a box for the first time in years last week im going to go have one
canada,not_removed,exactly it just like you said pizza pops are stuffed full pizza pockets have like tiny little gram of filling per pocket also it is an objective fact that you have stated your opinion thats how it works
canada,not_removed,says the person who cant spell as
canada,not_removed,nah at that point im going for httphardbitechipscom
canada,not_removed,i was never a fan of bbq chips because it just had flavours that i never liked but i just remember when they changed the recipe a lot of people were angry the box chips are a lot more common in my neck of the woods just about everwhere including and gas stations manitoba i prefer the box chips over the regular bags they just somehow seem to have a bit of a crunchier taste to them but its all my imagination
canada,not_removed,im in ontario in a more rural area than most
canada,not_removed,pizza pops are like dollars cheaper at walmart than anywhere else as well so bonus
canada,not_removed,the good news is i found the comment i was thinking of the bad news is that its still not a primary source
canada,not_removed,well even brand names tend to have a few fails i miss coop stuff all the corporateowned coop stores in the maritimes are closed now so the only one we have left is in fredericton and im not driving an hour just for the awesome coop gold cookies n cream ice cream im gonna try the farmers brand to see if its as good wouldnt be at all surprised if its exactly the same stuff in a different tub but well see
canada,not_removed,oh well guess that settles it
canada,not_removed,since were in the midst of migrating to google services right now a lot
canada,not_removed,seriously i havent had either in years and i remember how crappy those soggy air pockets were to the real deal
canada,not_removed,sweet ottawa has a chance
canada,not_removed,ok well if youre just now migrating you wont have very old habits to break p
canada,not_removed,nothing would be soggy if you stopped using the microwave like a savage they both taste better if you use the oven
canada,not_removed,its a political trend i think the media is both hoping for the ratings and also trying to find the canadian version of this worldwide trend thats been seemingly emerging out of nowhere
canada,not_removed,she has no charm and no authenticness so she has no chance
canada,not_removed,honestly were better than this canada we need to stop giving the racist shitheads a platform to spew their hate
canada,not_removed,yes its not just the media though
canada,not_removed,canadalandshowcom reddit is getting easier you dont even need to read the title just read the name of the website
canada,not_removed,noooo not girlpoilievre
canada,not_removed,whats racist about promoting canadian values if newcomers dont like us or our country why are they even here
canada,not_removed,trudeau is canadas trump card
canada,not_removed,define canadian values
canada,not_removed,when promoting canadian values is a thinly veiled attempt at making the lives of immigrants harder in order to drive them out or keep them out its a problem and lets not beat around the bush this values test would never be given to a white immigrant this is leitch coyly saying she would try to keep brown people out of the country
canada,not_removed,whats racist about promoting canadian values not racist to be pedantic but the only value we really have is freedom we dont have shared values across provinces and thats the point
canada,not_removed,more like the joker
canada,not_removed,if youre actually canadian you shouldnt even have to ask that
canada,not_removed,this values test would never be given to a white immigrant this is leitch coyly saying she would try to keep brown people out of the country thats just your opinion which youre entitled to
canada,not_removed,so you dont have an answer
canada,not_removed,i mean yeah its not like shed ever come out and explicitly say it but its just naive to think any different her whole shtick is appealing the to lowest common denominator that means running a campaign full of that kind of winkwink nudgenudge racism
canada,not_removed,an immigrant could be any race i know what the narrative is that some people perpetuate about her but i dont see a narrative on its own as proof people call each other racists at every turn these days
canada,not_removed,like the boy who cried wolf people use the word racist so often it has lost a lot of its significance
canada,not_removed,they also made preexisting sin cards ineligible to be used for certain times when you need aditional forms of id
canada,not_removed,confirmation of sin
canada,not_removed,this seems like a good thing no theyre probably trying to avoid the same clusterfuck the ssn card in the states has become
canada,not_removed,not once have i ever in my life been asked for my sin card in fact back in october i lost my wallet and had to get a replacement drivers license bank card credit cards etc and i may have been asked once or twice for my sin number which i know offhand no one requires you to actually produce a physical card and if you cant remember your sin number its pretty easy to just store the number on your phone
canada,not_removed,this is actually really good to know mine is cracked horizontally a few times but not fully knowing this i think im gonna go get it laminated thanks op
canada,not_removed,sadly not everyone seems to realize this its amazing how many teens still get the we need to see your actual sin card from employers who dont keep up with the times
canada,not_removed,why is that exactly wouldnt it be the same information from the plastic card as it would be just a piece of paper
canada,not_removed,next in the punk certification is the anarchy participation certificate
canada,not_removed,unlike the ssn in the us only employers and the gov should ask for your sin number
canada,not_removed,my not sure if it was an osap requirement or my school being dicks but the financial aid dept required the physical card in order to disburse funds even if i had the number memorised and provided plethora of other id
canada,not_removed,just store the number on your phone that is an absolutely awful way to do it never store it digitally on paper at least someone has to physically handle it to copy or modify it i would never trust any operating system with my sin
canada,not_removed,i had my wallet stolen years ago i put a credit alert out but never bothered getting my sin card replaced i have that number on tons of tax stuff i have saved its not like i cant find it if i need it
canada,not_removed,not once have i ever in my life been asked for my sin card ive had a few places ask but i just tell them i dont have one its usually smaller banks etc and after a few minutes they figure out that the government doesnt issue them anymore
canada,not_removed,i work in an industry with a lot of fraud going on when someone comes in with their sin number wo the card we turn them down or ask for an alternative piece of id theres absolutely no way for me to verify that the number you gave me is yours
canada,not_removed,you dont need the card just the number its good to have though just to have
canada,not_removed,why just destroy it the card is not even valid id
canada,not_removed,because technically a sin card is not a valid form of idea it has no security features or even a photo of the holder theyre trying to discourage the use of it as id
canada,not_removed,and financial institutions the government insists that all accounts be linked to a sin for income purposes
canada,not_removed,theyre just being dicks proof of sin can be in the form of an assessment or other communication which shows your number that was mailed to your current address by cra
canada,not_removed,exact same experience here flatout refused service unless i could show them my sin card despite the fact that i had several other forms of photo id and my sin memorized dicks
canada,not_removed,yet people do taxes on the computer all the time
canada,not_removed,if youre willing to not accept it its probably not something should be allowed to ever ask foraccept in the first place
canada,not_removed,if i gave you a printed copy of my tax return that has my legal name and sin on it with another government photo id to match that wouldnt be enough i never carry my sin with me havent had a situation where i ever need to show it i commit the number to memory and just stow it away safely
canada,not_removed,when someone comes in with their sin number wo the card we turn them down or ask for an alternative piece of id i do not and never had a sin card demanding it wont get you anywhere
canada,not_removed,with the retirement of the cards existing ones will appreciate in value and be worth more in the future op is just being a wise investor
canada,not_removed,because some of us want to keep ours
canada,not_removed,because i am bad at remembering numbers and having the card is handy as fuck
canada,not_removed,because technically a sin card is not a valid form of idea was it ever one
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,its about time we have a university id card instead of having to use a drivers license not everyone has a license
canada,not_removed,yesno you can use medical cards as ids still its just that they changed the sin legislation in its entirety in regards to the card and as such it invalidates whether or not the old plastic sin cards are legal government legal documentation that is in current circulation
canada,not_removed,true its needed for your taxes and sending you your t forms
canada,not_removed,httpswwwcanadacaenemploymentsocialdevelopmentcorporatetransparencyaccessinformationpreventionsignalementfraudereportinghtml
canada,not_removed,yeah i dont see anyone just storing their sin plain text on their phone and if they do im honestly speechless and aghast even when filling out tax form on computers theres regulations as to how you should be storing that information
canada,not_removed,i dont ask for it its a valid piece of id i just expect the card or this print out if someones going to use it ive had a customer come in with a drivers license and a sin the sin wasnt his which i caught after submitting everything and surprise it worked since then im skeptical about taking it as a piece of id
canada,not_removed,id take it but the effort someone would go through to bring that instead of say a drivers license and credit carddebit visa would confuse me gotta understand that my issue with accepting sins come from the fact that i cant verify whos number it actually is and as such im preventing fraud by not accepting just the number
canada,not_removed,did i ever say i demand it if you cant provide a physical card or the printout from the government i ask for alternative id
canada,not_removed,im not following
canada,not_removed,put it in your lastpass or other password manager
canada,not_removed,buddy you do not need to watch a video to come to that conclusion
canada,not_removed,sin numbers actually has a check digit unlike the us ssn and is much more secure
canada,not_removed,cgp grey eh i love his videos too
canada,not_removed,good thing in most provinces health cards are free and valid government id
canada,not_removed,i guess so
canada,not_removed,some people like having those things so why should we get rid of it
canada,not_removed,most times i presented mine it was refused as a form of id even in highschool go figure
canada,not_removed,as the government has already argued it will save public money and combat fraudid theft
canada,not_removed,i swear every comment above me was made in jest so everyone is really just whooshing each other
canada,not_removed,i dont care about a new one i just want to keep my old one this is why i wont be destroying it as you suggested
canada,not_removed,got mine in the mail yesterday hopefully i can get some time off this summer to enjoy it
canada,not_removed,too easy thanks friend
canada,not_removed,just ordered mine
canada,not_removed,why the hell not free park access and some historic site access
canada,not_removed,thanks applied while listening to day for night and thinking of the tourtiere in the fridge do i get to be a citizen now
canada,not_removed,just in case anyone is curiousit looks like this can be utilized by us addresses as well well see if it arrives in the mail but i should have an excuse to visit canada now
canada,not_removed,so does this mean access is only free for the you cant just show up at the park and be granted free entry
canada,not_removed,just got mine in the mail yesterday i cant wait to use it this upcoming year
canada,not_removed,what does this actually get you access to
canada,not_removed,i got mine in the mail yesterday
canada,not_removed,ordered three weeks ago still nothing
canada,not_removed,awesome thanks for posting
canada,not_removed,got mine in the mail today
canada,not_removed,i cant get the add to cart button to continue the process is there any other way to get this
canada,not_removed,i requested one of these a couple weeks ago but got no confirmation on the website looks like i should redo it or its a stupid website that doesnt give confirmation can any of you all who got one in the mail tell me if the website gave confirmation at the end please
canada,not_removed,do yr olds get a special on park camping in federal parks bc provincial parks give a a night at all provincial parks
canada,not_removed,does this mean the banff hot springs are free
canada,not_removed,just got mine yesterday cant wait to use them through the year
canada,not_removed,cant i just show up at a natty park come summer time and not worry about a permit what are all these harsh browns you guys are servin me
canada,not_removed,how long did it take i ordered two in early december and still havent received them
canada,not_removed,enjoy yourself
canada,not_removed,im commenting because i want to know what the answer is i work for parks canada in the summer and will consider changing summer jobs if i have to tell people they needed to order their discovery pass online
canada,not_removed,the best parts of canada
canada,not_removed,admission to all national parks national historic sites and national marine conservation areas operated by parks canada lockage at parks canadas historic canals and waterways more info httpwwwpcgccaengvoyagetraveladmissionaspx
canada,not_removed,never been to riding mountain national park it is beautiful
canada,not_removed,it also works for national heritage sites
canada,not_removed,are you a dumb pissboi
canada,not_removed,guessing but try at your nearest park or historic site
canada,not_removed,i ordered one and after checkout it said i would receive an email confirmation but i never did and i havent received my pass yet
canada,not_removed,they dont offer reduced camping rates for seniors at national parks they do however offer reduced fees for things like fishing skiing tours if you want to go i recommend booking now theyre already running out of camping spots
canada,not_removed,if its ever open
canada,not_removed,honestly i dont recall how long its been since i ordered them maybe a month i imagine theyve got a lot of orders on their hands but i see more and more people saying that theyve received theirs
canada,not_removed,just received ours yesterday and we ordered it at the beginning of december
canada,not_removed,i heard on the radio yesterday that they are available at park entrances also
canada,not_removed,i didnt know you needed to buy a pass to visit for the day i thought it was like provincial parks
canada,not_removed,first time ive ever seen a nickname be mandatory i hope they dont mind the liberty of excess i took when answering to that one were definitely going to use this as much as we can one of my bucket list items is to visit something in every province and territory and this makes it a bit easier to accomplish
canada,not_removed,yeah i just ordered another one and this time i got that thing about an email too but no email yet usually those things come in minutes from any other website tx
canada,not_removed,you should be getting a pass for provincial parks too right
canada,not_removed,i ordered mine weeks ago and got the email confirmation just a few days ago its probably just taking them a while to process
canada,not_removed,never seen such a thing in any of the ones i frequent
canada,not_removed,httpwwwpcgccaengvoyagetraveladmissionaspx under what is free will tell you
canada,not_removed,we dont always have it i mean we dont always have pancakes or waffles for breakfast but the first thing that springs to mind is maple syrup i dont mean aunt jemaimah or table syrup i mean authentic that might proove difficult to find in germany or it would cost you a fortune or bacon you guys have bacon right
canada,not_removed,buttermilk pancakes made with fresh buttermilk and real canadian maple syrup
canada,not_removed,bacon scrambled eggs cooked in the bacon pan afterwards grease drained first of course pancakes or waffles or french toast and maple syrup is a pretty classic canadian breakfast this isnt what youd eat every morning if you want to live past but your grandparents might make it for you if theyre out to spoil you saskatoon berries to go with the pancakes or in them would put it over the top but id imagine those would be pretty hard to find in germany
canada,not_removed,back bacon also known as peameal bacon
canada,not_removed,my blender wouldnt fit in the plugs in germany so i would have to find something to replace my smoothie
canada,not_removed,coffee is the part of my breakfast that i care about
canada,not_removed,better cereal i had really expensive high quality cereal in canada i buy decent stuff in japan but its not the same but thats just me
canada,not_removed,im a canadian that has lived outside canada for years i miss fresh berries blueberries raspberries blackberries
canada,not_removed,as a canadian living overseas breakfast caesars but that might always be appropriate
canada,not_removed,i dont eat breakfast ¯ツ¯
canada,not_removed,bacon would be very easy to get germany without bacon wouldnt work i thought of good maple syrup too but we do only have a very liquid runny version here which mostly tastes like malt
canada,not_removed,im not going to lie i use maple syrup in my coffee every morning instead of sugar i might die if i didnt have its pure deliciousness in my coffee daily
canada,not_removed,maple syrup goes well with a lot of things but if you can makefind somewhere that sells a good plate of french toast with some icing sugar that is in my opinion the epitome of canadian breakfast regardless of maple syrup quality side with bacon for a protein kick that goes well with the maple
canada,not_removed,there are if i recall strict laws about calling something authentic canadian maple syrup and at euros thats cdn i would think edit its a long shot but we have maple syrup in every gift shop in every airport make a post for someone who might be on their way to an airport here right now to catch a redeye to your nearest city given that breakfast tomorrow for you is in hrs its a bit of a long shot
canada,not_removed,you might be able to find maple syrup at an import store hey you can even glaze the bacon with maple syrup and black pepper
canada,not_removed,your bacon is actually different from ours
canada,not_removed,i did see real canadian maple syrup in an italian grocery store id check carefully in a big one before saying there isnt any in germany
canada,not_removed,you probably will die from its deliciousness
canada,not_removed,i have coworkers who do shots of it straight i mean i like maple syrup as much as the next canadian but ugh
canada,not_removed,do we really think our universities are full of sexual attackers short answer no
canada,not_removed,some people do because theyre paranoid and probably need to be committed for their own safety
canada,not_removed,ohhhhhhhhh lord you posted this on reddit triggered fembots in edit crux of the entire argument but in light of the numbers reported and estimated it is an exercise in ideological extremism to suggest carleton university condones rape culture tacitly or otherwise
canada,not_removed,its blowing up in rottawa and gaining traction in rcanadapolitics
canada,not_removed,triggered fembots hah they pale by comparison to the triggered mrapillersneckbeards
canada,not_removed,to be honest i have no idea what any of those are is mra mens rights activists thanks in advance for the schoolin edit yay down votes for questions 👍👍👍
canada,not_removed,an mra is anyone who thinks men deserve the same treatment as women in situations where women receive preferential treatment
canada,not_removed,i mean feminist argue the same thing but the other way around right i think both view points are flawed biology does exist men are better at some jobs than women and vice versa this hyperequality nonsense is laughable
canada,not_removed,the best we can do is make all people equal before the law treat all people fairly in society acknowledge that biology and genetics causes individuals to have differences and accept that brute fact of reality feminism has slain nearly all of its dragons in the west and found out that men dont have all the power privilege they thought so the plan is to push men down so women have the level of power privilege feminists desire and yes ive taken a collegelevel womens studies course thanks mras came about due to deficiencies in the system that were deliberately engineered to grant women more rights than men and put womens issues into the spotlight while detracting from mens issues see the blatantly sexist concept of mother is the better caregiver in divorces and the need to ignoredeny statistical proof that men are the overwhelming majority of suicides both sides started out with good intentions but allowed the loudest angriest voices to dominate the discussions and cant seem to walk their respective groups back to a position of calm sanity because the aforementioned loud angry voices see these groups as the easiest path to fortune and fame it took feminism over a halfdecade to start rotting from within while mras being composed of men who lets face it are far more adept at doing than talking took far less time to shoot themselves in the foot p
canada,not_removed,appreciate that you put in the update but you might also find listing your province and city helpful as there may be local programs and local venture capital groups that can lend a hand as per my original question back to you
canada,not_removed,which province city are you in often there are programs specific to the area you are in by woman of colour do you mean first nations again there are special programs depending on which first nations group is providing the help for ontario more general guide httpwwwcanadaonecommagazineloanprogramshtml as an aside both of these were really really really easy to find using google so i assume you knew very well about them otherwise you may want to take more time looking on your own first
canada,not_removed,there are lots of government programs to support young entrepreneurs of all types the city of toronto runs an that offers consultation services that could probably help you understand what programs you could apply to
canada,not_removed,thanks for the links if it were easy i wouldnt be asking for help but thank you for assuming im stupid
canada,not_removed,thank you i have spoken to them as well have a great night
canada,not_removed,thanks jerry for your condescending and unhelpful critique ill be sure to ignore the inequalities women face because of what is between our legs
canada,not_removed,well sorry for taking the time to try and be helpful you didnt detail what you had tried or where you had looked only your gender coloured and nature of business a condescending and negative attitude is never helpful when asking for peoples help
canada,not_removed,you might find it helpful to actually reply to the people helping you and not those who arent
canada,not_removed,alrighty if you say so have a great night
canada,not_removed,i have been to banks and credit unions all times rejected but the banks approved a male associate with a similar to almost identical business proposal i dont know why you feel the need to attack me but alright thanks again
canada,not_removed,day where i am in the world but all the best regardless
canada,not_removed,okay thanks again bye
canada,not_removed,please read my post you are an extremely mean spirited person i hope you have a good night
canada,not_removed,have a great night
canada,not_removed,most people think calgary is full of rednecks but they elected the httpsenwikipediaorgwikinaheednenshi of a large north american city in and he is incredibly popular he won the reelection with of the vote
canada,not_removed,that we say aboot
canada,not_removed,as a western canadian the idea that you can lump everyone together as western canadian central canadian maritimer etc
canada,not_removed,these are moreso all for americans ive met down there than anything europeans have ever saidasked me that the majority of canadians speak french or that its more common than english thats its winter yearround or somehow gets extremely colder compared to northern states that guns are banned in canada that we have to wait months to see a doctor if were sick that canada is exceptionally more massive than the usa when it comes to land area
canada,not_removed,yes in the summer southern ontario feels like florida actually it feels hotter than that because florida has the ocean nearby to regulate the temperature but the myth is as soon as you cross the peace bridge from new york state were all living in igloos and wearing coats all year
canada,not_removed,that there are no cities between winnipeg and toronto if youve ever seen a weather map outside of canada there is a vast nothingness between these cities p
canada,not_removed,that we dont suffer from racism
canada,not_removed,had you never in your life seen a weather report that covered more than western canada i dont understand how it can be news to you that it gets hot elsewhere in canada in the summer
canada,not_removed,that there is such a well defined thing as a typical canadian what we really are is a collection of politicallybound populations which are regionally isolated and insulated from one another by the large distances of a sparsely populated country
canada,not_removed,biggest myth that we care about each other
canada,not_removed,people in europe think we all speak french and english fluently across the board they just dont understand the distances involved in canada
canada,not_removed,that the people are warm and friendly they are not ive lived in the four different provinces ive also travelled extensively in the usa at first as a starving young person and again as a successful adult americans are a hundred times more hospitable generous and friendly than canadians
canada,not_removed,the milk in a bag thing im sure it happens somewhere in canada but ive never seen it anywhere in alberta and i dont remember seeing during my short lived stay in bc either
canada,not_removed,you can sweat your balls off in the summer it freeze me off i the winter i ottawa where it goes from to degrees in a few months
canada,not_removed,poutine is not a canadianwide dish maple syrup does not flow every where and its spelled tuque not toque
canada,not_removed,only in canada ice cubes are made of fire
canada,not_removed,heres a myth saskatchewan is all flat and farmland
canada,not_removed,that we are inherently better than americans
canada,not_removed,on parle français partout
canada,not_removed,were an egalitarian society we have higher rates of inequality than any major european nation gini coefficient canada spain italy poland uk germany france then when you get into the more smaller nations it becomes outright embarrassing switzerland austria denmark belgium netherlands finland sweden norway
canada,not_removed,that we have free speech
canada,not_removed,maple leafs they are not very common in alberta as compared to ontario and quebec
canada,not_removed,prairie provinces really arent in actuality is only found in the southeast corner of albertasouthwest corner of saskatchewan and not at all in manitoba
canada,not_removed,indians having it rough is a myth they get way too many handouts and then it creates a group of lazy people with large addiction problems who blame everything on white people because their ancestors had it rough
canada,not_removed,free health care do people in other places really think that all of our doctors and nurses work for free and that the hospitals get free electricity and free water supplies and free gas services and that the surgical supplies and iv bags are somehow supplied for free dumb and yet constantly repeated over and over by ignorant americans jim b
canada,not_removed,we have small penises and are polite
canada,not_removed,in the same year that toronto elected rob ford no less
canada,not_removed,hes an awesome mayor if calgary doesnt want him other cities will
canada,not_removed,what does our mayors religious affiliation have to do with our redneck nonstatus i think his religous affiliation only affects one thing his religious affiliation
canada,not_removed,could it be that he is just a good mayor who happened to be muslim i dont think calgarians elected him beause he is muslim
canada,not_removed,its more like aboat but even that is way off depending on where in canada you are though closer than that aboot abomination
canada,not_removed,i feel like i dont have an accent at all when i meet friends that ive known only online they always say i have such a thick canadian accent
canada,not_removed,actually its not much of a myth i dont think i say it but i live in the us and it gets pointed out all the time
canada,not_removed,as a canadian i would guess you would be defined as a central canadian
canada,not_removed,that guns are banned in canada love showing those guys the guns we can get in canada that are illegal highly restricted or times more expensive in the usa
canada,not_removed,that we have to wait months to see a doctor if were sick if its a specialist you might have to in some areas otherwise its generally pretty quick that canada is exceptionally more massive than the usa when it comes to land area i might be mistaken but i believe i read somewhere that we have more arable land so if we go by useful land being land area canada would be larger regardless of how you interpret it i still think its crazy that canada and the states have such similar land areas with all the water we have everywhere
canada,not_removed,wait youre not damn liberal media lying to me again
canada,not_removed,we definitely have racism in canada but its not focussed on the same races as in the states here racism is directed more towards natives and those from the middle east and surrounding areas or white if youre a racist of a different race in the states the racists seem to hate everyone who isnt white and some go farther and hate poles and irishmen and whatnot even though the distinction is fairly rare in modern times
canada,not_removed,i went to a small metal festival yesterday some canadian bands some american even the most crudest freakiest looking metalheads if they were from canada all said please and thank you during sound checks more vocals in my monitor please thats good thank you alright mother fuckers are you ready to rock we are the anal rapists and this song is called cum on your dad mother
canada,not_removed,ontario toronto ohio
canada,not_removed,now lets you drop them pants
canada,not_removed,the rude miserable people live in toronto and vancouver in my experience
canada,not_removed,myth rural canada is deliverance all the way i live in a small town and its far better than vancouver where i moved from
canada,not_removed,what the fuck is deliverance
canada,not_removed,op may be an albertan in fairness hot in alberta doesnt mean the same thing east of there degrees in calgary just feels like a nice day degrees in toronto or montreal feels hot its because of the lack of humidity in alberta
canada,not_removed,the weather channel plays weather from across canada when it was over in south ontario last week there was snow falling in northern canada and the week before the hottest point in canada was in the arctic
canada,not_removed,thats a rather depressing point of view
canada,not_removed,i feel like all the provincesregions are like squabbling siblings they hate each other until someone from outside dicks with them those may be shitheads but damnit theyre our shitheads
canada,not_removed,not in the pacific northwest they aint
canada,not_removed,its all over southern ontario and quebec so about the countrys population uses bags
canada,not_removed,really common here in quebec so much that i thought it was the same all over the world
canada,not_removed,they are everywhere in ontario i used them since i was a kid and ive lived in a number of different towns and cities so theyre pretty common here
canada,not_removed,its in or was in north west ontario as well used to live in fort frances and we had it there that was years ago though i sure do miss bagged milk though it takes up so much less room in the fridge
canada,not_removed,its in the maritimes and manitoba too i think alberta and bc are the only ones left out maybe sask
canada,not_removed,i use to see it occasionally in bc in the
canada,not_removed,ottawa where it goes from to degrees in a few months alberta is where that can happen in a matter of hours
canada,not_removed,to is more like it its rare to see or
canada,not_removed,this is a myth
canada,not_removed,no only frenchies spell it tuque the rest of canada spells it toque poutine is a canadawide dish its available in every aw mcdonalds burger king and kfc in one shitty form or another
canada,not_removed,where havent you found poutine sure the syrup only flows in the east but you guys ship it out west so i could put it all things breakfast now for some reason sugar cane syrup is almost impossible to find out east
canada,not_removed,poutine is a canada wide dish nobody associates it with quebec anymore because they act like dicks about everything ive never once seen toque spelled with a u
canada,not_removed,only when its cold enough to freeze the whisky
canada,not_removed,but no one lives in the parts where it isnt all flat and farmland
canada,not_removed,populated saskatchewan outside of remote reserves camping areas and hunting spots are
canada,not_removed,or inherently different than americans
canada,not_removed,ou par contre que tout le monde est bilingue au québec
canada,not_removed,i think its important to note that this only refers to income inequality
canada,not_removed,what do you mean by that
canada,not_removed,the usa is the only country in the world to protect hate speech every other country restricts it to some degree so if you compare us to the usa then no we dont have all that free of speech but if you compare us to anyone else we have some of the freest speech in the world
canada,not_removed,theyre not very common in the playoffs either heyyo
canada,not_removed,yeah out west its mostly aspen pine and spruce with some birch poplar and fir thrown in
canada,not_removed,cultural mosaic is literally the term that has always been used melting pot is an americanism
canada,not_removed,literally never heard the term melting pot used to describe canada the usa yes but not canada theres no homogeneous canadian identity in the first place for people to melt into
canada,not_removed,i like the term fruit salad
canada,not_removed,yeah those fucking residential school survivors were just faking the whole thing because they had it in for the white man
canada,not_removed,gotta agree with you there
canada,not_removed,i herd that natives are literally dying outtoo small to sustain their population and wont exist in x amount of time
canada,not_removed,the handouts thing is such a stupid myth reserve purchases are taxexempt yes but reserves are communities that receive significantly less funding for basic social services and infrastructure
canada,not_removed,very racist of you to observe that youd be amazed if you found out it wasnt true
canada,not_removed,think of it another way is walking down the sidewalk free or not do you think about the tax dollars every time you see a fire hydrant health care is functionally free in that nobody is afraid they wont be able to afford healthcare and this definition is the most important for happiness
canada,not_removed,no one thinks that infact the myth spread by americans is that it is unsustainably expensive
canada,not_removed,the free in free health care typically refers to out of pocket costs to the patient which are typically either or very low numbers in reference to those in nations who are using it as a reference like the us
canada,not_removed,nobody actually says that the healthcare is free in the sense that youre saying though americans are the first ones to say that free healthcare would make their country go broke as its not sustainable
canada,not_removed,well sometimes he thought he was jamaican so there is that
canada,not_removed,you dont usually get to run for mayor of cities you dont live in
canada,not_removed,oh great kick off a mayoral poaching competition like ceos have why dont you
canada,not_removed,no one is saying they did he was elected because they thought he would be a good mayor thats the point other cities may not have based on his religion
canada,not_removed,aboat is only for western canada according to your video source
canada,not_removed,i learned this in a linguistics class and most people adamantly deny they pronounce about like that so depressing
canada,not_removed,quebecer here we do it too maybe its a coast thing
canada,not_removed,better is bedder as well although i always assumed it was a north americawide thing
canada,not_removed,i feel like i dont have an accent at all literally everyone has an accent however you talk thats an accent
canada,not_removed,centralso manitoban
canada,not_removed,what guns are those last i checked weve got a pretty shitty selection compared to our southern neighbors and the rcmp just banned banana mags for
canada,not_removed,other way around actually the united states is slightly larger in land area and has significantly more arable land were only larger in area once you include the area of our fresh water bodies ill edit this with the the exact numbers total area with water canada usa area of land only canada usa area of arable land only canada usa
canada,not_removed,what are they telling you down there every time i see a us news broadcast theyre saying a cold weather front moving down from canada is chilling temperatures across the northeast thats the only time they mention us theyre giving you the wrong impression
canada,not_removed,the first place of note you hit is thunder bay on the nw of lake superior then youve got sault ste marie which is inbetween superior and huron then sudbury a bit north of huron followed by barrie between huron and lake ontario then youre in the greater toronto area theres also a bunch of small towns all along the highway
canada,not_removed,there are really only no cities if you use a strict definition of city several hundred thousand people that area has numerous small cities of people that have basically all the services you need to not feel like youre living in the middle of nowhere
canada,not_removed,mapsgoogleca
canada,not_removed,we definitely still have a lot of the same prejudices toward black people as they do in the united states we share all the same media after all it just doesnt manifest itself as often because we have a smaller percentage of black people and we dont quite have the same history of systematic racism against them
canada,not_removed,in vancouver there happens to be lots of racism towards asians people seem to lump all asians as rich and taking over our city go to any other small town and that racism will be towards aboriginals
canada,not_removed,metalheads are some of the nicest people you will ever meet
canada,not_removed,dad mother if its a typo its a glorious typo
canada,not_removed,i love those guys
canada,not_removed,what does leaving toronto in make ontario
canada,not_removed,out in the maritimes we generally relegate those folks to cpp towns there are lots of nice folks out in the villages but theres also a disproportionate number of racist grandparents
canada,not_removed,what a rude and miserable comment
canada,not_removed,ive not found that at all what ive found is people put up a barrier in larger cities but can be very nice below that caul where in smaller communities theyre extremely nice to your face but talk tonnes of shit behind backs
canada,not_removed,i cant speak for vancouver as i havent been there in years but i think thats a bit of a myth for toronto torontonians have the same big city distance that youll find in any large city but overall people there are generally quite nice and reasonable
canada,not_removed,yes but not the gun totetin no teeth rednecks
canada,not_removed,what are you like years old lol
canada,not_removed,are you kidding me northern alberta is filled with stagnant pools of water turning everything to muskeg edmonton in the summer is muggy as all fuck this summer has been particularly awful winters are indeed dry as a bone though
canada,not_removed,and it is true a lack of conflict does not mean we get along because we really dont
canada,not_removed,i am a reality based creature
canada,not_removed,hell only now we are talking about a free trade agreement for the provinces pretty sad that such a pact is even needed
canada,not_removed,yeah me too until i moved to china they have milk that doesnt need to be refrigerated
canada,not_removed,definitly not a single bag of milk in manitoba i dont think anyone here knows milk in a bag is a thing i often see on social media people posting photos look at milk in ontario its so weird
canada,not_removed,sk hasnt had bagged milk since the late to early when it was tried and everyone here said what the hell is this sk and mb both tried bagged milk and abandoned it shortly after only a few cities had bagged milk deliveries for any length of time wasnt sold bagged in stores i used to think friends in saskatoon were weirdos with their bagged milk
canada,not_removed,yeah i saw it in prince george a few years back
canada,not_removed,thats a httpiimgurcomgloxeahjpg
canada,not_removed,i dont really count the fast food poutine as poutine since its usually poor quality and doesnt have curds i usually call anything that isnt strictly chips brown gravy and curds bastard poutine since it cant be counted as true poutine
canada,not_removed,httpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionarytuque httpwwwoxforddictionariescomdefinitionenglishtuque
canada,not_removed,thats a httpiimgurcomgloxeahjpg this is
canada,not_removed,there are dozens of us
canada,not_removed,i thought we werent inherently different when compared to americans but after living abroad it hit me like a truck there are some very profound and deep differences between canadians and americans on the surface however we are indistinguishable but when you start asking deeper questions it can be day and night of course the americans on the northern border are most like us but there are still some real differences i wouldnt have noticed them if i didnt live in europe edit i would like to add that different does not mean better both nations have their redeeming features
canada,not_removed,which is directly tied to everything else
canada,not_removed,i mean exactly what i said our free speech laws are very open to interpretation saying the wrong thing to the wrong person could end you up on the wrong side of a lawsuit down vote me all you want but it doesnt change the facts
canada,not_removed,we dont have the right to free speech in canada due to our hate speech laws
canada,not_removed,the government is too overbearing with stupid shit like speech
canada,not_removed,the usa doesnt have absolute free speech either threats and inciting panic are criminal offenses and anyone can sue you for slander at any time if they want to they probably wont win but being dragged to court on its own is massively annoying and a huge deterrent from shaking the hornets nest
canada,not_removed,we have tons of maple out west but it isnt the kind with the iconic leaves and syrup
canada,not_removed,free school and government checks are not a myth they are a crime against tax payers
canada,not_removed,you dont have to preach to mei have lived here my entire life so i do know how things work in canada i was commenting on the often spoken phrase that many americans use got that jim b
canada,not_removed,if he decided to move then he would still probably get a huge support hes the type of mayor almost every city wants
canada,not_removed,its more prevalent out here but it can be found across canada little pockets and what not
canada,not_removed,i used to deny it too until my american friends pointed it out and i started listening really closely its such a subtle thing to canadians that we dont really think much of it or even realize it but once you hear it you cant unhear it
canada,not_removed,a friend of mine asked me if i was doing it on purpose i legitimately had no idea what they were talking aboot about i honestly thought i was saying it normally but apparently i have a distinct canadian accent
canada,not_removed,i learned in my phonetics class that part of it is how other people hear about when they say it slightly differently than canadians as much as about how it is said slightly differently the vowel in about is shorter in most canadian dialects that american ones and so some americans hear aboat or aboot when it is actually really neither it is just a shorter sounding vowel pronunciation that isnt the same as the american about
canada,not_removed,central canada is classified as ontario and quebec manitoba is classified as part of the prairies
canada,not_removed,its not a lot but there is some short barreled shotguns and rifles are the big one lot more common here than down south due to their nfa lawsand outright bans in some states they also have an import ban on chinese and russian firearms dating back a few years which means what is already in the country is considerably more expensive now due to supply and demand an sks is bucks in canada easily twice that in the states the runs around here and is often more like in the usa which is insane we get the norinco that are a lot more expensive in the states for a remaining example and some new guns like the werent around before the import ban so they will never see them think we might have also had israeli tavors for a year or two before them its easier to get big old anti tank rifles than some places down in the states as anything over is a destructive device federally and banned in a few states speaking of state laws many of them have their own restrictions awbs etc that limit them from getting stuff readily available in canada with either a pal or rpal its not a lot obviously more is generally available down south but some stuff gets them jealousthe sbss and cheap russianchinese stuff and we have it better off than a few states like california here is an old gallery of some interesting ones in our non restricted class
canada,not_removed,discounting fresh water is kind of disingenuous though its a useful resource like woodland or farmland if youre ignoring areas just because you cant currently put buildings on them youd have to also ignore the oil sands managed forests parks and land used for farming
canada,not_removed,thanks for the correction i must have had those mixed up as time went by
canada,not_removed,the only way to solve issue is by vote trump
canada,not_removed,if youre in edmonton dusty tucker and norma jean are playing tonight starlite room i think anyways youre totally right
canada,not_removed,are nicer than most people and then are fucking atrocious
canada,not_removed,i remember some venue being shocked at how metalheads would leave the place looking relatively great after a multiday event and how it was such a contrast compared to country concerts
canada,not_removed,yeah i meant dead mother
canada,not_removed,and dont forget how reserves have a permanent hate for white folks and other people who arent members of their reserve
canada,not_removed,hey there small town here im rather offended that you would misrepresent us like that but i wont hold it against you canadas a big place its hard to put everyone together in general terms also we have a good deal of festivals in canada
canada,not_removed,small festival in calgary and tonight edmonton they called it mulefest i dont know why
canada,not_removed,there is no ontario only toronto
canada,not_removed,cities are worse with that imo they just cant speak english d
canada,not_removed,around here the gun toters tend towards gold teeth
canada,not_removed,the real gun toters with no teeth are at jane and finch
canada,not_removed,i looked it up its a movie that came out in what are you
canada,not_removed,idk op might be from the calgary area or somewhere in the mountains he might not have travelled much in his life i was in calgary on a degree day it was just a nice day i wasnt sweating at all it isnt like that at all in southern ontario degrees people are sweating and they are issuing warnings on the radio in calgary even if its degrees it can cool down to something like degrees at night when its hot in toronto it stays hot at night and the weather is really variable in the mountains it can be degrees one day and degrees the next toronto can go for weeks above degrees humid degrees so it feels hotter than that its like being in a tropical country
canada,not_removed,lived in toronto and montreal from calgary and edmonton originally you do not know humidity in alberta
canada,not_removed,edmonton is not humid lmao i lived there for years
canada,not_removed,yeah that is weird we have complete freedom of movement over provincial lines so i kinda thought that freedom of movement for goods would be a thing in a free developed country by default
canada,not_removed,uht i call it camping milk but we can buy milk that lasts for months in canada too
canada,not_removed,its popular here in germany as well canadians have a thing about uht milk for me it tastes funny but its nice to have a box of it around for those times you happen to run out of the fresh stuff
canada,not_removed,it used to be widely available here i remember bagged milk as commonplace when i was a wee toban
canada,not_removed,really i grew up in pg and never saw it
canada,not_removed,looks like any poutine from any nonfast food restaurant here in sk its not some magical fucking fairy dust that is shat by french elves the stuff is everywhere these days
canada,not_removed,thats an ami in a box
canada,not_removed,fast food has curds and brown gravy although kfc subs in their chicken gravy and aw uses their own gravy some of them even have maple bacon and other atrocities in there
canada,not_removed,doesnt matter if canada outside of the french spell it toque then thats the way we spell it and those dictionaries one of which is american are wrong
canada,not_removed,httpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionarytoque httpwwwoxforddictionariescomdefinitionenglishtoque
canada,not_removed,i know the difference and have eaten the range im surprised thats the worse offender of poutine you could find at least that one had curds and not grated cheese
canada,not_removed,what differences i cant think of a single one
canada,not_removed,when i see the term egalitarian society i think of how women and minorities are treated
canada,not_removed,free speech should protect you from your government you can still be hit by a civil lawsuit with cases of libel defamation etc
canada,not_removed,you have the freedom to say what you want as long as youre not spreading hate most canadians agree with this because it shuts up the bigots that everyone finds annoying
canada,not_removed,well i see it as being against american style integration of one nation one identity it failed though
canada,not_removed,free schooling comes from the band and what government checks are you referring to welfare gst credits those are eligible to anyone
canada,not_removed,okay and the citizens of montreal or vancouver dont give a shit how good you were in calgary theyre not gonna elect some dude whos never lived there
canada,not_removed,americans are still wrong though they have a tendency to really anunciate the ou oww sound when they talk loudly where as canadians are far more subtle about it when they compare how we say it to how they say about becomes aboat
canada,not_removed,classified by whom for me central means the centre
canada,not_removed,for me central canada is manitoba western ontario and whatever split of territories you fancy
canada,not_removed,wow thanks some great info there learn something new every day
canada,not_removed,build a wall and make the weather pay for it
canada,not_removed,kenora is a lot smaller than all the other cities i listed people vs
canada,not_removed,as long as you dont get in to political arguments about the merits of subgenres its fine also fantasy metal sucks and thrashpv rules
canada,not_removed,true the rez is no less deliverance
canada,not_removed,hey there small town here spent most of my life in a small town i know how it is we have a good deal of festivals in canada i was talking about metal festivals in particular heavy to and mtl dont really count
canada,not_removed,actually i grew up in vancouver but yeah our heat is different here when i first traveled across the country the internet wasnt even widespread yet i was a little ignorant i admit it
canada,not_removed,its really humid this year though
canada,not_removed,where saputo and dairyland stopped producing uht years ago
canada,not_removed,yea but it is canadian so it must be better than anything anyone else could come up with
canada,not_removed,ive literally only seen curds in fast food poutine at new york fries everywhere else uses mozzarella
canada,not_removed,thanks for proving my point
canada,not_removed,from my experience our experiences with the black community our histories are completely different so we have different thoughts and beliefs role of government canadians largely are not nearly as anti government as americans again different history religion its not nearly as intertwined in our politics as in america this is very reflective of the people in the two nations war we have no real history of it so for canadians going to war is a big deal and generally frowned upon we as a nation look outwards more than look in americans look in more than out we are a small population at the mercy of a larger one it is natural to look outwards to see our future not in america these are just the ones off the top of my head
canada,not_removed,its more than just hate but regardless hate is also subjective do you think people should be punished for what could be as simple as difference of opinions
canada,not_removed,i dont know about that hes pretty well known it wouldnt be a free win but i think hed have a pretty good shot at things
canada,not_removed,americans also call a roof a ruff
canada,not_removed,i would imagine it was classified by central canadians we make up million of the countrys population politics is pretty much centred here our region was canada long before canada was canada from our perspective there are three regions western canada central canada and eastern canada to call us eastern canada would feel off it would imply were part of the maritimes or something while manitoba is geographically the centre geography isnt the always how things are decided influence and strength tend to matter more its a matter of perspective i totally get why western canadians hate the term though it implies like we matter more because we place ourselves at the centre i can see why it would sound arrogant
canada,not_removed,i mean you still have to get a license to get any of these so in that way its not really easier for joe blow to get one here than in the statesaside from areas that dont allow them at all but once you do have your license here some of what you can access would be more of a pain to getpay for or even impossible depending where you live in the states way i think about it your first gun is more difficulttakes longer to get up here than most states but after that your second might be easier which reminds me some states have additional waiting periods per purchase and stuff like that that we dont have to deal with and we can buy guns new and used over the internet and ship them across the country to your doorstepif you have a pal which is not possible in the usa they have to either do the transfer in person or ship it to a ffl and go pick it up pay fees get checked etc
canada,not_removed,exactly
canada,not_removed,build a climate wall and make the wind pay for it
canada,not_removed,nah man metalcore and prog metal are where its at
canada,not_removed,grand pre was the brand that we used to buy its been years since ive gone out to camp with family did something hapen to uht in canada
canada,not_removed,how so
canada,not_removed,he doesnt prove your point by putting tuque as one of the definitions of toque it means that toque and tuque are the same thing
canada,not_removed,lmao read the criminal code our hate speech laws arent subjective and people arent prosecutedpunished for difference of opinions
canada,not_removed,prog metal youre right are are atrocious
canada,not_removed,nothing new just saputo and islandfarms are western canadas largest dairies theyve discontinued uht due to lack of demand
canada,not_removed,it does because the word toque is referred to in the origin and etymology heres the definition of etymology because i highly doubt you even know what it means the study of the origin of words and the way in which their meanings have changed throughout history secondly if you press on the little speaker icon it will tell you how the words are being pronounced unless canadian english is drastically different from british or american english it is safe to assume that the pronunciation would be the same here so toque is pronounce the same way as i take a toke on where tuque is pronounced the way that well everyone says tuque sounds like duke puke the word from a cultural perspective is pure canadien as in preact of union if anything you should be happy as it is one of the rare time that canada had an impact on the english language was it borrowed from the french toque yes however we made it our own a true canadian word
canada,not_removed,lol i set myself up for that xd
canada,not_removed,theyre a canadian menswear comapny theyve got some great stuff is another canadian option not really the same style at all but this one is only on clearance at you could browse the hudsons bay website as well unless youre planning on spending your winter up in inuvik i dont really see the need for a canada goose jacket anyway
canada,not_removed,check out mec or marks both have great stuff at a reasonable price if you want a premium look product try northface last years product
canada,not_removed,offers the best selection and pricing of functional outdoor gear in canada edit mec has lots of good info check out the httpswwwmeccaenexplorelearn section at the bottom of the front page here is a link to httpswwwmeccaenexploreclothinglayers thinsulate is a great alternative to down and also works well in gloves and mitts wool is an excellent insulator and is perfect for base and mid layers but like many i cant stand it against my skin fleece is a great alternative and is what i prefer merino wool is less itchy for socks wool is the best choice
canada,not_removed,canada goose are meant to be warm in or lower while wearing a tshirt underneath there arent too many options out there with the same level of down fill for cheaper but you can get a coat that will work for of the winter for much cheaper then you get some nice long johns and fleece for those real cold days
canada,not_removed,you can often find them used online when i worked up north my canada goose parka was amazing and below before windchill
canada,not_removed,the only thing worse than being a canada goose wearer is being a canada goose rip off wearer
canada,not_removed,you can find a lot of cold weather rated stuff at marks work warehouse i have a c parka i used it when it was and sweated by bag off it also made me look like the marshmallow man from ghostbusters
canada,not_removed,you could just make do with a cheap insulated wool peacoat then just layer up underneath on the really cold days and youre fine parkas are major overkill for most of the country
canada,not_removed,who has to spend on a jacket
canada,not_removed,there are so many different options that are literally dollars cheaper and just as warm if not warmer than a canada goose north face has a ton of jackets that would work given they dont look as nice but they are not too bad
canada,not_removed,thanks will definitly get the parka in frank and oak
canada,not_removed,id rather be an offbrand wearer and save thats just me though
canada,not_removed,my husband was debating between a north face jacket or a canada goose bomber he has been really happy with the north face gotham jacket that he purchased i personally wear a goose jacket but i will admit that there are other very good products on the market for less that a cg
canada,not_removed,yes yes lets get all the protesting in before the siu report
canada,not_removed,he was resisting arrest fuck blackluvesmatter charlatans
canada,not_removed,desmond coles article about this is excellent httpottawacitizencomopinioncolumnistscoleweneednotwaittojudgepolicebehaviourinabdisdeath
canada,not_removed,youre going to have fun in this thread
canada,not_removed,a black man was beaten to death by police while in their custody the community has every right to be pissed
canada,not_removed,they need to warm up so they can really protest when it turns out the cops did nothing wrong
canada,not_removed,what siu report theres no report by law their findings are confidential occasionally they release a few sentences about incidents thats it
canada,not_removed,i will reserve the judgment until report is completed but i have a question here it relates to this whatever his reasons for running the officers had no right to take him down so violently what hes trying to say is that is that when suspect is trying to outrun police and im sure he knew who was chasing him and he knew whatever you was doing was wrong police need to essentially give up on chase and let him escape because well the suspect may get hurt im at a loss to understand how does anyone stop someone any other way also police had no really idea who they are dealing with simple rule dont run from police just dont run away i dont care who you are where you came from what religion you practice or what colour of your skin is dont try to argue for different treatment it is a tragedy that he died but to suggest that if police had some other way of catching him hed be alive is quite a stretch because if he hadnt run hed be alive anyone can armchair shit out of this
canada,not_removed,should i point out the number of times that a person involved in a fight with another person has been struck once in the headfallen to the ground and died of a head injury with no police involvement at all many times all it takes is one punch to the head to create a death lets wait for the coroners report shall we jim b
canada,not_removed,the killed a man jesus
canada,not_removed,the incident happened less than a week ago protests in canada are as of yet unwarranted
canada,not_removed,do you think they purposefully killed him because he was black you resist arrest you get your body slammed to the ground and handcuffed at the very least or tased or shot if youre holding a weapon any human resisting arrest will get the same treatment hes not the first guy to die this way many have and many will however there will be an investigation so before we start burning the city down lets wait and see what the findings are blm is a hate group claiming to fight racism by using racism they are a self destructive group and share ranks with the likes of the kkk the jewish defense league or the westebero baptists
canada,not_removed,fighting with the cops puts your body at risk not all people who resist arrest end up dead at the scene some do even fewer who dont resist end up dead at the scene
canada,not_removed,could you quit being so logical its just not what the cheering crew from blm want to hear by the way did any one see the blm summer school training program for to year old kids in toronto the stated intent was to mobilise their minds around the struggle sounds like indoctrinationto me get them young isnt that what malcom x said jim b
canada,not_removed,what hes trying to say is that is that when suspect is trying to outrun police and im sure he knew who was chasing him and he knew whatever you was doing was wrong police need to essentially give up on chase and let him escape because well the suspect may get hurt nice straw man what cole is saying and i agree with is that the police dont get to beat someone to death for making them run
canada,not_removed,except in this instance witnesses testify that he was hit repeatedly while in custody making some big stretches there jim
canada,not_removed,some of the initial video showed the guy getting hit again and again his head repeatedly punched against the pavement that video seems to have disappeared
canada,not_removed,oh they killed him on purpose specifically because of his skin colour can you prove this
canada,not_removed,why we have as much information as will ever be available apologists for certain things always say now is not the time but they never say when the time will be never according to them httpottawacitizencomopinioncolumnistscoleweneednotwaittojudgepolicebehaviourinabdisdeath
canada,not_removed,lol could possibly be one of the silliest things ive ever read on this sub
canada,not_removed,oh im sure the hitler blm youth are going to grow up just fine
canada,not_removed,beat someone to death for making them run you dont know what straw man is lol
canada,not_removed,and we all know that eye witness report are never wrong right jim b
canada,not_removed,where is the video all i have seen is him on the ground d bleeding does the video before that not meet there agenda so it wasnt posted
canada,not_removed,probably sealed under court order and entered into evidence we dont need to be exposing future jurors to potential bias
canada,not_removed,excessive force premeditated if there is evidence that this was racially motivated im sure it will come out
canada,not_removed,not really we have various statements from eye witnessnesses who only saw parts of the event are generally unreliable as evidence anyways and in this case seem to be prejudiced to form a conclusion we dont even have the reports from the officersemt involved yet let alone the siu findings
canada,not_removed,death in a possibility whenever force is used in any situation if you resist arrest you guarantee the use of force therefor dont resist if youre being unlawfully detained document everything as best you can and fight it after by using our justice system there is plenty and plenty of evidence of blm being racist just google or youtube it
canada,not_removed,i could say the same about a bar fight grow up
canada,not_removed,reductio ad hitlerum nice
canada,not_removed,hands up dont shoot
canada,not_removed,eye witness reports are used as testimony edit downvoting facts nice
canada,not_removed,what reports from officers what reports from emts what siu findings none of these things will ever be released to the public you are insisting that we withhold judgment until things that will never be public are public why do i need siu to tell me what to think about an incident that a halfdozen witnesses have unanimously said was unjustified
canada,not_removed,its not proportional and the police need to be highly justified when using excessive force just ask forcillo unless you feel that his sentence was unjustified we dont live in a police state
canada,not_removed,were you there in ottawa nah i didnt think so jim b
canada,not_removed,and they are strongly questioned in court if you can find holes in their testimony as a defence council you have raised the concept of reasonable doubt havent you remember that in canada the evidence given by a witness must be the truth beyond a reasonable doubt and not an opinion just the facts please jim b
canada,not_removed,which isnt fact unless it holds up under crossexamination
canada,not_removed,ten people ten different stories
canada,not_removed,oh ok
canada,not_removed,we certainly dont and we have fair courts so dont be a moron and resist arrest this isnt some world backwater where cops are extensions of gangs
canada,not_removed,hyperbolic nonsense
canada,not_removed,testimony is used to prove beyond reasonable doubt in support of the evidence this is the evidence eye witness testimony video footage a dead black man who had intellectual needs going to be pretty hard to establish reasonable doubt
canada,not_removed,doesnt mean that by resisting arrest that you should be exposed to unmitigated and excessive use of force
canada,not_removed,sucks when someone points out the similarities of both groups of racist shitbags doesnt it
canada,not_removed,is there video besides him already on the ground if so can you post a link
canada,not_removed,why do you keep saying excessive force we dont know if that was the case wait for the investigation before we jump to conclusions have you ever tried to wrestle somebody to the ground who was resisting a simple sidewalk curb could be lethal
canada,not_removed,look at the vitriol in your posts and ask yourself if these individuals have a right to be fearful of people like you
canada,not_removed,the video you saw is all that was released to the media im fairly certain it has been sealed into evidence heres the timeline heres the video nsfw notice how the police step in front of the camera to block the recording httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzigpjmrudus going to be pretty damned hard to prove reasonable doubt
canada,not_removed,when someone dies while confronting the police while unarmed i think its fairly safe to say that the use of force was a little excessive proportionality is a good measure to this effect
canada,not_removed,words are scary when theyre true make the bad person stop committing heresy
canada,not_removed,yah same video yes the cop is partially blocking the camera but the guy who is near the suspect is not hitting the guy when that happens how do i know educated guess the cop isnt moving enough between when we see him unless he is really smart and going back to near same position im just wondering where s the footage for how he got that way was it because he slammed to the ground when the cop tackled him was the guy fighting the cops or did the cops just kick his ass one of those is unreasonable the other two not really just an unfortunate accident
canada,not_removed,im sure the autopsy will shed some light into the affair especially once the cause of death is announced i just wonder what it will take for people to wake up and realize that there is a problem
canada,not_removed,this guy will be forced to walk the plank on a boat filled of angry redditors
canada,not_removed,another one added to my folder this shit is happening all over the country shouldnt the immigration fetishists be up in arms about this kind of crap theres nothing more anticanadian than the tfw program the government sure as hell cant regulate it abolish it now
canada,not_removed,while i agree the tfw program is mess probably for a different reason than someone with an account name tfwgohome to conflate immigration with the tfw program is simply incorrect people should be mad about this guy broke the law guy took advantage of marginalized people in the tfw program company wanted the benefit of cheap disposable labour but wasnt willing to follow the very lax rules for taking advantage of that program i dont dispute that the tfw program is crappy but these types of employers are just as happy to take advantage of canadian citizens who work for them
canada,not_removed,so the fact someone is facing charges means the government cant regulate it and let me guess if the program had no problems it would be because the government wasnt looking hard enough for the corruption but we have employers who take advantage of canadians all the time are you going to champion that we abolish work in general i mean why bother going half way lets get to the real root of the problem
canada,not_removed,the whole point of the tfw program is to provide a sea of people who can be taken advantage of like this you and i are directly competing with people who can be treated like garbage and have to smile about it we get screwed they get screwed too but apparently saying that makes me racist
canada,not_removed,the reality is that canadians get taken advantage like this on a daily basis as well look at the food service industry for example widespread illegal labour practices and blacklisting its time to start targeting the scumbag employers
canada,not_removed,definitely agreed
canada,not_removed,id have loved to go but this is exactly why i wont
canada,not_removed,the hamilton show may as well have not gone on sale at all they were all gone withing no joke one second its complete bullshit
canada,not_removed,the band should do a massive telethon raise money for brain cancer research and let people watch from across the country
canada,not_removed,time to start printing the buyers names on tickets like they do with airline tickets the band or the promotervenue doesnt wanna see people getting ripped off on second hand sales
canada,not_removed,so glad i got tickets i have never seen them live before and i would be very disappointed if i didnt get the chance
canada,not_removed,its an open secret that scalpers use bots to bypass ticketmasters captcha and ticket quantities yet ticketmaster does nothing it makes one wonder if they get a cut of the revenue of tickets sold on stubhub because if theyre really trying to prevent bots from entering the site they could hire the appropriate programmers to do so the legislation also needs to be reworded yet again to cap price points from third party retailers a ticket for the hip give me a break
canada,not_removed,isnt selling tickets for more than the face value illegal in canada how does stub hub function
canada,not_removed,the hubbub over the hip and stubhub httpiimgurcompvxnpphjpg
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,the ticket sale scene is beyond toxic these days
canada,not_removed,i got tickets just this morning through ticketmaster ¯ツ¯
canada,not_removed,surprise surprise ticketmaster are a bunch of scumbag bottom feeders they only care about money and nothing else when scalping was illegal they couldnt stop it so they made themselves the only legal scalpers now they are profiting on gordies cancer i wish more people would just stop buying tickets
canada,not_removed,fuck ticketmaster this is the reason i dont go to concerts anymore
canada,not_removed,the other day i tried to buy a drakefuture ticket and they were all sold within minute of the release within minutes their were on stubhub the ticketmaster rep i was on the phone with had absolutely no explanation how within less than minute all of the tickets at the venue vanished its gotta be an inside job
canada,not_removed,glad i got to see the hip in the this is the exact reason i havent been to a live show in over years
canada,not_removed,unfortunately this was bound to happen too big of a show to attempt to control reselling the only real option would be to have free outdoor shows but the hip has no reason to do that with that said tickets always pop up over time my wife wanted beyonce tickets in toronto and they sold out instantly when they were first released i checked periodically for her and found her seats on ticketmaster a week before the show the resell market will be flooded until the shows come so your only bet is to keep checking once a week or something on tm
canada,not_removed,apparently for certain tickets they are now requiring that you present the credit card used to purchase the tickets at the time of entry so be very careful buying tickets from scalpers now
canada,not_removed,why dont they just use captcha to prevent the bots this isnt new technology
canada,not_removed,how is this legal
canada,not_removed,if you need any better demonstration of what the corporatization does to the society and for every decent fan of the band who hates this there are or more selfiegeneration douchebags who cannot wait to post a photo from the concert so yeah it sucks but theres nothing you can do
canada,not_removed,same thing happened with drake tickets last week most of the fault is due to these stupid presales they have like with drake they had the first presale for all the floor seats but you could only pay with amex as it was amex sponsored then they had a facebook only presale thursday and then general public sale on friday and then all the floor seats were already mark up on stubhub and ticketmaster and everything else was ridiculously expensive such a sham
canada,not_removed,someone needs to make a lotto system for tickets instead of selling them first come first serve you open them up for a draw you then let verified accounts enter the draw for a chance to purchase tickets to the show then you close the draw of entries and email or text the people selected for a chance to purchase tickets not everyone will purchase tickets so whatever seats are then leftover are sold on a first come first serve basis this way you have people who actually want to see the show being able to get tickets at the sales price i cant see why a system like this cant dethrone ticketmaster from their gouging ways
canada,not_removed,i couldnt get tickets through the presale through ticketmaster for this but did through capital tickets in ottawa had a bad experience also trying to get pearl jam tickets tried for like an hour an got nothing then my husband tried and got some their site cant handle the volume i dont think that show was even sold out
canada,not_removed,just lucked out and scored lower bowl for the hammer
canada,not_removed,same thing happened with drake the other day i posted a thread on rcanada ralberta and redmonton were getting fucked and its about damn time we do something about it
canada,not_removed,i hope this is the straw that breaks the camels back and we finally get some govt oversight of this scam
canada,not_removed,i paid my pieces of silver us for two floor seats in vancouver rows back this has been my favourite band for about years i saw their very first tour for their first album and probably shows since so it was easy to justify especially when bands like are selling tickets for over at the box office i was also prepared to go to victoria to see them and shell out for ferries hotel restaurants etc which would have come to more than the price i paid still i hate it i hate that ticketmaster owns stubhub and the massive conflict of interest this creates i hate that the days of going to the box office at in the morning to get tickets at are over ensuring that the most loyal fans always got in i hate the service fees and bullshit its time for an app similar to uber or airbnb and a system that ranks ticket buyers by lottery when demand exceeds supply they could charge a small fee like and your tickets would live in your app which would also connect to your calendar when a concert is coming up just click yes and the app will buy your ticket for you the app will also limit how many tickets you can get to any event putting scalpers out of business and force you to resell your tickets back to the next person on the lottery list if you cant go
canada,not_removed,can someone explain to me how this happens for shows like these where credit card entry is required as in you have to swipe the card the tickets were purchased with to get into the show and show id confirming the name on the tickets the tickets are not transferable on the ticketmaster site and the fine print confirms this i bought tickets for a friend in vancouver because for some reason she couldnt get them to come up on her computer and i ended up having to return them because of this rule i dont live in vancouver and i wont be going to the show with her how the hell do scalpers get around this
canada,not_removed,the sale to the general public for the winnipeg show sold out in a minute i walked past mts centre this morning seeing the long line there i walked to hmv which is tm outlet there was only one couple in front of me they got tickets it was sold out before i could get mine luckily the nice lady at hmv kept trying and eventually got me a pair probably only one or two people got tickets waiting in line at mts centre
canada,not_removed,a bieber show yeah whatever i get it hes a dickface and his fans should pay a premium but the hips last tour plain classless i didnt think it was possible for ticketloserstubchump to make me hate ticket brokers any more but here we are
canada,not_removed,the flip side of the argument is if thats what tickets are worth why do the lucky few who get in nanoseconds before everyone else get the tickets if i have to work when tickets go on sale but id pay then thats the market value there needs to be a better way for tickets to be sold that doesnt benefit scalpers maybe ticketmaster should have an open auction scalpers will be less likely to buy
canada,not_removed,the band should do massive shows at downsview for free they dont need the money
canada,not_removed,if you dont like it dont pay it if the stubhub price isnt a fair market price it will come down you are now entitled to cheap tickets
canada,not_removed,its so frustrating to show up at a venue and find half a dozen scalpers out there selling tickets for sold out shows because the assholes gobbled up the day one sales venues just need to start making early sale tickets nontransferable
canada,not_removed,yeah ive never gotten around to actually going to a large concert and frankly i dont see that changing anytime soon seeing how tickets are gone in minutes if not seconds already often cost quite a bit without having to buy them from a scalper plus id often have to travel to vancouver which isnt cheap even if i could afford it i have better uses for my money
canada,not_removed,markup and to slimy assholes who absolutely dont deserve it either if that markup at least went to band members i would probably still pay that markup in some cases but otherwise forget it
canada,not_removed,welcome to capitalism and the profit motive
canada,not_removed,i picked up tix for the hamilton show at first it said nothing nothing nothing i didnt get them till almost
canada,not_removed,you should sell them for a mark up and retire
canada,not_removed,wouldnt tm instead use their own reseller service to keep the revenue within their ecosystem tm and sh are competing companies individuals not related to tm would definitely use sh and competing services to sell tickets
canada,not_removed,it was only the band presale today so likely only a few hundred tickets for each show there are more presales and then the public sales
canada,not_removed,stubhub already has tickets on sale for the vancouver show the email the band sent this afternoon stated that the presale for that show is at tomorrow kind of suspicious
canada,not_removed,im not sure they are held back for stubhub theyre different companies apparently a great deal of tickets are held back for high end credit card holders special interest groups vips check it out interesting tho that this fans rights group is funded by stubhub i would think that a lot of these high end credit card holders are the guys doing a lot of the reselling on stubhub it all sounds very corrupt and in need of oversight
canada,not_removed,its worse than that peter gabriel played at the molson amphitheatre a few years back i bought physical tickets from a guy in arizona of all places second row centre i had the tickets in my hand before tickets were officially for sale not only do the scalpers get some of the tickets reserved they get them before everyone else
canada,not_removed,how is this legal
canada,not_removed,i got weirdly it said sold out at i had tried toronto first but a few minutes later i was able to get them
canada,not_removed,how can tickets sell out that fast do you load up your online cart and wait for the site to allow transactions then press buy
canada,not_removed,i heard on reddit so take it for what it is that apparently the cbc is potentially looking at broadcasting the kingston show
canada,not_removed,has to be a bit broader than that ill often buy tickets to something then realize that either me or my wife cant go and one of us will go with a friend
canada,not_removed,they do that now with etickets but venues only check the barcode the lineups to enter a massive venue are already so long for shows imagine if we had to wait even longer for id checks
canada,not_removed,they do this my tickets have my name on them and the fine print says you have to present the credit card used to buy the tickets and id to get in
canada,not_removed,they are selling out the shows on day one they got their money that is all they care about
canada,not_removed,the real problem is that somebody is willing to pay to see the tragically hip why wouldnt you
canada,not_removed,i think the key words here are in canada many of the tickets on stubhub are being sold from the us maybe circumventing the law that way
canada,not_removed,what do you propose unless you go the route of the superbowl or the masters where you have to present id and only the original purchaser can attend using that ticket there is no way to prevent increasing prices with increasing demand look at jays games last autumn they sold out right away and people were paying for their seats by flipping a third to cover their other two thirds its just a reality of how supply and demand works if you dont like being priced out im sorry
canada,not_removed,stubhub doesnt set the prices people sell their tickets and they take a commission if youre going to get mad at anyone get mad at the people asking that much for their tickets on there blaming stubhub is shooting the messenger
canada,not_removed,in japan for some concerts they require the buyer to upload a facial photo when purchasing and entrance is only granted if the person in the photo is the one trying to get in
canada,not_removed,they do this the hip tickets i bought in vancouver say this explicitly i dont know how scalpers are doing this
canada,not_removed,me too couple floor seats for the final show in kingston
canada,not_removed,yeah same got floor tickets for second show in calgary
canada,not_removed,they only care about money and nothing else they are a corporation what else would the care about other than money its our shitty government that allows them to continue to operate in this manner
canada,not_removed,edmonton pre sale tickets had this it also said the tickets were non transferable could make for an empty building
canada,not_removed,they should do this for all of them when time is available which would be rare i know so theyd just do random ones the risk of being asked to show the cc or be turned away might be enough to deter people buying scalped tickets and in turn eventually lower the demand for them
canada,not_removed,yeah this baffles me i dont know why scalpers are even bothering the only way around this is a prepaid credit card you buy with the tickets but even then youre supposed to present id i imagine the rule simply wont be upheld thats a lot of fans to id trying to get into a concert
canada,not_removed,the ticket software those scumbag scalpers use can fully get by captchas like httpdocugsaonlinedemediacaptchabreakercbticketmasterpng
canada,not_removed,they did use captcha
canada,not_removed,they have some stupid picturebased captcha but it doesnt seem to prevent bots very effectively
canada,not_removed,tragically bots are able to answer a lot of captchas with pretty good accuracy these days
canada,not_removed,blame ticketmaster all you want the band could have approached it differently
canada,not_removed,no the best way is to have preregistered users like pearl jam does you pay a yearly membership so they can verify it is you then they have a lottery for the registered user before the public sale if you get caught scalping your tickets you lose them and future rights
canada,not_removed,atleast other friends and i tried with our laptops while also on the phone with ticketmaster to grab summer tickets the second they went on sale none of us or anybody i know for that matter was able to get a pair most shady thing ever
canada,not_removed,what is stopping scalpers or speculators from acquiring a bunch of burner phones and using the app
canada,not_removed,dae hate new music but love the hip
canada,not_removed,i hope they bring the biebs on stage
canada,not_removed,they donate most of the proceeds from all their shows to charity this tour the proceeds will be donated to sunnybrook every tour its a different charity
canada,not_removed,downsview is always a shitshow both to get to and as a venue
canada,not_removed,even for people who arent hugely into the music this tour will be the last chance to see them before gord dies so its kind of a big deal
canada,not_removed,you may not get it and thats ok there are a lot of us that grew up grew old with this band seeing them perform for the last time is important and puts some closure for us on the band and what they have created im fortunate enough to have seen them perform a number of times still i would have loved to have seen them one last time
canada,not_removed,have you seen a live show
canada,not_removed,venues just need to start making early sale tickets nontransferable or do they dave chappelle thing and require the credit card that was used to be presented at the door
canada,not_removed,exactly id pay a shit tonne for tickets if a it was going to the band b it was going to gordhis family or c cancer research etc but nope people are shamelessly middlemancapitalizing on a canadian icons terminal cancer diagnosis fucking disgusting
canada,not_removed,ticketmaster is so broken
canada,not_removed,lol even for id still fell dirty profiting off of gords condition besides i actually want to go to the show unlike the scalpers and the experience is worth far more to me than whatever crazy resell prices theyre going for
canada,not_removed,i believe stubhub is owned by ticketmaster edit or not looked it up and i remembered wrong owned by ebay
canada,not_removed,there will be virtually nothing left by the time we get to a public sale though scalpers have amex cards and sign up for every artists presale alerts to hoover up whatever they can before they hit the market
canada,not_removed,my brother managed to get four for the hamilton show i dont envy anyone for trying to get them though
canada,not_removed,you could have multiple names on multiticket sets and as long as one named person is their with the group you would get in if you just want to give them to a friend youd require a much more complicated system to avoid scalping though
canada,not_removed,back when the hip were on the trouble in the henhouse tour they announced a concert the morning of the show and the tickets were polaroids of you in front of the concert poster if you werent the person in the picture you had to be with the person in the picture
canada,not_removed,pearl jam tried to boycott ticketmaster fought tooth and nail and lost few other bands supported them and here we are continually getting screwed by ticketmaster
canada,not_removed,pearl jam fought this battle valiantly for years and lost ticketmaster signs exclusive ticketing agreements with facilities if you want to show up to a city and play for more than a few hundred people all the venues are locked up and then ontop of ticketmasters scuzzy ways theres people trying to actively scam ticketmaster botnets run from cloud services hosted abroad paying for dedicated pipes and bandwidth that give them millisecond advantage to traditional isps theres no way to win
canada,not_removed,if each ticket sold was nontransferable and had to be tied to a full name and birth date to be confirmed by a show of id at the venue the problem would more or less go away hell given the demand for tickets you could have a refund with handling fee so if for some reason you cant go you get most of your money back and the ticket can be resold and you could also have a system where a ticket without an id link could be paired with one that was so you could take a lastminute date or something obviously the industry is not at all serious about stopping the scalping so it must be making them money
canada,not_removed,i dont know why it doesnt happen more often but i do know that ticketmaster has the credit card ticket system you can only get into the venue if you show the credit card you used to buy the tickets the tickets are nontransferrable and if you sold them to someone else they would be void and youd both lose moneytickets i know they did this system for the dave chappelle shows in toronto during allstar weekend and for adeles tour i dont understand why they dont do this for every concert
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,wow great pull
canada,not_removed,what damn
canada,not_removed,which is why im super stoked i got a pair of tickets i am counting my lucky stars
canada,not_removed,in this case you have to swipe the card to validate and get your entrance stub
canada,not_removed,oh cool so its just a scam
canada,not_removed,most captchas are not really effective
canada,not_removed,are these bots in any way tragically hip
canada,not_removed,i doubt they could they probably have a contract with ticketmaster or ticketmaster has a contract with the venues either way nowadays it is ticketmaster or nothing
canada,not_removed,a unique code for each fanclub member would have helped
canada,not_removed,i like pearl jams approach to selling tickets to fan club members which is what the hip were doing here selling to fan club members pearl jam bypasses ticketmaster entirely and has of the seats for every show that they sell through their own distribution system basically as soon as a tour is announced active fan club members paid your annual fee for the year have the ability to enter into a draw to get tickets you can enter into as little as one show or all the shows of the tour for each show that you enter into the draw youre agreeing to purchase tickets for that concert if you win your credit card is charged for tickets for all the shows you won but you dont get the tickets until the day of the show when you pick them up at will call this also prevents fan club members from making a quick buck on what are always the best seats in the venue its not perfect as often longtime fans do get shut out even if the band is coming through their hometown on the last tour i scored floor tickets for ottawa but lost on the toronto show and had to go ticketmaster for the public sale tickets pearl jam has a long standing history of battling ticketmaster in the and tried alternative ticketing routes only to find they were playing cities and arenas that made it even more difficult for fans to see the band i imagine tm has now further consolidated their exclusive agreements with venues meaning bigger bands have no choice but to deal with him im just glad my favourite band is able to reach out to loyal fans and give them an alternative
canada,not_removed,that seems more difficult to do with less established acts the way i described is how sports playoff tickets and some acts are typically sold in the us for some reason it hasnt made its way to canada yet
canada,not_removed,it would be a significant investment for a lottery system and there is no way to sell for higher than you paid you can only sell your tickets to the next person on the lottery wait list
canada,not_removed,i hate bieber but even he is better than the hip seriously gord downies voice is utter trash bring on the perma ban
canada,not_removed,what if i want to buy my brother tickets for his birthday
canada,not_removed,i work at a box office and for paperless credit card entry only shows scalpers will buy tickets on a prepaid card and then when you buy through them theyll send you the card in the mail frustratingly genius
canada,not_removed,yea but to be fair its an insane process to manage youve gotta find tickets hold them as they go through the process and if they dont complete release them all in real time while hundreds or thousands of other users are trying to get those tickets its not an easy thing to make but i think there are probably things they could do to improve it
canada,not_removed,ticketmaster has something called ticketmaster or usually referred to as tm i think thats their competition to stubhub pretty shady though
canada,not_removed,that is the rumour read a book called ticket master find it on amazon it describes the history of ticketing and how the industry got to where it is today great read if you are a regular user of ticketbastard
canada,not_removed,ya i know i was there the second they went on sale today and was shut out i am still optimistic i will get a pair i go to lots of concerts it is very rare for me to get completely shut out of a show i want to attend this system is still way better than the old days lining up all night outside of a tm location then getting shut out as the people working at the tm location print off a few dozen for themselves that really sucked
canada,not_removed,the amex presale is limited to a max of tickets per address and you need to present the card at the entrance to get in with the tickets so the party has to also enter at the same time and its starts protip you like shows then get an amex card
canada,not_removed,this would impossible today because almost nobody carries a polaroid around like we used to in the
canada,not_removed,they could reserve a block of tickets for physical purchase at the venue or other resale locations keep an index of max tickets per name with proof of id
canada,not_removed,the thing is it doesnt make that much extra money it only guarantees low risk of loss from unsold tickets which isnt an issue anyway for high demand shows
canada,not_removed,captcha just isnt that good anymore you can literally pay for real people to complete catchas on the fly as part of a software package or they just get easily beat by some halfassed software that is fairly good and if it gets it wrong even half of the time ohwell still gets through eventually theres no site that can stop spam matter the captcha its just an easy measure to mitigate some of it and increase the cost of spam
canada,not_removed,i think the site was just overwhelmed i had the same frustrating experience as many others but kept at it and managed to get tickets
canada,not_removed,they are more like crowd sourced hip
canada,not_removed,last time came they played the same venue the hip are playing all floor tickets were will call you had to pick up your tickets and had to have the credit card they were purchased on and photo id that matched the name on the order and then a bracelet was put on and that was that absolutely no way to scalp unless you personally accompanied the person into the venue theres no reason why the hip couldnt have done this either ticket max photo id pickup enter immediately impossible to scalp hell they could have auctioned off a thousand of their best tickets each night and given the proceeds to a cancer charity
canada,not_removed,or held it back from more real people as if the scalpers cant figure out a fan club code i feel like that certainly didnt stop any scalper
canada,not_removed,that seems more difficult to do with less established acts the perfect way is to have people establish accounts with tm and ticketscom apply to be a user like you would apply for a credit card complete with sin number then they make you a registeredverified user maybe make it a yearly fee of they have to come up with a way to keep the speculators away
canada,not_removed,give him your credit card when he goes
canada,not_removed,maybe just the name of the intended ticket holder at purchase confirmed with valid id at the door
canada,not_removed,its not like they need burstsble bandwidth and processing power once a year they need it weekly on mondays and fridays or whenever tickets are released the system doesnt work as is flawed it wouldnt be hard to hold a seat and put someone into a queue for payment when available and release if not completed instead pages were coming back as no seats available not a problem with the search
canada,not_removed,somehow the prospect of reading a book about a company i hate more than any other company might drive me insane
canada,not_removed,this system is still way better than the old days lining up all night outside of a tm location then getting shut out as the people working at the tm location print off a few dozen for themselves that really sucked or when you would line up overnight and then they would hand out numbers and randomly draw for position and every time the same people would get the tickets and be found outside the sales booth hocking the tickets for a tidy markup
canada,not_removed,you like shows then get an amex card we shouldnt have to make an application that affects our credit scores to get concert tickets
canada,not_removed,the fan presale was limited to too
canada,not_removed,you could just go by the name thats written on the ticket and then say your name has to match that ask people for official government id to verify the name scalpers would have their name written on the ticket since they purchased it originally
canada,not_removed,true a concert venue wouldnt have any way to take and print pictures quickly these days
canada,not_removed,that must be how tinder bots are so prevalent now
canada,not_removed,i think floor tickets for this are supposed to have the same restrictions at least according to the ticketmaster site some locations are credit card entry only restrictions apply credit card used for pymt and id reqd to enter ticket is non transferable so well see what happens to the ones on sale on stubhub i guess maybe since theyre a legal redistributer theyve found a way to circumvent that
canada,not_removed,the problem is that the venues have a deal with ticketmaster bands just dont have much of a choice only a few big names were able to avoid ticketmaster idk if deal worked that way because they were building their own stage for the tour
canada,not_removed,individual one time use codes could have prevented this
canada,not_removed,i dunno if you have to be that sophisticated one account per email address one draw entry per ip you limit how many tickets can be purchased per draw entry and you could even do one purchase per credit card even if speculators still somehow got a dozen entries into the draw it doesnt guarantee they will get all of those seats
canada,not_removed,what if my brothers an asshole and i dont trust him with my card
canada,not_removed,thats what im worried about i just got two tickets for the kingston show using my mothers american express i dont have amex buddy and i are going but i can bring her card and it will be fine right
canada,not_removed,yeaits flawed for sure i spent min getting no tix available for the new edmonton show then i got a really good pair somethings not quite right
canada,not_removed,just getting a new credit card wont impact your credit score by itself making multiple credit applications over a short period of time can
canada,not_removed,well i wonder if you buy them with one of those credit card gift cards if that would work then you send the used gift card with the tickets
canada,not_removed,they used ticketmaster you cant not use ticketmaster in a ticketmaster venue like an nba or nhl arena
canada,not_removed,that sounds like something that makes it harder for people to buy tickets not scalpers how hard is it to get multiple or many codes what do you need to get a code a valid email adddess i have of those at least myself and im not even trying does nothing stops nobody
canada,not_removed,one draw entry per ip i purchased my hip tickets this morning on a company computer there are people on the same ip about people were trying this morn
canada,not_removed,then dont buy your brother tickets
canada,not_removed,buy him a self help book instead
canada,not_removed,dont buy him a birthday gift
canada,not_removed,yeah itll be fine most venues dont ask to see the credit card anyway
canada,not_removed,no youll be charged for stealing her credit card
canada,not_removed,whenever you apply for new credit there is an inquiry every inquiry has an impact on your credit score applying for a single credit card admittedly wont bring down your credit score by a large amount but it will still knock a few points off
canada,not_removed,those are all good points i suppose im just bitter
canada,not_removed,curious were you the only one to get tickets ticketmaster today will push you further down the line if you have multiple connections from the same ip happening i know when the blue jays playoff tickets went on sale it was far more effective to purchase them on your phone using mobile data than it was using a work computer because of all the simultaneous connections
canada,not_removed,what if hes been difficult in the past but made a lot of progress through rehab and i want to recognize that through convert tickets but dont yet trust him with my money
canada,not_removed,this is one of the biggest misconceptions in credit getting a new card wont impact your score being delinquent is the biggest culprit this is from httpswwwtransunioncacapersonalconsumersupportfaqscoreenpageinquiryaffect website q how do inquiries affect my score a a common misconception is that every inquiry decreases your credit score a certain number of points this is not true while an inquiry is recorded on your personal credit report every time you one of your creditors or a potential creditor obtains your credit report the presence of inquiries has only a small impact on your credit score and certain types of inquiries your inquiry to your file and account review inquiries have absolutely no impact inquiries have less importance than delinquencies balances owed and the length of time you have used credit in general scores only consider inquiries from the last months inquiries are usually more important on your credit score if you have a limited credit history
canada,not_removed,today yes we have been able in the past to get tickets for multiple users for the same show simultaneously example me and a guy desks down scored pearl jam toronto tickets within a minute of each other it appears that it is important to login to your tm account in advance
canada,not_removed,i should also mention my significant other works on the desk beside me we often have duelling computers we each login then we put tickets in the cart wait to see who gets the better pair then pull the trigger on the best pair and then throw the other pair back been doing this for the last decade we have purchased excellent seats good floors all the time at various venues in ontario and western new york the ip address does not appear to be a problem but we do both login to separate tm accounts
canada,not_removed,then i would send him a gift card and go to the concert myself
canada,not_removed,this confirms what i said the presence of inquiries has only a small impact on your credit score and certain types of inquiries your inquiry to your file and account review inquiries have absolutely no impact inquiries for new products do have an impact on your credit score however small
canada,not_removed,fuck ticketmaster has been doing this shit for over a decade somebody really needs to give them a run for their money
canada,not_removed,a couple of things impact doesnt necessarily mean it decreases your score the calculation of the score takes in many factors they wont tell you what they are that drive the overall score the most important ones are delinquencies and current balances a credit score is at a particular moment in time it is only updated when a lender requests the score so amex makes a request and sees the score at that time the request is made the amex request wont have any impact as the request wasnt there until it was made
canada,not_removed,much longer than that if this is a business you frequent or care about go buy the book ticket master it is about tm the history of ticketing and how we got here a really good read
canada,not_removed,a good read regardless of your politics i think its amazing how important the definitions of words are someone says this someone else says that someone else points out that both could be correct and thats all we have words without words wed be like animals
canada,not_removed,my boy coyne reppin it the canadian way
canada,not_removed,conservatives are getting exactly what they asked for they own it
canada,not_removed,sorry but trump is the new definition of conservatism cpac showed that
canada,not_removed,yeah the average conservative is too dense to see the difference and this is made evident by the current polling on the cpc leadership race
canada,not_removed,conservatives arent unreasonable and many agree with trump ps the manning conference was pretty much ignored by canadas fake news media yet andrew wonders why people dont understand real conservatives conservatism does not rest in the conviction that popular opinion is always right at any moment in time but neither places its faith in allseeing experts or visionary leaders rather it trusts in the wisdom that is accumulated through generations of trial and error and the institutions and customs that embody it its good that he realizes the inherent rationality in conservatism but unfortunately he cant seem to grasp the benefits of reaching out to populist voters people wont vote for generations of trial and error or institutions they cant understand
canada,not_removed,lol the left is projecting again us progressive liberals people versus them bigoted rightwingers
canada,not_removed,the old rightleft paradigms are breaking down which makes sense society has changed too much for them to make sense progressivism is the merger of the economic right with the cultural left it could be described as a promoting a hyper capitalist society with weak states and no borders where there is no racism or sexism but far more entrenched classism the nationalist movement is less mature and still struggling over what it will become if it will survive it needs to become the ideology of the welfare state capitalist but with capital tempered by the national interests and the defender of classical western ideals and values
canada,not_removed,politics has always been us for them but as far as im aware the conservatives have lost their roots and have become stiff lipped liberals
canada,not_removed,semantics
canada,not_removed,funny how you people who accuse conservatives of dividing people with a us vs them mentality by mentioning canadian values are so keen to rule whether how someone behaves or thinks is canadian or not if there is no such thing as a canadian value then racism would be as canadian as racial tolerance fascism as canadian as democracy communism as canadian as darwinian capitalism so which is it do canadian values exist or not if not then you have no right to say that anything is the canadian way or of accusing anyone of not acting canadian
canada,not_removed,i used to strongly dislike him now he is the voice of reason
canada,not_removed,actually hes the original definition of conservative holding to traditional attitudes and values and cautious about change or innovation typically in relation to politics or religion its not hard too see with slogans like make america great again many conservatives especially in canada are neoliberals which has always been strange especially when the somewhat founder of neoliberalism kinda i know adam smith fredrich heyek was influenced by darwins natural selection it really doesnt make sense why such extremely religious people like ronald regan were so into neoliberalism it totally makes sense for them to be into protectionism though
canada,not_removed,you realize coyne is a conservative right
canada,not_removed,if it will survive it needs to become the ideology of the welfare state except that progressives are the ones championing the welfare state progressives are the ones championing public healthcare and a basic income solution to the automation of jobs progressives are the ones championing free higher education paying to retrain laid off workers and imposing higher taxes on the wealthy the nationalist movement is less mature nationalism is new well til
canada,not_removed,who you callin you people
canada,not_removed,what values are you talking about our national film board that was essentially in charge of canadian propaganda always tried to install left wing values onto the country and canadian conservatives were always pro aristocracymonarchy classical conservatives why does it always feel like when people use buzz terms like canadian values theyre always using it in a american republican like manner by people who have a warped version of canadian history our conservatives have never been like donald trump thats what coyne a prominent canadian conservative is highlighting if you believe the values of trump match that of canada you are simply wrong trump like conservatism is also very new too america republicans were the party way back of anti slavery and racial rights not democrats
canada,not_removed,this hypocrisy goes back decades pierre trudeau who pioneered this idea of canadian nonidentity went so far as to coauthor a book titled the canadian way
canada,not_removed,racial tolerance and democracy are desirable for reasons that dont hinge on their canadianness imo to imply that theyre canadian is uncomfortably close to implying that theyre uniquely canadian and obviously thats wrong too
canada,not_removed,im not conservative but hes my favourite canadian writer forsure
canada,not_removed,you are correct the conservatism that most people are used too these days is called neoconservative and wad orrgionally made up of disenfranchised liberals
canada,not_removed,i know adam smith i never understood why so many free market capitalists worshipped adam smith when smith himself said that he hated free market capitalism because business owners were just constantly trying to figure out new ways to screw over the average consumer he just thought it existed whether you liked it or not and you should be aware of it
canada,not_removed,if you dont like peoples freedom to choose maybe youd be more comfortable in china
canada,not_removed,except that progressives are the ones championing the welfare state progressives are the ones championing public healthcare and a basic income solution to the automation of jobs progressives are the ones championing free higher education paying to retrain laid off workers and imposing higher taxes on the wealthy and those cultural lefties are the useful idiots progressivism is just neoliberalism in a clothes open borders free trade an other similar policies require the dismantling of the welfare state nationalism is new well til the current nationalist movement is new and born of the emerging social conditions with good luck it is just in its infancy and will emerge as a more coherent doctrine as the next generation emerges
canada,not_removed,people who fit the description i gave heres the hat if it fits put it on
canada,not_removed,gallant attempt to defend a lost cause i salute you racial tolerance and democracy are desirable for reasons that dont hinge on their canadianness desirable based on what nothing is desirable on its own its desirability is evaluated based on the evaluators you guessed it values for example some religious people believe democracy is wrong because gods law takes predominance over mans law therefore to subject gods law to the popular will is undesirable and a sign of arrogance racial tolerance wouldnt be considered desirable by racial nationalists either whether they be white like richard spencer or black like early malcolm x imo to imply that theyre canadian is uncomfortably close to implying that theyre uniquely canadian and obviously thats wrong too i think thats a strawman no one ever said or implied that any canadian value must necessarily be uniquely canadian especially since canada is largely derived from british culture and values except for québec hell canadas queen isnt even unique to canada its shared with the uk and a few other former british colonies
canada,not_removed,if youre right im not sure either do you have reading material to back that statement id love to read about it more
canada,not_removed,is exactly what i said to anyone protesting the idea of joining the cpc right now specifically to ensure it is a centreright party that is not run by a xenophobic asshole
canada,not_removed,and those cultural lefties are the useful idiots progressivism is just neoliberalism in a clothes open borders free trade an other similar policies require the dismantling of the welfare state im not going to respond to the idiots comment because i dont think engaging in name calling is useful if you want to be treated with respect treat others with respect now is there a single liberal or ndp mp or mpp whos actually proposed open borders oh and please be intellectually honest enough to not conflate open borders with free trade or immigration theyre not even close to the same thing and no free trade doesnt necessitate the dismantling of our welfare state where do you folks come up with this stuff weve had nafta for years now and we still have a social safety net public healthcare and ample social spending the current nationalist movement is new and born of the emerging social conditions the policies and substance of the current nationalist movement is the same old dog shit of the and early just reheated and served on a new plate chow down if you wish but be aware that what youre eating isnt remotely fresh
canada,not_removed,wearing a hat when the ambient temperature is is not the canadian way
canada,not_removed,desirable based on what nothing is desirable on its own its desirability is evaluated based on the evaluators you guessed it values well certainly but this has nothing to do with whether canadian values in particular is a useful concept
canada,not_removed,so you ask who said anything about open borders then immediately put a bunch of topics related to that as off limits or youre an idiot typical
canada,not_removed,if the values dominant in canadian society mean that these elements being desirable is the consensus then that makes these values also largely consensual hence canadian values
canada,not_removed,what off limits or youre an idiot i dont see anything in my post that could be characterized as such theres not an exclamation point in there open borders are not the same thing as immigration or free trade you cant lump them together because theyre different conversations
canada,not_removed,are you aware of any polling data that illuminates what those values are in precise enough terms and with a small enough margin of error that they can plausibly be used to form the basis of legislation is there evidence that they diverge strongly enough from averageuniversal human values that calling them canadian values isnt just empty sloganeering
canada,not_removed,are you aware of any polling data that illuminates what those values are in precise enough terms and with a small enough margin of error that they can plausibly be used to form the basis of legislation values are always the basis of legislation in all cases legislation aims to achieve an objective and this objective is viewed as desirable because of the values of the decisionmakers that being said i think this debate on canadian values just like the debate on britishness in the uk in recent years is still in its infancy because up to very recently canadian society was largely uniform culturally monolithical apart from the québecroc division looking at the census data yearold canadians born in canada second generation and more so born between and were not visible minorities declared either european origins or exclusively canadian ethnic origins including natives declared either french british or exclusively canadian ethnic origins who have a religious affiliation report a christian religious affiliation when canada was european and christian as was the case as late as the a debate on the countrys values would have been largely irrelevant canadians knew what their values were there was no need to define them everyone knew what they were now with the immigration of the past decades coming from a variety of cultures a debate is more needed to know exactly what values are to form the basis of the new canadian identity if one is to emerge for if it does not there may be a rise of many community identities and a fragmentation of canadian society the answer to the question of what are canadian values is now not as evident as it once was is there evidence that they diverge strongly enough from averageuniversal human values that calling them canadian values isnt just empty sloganeering there is no such thing as universal human value values are inherently cultural and being a human is not cultural its biological
canada,not_removed,the answer to the question of what are canadian values is now not as evident as it once was then i hope were on the same page re the futility of testing for them values are inherently cultural and being a human is not cultural its biological ok let me rephrase is there evidence that canadian values diverge strongly enough from values found in every culture that calling them canadian values isnt just empty sloganeering
canada,not_removed,ok let me rephrase is there evidence that canadian values diverge strongly enough from values found in every culture that calling them canadian values isnt just empty sloganeering lets look at the most controversial type of immigration today muslim immigration want the law of the land to be sharia law and not secular law do most canadians want religious law to replace secular law varies by country do canadians think adulterers should be stoned to death do canadians support the death penalty for apostasy do you know how many muslim countries allow a muslim woman to marry a nonmuslim i think turkey and tunisia are pretty much alone in allowing it what about female genital mutilation what about blasphemy laws in this case you can see differences even between america which clearly takes a stand for freedom of expression and many european countries for instance a dane has recently been prosecuted under blasphemy laws for burning a quran though modernization is converging a lot of cultures cultures still have different values you have to stick your head in the sand not to see it
canada,not_removed,do most canadians want religious law to replace secular law do canadians think adulterers should be stoned to death do canadians support the death penalty for apostasy i dont know do you have polls on that too so we can compare i live in rural ontario and these people are vicious so it wouldnt surprise me
canada,not_removed,got to admit impressed that this poor soul at least admitted that the family didnt do anything wrong and that he brought this onto himself hope he finds peace and new life after this accident crimefree
canada,not_removed,so uh an american here is it normal for thieves to brandish machetes and what looks to be a sabre only to be resisted by acid a metal pipe i think and a handgun that isnt actually used i fence so the sabre really caught my attention at least i think its a sabre
canada,not_removed,the article states the criminals name as richardson francois but it would make more sense if his name was françois richardson no
canada,not_removed,sheer luck that the store owners were not killed by the armed bandits extremely dim to wrestle with an armed man at such close range the outcome is usually death for one of the involved parties canada needs concealed carry laws
canada,not_removed,dat thug life yo
canada,not_removed,the hand gun was brought by the robbers but one was disarmed by store keeper and no this isnt normal hence it making the news
canada,not_removed,i think if i had to make up a character name id go with françois first maybe his parents just liked the sound of the reverse
canada,not_removed,no it wont the perps now get a lifelong bachelor apartment dont have to worry about utilities rent increases and have high speed cable internet for free being a criminal in canada is a highly lucrative lifestyle
canada,not_removed,no we fucking dont
canada,not_removed,close range is the best way to wrestle with anyone
canada,not_removed,i know how you feel i also all about tough on crime i guess i am a bit gullible still to believe in the good if people even those beyond repair
canada,not_removed,i mean françois is a pretty common first name ive seen it as a last name but much less often richardson on the other hand never seen it as a first name
canada,not_removed,there are no sound arguments against concealed carry for citizens
canada,not_removed,yes especially someone with a loaded weapon or knife the shared intimacy makes it special
canada,not_removed,losing a bit of vision for a lifetime of subsidized food heat and internet sounds like a pretty damn good deal to me
canada,not_removed,yes there are namely i dont want people walking around with loaded guns
canada,not_removed,yeah jail is great fun
canada,not_removed,then the logical thing for you to do is to commit a crime well wait
canada,not_removed,thenhttpfreeprisonvacationcom this offer wont last long so act now
canada,not_removed,triggered there bud
canada,not_removed,but people namely criminals already carry around loaded weapons and these people are from the rough parts of society theyre more volatile irascible and will kill you with little hesitation id feel much better being responsible for my own personal safety than counting on chance and probability
canada,not_removed,weve already got criminals who do that why not let law abiding citizens protect themselves
canada,not_removed,i mean they took away the liquor and badminton kind of sucks but its still better than paying for rent for a in toronto
canada,not_removed,no im just not a fucking idiot who thinks ill be able to draw my concealed weapon and fire before someone who has a gun out and in my face already go move to the states if you want to walk around with a loaded gun you yokel
canada,not_removed,and when they rob your house and steal the gun when you arent home another criminal has an easily concealed gun to commit crimes criminals acquire guns most often through theft from legitimate gun owners increasing the number of guns that are concealable so that feel much better being responsible for my own personal safety in fact increases the danger to all of us and reduces my ability to feel safe in canada it is effectively illegal to use a gun or any other weapon for self defense concealed or not
canada,not_removed,because canada isnt a world country where everyone walking around has a gun your argument is more guns less crime yet every fucking statistic from every country ever says less guns less crime
canada,not_removed,thats not so bad at all im paying for a small room like square feet in hamilton that seems like a strong deal for a whole apartment to yourself
canada,not_removed,america isnt a third world country though it tries its best to make it so in some areas also the reptillians must not have gotten to this because it doesnt show what youre saying
canada,not_removed,that statistic is meaningless you could chart that same fall against the introduction of unleaded gasoline and it would be a better fit
canada,not_removed,pretty sure people have noticed its not like the toronto star is breaking news here it would be a huge improvement in our media discourse if theyd quit writing hyperbolic headlines
canada,not_removed,at least trudeau could have asked about the or the massive just for example
canada,not_removed,it seems they were hoping that trudeau would publicly spank the president of mexico or something
canada,not_removed,no physical contact since elbowgate but we do seem to be condemning things a lot lately
canada,not_removed,i dont think rescinding the safe third country agreement would be the smartest thing to do i understand the concern that the canadian government is going to be taking in less refugees but i agree with the move
canada,not_removed,i sent a letter asking them not to accept more refugees and instead use tax payer dollars to enrich the lives of tax payers they can start a go fund me campaign and then use that to bring in refugees but sorry not with my money no thanks
canada,not_removed,this is clearly the ndp campaigning go on the official government of canada site and the mp directory is there
canada,not_removed,thanks for this tool ive been writing up a personal letter this should help ive gotten some others on board too the us vetting process is only going to get more extreme it makes absolutely no sense to tie our admissions of refugees and asylumseekers with the flawed democracy in the south
canada,not_removed,no but i will write them to ask to reduce the number of refugees stop the massimportation of incompatible ideologies and stand by our neighbours president thanks for the reminder
canada,not_removed,but those are canadians lefties only care about refugees and migrants
canada,not_removed,or we could do some of both
canada,not_removed,these things are not mutually exclusive how about we do both how about we also cut the subsidies to oil corporations to help pay for it
canada,not_removed,yup we can take action in opposition to their backwards discriminatory policies
canada,not_removed,why would you stand by trump hes anti canadian and anti humanity surely as an east vancouver mom you want your wast vancouver children raised in a world where women and brown people arent discriminated against by their president
canada,not_removed,these things are mutually exclusive as funds are a finite resource
canada,not_removed,in this budget climate they kinda are mutually exclusive it would be one thing if gdp was increasing and unemployment was low neither of those things are true because were in a recession you want to cut subsidies to the oil corporations fine do that and see how beloved youll be when gas is
canada,not_removed,its about choices and we certainly can choose to prioritize both of these things whilst cutting subsidies to giant polluting oil corporations not mutually exclusive
canada,not_removed,then we do less of both
canada,not_removed,i think those subsidies mostly go to the immense profits of these giant corporations whereas supply and demand are more important factors in the price of gas if we turn those subsidies towards renewables that should lower the cost even more
canada,not_removed,ya that isnt a good idea actions taken with no knowledge of the consequence
canada,not_removed,well wed better ban immigration without knowledge of consequences then eh
canada,not_removed,sign of a weak position shown the need to jump to far exaggeration of my position better even yet turned refugees into immigrants
canada,not_removed,you of course realize im basically quoting you
canada,not_removed,no youre not
canada,not_removed,you know this stuff is in writing right
canada,not_removed,write exactly what you are supposedly quoting
canada,not_removed,im gonna assume your reading comprehension kicked in
canada,not_removed,of course each media source has a bias that is why we should read alternate sources however comparing the reporting biases of rt and sputnik news to cbc or bbc and suggesting the bias is to the same degree is ludicrous
canada,not_removed,cbc fake racist news election night special
canada,not_removed,from the article highlighting russias propaganda system to a canadian audience without mentioning the one at home indicates either a journalists ignorance or that she is part of it in todays information age its probably best to think of all news media as biased and or fake if it is profitable to publish a lie with no consequence and profit then why not the bias canadian media has for mining is not applied to oilsands open pit mining take a guess which has tailings ponds that are more toxic to the environment defund cbc
canada,not_removed,cbc online is completely biased very much just as fake as anything from rt
canada,not_removed,how would defunding the cbc work towards solving the authors problem when all that will do is secure corporate control of the news and therefore the profit model that promotes misinformation for ratings the news was never supposed to make money it was supposed to be something that the corporations gave us as a public service
canada,not_removed,cbc is the least biased news you will find in canada bias comes from advertising dollars not because people hate how you think
canada,not_removed,traditional news media is a dinosaur many billions subsidize all the major networks in canada defunding the cbc allows the government to cut subsidies for the others who complain that the cbc has an unfair advantage of being government funded and thus themselves receive subsidies to compete with the government subsidized cbc end the subsidies and the market will correct itself eventually and hopefully they all go broke but it wont happen because the canadian pension plan is heavily invested in the ultra subsidized bellglobe media wtf are they called now i dont watch television follow the money
canada,not_removed,cbc is the least biased news you will find in canada that isnt saying much even if true source us election night
canada,not_removed,the lack of money in news combined with it being in a profit model is exactly the problem its going to lead to further centralization of news unfortunately but will that be trusted by people like the author certainly not everyone wants to get their updates from alex jones and the like and part of the reason why there is so much outrage on social media platforms is to feed the profit model involving these nonmsm sources so corporations and the government have quite the conundrum on their hands how do they rebuild trust while maintaining an unworkable profit model and if they ditch the profit model how can the result likely statesponsorship be trusted i would suspect that they would like the profit model continue and run various counterintelligence efforts to keep noncompliant alternate sources and social media under wraps but as a conservative i long for plain ol boring news
canada,not_removed,those were personal emotions of the employees and besides canada is fairly left compared to the us
canada,not_removed,what happened on election night
canada,not_removed,was that the first time youve seen a panel on tv did it make cnn biased because they paid trump surrogates like trumps former campaign manager to show up and say ridiculous things on air no theyre just providing a forum for people with different opinions to express their views
canada,not_removed,fake news wouldnt tick me off near as much if there was no taxpayer monies funding it directly if govca wants to spread propaganda through traditional news media thats they way it goes but if it is something like the canola council trying to tell me butter is worse than margarine something needs to change trust in news has been lost permanently
canada,not_removed,if the motivation to defund is to gain trust fine if the motivation is to further build the profit model which is currently built on distrust then thats not fine is it
canada,not_removed,quite simple to avoid bell rogers or the rebel and their nonsense no eyeballs no ads no revenue no more fake news the cbc gets their funding straight out of my pocket
canada,not_removed,too simplistic obviously the issue of fake news and the profit motive goes beyond this
canada,not_removed,lexin resources formerly mfc resource partnership formerly compton petroleum get the picture find out who profited and make them pay screw the limited liability loophole find out who else has owned these deadly wells claims of a ponzi scheme have merit been working in southern alberta oil and gas for almost years some wells get passed around more than a high school chick at a rainbow party follow the money
canada,not_removed,a carbon energy industry externalizing costs and thus distorting the price of oil while damaging the environment how rare im sure deregulation would totally solve this do i really have to point out this is sarcasm
canada,not_removed,an environmental crisis like that sounds like jail time and leins are more appropriate than asking for cleanup fees companies need to be held accountable or else the whole system breaks down
canada,not_removed,fill the wells with the bodies of those who profited from them
canada,not_removed,i think were past the point of we told you so
canada,not_removed,basically alberta is now liable for an amount that is more than the entire royalties the oil gas industry has paid the province over the past years all of this because alberta has consistently refused to nationalize its resources
canada,not_removed,utexasnorth what do you think of these responsible oil companies leaving their messes for the government to clean up you want less regulations and government meddling to allow more of this to happen those damn liberal commie socialists want to stop this stuff from happening with their damned anti business policies
canada,not_removed,saddly this is what happens when recessions hit no one wants to pay to have people take care of anything just leads to more of a problem it would be nice if oil picked back up and business was booming just to get everything repaired and cleaned and ready for reclaimation its likely that all of these cleanups that could have been the companies bill will instead become the taxpayers
canada,not_removed,its pretty simple if costs are externalized then the prices paid are subsidized all aspects of modern society have operated this way for decades without a second thought welcome to the snapback
canada,not_removed,cant believe someone here is paying attention and noticed thats what they do have an up vote
canada,not_removed,could you explain what you mean by wells getting passed around
canada,not_removed,did your uprofessorbambam account get banned or something
canada,not_removed,he wont answer you because with his world view the right answer doesnt jive with his beliefs
canada,not_removed,in theory but why waste money doing what youre supposed to and not being reprehencibly irresponsible when you could spend that money expanding your business or better yet padding the bonuses of executives when companies arent held responsible or are given token gestures of repremand you really do get the world foolish anarcho capitalists get all misty eyed about
canada,not_removed,if oil picked up the dead and empty wells would still be owned by shell companies that go bankrupt and claim they cannot do a cleanup
canada,not_removed,junior oilfield exploration companies go bankrupt all the time shareholders take all the profit while doing everything possible to minimize tax liability like selling old wells at a loss sometimes even sell the wells back to themselves under a new corporate entity then first company bankrupts themselves and then they dissolve and are now completely off the hook rinse and repeat company now has an unprofitable well they go bankrupt and now taxpayers are on the hook for clean up and remediation company is long gone and no way to make them pay for it a well can produce many millions of dollars over their lifetime but if the company is a limited liability corporation and goes bankrupt after paying out millions in profits to shareholders that money is untouchable even if criminal fraud is commited by management no one is ever made to pay another way is if encana were drilling for natural gas in an area but the well produces fluids that cant be processed by the nearby plant they will sell the well to someone who has wells and proper processing facilities in the area there are over wells in alberta and around trillion dollars pumped from out of the ground and no money for clean up
canada,not_removed,i know its way easier to make wild generalizations and outlandish rhetoric than it is to have a meaningful discussion based on fact and reality trump is finding out that first hand way easier to criticize than make good policy that actually works
canada,not_removed,dont forget the poor shareholders they need to see a good quarterly profit so they can flip their stocks
canada,not_removed,yea true that like you said its in theory when theres no more of a reason to go out to the site though these are the kinds of things that happen
canada,not_removed,funny how people in alberta got money from the government when these wells were pumping out that trillion dollars but now those people have to pay back more in taxes to clean up this mess
canada,not_removed,thank you so much for posting this
canada,not_removed,awesome thanks man for the insight
canada,not_removed,its rare when the general populace puts a party in that promises only blood toil tears and sweat
canada,not_removed,in alberta where weve had a carbon tax since january have literally not noticed it at all
canada,not_removed,the correct answer to the op question as amply demonstrated by the reaponse of both ministers is we dont care how much it costs
canada,not_removed,less than the cost of doing nothing the cpc better get the fuck on board with addressing climate change or suffer the consequences
canada,not_removed,way less than it will cost our kids to deal with the damage of climate change
canada,not_removed,its interesting to compare walls response to pallisters theyre both conservative the one in saskatchewan got mad and screamed the other calmly stated that manitoba will address the issue itself the latter is pretty much like the bc conservative er liberal government who had no problems putting the tax in years ago and their economy is thriving the truth is something like the issue is nonpartisan they all want the tax or a version of it they all realize that the issue is valid as do the voters and its inevitable the different takes on it have been attempts to parlay initial voter concern into political points longterm im looking forward to the clean energy crisis being solved once and for all
canada,not_removed,i think its important that we set the bar fairly high in terms of cutting down carbon emissions a carbon tax is pretty much the best way to do that i really hope they go through with this plan
canada,not_removed,the last time oil was under bucks gasoline was wake the fuck up
canada,not_removed,lol and what are the consequences hes taxing air and cant balance a budget have you seen any benefit from the carbon tax cash grab or are you just virtue signalling you think this country is going to stand a chance when trump lowers the business tax to and ours is way higher and also has a carbon tax slapped on to it you think china india brazil us and middle east all give a shit about carbon emissions we are such an irrelevant nonfactor in all of this it literally makes zero difference what we do i cant believe you guys fall for this shit
canada,not_removed,there are a million supposed impending disasters why should we focus on climate change and deprive resources from focussing on astroid defense
canada,not_removed,based on what australia spent billion to reduce greenhouse gasses of to which is unclear how much of that was attributed to the carbon tax considering that it was already falling prior
canada,not_removed,well how sweet ive got a better ideawhy dont you cut down on your emissions and leave the rest of us out of it the carbon tax is idiotic the two biggest emitters are the usa and china neither is crippling their economy with moronic taxes meanwhile canada is in competition with these twoand shooting ourselves in the foot with a carbon tax is not the way to keep up to top it all off we are responsible foer a gigantic of ghg emissions even if we managed to cut emissions by impossible our reduction would not be close to the margin of error in any study of ghg emissions this tax is insane
canada,not_removed,how does it lower our carbon emissions
canada,not_removed,the best way would be to subsidize green energies on a micro scale give huge tax intensives for people to install solar or wind on their own homes and not need to be saddled to the grid taxation is rarely the answer
canada,not_removed,you fail to see the bigger picture ultimately carbon tax or not it doesnt matter the coal industry is on its death bed the cost of solar wind is plunging the cost of evs is steadily declining this carbon tax will indeed be an efficient way to reduce carbon emissions in canada but even if it fails to get implemented it wont matter the world will evolve with or without it
canada,not_removed,have you seen any benefit from the carbon tax cash grab weve had a nice income tax cut here in bc and have had the most economic growth in canada for the past several years perhaps the carbon tax isnt the boogey man you think it is
canada,not_removed,neither is crippling their economy with moronic taxes please provide proof a carbon tax will cripple the economy bc has a carbon tax and has the strongest provincial economy in canada
canada,not_removed,price signals libertarian free marketers would be proud if only theyd thought of the idea first
canada,not_removed,truth be told it wont be necessary the cost of solar panels wind turbines and evs has been steadily declining for years and will continue to decline theyre market disruptions like cell phones or the automobile itself never underestimate market disruptions well all have electric cars and solar panels on our roofs before we know it
canada,not_removed,the carbon tax in bc did nothing to lower emissions the smog in vancouver is as bad as ever or worse
canada,not_removed,lol no ones choosing to go to bc because of the income tax cut thousands of asian millionaires probably helping your economic growth more than a carbon tax foreign money tax cut
canada,not_removed,if it wont be necessary then why the tax lets cut people a break and give them a reason to go green not punish them
canada,not_removed,fake news vancouver isnt toronto and didnt doesnt have a smog program
canada,not_removed,no they choose to come here for our amazing climate and beautiful scenery you asked what the benefits are i personally pay less income tax because we have a carbon tax its quite simple really
canada,not_removed,i dont have to uchucksmall made the claim that a carbon tax will cripple the economy i just provided an example of an economy that has a carbon tax that is not crippled its on youhim to provide an example to prove the claim that a carbon tax will cripple the economy
canada,not_removed,i wont affect people itll affect large businesses that release massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere all it really does is force them to invest into less polluting equipment so they dont have to pay as much taxes its a tax on corporations not people
canada,not_removed,ever been to cypress park you might have seen this
canada,not_removed,bc carbon tax did nothing to help the smog problem in vancouver
canada,not_removed,you are naive the costs as always will be passed on to the consumer thats why you see a carbon levy on your energy bill
canada,not_removed,smog problem in vancouver now this is actually fake news
canada,not_removed,i pay a month for electricity joys of tiny appartment and i take public transit everywhere no i dont see it on my energy bill and if it goes up to a month what difference does it make in my life
canada,not_removed,nope ever been to cypress park you might have seen this sign
canada,not_removed,glad you represent everyone but you dont understand the trickle down groceries especially produce will go up as transportation fuel costs go up as well as op costs to green houses and growers that will be passed along your bus runs on diesel pretty soon your ticket price will go up it may not have the largest impact on you but you will still be affected by it
canada,not_removed,my city plans to replace and a carbon tax would speed up the adoption rate of these new technologies heck theyre even selling
canada,not_removed,you realize nearly of the carbon impact of a vehicle is in the manufacturing right and the mining for the heavy metals needed for the batteries sweet plan
canada,not_removed,check out the neodymium mine in china ecological disaster produces of world supply green energy has dirty secrets
canada,not_removed,i used to work on a reality tv show called highway thru hell it was about a tow truck company based out of hope bc that would work the coquihalla and tow out rigs that got wrecked i had access to all the raw footage so it was amusing to watch how some of the cast members would often forget that cameras were always rolling and theyd casually revel in their racist tendencies there was also an rcmp officer who was super unprofessional and most of his footage ended up being unusable a trucker had died in a wreck and they had found womens clothing and sex toys in the cab of the truck implying the dead driver was at the very least a crossdresser and rcmp brodude couldnt stop joking about it
canada,not_removed,did anyone else notice the face
canada,not_removed,i dont understand this why would people want to watch a video of driving down a highway even though its beautiful thats something you can easily do yourself i really dont get it
canada,not_removed,watch out for cops this weekend i got a ticket yesterday
canada,not_removed,is like my second favourite chixdiggit song
canada,not_removed,beautiful in the summer horrible in the winter either way nice highway
canada,not_removed,headed the other way back home today
canada,not_removed,if youre heading north just past the former toll booth theres a couple sizeable stands of trees in the median cops love to hide in them
canada,not_removed,i was there last week fun to drive amazing view plus occasional adrenaline rush
canada,not_removed,im so glad i found this i spent my sunday watching your you tube videos reliving past road trips in canada thanks they bought back fabulous memories if ever you get the chance you should drive the beartooth highway in montana
canada,not_removed,lol i watched a few episods of that it is interesting to find out what happens behind the scenes on these types of shows
canada,not_removed,i would love to see you do an ama about your time working on that show
canada,not_removed,yes i was going to ask whats with the eyeballs floating in the sky
canada,not_removed,sadly i live in mb so i actually cant drive the coquihalla myself
canada,not_removed,because were too far away to drive there ourselves
canada,not_removed,i am on the coq right now watching this video its great passenger seat dont worry
canada,not_removed,the coquihallas a bloody boring highway to drive anyhow the fraser canyon highway is way more scenic
canada,not_removed,the highways in ontario are not nearly as interesting plus not everyone has a car
canada,not_removed,yeah i feel the same way i literally just drove it yesterday its nice its not that nice though
canada,not_removed,isnt the speed limit now kmh i always found that a comfortable sped for that road
canada,not_removed,just ask me on here lol i doubt my experience deserves a separate thread of its own i only worked on the first season so my memory is a bit foggy the production company was based in vancouver and i worked on the shows postproduction so i was never in the field or on set for any shooting they also had other realitydocu shows like confessions animal hoarding and untold stories of the er which i also worked on
canada,not_removed,why not just look out the window
canada,not_removed,ha you havent been driving through much of the country have you the coq is a far better drive than of canadian roads and of the other are also in bc
canada,not_removed,fair enough different strokes tried watching the tokyo video and still found it boring af but maybe thats just because ive spent so much time behind the wheel in different places
canada,not_removed,i heard that highway between sault ste marie and thunder bay is a pretty scenic drive though but yeah i just realized that of our highways only pass by farms cities and trees
canada,not_removed,thats because youre spoiled by all the beautiful roads in bc for anyone not familiar with bc highways its an incredible drive
canada,not_removed,is pretty comfortable
canada,not_removed,even southbound past othello because me thinks they dropped the ball there
canada,not_removed,that was probably from one of the many crashes main issue in the summer is overheating during the hot days
canada,not_removed,one thing i like about highway thru hell is it doesnt seem to have all the fake madeup drama other reality shows do from your experience does that seem to be the case or is there actually a lot of stuff that is made up just for the show
canada,not_removed,doing both at the same time is hilarious
canada,not_removed,only eagles
canada,not_removed,one of the most beautiful roads ive ever driven
canada,not_removed,you could be right especially in northern bc
canada,not_removed,ive seen so many cars break down on that highway i prefer the tunnels om the but coq is a lot faster and still nicd
canada,not_removed,that was probably from one of the many crashes yep thats bc alright
canada,not_removed,it was pretty authentic you cant exactly stage a wreck and shut down the highway especially during winter when road conditions are atrocious and accidents are bound to happen anyway it was very much just a tow truck crew doing their thing and a camera crew getting it on film but its still reality tv and they still have to craft a storyline for each episode the producers might prompt the cast to say things in a certain way in order to set up a storyline if jamie says something about brandon being young and inexperienced which was true and unsure if he can handle working big wrecks then the cameras are naturally going to focus more on getting footage of brandon so if brandon wasnt aware of jamies doubts before he is now and thatll influence his words and actions so the situations and storylines are organic but theyre always trying to weave in a more dramatic element to fit the narrative the cast wasnt being paid to be on the show but i bet jamie was more than happy with all the publicity hes received for him and his business
canada,not_removed,totally
canada,not_removed,i think the old fraser canyon route is even more beautiful
canada,not_removed,im more of an kind of person it only costs an extra to dollars extra in fuel even with the extra distance and fuel to get between vancouver and edmonton although id argue its much easier on your vehicle so that extra fuel is a wash anyway
canada,not_removed,thats how i figured the show works thanks for the answer
canada,not_removed,also distracts me from the searing ear pain i have been hiking above ft this week drove from field this morning and now doing the big descent into hope my ears are not happy
canada,not_removed,never done it before may have to add it to the list
canada,not_removed,it was way overdue we will save so much money through this compassionate program its one of those rare winwin situations where both patient and the system wins
canada,not_removed,thats not a crazy rate of return across industries thats what many companies aim for
canada,not_removed,that report looks like it was written by some second year biz school team from uwo whos kids got paid to write stuff that we can easily find out from wiki or other sources
canada,not_removed,well we can safely guess from this production value is not one of those values
canada,not_removed,full video edit youtube
canada,not_removed,shes for real like im starting to wonder if this is a long form minutes skit
canada,not_removed,for someone who has been in the game as long as she as im shocked she has no idea how to hire a proper video editor or speak in an interview she was a minister for gods sake
canada,not_removed,stand up sit down stand up sit down stand up sit down
canada,not_removed,i kind of want this video reedited with buffering displayed on her somewhere during her awkward pauses or timeout reached just as she finishes her pause and awkward face
canada,not_removed,totallynotarobot
canada,not_removed,i think it is an uplifting story that she was able to learn to talk again after that horrific head injury wait this is her normal come on you guys you elected a robot last time have some sense
canada,not_removed,her voice is so annoying ugh
canada,not_removed,its a canadian value to tell dog whistle rascists like kellie leitch to get fucked
canada,not_removed,oxygen thief
canada,not_removed,as a liberal i pray that leitch becomes leader of the conservative party
canada,not_removed,im pretty sure the camera is just floating freely and shes being forced to chase after it
canada,not_removed,well she comes across as a dingbat but shes right of canadians would support the common sense values rhetoric she describes but we already have superior vetting so im not sure if shes delivering anything but rhetoric heck she didnt even give a number
canada,not_removed,this kellie take off by tvs minutes still rofls me every time
canada,not_removed,lol canadian values you guys ever notice the people who make this an important part of their belief system always come from the parts of canada that arent that important keep reaching guys canadian values are found in places like toronto edit also kinda tired of people from places where no immigrants move to presuming to know more than i do about immigration im from toronto you people should be listening to me on this issue not the other way around the fuck does a person who has never walked into a chinese restaurant in their life gonna tell me about immigration edit you see the problem with these places is that they dont send us their best politicians they send us their kellie leitch and brad tost theyre racists and some i assume are good people
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,that was a fine video with normal paced speech portraying a reasonable logical policy with clear explanations and call to action i dont see an issue
canada,not_removed,obviously she was never a drama teacher
canada,not_removed,so lets make a big deal out of it to make sure she gets lots of exposure someone badly needs to explain the dont feed the trolls rule to the msm in this country
canada,not_removed,the progressives are being progressivehilarious from the bit i saw leitch says nothing outrageous the production values are what are being criticized of course if the cbc and hp scream loudly enough about the criticism of leitchs video the mass of the people who wont actually get by the headlines will assume she has proposed setting up extermination camps for muslim refugeesor roughly the equivalent and they will act accordingly making leitch a pariah this is just part of the ongoing campaign of the msm to smear anyone not on the left and no i am not a leitch supporter i think she has negative charisma and is unelectable but that is besides the point
canada,not_removed,cringe level tom cruise scientology video level of cringe
canada,not_removed,thanks for putting the real source holy that was insanely painful to watch i couldnt make it through the video it was waaay too cringey shes a terrible speaker
canada,not_removed,values such as hard work generosity freedom and tolerance you could say that about literally every country on earth
canada,not_removed,downvote for the bookface link
canada,not_removed,a lot of people think that about the leitch campaign when she drops out shell reveal shes actually mark critch in drag
canada,not_removed,shes cheap they werent about to spend money on production
canada,not_removed,i agree yikes all that weird zooming in was really distracting and definitely took away from what she was trying to say
canada,not_removed,rtotallynotrobots
canada,not_removed,first time ive heard her speak that was brutal
canada,not_removed,like a female kermit the frog
canada,not_removed,dog whistle rascists like kellie leitch i think shes piping her racism straight through a vuvuzela
canada,not_removed,honestly i dont even know what the fuck shes talking about what are these values she keeps referring too im a born and bred white canadian and i can guarantee you i do not share the same values as kellie leitch who the hell does she think shes speaking for and more importantly what the fuck is she rambling on about i have no idea what the point of that video was
canada,not_removed,hold up dont assume all of us in rural canada share in this belief system some of us arent even ascared of wind turbines edit cant even not spell right proper
canada,not_removed,so rural canadians arent important
canada,not_removed,i was born and raised in toronto and i think we should drastically cut immigration
canada,not_removed,true canadain values are found in places like pond inlet and sachs harbour
canada,not_removed,im from toronto no kidding
canada,not_removed,irony dripping here most small towns that you are seemingly bashing not only have chinese restaurants but also many immigrant doctors and lawyers there is a world north of steeles you know just because public transit wont take you there doesnt mean its not viable
canada,not_removed,you guys ever notice the people who make this an important part of their belief system always come from the parts of canada that arent that important canadian values are found in places like toronto im from toronto of course
canada,not_removed,im from toronto everybody should shut up and listen to me on this issue
canada,not_removed,canadian values are found in places like toronto hold up toronto is full of some of the most vile people in our country canadian values are found in places like the little town of in the middle of the prairies or in the maritimes where everyone shares the struggle unless making stupid money and complaining about traffic is a canadian value i think youre a bit off the mark by placing toronto on the important pedestal
canada,not_removed,canadian values are found in places like toronto real canadians left toronto a long time ago
canada,not_removed,toronto is not canada its just an international bus stop with no culture or character canadian culture and values are found outside of toronto the reason why foreigners think canada is boring is because they usually only see toronto
canada,not_removed,yes but so is the order screen at mcdonalds why should i prefer one robot over the other
canada,not_removed,brilliant hard working and accomplished lizardperson credit where credit is due
canada,not_removed,im not convinced she was ever human
canada,not_removed,also
canada,not_removed,i watched it at speed and her pace became almost normal
canada,not_removed,its like putting hard worker on a resume and expecting it to stand out
canada,not_removed,freedom and toleranceevery country on earth ya about that map of the million slaves alive today here is a map of everywhere its punishable to be gay i think we might have different definitions of freedom maybe i should include some maps of where you can criticize the dominant religion without persecution or where women are allowed to work
canada,not_removed,north korea
canada,not_removed,fixed
canada,not_removed,lets dispel with this notion that justin trudeau doesnt know what hes doing he knows exactly what hes doing
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,i think shes got a list or something but she fails to address the nitty gritty detail the number of migrants she wants in per year without that her posturing is meaningless
canada,not_removed,actually a ton of wind turbines are in what might be canadas most conservative region mormon country in southwest alberta you can see turbines from the temple in cardston then again mormons are capitalists and not afraid of economic progress
canada,not_removed,i dont assume that all of rural canada is like this my parents live in rural canada micheal chong is from rural canada rural canada however because its so isolated is the only place where someone like kellie leitch rises to power
canada,not_removed,their votes are worth quite a bit more than urban dwellers so their fears shouldnt be discounted and can be exploited especially if you have a smart political advisor at the helm of your campaign maybe maybe not in kellies case
canada,not_removed,it is important just not as important
canada,not_removed,thats is why i love toronto people like you have no political representation here edit except for maybe on the municipal levels with rob ford
canada,not_removed,oh please if you want to romanticize that life go read little house on the prairie so sick of people bashing toronto because we as a city dared to have more ambition than being overly dependent on a dying steel mill
canada,not_removed,all canadians are real canadians if you get to have your definition of real canadian ill come up with a rival one and make sure to exclude you get out you fake canadian you
canada,not_removed,yeah of course theres canadian culture outside of toronto as well theres vancouver montreal ottawa calgary edmonton all the major cities
canada,not_removed,was talking about my resume and they want keywords and then in the same sentence to not use keywords because everybody does it the keywords are obviously the main words used to describe or title the jobs you do while performing the duties required of you at work and being warehouse we dont get these nifty i did something special on job resumes
canada,not_removed,if you need to emphasize hard worker chances that you are not
canada,not_removed,at a basic level individual people tend to be the same in the way they relate toward each other they share with others in need theyre tolerant of differences and individual needs and want a level of freedom to live their lives as they wish i suspect the people of north korea despite the oppression and propaganda they face arent that much different from us in their needs and wants
canada,not_removed,i hear you but can we dispel with this notion that justin trudeau doesnt know what hes doing he knows exactly what hes doing
canada,not_removed,thats great to hear around here central ontario we still have a lot of people who believe in wind turbine syndrome as well as thinking somehow their kids are going to get sick from them ditto with complaints about solar farms
canada,not_removed,so youre effectively saying that your parents are responsible for leitchs rise to power since they live and vote in rural canada i dont think youre making the point you think youre making
canada,not_removed,its true but the majority of the electoral districts in canada are in the major population centers canada added electoral districts in the last election were in urban areas were in the gta the country is being taken over alright its being taken over by us demographic brute forcing
canada,not_removed,always come from the parts of canada that arent that important a mere minutes ago you said that theyre categorically not important
canada,not_removed,immigration is contributing to the housing crisis and i think certain enclaves like markham have gotten out of hand we could do with a bit of a slowdown and millions of people in the gta support it even immigrants i know support lowering the intake
canada,not_removed,if you want to romanticize that life go read little house on the prairie i live in that life im not romanticizing anything maybe you need to leave your city once in a while so sick of people from toronto thinking they know the first thing about the rest of the country despite never having left the perimeter your assumptions really make you seem inexperienced with our country
canada,not_removed,and being warehouse we dont get these nifty i did something special on job resumes disagree worked in a beer warehouse for a few years my resume has that listed and it mentions that i oversaw the organization of x in stock on a daily basis handled valuable stock safely and without incident and solved the problem of double or missing deliveries on several occasions just gotta know how to fancy up your writing
canada,not_removed,dont think freedom would be considered a north korean value
canada,not_removed,had to deal with the same turbine syndrome nonsense here in ns a few years back god what an annoying interruption to progress that is
canada,not_removed,no my parents vote for the correct people
canada,not_removed,not that important were the exact words if you want pedantic so i never actually said they were not important they have value just not as much as where i am from also i never explicitly mentioned rural canada in my op kellie leitch is from collingwood which is a small town
canada,not_removed,immigration has been quite constant for a while
canada,not_removed,yeah wrong on all fronts i actually remember markham before pacific mall was built empty land the housing crisis being caused by immigrants is ridiculous montreal has a high number of immigrants as well and theyre rents are half of what we have
canada,not_removed,now youre just projecting most of us in toronto dont think about other places outside the major cities we would never presume to tell you people how to live your lives have you ever heard of politician from toronto giving speeches in a prairie town about how to properly grow wheat so why do people like kellie leitch presume to know about what constitutes canadian values and lecture me about immigration
canada,not_removed,should toss logistics somewhere in there too
canada,not_removed,frankly thats useless information doing the exact same job for tims or for ibm and your price figure skyrockets as dollar amounts are directly related to the products themselves and not your capability hell the work i did yesterday was times more productive then todays but its valuation due to the product received is probably about of what i did today solving stock issues isnt worth anything except in regards to when you evolved your job into a new position id however at least rate it as information that is at least useful to a warehouse position
canada,not_removed,remember seeing ns come up a lot when i was forcing myself to pay attention to the antiwind people its still ongoing here antiwind groups throw every single thing they can out in the hopes any of it gains traction to stop projects doesnt help when the local government mpps pander to them and stall the projects
canada,not_removed,of course they do everyone else is dumb except you
canada,not_removed,there are many causes to the housing crisis and immigration is definitely one of them im not saying its the only cause but its a big contributor
canada,not_removed,im not projecting im describing exactly what youre doing why do you presume to know anything about canada when you havent even left your neighbourhood you keep bringing up leitch as a negative but you act like one of her supporters in holding true to the i havent experienced it but still know all about it attitude
canada,not_removed,logistics can mean anything taking a shit is a exercise in logistics
canada,not_removed,frankly thats useless information congratulations youve just taken the first step in learning how to craft an excellent resume
canada,not_removed,isnt that exactly what youre saying by insisting that all rural canadians vote for people like leitch
canada,not_removed,nah my parents are cool they voted for michael chong salt of the earth people
canada,not_removed,i havent experienced it but still know all about it attitude what know it all attitude this is about immigration not junior hockey someone from toronto a city that experiences more immigration than the rest of the country is going to know more about it than the average person from harrison ontario you dont need to leave toronto to know how immigration is affecting canada toronto is literally the epicenter of that this is like telling somebody from the maritimes to visit saskatchewan to learn about fishing
canada,not_removed,no try again
canada,not_removed,what know it all attitude the one that guided the following quotes from you you guys ever notice the people who make this an important part of their belief system always come from the parts of canada that arent that important or if you want to romanticize that life go read little house on the prairie or toronto is literally the epicenter of that or the big one im from toronto you people should be listening to me on this issue not the other way around i mean especially that last one other examples are more of just being a dick who thinks hes better than everyone else more so than thinking you know everything about everyone else though assuming yourself to be superior infers that you have knowledge about everyone else what about living in toronto makes you experienced with illegal border crossing coming into your tiny home town what about living in toronto automatically makes you the expert at how towns with one school will be able to handle more students what about living in toronto makes you know everything or even anything at all you essentially live in a bubble and have no experience outside of that bubble thinking yourself an expert on any subject is ridiculous
canada,not_removed,great way to foster discussion why bother clarifying when you can just be a dick right
canada,not_removed,there you are projecting again sad what gave you the idea that ive never been out of toronto i gave no indication that ive been here my entire life ive lived in three different places in the last years vancouver montreal and toronto toronto has never experienced things like crowded schools we took in refugees and immigrants from all over the world plus the anglo exodus from quebec in the many of those kids are just hitting adult hood now that i had no idea about border towns my rant was about people from places that experience little to no immigration presuming to tell me about the fake problem collingwood where kellie leitch is from is further from the border than toronto is
canada,not_removed,im sorry you want me to foster a discussion with a trollish asshole who claims that he knows about immigration because he goes to a chinese restaurant and calls the vast majority of canada irrelevant no thanks
canada,not_removed,i quote you you respond with an overused meme boy you sure got me beat
canada,not_removed,no i want you to foster discussion with me someone who asked you to clarify what you meant with a vague statement
canada,not_removed,your rcanada submission was removed rule editorializing
canada,not_removed,cool a couple of years ago when we were in buenos aires we saw a restaurant called quebec one of their specialties was poutine
canada,not_removed,better be cheese curds
canada,not_removed,what i would give to have a real colombian arepa again make sure you experience that before you leave
canada,not_removed,fuck bogota man i can never manage to get there fast enough to clear all the yellow cubes
canada,not_removed,now thats interesting you are currently in the hotbed of potato biodiversity in the andes right next door to equador bolivia where potatoes of every color texture flavour and shape can be found i am very curious to know what strain of potato they are deeming the most appropriate for our poutine perhaps youll ask around whatever it is that strain should be tried on canadian soil
canada,not_removed,back near the beginning of this century i was visiting a small town at the bottom of cambodia the guest house complex was run by a young couple vietnamese and khmer when i looked at the menu my jaw dropped when i saw poutine on the menu keep in mind they dont have a big kitchen just one of these open air cooking areas but they did have a deep fryer how the do you have poutine you dont actually have poutine do you the woman went to the kitchen and came back with a huge can of poutine sauce it turns out the two of them met when they were attending college at concordia every time a family member visits from canada they demand a can of poutine sauce
canada,not_removed,and yet i havent been able to find a decent colombian food joint here in canada luckily my mother makes the absolute best empanadas and ajiaco
canada,not_removed,quand ta besoin detre un vrai quebecois mais tes en colombie a lautre bout du monde mais ta vraiment le gout dune poutine
canada,not_removed,canadian cuisine cultural appropriation at its best
canada,not_removed,quebec cuisine
canada,not_removed,preparing to come to canada for the first time ever to get to a hip show next week already have a restaurant staked out for poutine totally stoked
canada,not_removed,i found all dressed chips in both kentucky and tennessee on my way to florida our influence is spreading
canada,not_removed,makes sense actually colombia makes an assload of potatoes and they love em there
canada,not_removed,it irks me that this picture is food box angles
canada,not_removed,i had some poutine on koh lanta in thailand but honestly yours looks better the fries and gravy were decent but the cheese was super disappointing i wasnt actually disappointed since i had very low expectations about the quality of the cheese
canada,not_removed,in pai thailand i saw a perfect poutine on a menu and got excited so i ordered it what arrived what looked like potato wedges with some melted cheese on it
canada,not_removed,serious question and purely for educational purpose how much does a gram of cocaine cost
canada,not_removed,tbh that does not look like tasty poutine
canada,not_removed,cheesey chips with gravy
canada,not_removed,where did you get this im studying abroad in bogota and i havent been able to find good poutine
canada,not_removed,he he he cuisine
canada,not_removed,i cant be alone in saying that fartinducing cheese pellets dropped on top of deepdried potatoes is something of which to be proud but i hope you enjoy colombia
canada,not_removed,always funny to see your own countrys food sold as ethnic food in other countries was it any good or were you just window shopping it
canada,not_removed,it was more like a mozzarella haha and the gravy was very light delicious but definitely not canadian style
canada,not_removed,topped with shredded capybara natch
canada,not_removed,especially the sweet ones they serve at breakfast from little food carts in downtown bogota holy shit those were delicious
canada,not_removed,you can make your own just buy pan brand flour my colombian missus does the recipe and its best done on an arepa grill but they taste pretty damn authentic also arepa cafe in toronto while venezuelan does hit the spot
canada,not_removed,here my friend thank me later httpwwwmycolombianrecipescomarepasdechocoloconquesitocolombiancorncakeswithfreshcheese
canada,not_removed,i feel like this is a game reference that im missing haha
canada,not_removed,that why i always use the resistant population card or whatever its called in english on that city
canada,not_removed,subscribe to potatofacts in all seriousness i have no idea if theyre regular potatoes or what and unfortunately dont speak enough spanish to ask that for what its worth they tasted like generic albeit well made fries haha
canada,not_removed,i had yuca poutine ever since then i have craved it
canada,not_removed,do you live in montreal
canada,not_removed,yeah im old enough to remember when the average canadian considered poutine a purely quebecois thing if they were aware of it at all its always the way though maybe thats why its smart to keep a place in the name like montreal smoked meat nanaimo bars or halifax style donairs though as more and more halifax style donair shops pop up people eventually start to think of them as donairs and eventually canadian donairs newfie fries will probably keep their cultural attribution because when they eventually go international theyll always be called newfie fries
canada,not_removed,first they took the name canada then they took the anthem then they took our provinces history as national history but we gotta draw the line at them appropriating poutine what an outraaaaaaaage
canada,not_removed,usually people dont know individual provinces outside canada
canada,not_removed,this is an outrage
canada,not_removed,which is a part of canada and thus canadian
canada,not_removed,maybe we could settle for canadien cuisine
canada,not_removed,nice if its vancouver check out belgian fries or la belle patate both are delicious
canada,not_removed,i mean quebec counts as a part of canada whether or not people think it should
canada,not_removed,ketchup chips that would be something also clammato needs to be a global thing
canada,not_removed,haha looks interesting the rice puts it over the top a little bit for me but id probably love it after a night of drinking
canada,not_removed,wish i could help you out but thats not really my scene probably cheap though haha
canada,not_removed,bad photo haha it was actually really tasty but very different from canadian poutine
canada,not_removed,im kind of surprised you can even find poutine down there at all but this whole conversations given me a craving for egg soup and arepas now
canada,not_removed,theres even better poutine at the southeast corner of calle and carrera next to centro comercial atlantis plaza its in the first food truck to the right when you enter the food truck plaza buen provecho
canada,not_removed,it was in the candelaria neighbourhood i believe it was called poutine e poutine or something different from canadian poutine but certainly tastes good if you have an open mind edit a cra bogotá colombia address copied from google maps idk what these numbers refer to
canada,not_removed,which places have you visited ive never heard a lot for canadian restaurants around the city and im a local but theres a place around con that is called freshly made and have the canadian flag everywhere take it with a grain of salt tho cause i have never been there just have seen it while sitting on the bus
canada,not_removed,we meant to go but never got around to it before we left the stuff on the menu sounded awesome though
canada,not_removed,theres also a quebec restaurant in ecuador seemed so random
canada,not_removed,wellit was just one province
canada,not_removed,i find it funny when i see poutine advertise in provinces outside qc
canada,not_removed,what do you think of bogota are you working there or traveling was thinking of freelancing or remote work and its one of my top picks so far
canada,not_removed,queso fresco
canada,not_removed,i like lighter gravy too many places use shitty beef gravy a light chicken gravy is where its at
canada,not_removed,heres a secret for you friend the difference between cheese curds and mozzarella is basically salt so dont pay much mind to anyone that gets on your case for using mozzarella instead of uncheddered curds
canada,not_removed,mozzarella is a type of cheese curds are a shape thats like somebody askjng hey if that beer a pilsner and replying no its in a bottle many varieties of cheese are in curds before they are pressed into blocks growing up we used curds simply because they were cheaper
canada,not_removed,pandemic
canada,not_removed,resilient population you dont save it for asia i always seem to have out of control red cubes
canada,not_removed,there are like so many varieties it is insane sampler httpwwwlimaeasycomperuvianfoodguidetypicalpotatoes
canada,not_removed,where i must know
canada,not_removed,ottawa
canada,not_removed,des vrais canadiens nont pas besoin de traduction 😜
canada,not_removed,avoir le goût means to want something and not really a link with taste even if the word is the same jai le goût dune bière would translate to i want a beer astu le goût daller au cinéma is do you want to go to the cinema and not do you want a taste of the cinema
canada,not_removed,nobody would ever describe jambalaya as american food dude same idea
canada,not_removed,im a fan of teddy bear takeout on salt spring island
canada,not_removed,smokes in london im not confident about the pronunciation hoping to get by with pointing and politeness
canada,not_removed,i dont get it canadians are super proud of their diversity but if you come from quebec you better shut the fuck up about it its like everything quebec does gets erased and rebranded with a canadiantm its very frustrating i mean nobody in england will say that haggis is british right everyone knows its scottish and theres nothing wrong with that why not give us some cultural recognition
canada,not_removed,is it not its not here in australia ive missed it dearly but surely the us has it
canada,not_removed,the uk has ketchup chips now
canada,not_removed,glad you enjoyed it then not much else really matters
canada,not_removed,im not that surprised locro de papa is kind of like a poutine soup there is also a restaurant in ecuador where you can get poutine curds n all casa quebecua
canada,not_removed,brb have to try this
canada,not_removed,a cra cra means carrera which are the streets going north to south the alternative is c which is calle referring to the streets going east to west the means it is between calle and the is the house number in the block im guessing that a refers to the unit within the building i believe its possible to say which side of the street youre on too addresses in bogotá are amazing and you know exactly where you are in the city for example i know without looking at a map that youre right in the city centre compare this with panama city which is lucky to have street names let alone house numbers taxis are fun in pty
canada,not_removed,although those are referring two really different addresses cra d candelaria cra north
canada,not_removed,this is why some people dont like quebec
canada,not_removed,i heard the poutine is pretty forgettable
canada,not_removed,im traveling through so only here a few days seems like an awesome place though cool nightlife good food for cheap and really cool coffee shops and the like even saw some craft breweries though im not sure how their quality is
canada,not_removed,i toured the northern half of the country while paragliding and highly recommend it friendly people everything is pretty cheap and theyre motivated to show the world how nice their country is very pro tourism without the gouging
canada,not_removed,probably im pretty white so i dont know colombian food at all
canada,not_removed,real poutine uses vegetable gravy
canada,not_removed,is that a joke the texture is totally different
canada,not_removed,yes and no good cheese curds have an unmatchable squeaky texture to them
canada,not_removed,i prefer a good old mozzarella to cheese curds myself they melt better
canada,not_removed,curds definitely have a different texture and a slight taste difference to them than standard blocked cheese though i agree its silly to say its not curds its mozzarella but the cheese being in curd form definitely brings more to the poutine beyond just shape
canada,not_removed,damn thats an old game
canada,not_removed,nah i find it easier to move around asia south america is just a big dead end that make you turn around a big waste of action
canada,not_removed,cant remember the name of the place but it was actually in seattle was like the stop of night food tourism gets messy
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,et les personnes qui ne peux pas parler francais qui dit quils sont canadiens ne sont pas vrais canadiens
canada,not_removed,of course they would and they do do you think someone in poland would call it creole no theyd call it american same thing applies
canada,not_removed,where in new west is that
canada,not_removed,its a chain but its actually pretty good dont let the haters detract from it because its not some authentic vegan vampiric cult in the deep woods operated by hairy leprechauns
canada,not_removed,russian president not the bear may the fries be crispy gravy salty and cheese stringy
canada,not_removed,i actually am french canadian by blood not location though albeit a very liberal one i personally think its great that people have a separate culture and they should definitely embrace that but theres a difference between being proud and being elitist canada has vastly vastly different cultures throughout the country but when i refer to something from a specific province i dont think theres anything wrong with using canadian as a blanket term french canada has its own unique history yes but its still a part of canada on a somewhat related note i feel like both sides of the debate need to chill the hell out lots of non québécois people are pretty racist towards french canadians while a lot of quebecois people are equally dicks to the rest of canadians just chill out dudes
canada,not_removed,depending on where you live in australia i think its possible to get it my uncle somehow had it when my dad and i visited him a couple years ago
canada,not_removed,its available anywhere ive lived in the us but people here dont know what a caesar is i think they mainly use it to make httpsenwikipediaorgwikimichelada which is something ive yet to try
canada,not_removed,nope they consider it alien
canada,not_removed,my mother puts cheese in her soup from time to time i cant stand it but at least i know where she gets it from now
canada,not_removed,where is this place do you remember what city street
canada,not_removed,still not the same because of the cheese but it will do in a pinch
canada,not_removed,addresses in bogotá are amazing and you know exactly where you are in the city calgary is actually the same its a bit more ambiguous in the tortuous residential neighbourhoods though
canada,not_removed,source
canada,not_removed,really always thought it was chicken well til
canada,not_removed,cheddared curds also dont melt nearly as well and that changes the dish a surprising amount
canada,not_removed,you take curds squish them and you make blocks edit httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjsabajctie also i do agree the curd step is great cause it leads to the squeek and the partially unmelted cheese
canada,not_removed,if is old then you must still be an infant
canada,not_removed,lol are you in montreal
canada,not_removed,exactement
canada,not_removed,les meilleurs canadiens sont les bilingues anglaisfrançais les autres sont de secondes classes
canada,not_removed,yeah i gotta side with you there kfc southern fried chicken is thought of globally as american food just like the average canadian doesnt distinguish bengali cuisine from indian okinawan from japanese or even sicilian from italian
canada,not_removed,you are basing your argument off of ignorance bold move cotton lets see if it pays off
canada,not_removed,never been there myself but it appears to be that little ice cream store about a block from nwss on street i wasnt aware they sold anything else though a look at google maps shows it clearly mentioned on the signage despite the huge ice cream cone also present
canada,not_removed,next to the kfc across from wendys on plastic patio furniture and cheap interior but shes got it where it counts
canada,not_removed,pootzin the t gets shifted to a tz sound in quebecois french in pronounced like the english word
canada,not_removed,dont do the teen part just tin as its closer to the actually pronunciation and therefore less grating to use if ever you find yourself in a french speaking area build good habits while you can
canada,not_removed,good to know thank you
canada,not_removed,i dont like smokes because they always add way too much gravy and the fries end up mushy and limp this has happened at every location ive gone to in toronto even when i tell them to go easy on the gravy
canada,not_removed,it goes both ways people can be legitimately racist towards french canadians even when theyre normal not annoying people
canada,not_removed,in quito in la mariscal on calama
canada,not_removed,well easier than finding maple syrup cookies
canada,not_removed,in lima house numbers depend on which block you are on the street so the first block will be and the block will be but you dont know where in the city the street is in buenos aires they have the same scheme but the numbers dont start at they start at how many blocks they are away from a central point in the city so parallel streets will always have the same numbering even if one of them goes all the way to the centre and the other has just started so you dont know where in the city is it but you have a locus as to where it might be
canada,not_removed,you were right the first time httpsenwikipediaorgwikipoutinerecipe
canada,not_removed,to be fair a nine year old game would feel ancient to a tweenadolescent as well its a phenom you always notice when you get older listening to much younger people like teenagers talking about the olden days which for them was more than half a lifetime ago in the fog back when their memories started to stick there used to be a funny kfc commercial with a kid doing the i can remember when spiel on the other side of the coin it weirds me out when i see redditors talking about the like it was the beforetimes tempus fugit just like the average redditor will eventually be looking at someones drivers license see that post birth year and think wtf oh yeah its always been that way i can remember adults being weirded out by inaccurate fifties nostalgia back in the seventies once at a kids sockhop in or so an older person once told me that if someone dressed like any of these fonzies they would have got a beating so i tied an onion to my belt which was the style at the time
canada,not_removed,yup
canada,not_removed,we can discriminate between cantonese and szechuan though so theres that
canada,not_removed,except its not ignorant ive lived in europe and travel extensively i know full well how other countries view the cuisine of countries much further away
canada,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikipoutinerecipe i stand corrected i saw a blog post recently that stated it was vegetable gravy the blog seemed to have strong convictions about poutine so i took it at its word hopefully i can dig it up
canada,not_removed,you misunderstood what i meant by ignorance completely that much further away is the cause of the ignorance i meant that distance means they dont know the proper terms for it your argument is that they call it american food and that would be acceptable because they would not know the more specific distinction creole food meanwhile this is a sub for canadians a post made by a canadian calling it canadian cuisine does not have that same defensible they didnt know it was quebecois food so canadian food is acceptable in that context i have a feeling he got this from the restaurant run by quebecois people down there too the one with the montreal impact flag in the restaurant they dont really pretend its canadian food there either so at no point of this is there the same point you were making in response to polish people not using the correct term due to their ignorance its someone aware of quebec and quebecois food buying food from quebecois abroad calling it canadian cuisine whatever floats their boat anyways
canada,not_removed,some people get really weird about their poutine beliefs
canada,not_removed,i agree and disagree yes we all know of its quebecois its still not wrong to call it canadian in food because it is a subcategory of canadian food for example think of people from different states in the usa some are californian new yorkers texans etc but they still all identify as american yes there are differences and people use their local descriptors all the time but we can call of them american and it wouldnt be wrong its the same principle with food
canada,not_removed,wowyou had to dig really really deep to strike that pool of bullshit im somewhat impressed with your shoveling
canada,not_removed,this literally has nothing to do with canada
canada,not_removed,thanks for your submission to rcanada unfortunately your post was removed because it does not comply with the following rules submission content posts which do not relate to canada will be removed tldr stay on topic dont make posts considered low content dont post duplicate content if you believe a mistake was made please feel free to message the moderators including a link to the removed post you can view a complete set of our rules by visiting the rcanadawikirules
canada,not_removed,its a cool design like most crowdfunding products its just a computer generated design rshittykickstarters is filled with them some one creates a cool looking product but not an actual prototype with a product the technical side is a huge barrier for example what kind of speaker are you punting in that fit that shape
canada,not_removed,just as someone thats been on the outside looking in and only loosely following these negotiations its pleasantly surprising to me that the two sides avoided a work stoppage despite teetering on the brink of one for such a prolonged period of time
canada,not_removed,good i prefer ordering things online to shopping at stores for most nonfood items now i dont have to consider that there might be an indefinite delay involved
canada,not_removed,looks like they both agreed to esentially delay negotions till the goverment review is over thus why the contract is only good for years instead of when you factor in that months have passed since the last contract expired we will be back where we started in years
canada,not_removed,we ship approx packages a day with cp have been using a courier for about a week resulting in dramatically higher costs i have noticed about a drop in orders since the labour unrest became an issue yes cp makes a difference
canada,not_removed,really happy this got sorted out without a job action someone needs to put all those flyers in my mailbox
canada,not_removed,yay now the uniformed people can transfer envelopes from truck to box
canada,not_removed,both sides agreed that canadian should pay more money for the postal services
canada,not_removed,i hope this means that my mail service will stop being shit i started to get a hint that maybe it was intentional
canada,not_removed,thats nice i guess theyve come to the consensus that canadians can face dramatic postage increases again
canada,not_removed,i was so happy when harper sent them back to work the article even says volume revenue is decreasing while pension costs are going up does this make sense to anyone if they werent on the taxpayers dime they would be looking at layoffs or wage decreases
canada,not_removed,job action other wise known as a fucking strike unions
canada,not_removed,god i hope the canada post goes tits up i get way better service through other companies
canada,not_removed,so the question of what if they had a strike and nobody noticed will take a few more years to get answered
canada,not_removed,still waiting for the layoffs that should happen at canada post
canada,not_removed,i think both sides realize the truth of their industry all this possible work stoppage did for me was make me switch the last of my bills to email delivery neither a lockout or strike had any real teeth to it the last time i bought a book of stamps was well over years ago
canada,not_removed,canada post tucked its tail between its legs when trudeau announced they werent considering back to work legislation thats the only reason they got to a tentative agreement its the same thing happening at my workplace ministry of labor told the company they let us strike and suddenly the company came back to the table after walking away
canada,not_removed,why isnt this made an essential service
canada,not_removed,most stores would ship with one of the other options available
canada,not_removed,yep weve had to courier our invoices for the past few days
canada,not_removed,however the majority of canada decided to stop using letter mail entirely
canada,not_removed,exactly
canada,not_removed,i would have hoped that mail service would have gone down to days a week to reflect the actual mail i receive hint this does not include admail which constitutes the vast majority of what fills my mailbox
canada,not_removed,wishful thinking
canada,not_removed,how much mail do you send that even a hike would be notable i might send pieces of mail a year
canada,not_removed,the good news is no canadian buys stamps anymore
canada,not_removed,canada post is essential for small business especially online
canada,not_removed,funny they are trying to fix it it is like curing the symptom of a disease without curing the disease itself defined pension should be gone and maybe after a few years people will actually learn how to save some money instead of spending and of your pay check
canada,not_removed,i am a maintenance foreman with canada post imo the vast majority of users which were going to shift to electronic bill have done so there isnt much more room for this to drop the hold outs are largely people which are in remote areas with poor internet access or the elderly the make up of the letter mail i see in the plants is most business to business or customer to small business unless the banking sector make significant changes to electronic fund transfer fees checks and bank drafts will still be mailed physically frankly i dont see that occurring because banks make too much money on efts to reduce rates with the exception of bday cards christmas cards wedding invitations etc the vast majority of people havent communicated via mail for a decade the past couple years the decrease in letter mail has been off set by the increase in parcelpacketoversized i suspect this trend will continue unless we see a significant economic downturn causing a halt to online purchasing and distribution in which case we have bigger problem than the solvency of the mail industry even most pay stubs and have converted to online distribution based on what i saw during the tax season compared to past years advertising mail or neighbourhood mail as it has been rebranded is only of the piece count but also delivered at extreme discounts they are charge between cents vs a letter being this is generally the mail most people bitch about and frankly its a small portion of the profitable mail the reason admail is so much cheaper is we dont transport around the country it we just distribute it
canada,not_removed,to add to this as a personal experience i buy a lot of stuff online since a lot of vendors have been operating protectively and using ups or fedex instead and pushing the extra cost to the buyer to prevent delaying shipments in the event of a canada post work stoppage my experience with my shipments has sky rocketed in the future i will always request upsfedex instead now that i know how much better it is i cant be the only one either fuck canada post their service sucks shit i do realize people living in some remote areas and on a tight budget still need them though in my opinion this whole ordeal will have a lasting negative impact on their ability to continue operating well with yet another round of volume drops meaning their service will only get worse and worse
canada,not_removed,because orderly society wont grind to a halt if the mail stops
canada,not_removed,they would but none are as efficient or effective for the cost as canada post ive dealt with the others in a high volume capacity in another lockout and they clearly were in over their heads
canada,not_removed,yes long negotiations with each of the couriers you so kindly mentioned discounts always offered and discussed at length they are still unable to match cp rates especially to rural destinations and with our volumes our overall costs are substantially higher thank you for the suggestions though
canada,not_removed,if you dont want admail you can have your address listed so that they dont deliver it some will get there but most stops
canada,not_removed,i dont think thats going to happen it would mean that they wouldnt be paying the workers as much anymore and laying people off the union wouldnt agree with it well they would if the workers got days off but still got paid for those days
canada,not_removed,downvote brigade strikes a beleaguered and outmoded model of information delivery teeters and falls upon its own irrelevance
canada,not_removed,canadian companies spend billions on postage each year you think theyre gonna just eat that cost
canada,not_removed,maybe for certain things maybe then they should just spin off the package delivery i prefer purolator and canpar and ups if canada post was out of the way the others would step in majority of canada post is useless and overpaid
canada,not_removed,of course theyre going to try and fix it dont you know that senior citizens would start dying by the truckload without daily doortodoor mail service its a human right and an absolutely essential service but they should still be allowed to strike to get what they want as if they werent essential
canada,not_removed,this guy gets it lol
canada,not_removed,adjust bitch nobody gives you nothing for nothing and if you feel entitled differently you are going to be left hanging ironically im a liberal
canada,not_removed,good insight what in your opinionbased on your experience is the largest portion of profitable mail
canada,not_removed,unless the banking sector make significant changes to electronic fund transfer fees checks and bank drafts will still be mailed physically oh come on it costs what to send an interac etransfer how much is a stamp these days
canada,not_removed,i dont think anyone would consider fedex or ups as over their head with high volume
canada,not_removed,canada post will need to readjust its workforce at some point i was hoping this strike would be a mandate for change
canada,not_removed,more for stuff delivery now
canada,not_removed,canadian companies spend billions on postage each year except the ones who adopt modern information distribution processes even the government is phasing it out i do not get a single piece of paper in the mail for any account related information at all bank investments were the last holdout id rather see expansions of epost over any sort of cp delivery infastructure
canada,not_removed,thats exactly why a corporate rate exists my friend
canada,not_removed,well at this point is like beating on a dead horse blah blah blah we will go on strike amazon starts their own service everyone migrated to another courier cp you are not the only delivery service in town yes its cheap but you get what you paid for which is a piece of shit if you steal something from the mail i dont want reimbursement and a answer we simply lost is just not good enough not when i have to call and bug the shit out of you to get an answer i want the person fired from the job its not about the money its the principle
canada,not_removed,obviously pfft they should never fight for anything and just roll over and accept what their master feeds them
canada,not_removed,packets are the bread and butter now the modern sorters streamlined them pretty effectively and sizeweight vs postage cost is the most profitable previously they required a lot of manual work now in the mid size or larger planets they are hopper fed into sorters only requiring manual intervention when the labelling is incorrect its still an issue in smaller plants which dont have the volume for sorters but in general its the most profitable costlabourshipping ratio
canada,not_removed,bulk meter post is bulk stamps are single stamps are in a one off purchase its break even however over a transactions this is a difference of up to dollars with no investment into a a meter post machine this is before price cut negotiations its significant to low and mid level business which arent large enough to strike deal with the banking sector edit price guide httpswwwcanadapostcatoolspgpricessbpricesepdf also if you presort you can save more to piece depending on your business this might be cost beneficial but imo there is a niche here between the cost of labour and the saving which doesnt always pan out
canada,not_removed,it costs what to send an interac etransfer depends on your bank mine are free
canada,not_removed,well this was some years ago and in canada they certainly were the one a few months ago i heard they werent terribly better worse shipping software for waybilling more expensive for slower times etc purulator as well maybe its just isolated incidents canada post does the vast majority of shipping here so it makes sense they can handle the volume im sure the others would too given a few years of course in the states its different
canada,not_removed,i received two packages that i ordered before the start of the summer lockout threat yesterday from purolator would never use again they apparently had trucks full of stuff sitting in their lots and it took months to get through the backlog
canada,not_removed,in canada they are i worked for a company that did a lot of shipping and when we had to use fedex or ups it was both more costly and much slower
canada,not_removed,canada post said that the new collective agreements would last just two years half the usual four that is interesting
canada,not_removed,that still will mean a downsizing of the carrier workforce since parcel delivery is on an as needed basis rather than door to door often only delivering unaddressed admail anyway
canada,not_removed,except there is no except canada posts revenue in was billion thats pretty much all postage and the bulk comes from companies while some companies can phase out here and there there is still billions of dollars being spent annually on postage by companies just because you dont rely on the post office doesnt mean that millions of canadians dont and whenever businesses face price hikes they really only have a couple of options a raise prices or b cut staff canadians can either expect to see more job slashing from the companies that contribute to that billion or they can expect to see increases in the prices of their goods
canada,not_removed,and that went up a letter about months ago its up to for a normal letter now on ol pitney bowes
canada,not_removed,there was still a big jump back in for businesses
canada,not_removed,door to door is a long term sustainable model of employing lots of mail carriers there you go have fun lol
canada,not_removed,but there still has to be the cost of printing and mail handling before it gets to canada post that has to cost something approaching breakeven to electronic
canada,not_removed,it is pretty much package postal volume is declining year after year canada post revenue is coming more and more from domestic package with most of it most certainly not from postage
canada,not_removed,if it did businesses would do so they dont
canada,not_removed,i think your over estimating the costs here laser print costs fractions of a cent and paper in bulk is very cheap sheets of paper from best buy before price cut is or cents a sheet even if you replaced your laser printercartridge every years for its still cheaper this is also assuming the print is strictly used for the mailing most companies use black and white printers after all
canada,not_removed,revenue transactional mail parcels direct marketing other in transactional mail tm was and parcels were so while parcels have increased by tm has only dropped by in a decade the majority of transactional mail revenue comes from companies all but a very small fraction of direct marketing comes from companies canadian businesses are carrying the post office and if their postage rates go up their prices are going up or their staff is getting cut
canada,not_removed,depends if you are a small business or large business production environments for say bank statements or utility companies cost a boat ton of money if you are a small business that is sending out manually you then need to consider the cost of labour to print off fold stuff presort etc
canada,not_removed,domestic lettermail volumes have declined by per cent from their peak yoy total volume change segment domestic lettermail erosion canada post segment transaction mail erosion canada post segment transaction mail volume decline per address yoy loss in lettermail does not represent a sustainable pattern for the future
canada,not_removed,wont work in practicality next thing then we would get paid for not mining coal natural gas etc subsidizes for their own countries green alternatives make more sense
canada,not_removed,the only country that could afford it is the usa good luck getting that through congress
canada,not_removed,hahahahaha as an albertan i hope who ever has this idea has deep pockets because its going nowhere unless theyre ready to replicate the prosperous boom periods that this province is famous for and if they slip even once guess where the first place well go looking is
canada,not_removed,no one should and no one will it seems ridiculously unfeasible and even if canada were to keep its oil in the ground other oil producers would gladly snatch up our market share and increase their outputs
canada,not_removed,didnt sting try this in brazil to get them to stop clear cutting forest
canada,not_removed,would it not be easier to just apply the carbon taxes to carbon heavy imports as well that way it does not matter if some other country ups production cause all things would be equally taxed and consumption would stay low at least in the country with the carbon taxes
canada,not_removed,absolutely yes and in particular pay me directly for keeping my particular oil in the ground of which i have very large reserves
canada,not_removed,gotta be the other way around give every canadian a cut of the profits do away with private energy companies allow our resources to benefit every canadian rather than a select few
canada,not_removed,maybe if we had the military to back up that kind of big balled maneuvering on the political dance floor hell all america has to do is say no and our govt will probably most likely say okay
canada,not_removed,why would someone pay us to do what the liberals ae doing for free
canada,not_removed,why pay canada to keep its oil in the ground when all you need to do is stop the pipelines saves a lot more money that way and you get the bonus of having a giant reserve if you need it just north of the boarder
canada,not_removed,who says there is going to be another boom im not sure if there will be another one sure nominal price increases and decreases but sustained bbl i cant see that happening then again if i could forecast oil prices id be a billionaire
canada,not_removed,as an albertan your interests in oil are irrelevant with regards to the world we are coming into in future decades while an instant shift off oil is impossible dont count on your dino juice for much longer move along and get over it
canada,not_removed,i hate to burst your bubble but theres plenty of oil in canada that will stay in the ground and aint nobody gona pay to keep it there the economics are softening
canada,not_removed,maybe but ecuador did with the yasuni national park didnt work so well
canada,not_removed,norway payed brazil to curb deforestation
canada,not_removed,why stop at energy the people need to seize all the means of production from the imperialist capitalist pigs and end all exploitation private property is theft socialism will work this timetm every other failure was just state capitalismtm lets do it comrade
canada,not_removed,give every canadian a cut of the profits as per the constitution resources are owned by the provinces not the feds so it would be only albertans who would get a cut of the profits people in the rest of the country would not be entitled to jack
canada,not_removed,like say through the taxes and deductions that come off the paycheques of oilfield workers that goes to govt provided services like say through the royalty schemes where something like half the value of a barrel of oil or gigajoule of natural gas goes to the province or the feds which goes to govt provided services like say the way moneys moved around the country via transfer payments collected from all revenue generated within canada just how much more of other peoples money do you think youre entitled to despite having done nothing to earn it
canada,not_removed,impossible canada does not have the capital to start complete and maintain its oil industry the only reason canada he an oil industry is because of the massively deep pockets of china american and the eu
canada,not_removed,gotta be the other way around give every canadian a cut of your income do away with private savings allow your money to benefit every canadian rather than just you
canada,not_removed,andyou were being serious wow
canada,not_removed,pretty sure they did that once king kliene gave everyone a small cut think it was about a house
canada,not_removed,agreed canadian oil should belong to and be managed by canadians through crown corporations if this were the case wed all be burning canadian fuel the extensive network of high quality pipelines would rarely leak and if they did cleanups would be immediate and thorough the biggest problem with oil is the oil business
canada,not_removed,every canadian already shares in the profits through the huge taxes and royalties provided by oil companies ohyou want them to send you a free cheque in the mail because you exist nope youll have to buy some stock if you want that
canada,not_removed,hell all america has to do is say no and our govt will probably most likely say okay better than losing an economic or worse war
canada,not_removed,the only way thats going to happen is if opec keeps pumping enough oil to keep prices below a barrel once the price of oil exceeds that oil companies can still turn a profit by shipping oil by rail sure the industry would prefer pipelines but its important to realize that if demand rises enough they will get their product to market through other methods this doesnt mean a pipeline is necessarily better or worse only that people need to realize that fundamentally stopping pipelines will only slow things down it wont stop oil or oilsands development if the price of oil goes back up over a certain price and stays there we have alternative transport methods that arent being fully utilized now and they will be used if the opertunity cost is there
canada,not_removed,the key point here is future decades we are a long way off from this future we need to build towards
canada,not_removed,nah
canada,not_removed,sting norway whats the difference both really white and kind of whiny and both better when they are part of a group
canada,not_removed,communism is an amazingly effective way to convince people who have barely anything to kill each other for the privilege of owning absolutely nothing
canada,not_removed,because its a lot more dicey with wide scale intervention oil is comparatively easy to manage given a well paid management team the international reprocussions are the only real danger
canada,not_removed,nationalizing oil has worked fine for countries like norway and the gulf states we dont have to take everything to extremes
canada,not_removed,just how much more of other peoples money do you think youre entitled to despite having done nothing to earn it all of it liberals think that theyre literally entitled to all of it
canada,not_removed,i smell a dirty capitalist get em rcanada
canada,not_removed,give every canadian a cut of your income i shouldnt have to work to live like a king all those other greedy people are messing up the universes plan to shower me with wealth
canada,not_removed,if this were the case wed all be burning canadian fuel pardon were already trying to get albertan oil out east to replace oil imported from algeria and saudi arabia and large portions of the country are against it the same people who are against this currently would be against it if the feds were in charge because they want all the comforts of century living but demand that lesser other people in lesser other countries shoulder the labour materials and pollution cost of it
canada,not_removed,agreed private companies only ever produce death and misery theyve never done anything good for money advertising is just mind control propaganda that forces people to hand over their money and theres absolutely no voluntary interaction there the solution is to outlaw private ownership of the means of production and seize the means of production this way the government can manage everything governments never make mistakes because theyre democratically elected and thats the will of the people and the people are always right all good things come from government eg sunlight that is taxed in spain rain water that is owned by various municipal governments roads that never could have existed without taxation health care because everyone in history that didnt have government provided health care died this is an indisputable fact etc etc fuck competition its just code for greed eliminate greedcompetition and socialist government pricing will ensure a veritable utopia the biggest problem with everything is that the government doesnt control everything
canada,not_removed,resources are owned by the provinces nationalization of oil is against the charter this was already decided by the supreme court
canada,not_removed,if this were the case wed all be burning canadian fuel no we wouldnt oil is traded on the world market and people would just buy it cheaper from elsewhere i get it though nationalize it is just another way of saying i want a cut of the profits that someone elses hardwork and risk taking provided without doing anything for it i swear the canadian mentality is becoming a total crab bucket i should benefit from something no matter how little i have to do with it so project x either cant happen or the government has to get involved to benefit me at the expense of everyone else
canada,not_removed,i never said anything about a free cheque in the mail i dont give a fuck about money i care about our natural resources being stolen out from underneath us by corporations that dont actually give back to the country beyond the small amount of taxes they pay how much did suncor pay in taxes last year compared to profits put the operations profitability choice whether to exploit those resources and responsibility with the communities affected by the industry edit cmon people answer the question dont just downvote your fingers are jammed so far in your ears that youve damaged the part of your brain that handles critical thinking every cent of profit that energy companys earn is stolen from every single one of us
canada,not_removed,thats precisely it though we are using oil a lot less and theres now serious investment into using oil a lot less
canada,not_removed,we will stop using oil for a lot of our energy needs in the coming decades oil will be needed for plastics and lubricants and some forms of transportation not cars
canada,not_removed,yah
canada,not_removed,capitalism is an amazingly effective way of convincing people who have barely anything to kill each other so that the rich can get richer
canada,not_removed,against the constitution the oil doesnt belong to ottawa it belongs to alberta end of discussion
canada,not_removed,you disappoint me comrade
canada,not_removed,well they cant want all of it some of it has to be given to natives who are also doing nothing to earn it
canada,not_removed,you misunderstand if we we shift the regulatory and ownership paradigm then we need to shift all the other elements as well which brings all stakeholders onboard
canada,not_removed,preach it those soviets ran things at the peak of efficiency never had food shortages everything worked perfectly and the people were treated like kings its a shame all those saboteurs and capitalists running dogs brought it all down and spread lies about million people being killed in the name of their god party
canada,not_removed,youre being asinine sarcasm and simplistic binary arguments dont make your point
canada,not_removed,which particular level of government administers public ownership is not the issue that the existing commercial mismanagement of public assets is undermining both the economy and public good is
canada,not_removed,i should benefit from something no matter how little i have to do with it its the anthem of the millennial generation the same people who want to stare into a touch screen while the car drives them around because it involves zero effort and they dont have to interact with other human beings we need to build some mini version of the matrix so they can plug themselves in to live their dream life and the rest of us dont have to put up with them
canada,not_removed,that is just a fabricated corporatist narrative their model continues to fail miserably and is demonstrably counter to the public good we need new solutions and public ownership of key elements certainly distribution is a good first step either that or because of the worsening failures of the existing model we should simply jettison the oil business if their only hope of survival is continuing public subsidy while they increase environmental damage then there are no compelling counter arguments in their favour
canada,not_removed,there is investment to use less oil in the future but we are currently not using oil a lot less httpwwwindexmundicomenergy
canada,not_removed,actually oil is in higher demand than ever
canada,not_removed,that is an optimistic view i hope you are right though
canada,not_removed,k
canada,not_removed,the thing about constitutions is that theyre open to interpretation by the scc plus we could always amend it the conversation is technically never over
canada,not_removed,well thanks to the way alberta has managed it im pretty sure it actually belongs to china
canada,not_removed,well considering we put them in such a fucked up state then yes they do deserve it
canada,not_removed,but the lies are even bigger than million million there is no level that the capitalist dogs will not sink to theyre like anchors but stupider
canada,not_removed,giving an inch to socialists only encourages them to take a mile better to throw them in gulags so that they know what theyre fighting for
canada,not_removed,alberta is the richest jurisdiction in all of canada and the us if it was a sovereign nation it would likely be the richest country in the world alberta has the highest quality of life in canada and measured as a sovereign nation would have the highest quality of life in the world not sure how the economy and public good is being undermined in alberta because of them bad private business things have worked out quite well
canada,not_removed,im also a millennial and i get conflicted about where this attitude came from either way im worried that were descending into a society that keeps fooling itself into thinking hard work is actually a bad thing basically you let success and wealth come to you passively and when it doesnt demand the government get it for you we need to build some mini version of the matrix so they can plug themselves in to live their dream life and the rest of us dont have to put up with them we dont have to because short of the government raiding peoples bank accounts private savings and property the consumer crab bucket types will always be worse off than the people who produce make the world better and provide genuine value for people
canada,not_removed,public ownership is not a new solution to problems that industry faces been there done that a closer merger between the state and the oil industry may be beneficial but full public ownership is a bad move
canada,not_removed,that is just a fabricated corporatist narrative no its the nothing comes for free narrative of real life and is demonstrably counter to the public good oil isnt good while oil isnt the cleanest technology it has allowed us as human beings to be able to raise our standard of living to incredible levels feed ourselves several times over and accomplish great things for real why on earth do you think we keep using it purely to fuck with and damage the environment we need new solutions and public ownership of key elements certainly distribution is a good first step either that or because of the worsening failures of the existing model we should simply jettison the oil business like who the fuck are you to demand that we force oil companies to pick between giving you an unearned share of it or shut it down completely if their only hope of survival is continuing public subsidy tax breaks arent subsidies but youre totally ok with the government making competition illegal for things like telecom healthcare dairy domestic flights and all that shit because it benefits you personally while shifting the risk and cost disproportionately on to everyone else besides you
canada,not_removed,if it doesnt happen we are in serious troublei already think its too late anyone doubting what is happening needs to look at some phenomena that we didnt predict such as gas trapped for millions of years now escaping in russiathe ground is like a spongeif it escapes this will add insane amounts of gases to the atmospherelots of crazy shit happeningwe need to keep as much as possible in the ground this isnt a left or right thingits a human thing
canada,not_removed,socialists
canada,not_removed,yall spiked the koolaid for sure
canada,not_removed,were descending into a society that keeps fooling itself into thinking hard work is actually a bad thing yes we are it has to do with people whove grown up in urbansuburban areas and have never had to work for anything in their lives and expect the world outside of their parents homes to follow the same pattern they deserve everything theyve ever wanted now someone else should put in the effort to make it happen and they the aforementioned urbanites shouldnt have to see hear or smell any part of that process which is the kind of attitude one wouldnt tolerate from a year old let alone a year old the fact they can protest industrial operations in this country that are bound by this countrys environmental regulations and employ people who contribute to the tax base of this country while not caring in the least about the fact their prized mobile devices are made by slave labour in a chemical swamp on the other side of the world shows what kind of mental illness were dealing with and the idea that someone with a philosophyenglish lit somehow contributes more to the maintenance of society than a journeyman in the trades is also something that needs to be quashed and shows just how classist and elitist they can really be
canada,not_removed,a closer merger between the state and the oil industry may be beneficial but full public ownership is a bad move thus far it would seem to be the only way in which the public interest can be served existing models in canada continue to fail spectacularly
canada,not_removed,the fact they can protest industrial operations in this country that are bound by this countrys environmental regulations and employ people who contribute to the tax base of this country while not caring in the least about the fact their prized mobile devices are made by slave labour in a chemical swamp on the other side of the world shows what kind of mental illness were dealing with this shit bothers me a lot because were trending toward economic stagnation that pays for all the stuff they demand and classify as rights whats more is that its always the fault of corporations who employ hundreds or even thousands of people for pulling the oil minerals etc out of the ground not they themselves who demand the shit in the first place oh and its never them who should cut back its always government who should force everyone else to comply and limit themselves so that they dont have to personally i wish i could find it now but in rentrepreneur there was a quote i read that went something like you have become an adult when you realize that you and you alone own your life and your situation nobody really cares about you not even your parents in the end and will not go out of their way in the long term to improve your situation and make your life better in a lot of ways many millennials have stalled on the way to fully becoming adults we just got to school do as we are told and do all the things right as ive read in the this sub and expect that life will just hand them the success they expect well it doesnt work like that and many of them refuse to even take step one in the grind of life other than voting they dont even do that or complaining about how it should be so oh well
canada,not_removed,why do you end all your comments with a period on its own line
canada,not_removed,khalistan terror force ktf im a little surprised we didnt extradite him at indias request there must be a lot more to the story
canada,not_removed,seems mostly unfounded
canada,not_removed,sure seems like youre doing damage control in all of these threads
canada,not_removed,for what purpose do you think
canada,not_removed,so ive got some questions not because im a drug user but curious i was reading this earlier and these places seem great im just wondering though if a drug user provides their own drugs or are the drug of choice provided for them if its provided is it free or is there a cost do they need to be addicted to a particular substance first or is it sort of like a menu for lack of a better term hmm today i think ill go with once the drug is administered are they required to stay at this facility for the duration of their high
canada,not_removed,according to studies this will help reduce the spread of infection and disease
canada,not_removed,i work at a site in alberta that currently does needle handout and is opening a safe injection site the current rules allow us to hand out clean needles but the users are not allowed to inject on our property the safe injection site merely allows users to use the free equipment and have nurses onsite to make sure they are injecting properly and have a safe space afterwards most importantly the nurses have naloxone the antidote to an opioid overdose theres no drug handouts at the safe injection site unless theres another place nearby that has the clearance to do that prescription necessary though no menu because the injected drugs are relatively similar i dont think theyd be required to stay but i doubt theyre going to be kicked out right after not sure on the injection sites policy on length of stay hope thats of some help
canada,not_removed,and overdose deaths most importantly
canada,not_removed,oh i see so they just bring in their own drug of choice and the staff there make sure they inject themselves correctly and with clean needles then if they overdose they have the antidote neat thanks for the reply
canada,not_removed,its also much much cheaper than not spending the money one of the worst things that antiscience fuck harper did was fight against safe injection sites
canada,not_removed,depends which side you lean on right wing might not care about those deaths but they do care about stds spreading their way back to themselves or people they know
canada,not_removed,they should care about it being more fiscally responsible too
canada,not_removed,ya but it has to hit someone they know before they give a shit
canada,not_removed,they should but dont
canada,not_removed,i have to say that was a pretty fantastic speech whoever his speech writer is deserves a raise
canada,not_removed,your video is showing up private uploaded it
canada,not_removed,certainly it was a great event
canada,not_removed,not sure why is it shown as private
canada,not_removed,it isnt anymore but was this is the official justin trudeau channel too unfortunately the video isnt hd eitheror hasnt finished processing yet
canada,not_removed,it was the same quality when i saw it live
canada,not_removed,cbc livestream was at it doesnt matter anyway just expected better quality from the official jt channel
canada,not_removed,they were great on late night with stephen colbert last night
canada,not_removed,leaving a comment here so that i remember to check this out later i love me some bss shoreline is one of my alltime faves
canada,not_removed,bss is amazing to see live ive been to of their shows definitely be there again if they tour
canada,not_removed,holy fucking shit
canada,not_removed,so is this happening for sure or have they just decided to try it with pilot projects
canada,not_removed,social signalling will become subtler still and more important yet
canada,not_removed,id still work at my job likely getting zero benefit because id make too much money for mincome to actually be given to me id all get taxed back
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,i find that people against basic income are those who have really taken the notion of christian puritant work ethic closest to heart this idea is really not that radical when you think about it and its implications can only serve to better the standard of living on a mass scale im glad these discussions and pilot projects are being undertaken we are going go witness drastic changes to employment the nature of work and a shift towards access over ownership over the next years we can plan ahead or deal with the consequences
canada,not_removed,oh itll have stigma no doubt about it
canada,not_removed,mincome will never ever ever happen ever it just will not happen the only way i can see it working is if as a result of lowered crime less health problemsetc we start firing more public service workers and other cutbacksthere are hundreds of possible cutbacks that are currently wasting money the money has to come from somewhere and provincial welfare programs already siphon a lot of the lazy people out of the pool it does happen but abusing our welfare system currently is not really worth it the second you make it worth it to abuse tons of people are going to do it it is incredible the amount of people that simply do not give a fuck people are here for one time only and a lot do not care about future generations or anyone but themselves
canada,not_removed,as a lazy drug addict this is fantastic i cant wait for all of the hardworking conservatives to subsidize me with taxes thanks hard working bros
canada,not_removed,with companies making more money then ever before and the rich richer than any point in history with all the recent revelations of tax havens corruption and graft by the people are still crawling out of the trash heap to defend these fucks well i do not think minicome goes far enough we need worker ownership of the means of production we need to have a democratic workforce not a totalitarian one captialism breeds totalitalism look at the us it not even a democracy anymore workers of the world unite they only thing you have to fear is losing your chains
canada,not_removed,basic income its simple you pay lazy people more money so they stop working we now have no money but wait you say the robots will save us they will do everything and well go full socialist yeah no who the fuck is gonna pay for those robots who owns them all private industry which will leave the second you gut the economy simple you say nationalize everything and thatd be when i flee the country and watch vzla unfold once again
canada,not_removed,i tend towards the why should people get money for free while i have to work for it rah rah rah camp but im really interested to see how it pays out and effects the shtty jobs where i work a lot of people are paid really really low and treated really really poorly itll be very interesting when suddenly of our workforce realizes they can make just a little bit less and not have to put up with the nonsense we might actually have t start paying competitive wages at least semicompetitive
canada,not_removed,people will totally still work at mcdonalds in fact more people will want to work at mcdonalds the main reason working at mcdonalds will be worlds better no more worrying about telling your boss you wont do unsafe work get fired no problem mincome boss is a psychopath people leave or complain to higher ups and hes gone because otherwise your workforce goes to mincome dont want to work forced unpaid overtime tell your boss youll quit and go to mincome with that kind of freedom people will work at good jobs and bad jobs will disappear shitty small business that rips off workers gone large corporation with a vested interest in staying in a market suddenly relations between management and the labour force have to improve
canada,not_removed,my libertarian side would love to see this combined with the elimination of minimum wage think about it a real actual noncoercive labour market its not take this shitty exploitative job or starve and the employer isnt stuck paying more than someone would be willing to take for a really easyslack job both parties win
canada,not_removed,working conditions could improve as well to get people to take shitty jobs
canada,not_removed,i absolutely think employers will have difficulty filling shitty jobs for retail in particular theres a cost to psychological wellbeing in being put on the front lines subject to abuse from disgruntled customers without any expectation of support from your employer it takes a toll that cant be compensated by minimum wage
canada,not_removed,its just a rational response to the failure of corporate capitalism
canada,not_removed,its funny how you think you will be able to afford nice things like a backyard and drugs on mincome its call mincome because its the minimum income you need to live
canada,not_removed,firstly this is great rantpost seriously you open up a lot of things to talk about and ill do my best in responding to you okay i guess the one thing i dont understand about basic income is how its going to be paid for thats fine money as it stands today is designed not to be understood and what you learn in economics is a cursory understanding that is undermined by the cartels of the finance industry start with and only after you understand what money is you might decide to change the framing of your question canada can borrow money to pay for it and pay it back the following year with borrowed money from the year after and so on heres about that i mean say i get enough money to live no questions asked im not going to work another second period even if that meant taking a huge cut to my income or quality of life i wouldnt have to work so fuck that id rather spend all my time getting blazed in my backyard and i cant be the only one to each their own if youre satisfied to live another years getting blazed in your backyard so be it to be honesti dont think youll want to be doing the same thing in years let alone in years im not saying that in years youre going to stand up and be like i dont want to get stoned anymore and now i want to work for the man not like that but youre going to cultivate hobbies youre going to do something and that something might just create value for the people around you i define value well beyond your mother provided you with value and didnt get paid a cent for it and you will provide value for others that you will not be paid for a ubi universal basic income acknowledges that not all value created translates into fiscal value this is a good thing in my opinion the quantified economy misses a lot of the greatest qualities that make everything so valuable im sure many people will quit their jobs to pursue other activities pursue their art or their shitty business idea or even just take a break from it all for a while so i imagine there is going to be a noticeable cut in actual tax payers right in the dauphin mincome experiment only single mothers and teenagers quit working everyone else kept at it we have to break out of the paradigm of how do we pay for it its onetrackmind thinking its like every time i say we need energy you respond we need oil the conversation needs to levelup given the choice of cleaning toilets or not working even if i am taking home less no one is going to fucking choose to clean toilets but toilets still need to be cleaned right whos going to do that robots andor higher wages for worse work garbage people get paid around in montreal from what i hear its tough work so the pay reflects that businesses are just going to have to raise wages right wheres that money going to come from minor increases in prices of goodsservices can create significant wage increases or businesses can create healthier work environments where people are happy to come in to work then they might not have to increase the wages as much id work for very low wages if i loved what i did and felt that i was contributing to society through my work i cant be alone in that sentiment just like you arent alone in yours so less people paying taxes more taxes owed for those who choose to work less positions to fill because employers dont want to have to spend even more money especially small businesses like say goodbye to the small business because staying afloat is hard enough as it is ive seen people say that since we already have the basic covered wages would be able to go down opening up more opportunities for business to hire getting more people out into the workforce but like if wages go down im not busting my ass for just to get that mega taxed this is a linear pathbut it isnt written in stone it isnt necessarily how it will happen at all there are so many variables to consider that to simplify it as such doesnt really get us any closer to the truthit does however create a narrative which is dangerous as per busting your ass for if it was to help your friend build something amazing low wages only make sense for the best jobs and you wouldnt be megataxed if youre making very little money thats why there are tax brackets maybe if it was like so people still have a reason to sweep floors and flip burgers but then we wouldnt be able to get rid of practically any assistance which would be the whole point of the basic income right there are many many points to basic income but youre right that a basic income of wouldnt work the poverty line is around but if it covers enough to live then theres no point in flipping burgers and if theres no one working or working for far less whether because wages go down which still someone defend that because i just dont see how that could be a good thingor because now youre being mega taxed and see no point in working so much so you cut your hours working or something then youre going to be collecting less taxes robot burger flippers or more expensive burgersso you couldnt afford to eat them on a basic income youd have to flip your own burger is our government independently wealthy honestly asking because i really dont know anything about anything can you tell ha but like to just give us money they have to get that money from somewhere when the tax payers dip out do they own a lot of businesses are we getting money from other countries are natural resources government owned i honestly dont know basically what im asking is whats the plan when tax payers arent able to cover this do we get less and less money can canada just like print more money wouldnt that just devalue everything to shit the government is the mom and dad of million people we give them a cut of what we make they build us roads and manage the hospitals they are supposed to be acting in our best intereststhey dont always do that see the article i posted corporations hire lawyers and lobbyists to manage their finances to take advantage of every tax loophole possible to profit from the inefficiency of the government while you and me joe nobody cannot afford the same luxuries and are forced to pay a greater portion of taxes just to give you a sense a ubi is a rebalancing act its a shuffling around of resources to help restructure a millionlarge company its acknowledging that micromanaging our welfare system is inefficient and that we should simplify it for everyone its saying that everybody should get an income based on income and not based on how old they are or if theyre disabled or if theyre this kind of person or that kind of person we are entering a new world where there will be fewer and fewer necessary jobs to maintain and upgrade the world as it is this is a response to that there is no more room for gdp growthincome inequality is too vast and we as a world have already grown past the point of our planets capacity we need to scale back and simplify this is a part of that so i can answer all of your questions sincerely but i absolutely genuinely believe that they are besides the point canada has medicare to take care of the sick the next logical step is to provide a basic income to take care of those most direly affected by income inequality if you as an individual are going to take advantage of it so be it thats what its there for but hopefully you spend your money into someones pocket that will grow a business pay taxes and help more people live better
canada,not_removed,crab in a bucket thats you
canada,not_removed,say i get enough money to live no questions asked im not going to work another second most people will not do this though because the quality of life and lifestyle you will be able to have with the basic income will not be enough for most people like now people will want to travel eat what they want to eat drink what they want to drink have nicer things better things bigger house better car or even just car etc etc
canada,not_removed,i guess the one thing i dont understand about basic income is how its going to be paid for borrowed money
canada,not_removed,welfare pays like a month if the basic income cost is thats a month that extra goes a long way saying that its just going to be used for drugs or laziness or potentially driving up costs is just going after easy targets really its just making it so people on welfare can barely crawl out of debt while wanting to take away other stuff like career counseling and programs that get people back into the workforce
canada,not_removed,i hope people quit their jobs maybe then i can find meaningful employment
canada,not_removed,thats because basic income is meant to be a solution to massive automation of production
canada,not_removed,id rather spend all my time getting blazed in my backyard and i cant be the only one im sure thatd be great for a week or two but if you really believe you could spend the next years doing that then yeah youre in a much smaller group than you believe i think
canada,not_removed,youd probably get motivation to work when you run out of savings from your backyard and weed
canada,not_removed,its part of the party platform so very early stages and nowhere close to inevitable or happening soon basically it means that in upcoming elections it will be something they explore expect it to maybe be a part of their budget for the election in or later
canada,not_removed,i think its too early to know how it will play out
canada,not_removed,no plans yet but it seems like its being pushed really hard to sell everyone on it
canada,not_removed,its just big news because its a pretty radical platform
canada,not_removed,this sub is a socialist cicrlejerk thats why
canada,not_removed,i do my job because i love what i do honestly id keep doing it even with basic income in fact id likely be able to put more effort into my career because bills wouldnt be such a pressing issue
canada,not_removed,likely getting zero benefit because id make too much money for mincome to actually be given to me i can only speak to my personal experience but the thought of violent crime scares me the idea of a home invasion or muggingits just scary i would prefer to never be put in that position now lets say youre a mugger or a home invader the government is now paying you a year to not commit crimes are you going to rethink your career choices i cant tell you how much safer i will feel in a society with basic incomebut it will be a lot there are your benefits right there increased safety and security for you and everybody you know
canada,not_removed,this is a guaranteed income we are talking about so it would probably only provide benefits to the poorest of population so the true cost would likely be one fifth of the numbers you quoted this could potentially be paid for by scraping oas gis ei disability programs student loan programs grants and bursaries affordable housing programs childcare grants certain low income tax rebates etc
canada,not_removed,depending how its implemented i never saw this as a way that everyone gets a raise of x amount i saw it as that people who didnt make x amount were brought up to that level so if you make a year the government effectively doesnt pay for that according to there are aprox workers so if the government is not paying the basic income to those people it becomes a lot cheaper i still dont know if thats feasible but it leaves a lot more room in the budget
canada,not_removed,its mincome not universal basic income so only those making below a cutoff would get it using some admittedly outdated numbers from lets do a little napkin math advanced warning im just throwing this together as a quick mess im not an economist or mathematician im just theres canadians reported as income earners for the sake of easy math lets assume that mincome is set at with a clawback on each dollar earned once youve hit earned youre getting zero supplemental about million canadians will get some manner of supplemental payment lets be extremely generous and assume each of the lowest five groups is making the highest amount in their bracket and the last group is making the median income shown for those lowerearning brackets youre going to pay out about billion in mincome payments the most recent number i can find for even assuming ei is totally eliminated by mincome theres still billion left to cover im not arguing one side or another just looking at numbers here and wondering where the rest of its going to come from
canada,not_removed,everyone would receive it though i dont see an opportunity for stigma
canada,not_removed,yup the ol keep the government out of my medicare types or the folks that say they dont get welfare like those other leeches but theyre on every other social program under the sun people have crazy weird understandings about these things
canada,not_removed,every time i read such a pessimistic opinion of humanity i wonder where the person has acquired it i dont think i know a single one personally that would just quit everything and decide to laze about their entire life everyone i know has some dreams the want to accomplish some of those dreams arent profitable but still
canada,not_removed,oh it will happen except it will also come with a minimum labor quota where well be carting unemployed hipsters into the farms at gunpoint welcome to the soviet republic of canukistan
canada,not_removed,reefer madness
canada,not_removed,thank the robots they are the hardest workers of all
canada,not_removed,how addicted are you we might not have to support you for very long
canada,not_removed,thats perfectly fine have fun living in borderline poverty with no new electronics internet or spare money to spend on drugs the reason it is called basic income is because its only enough to provide the bare necessities to keep someone alive
canada,not_removed,it might not go far enoughbut i hope we can agree that it is at the very least a step in the right direction
canada,not_removed,i dont think it will stop lazy people from staying lazy but i believe most people tend to not realize that people want to work and to be a contributing part to society meaningful work means a meaningful life
canada,not_removed,are you for real do you think that you can support anyone other then yourself and even then it would be tough on just minicome bad jobs wont disappear and good jobs will become scarce because its going to be so much more competitive
canada,not_removed,its replies like these that convince me that mincome is doomed to fail you are basically describing a complacent and unmotivated workforce how is that good for anyone other than the lazy worker who cant handle the work
canada,not_removed,isnt there a rule that people must have job offers to get in in the first place nope thats the us system we just look for qualifications that canadian employers may or more may not care about and thats why we have foreign doctors and engineers driving cabs
canada,not_removed,this is the biggest question i mean he did say hed be willing to take a drop in quality of life to pull this off but weed aint cheap and neither is a place with a backyard
canada,not_removed,homeless people can afford drugs it wont be any different for people depending on minicomeand substitute backyard for park and the argument is just as valid
canada,not_removed,sharing a house with people that has a backyard isnt an option growing weed is cheap my friend
canada,not_removed,canada can borrow money to pay for it and pay it back the following year with borrowed money from the year after and so on heres an article i wrote about that thats not how borrowing works in the long term in light of your article you are assuming our country can change the laws back and secure interest free loans year after year
canada,not_removed,out of everything you stated theres one key point that so so many people miss domestic goods goods which are sourced grown and distributed within the country have an external net value of when robots are doing all the farming vehicles are being produced locally and were actually using advanced technologies like thermal depolymerisation to recycle things which would otherwise wind up in landfills we reach a point where we dont actually have to borrow we can produce a surplus of goods and provide an ultimate service to the world really look into what thermal depolymerisation can do we could literally take in the worlds garbage reprocess it into usable oil and generate power while recovering all the metals for production purposes while eliminating of the need for domestic finances within a fully closed system money itself has no value money is a promise of resource later in exchange for something now when we have all the base resource we need we reach a point of equilibrium within a ubi model everyone gets doled out a survivable amount of the resource pool if you want more than that then you work if you are happy spending some time with a sustained but comfortable survival such as the maximum pay out allowed by unemployment insurance in your locale where you can pay your rent have reasonable access to food and all of your baseline communication and entertainment is covered internet phone clothes and a little left over for frivolous things then by all means you should be able to its not costing anyone anything and the toll your existence is placing on the systems only means theres room for someone to come up with optimizations and refinements which makes everyone happy in months or a year or years down the line the individual will get bored of their baseline survival and start putting in the time needed to enhance their lives they will eventually start finding work to do any work they do in such a social model will improve the whole in slight but measurable ways this improvement will increase their allowance of the general resource if done for the public sector or can generate revenue if done in the private sector where they can spend the money on things which are not domestic one must also keep in mind that canada is a resource producer we have oil wells we have lumber we have mining even without taking in external resources our total pool of resources will increase really when we are able to do most of our farming indoors we already do it for chicken and eggs and some fishing japan is adding lettuce to the mix and theres really no reason why we cant produce even larger varieties of food indoors more local to the markets where itll be consumed why wouldnt the cost of food go down sharply if you can produce more food in the same time period due to vertical farming around the clock and yearround how could you get by with charging the same price for the food especially if theres no human intervention needed once established sure youll need mechanical engineers to maintain and repair the robots but farming is already getting close to that now the entire western world is about to be upset due to robots taking jobs and the entire old economic system is going to collapse because of it for anyone curious about how things will play out and how they could play out it starts off with showing the current economic model being upset but the second half is what things could become instead most people stop reading because they hate how heavy handed the first part of the story plays things but thats really the best possible situation under the current methods in place
canada,not_removed,canada can borrow money to pay for it and pay it back the following year with borrowed money from the year after if canada gives to everyone were spending billion on basic income without paying for anything else i dont think running a deficit worth close to of our gdp without paying for anything else is a wise idea to each their own if youre satisfied to live another years getting blazed in your backyard so be it to be honesti dont think youll want to be doing the same thing in years let alone in years im not saying that in years youre going to stand up and be like i dont want to get stoned anymore and now i want to work for the man not like that but youre going to cultivate hobbies youre going to do something and that something might just create value for the people around you i define value well beyond your mother provided you with value and didnt get paid a cent for it and you will provide value for others that you will not be paid for a ubi universal basic income acknowledges that not all value created translates into fiscal value this is a good thing in my opinion the quantified economy misses a lot of the greatest qualities that make everything so valuable so people will substitute leisure for work more often in the dauphin mincome experiment only single mothers and teenagers quit working everyone else kept at it that doesnt change the fact there will be labour supply changes and you can argue that people knew the program would eventually end which is why they never left their jobs we have to break out of the paradigm of how do we pay for it its onetrackmind thinking youre suggesting we spend billion on a program not including the or whatever billion the federal budget is how do we afford a federal budget of billion dollars or of our entire economic productivity is a pretty important question its acknowledging that micromanaging our welfare system is inefficient and that we should simplify it for everyone its saying that everybody should get an income based on income and not based on how old they are or if theyre disabled or if theyre this kind of person or that kind of person so the person in a wheelchair who is unable to work should receive the same amount of assistance as someone who is able to work we are entering a new world where there will be fewer and fewer necessary jobs to maintain and upgrade the world as it is this is a response to that youre referring to technological unemployment there is no more room for gdp growth wat
canada,not_removed,canada can borrow money to pay for it and pay it back the following year with borrowed money from the year after and so on heres an article i wrote about that here is the reason why so many people are screwed like my engineering economic professor money are worth more today so borrow to spend it while this is true and looks good in theoryyou are just one mistake away from going from okey to a shit storm paying the minimum is payment is what screws up asa the interest increase over time right now the current tax avoidance is not worth it as it takes a lot of time just to save a few grand but as the tax percent goes up the roi for avoidance will also increase
canada,not_removed,its a shuffling around of resources to help restructure a millionlarge company a major issue is the most productive employees are not obligated to stay here how would you feel if you lived with your whole extended family and they hit you up for money so they didnt have to work you might just say screw them and move out like hundreds of thousands of your brothers and sisters have done already
canada,not_removed,this guy
canada,not_removed,welfare pays like a month yeah right i wish the rules for some quebec welfare recipients are about to get tougher under the parti québécois government as it stands a singleperson household gets a month on social assistance for households with young children or for individuals years old and up an extra is normally tacked on
canada,not_removed,welfare pays like a month yeah no
canada,not_removed,thats what i figured that it would be part of the next election platform but an article in another thread said that is was passed and flagged as a priority which seemed pretty intense so soon haha
canada,not_removed,dude our dad was the best
canada,not_removed,this sub has been creaming their pants over the idea of basic income for years now its not a surprise since its overwhelmingly populated by broke kids in university who cant find jobs because they have zero life skills or work experience and blame their lack of success on everything but themselves its the same reason why we see constant hate towards baby boomers immigrants real estate the workers in the oil patch etc etc
canada,not_removed,likely bills would be a more pressing issue for you mincome will be like
canada,not_removed,httpimgsxkcdcomcomicscompilingpng title compiling titletext are you stealing those lcds yeah but im doing it while my code compiles stats this comic has been referenced times representing of referenced xkcds httpswwwxkcdcom httpswwwredditcomrxkcd httpswwwredditcomrxkcdtranscriber httpxkcdrefinfostatistics
canada,not_removed,the stigma will be around the people who choose to be lazy i think there will still be somewhat of a stigma for people that cant get work but anyone who openly admits they just sit around all day doing nothing and are happy about it will definitely be looked down upon most
canada,not_removed,something something lazy people taking our tax dollars something something they dont work as hard as me people are going to be pissed poor people shouldnt get help apparently
canada,not_removed,everyone would receive it though thats mathematically impossible the total federal revenue is less than half of what would be needed to give every canadian a year
canada,not_removed,that includes people i have met on ontario works shit do they want to work they really do not only that but the mincome experiment showed more people completing high school and less psychiatric visits both big reasons people are on ow
canada,not_removed,as long as our mechanical overlords are kind they will be heroes
canada,not_removed,joke posts cant have joke post responses come on now p
canada,not_removed,then why dont we give these people what they really need housing food and training
canada,not_removed,im starting to think i sould have added s
canada,not_removed,if they spend all the money on drugs we could deny them food and shelter unless they voluntarily check into a labour camp ban all charity as well and let the problem sort itself out in a callous but fair way
canada,not_removed,most people really miss the boat on this one honestly i could not care less about the lazy people they are lazy and generally worthless and in any economic system they will be a burden i care about the majority of people who want to be contributing members of society but have their ambitions stymied because they need to support themselves or their families so they have to take on any work they can if they had a better safety net there is a better chance for them to become community organizers entrepreneurs artists or just get educated all of which will have a more positive outcome on our society than having them work jobs in the service industry just to make ends meet
canada,not_removed,why would they be more competitive because people would have more opportunity for educationtraining
canada,not_removed,you are basically describing a complacent and unmotivated workforce this assumes that the workforce is motivated only by this is the case for some and that wont change but it will allow people to pursue jobs that they are passionate about but still make a living if it isnt a knock out of the park success
canada,not_removed,i see outcomes in regards to the poster you replied to people are no longer forced to put up with bullshit at a job they hate because they cant afford to quit to look for another job this means people constantly quit until management is forced to change either policy their team leads or wages until they can keep a stable workforce this is the best scenario imo people continue quitting and instead of thinking what can we do better to keep our employees companies complain to the government and replace all employees with tfws who will continue to work for low wages in shit conditions this is the worst case
canada,not_removed,hah people arent motivated by threats theyre terrified by them what we have now is an unmotivated workforce
canada,not_removed,yeah the other thing id love to see is the complete elimination of the tfw program or to have it limited to the extremely niche doctoral specialists that might actually be needed
canada,not_removed,claim refugee status people can claim all they want but that doesnt mean it is accepted from only of refugee claims for canada were accepted in this jumped to because of the syrian crisis
canada,not_removed,homeless people can afford drugs not through government assistance alone have you ever done drugs maintaining any sort of habit is far from cheap
canada,not_removed,no laws need to be changed these are the current laws they just arent being exercised
canada,not_removed,if you are happy spending some time with a sustained but comfortable survival such as the maximum pay out allowed by unemployment insurance in your locale where you can pay your rent have reasonable access to food and all of your baseline communication and entertainment is covered internet phone clothes and a little left over for frivolous things then by all means you should be able to you just described the situation of my life and i work hours a week holy god
canada,not_removed,how countries pay for things and how you and i pay for things are not just orders of magnitude of difference its the equivalent of the quantum physics ruleset compared to einsteins
canada,not_removed,theres a huge difference between a countrys debts and an individuals debts so much so that your analogy is irrelevant even if you were making reference to the same thing i was talking about which you actually arent i was making reference to the bank of canada act stipulates that the bank may and thats the operative word make loans to the government of canada or the government of any province but such loans outstanding at any one time shall not in the case of the government of canada exceed onethird of the estimated revenue of the government of canada for its fiscal year and shall not in the case of a provincial government exceed onefourth of that governments estimated revenue for its fiscal year and such loans shall be repaid before the end of the first quarter after the end of the fiscal year of the government that has contracted the loan
canada,not_removed,you want to move out of canada one of the best places in the world to live go ahead i think thats a false equivalence and fear mongering anyone willing to leave the country for a few extra dollars isnt really the kind of person who is contributing the most value to society
canada,not_removed,so now we have basic income everyone gets if it ever happens it will be more like its supposed to be the bare minimum to live not enough for you to kick back and enjoy the good life there will be no extra money for fun cars travel nice food etc one thing that most people dont mention though is that with basic income we could remove the minimum wage because people would be free to leave terrible jobs if they wanted the terrible jobs would have to pay more to get people to do them instead of relying on people needing it to survive this would open up a whole slew of new job possibilities that people like you could do on your couch at home that are really easy but are unaffordable with the current minimum wage
canada,not_removed,baby boomers are the reason mincome as a concept even exists just retire and then you can bitch at kids who dont have jobs because you hadnt left
canada,not_removed,sad
canada,not_removed,sign me up
canada,not_removed,this is absolutely correct as someone who was a recent victim of a break and enter ive experienced it first hand got a call from the police about a month later that my laptop had been recovered on a search warrant being enacted on the premises of a suspected drug dealer along with a lot of other stolen property that was found it had been stolen by a drug addict and sold to the dealer in exchange for drugs the officer i was speaking with said the majority of break and enters in the city are committed by either drug addicts or organized crime gang members which kind of overlaps with drug addicts i guess
canada,not_removed,my only experience with a breakin was a guy who wanted to pay for his wow obsession literally the first charge on my credit card he got a plethora of magically swords i am sure
canada,not_removed,this is true but drug addiction is majorly but of course not by any means exclusively fueled as a temporary escape from lifes problems for rich people its the pressure of a very burdensome career for poor people its the stress of no financial stability im not sold on basic income or its softer alternative cousins but im open to exploring the idea especially with the whole remove minimum wage and social programs angle
canada,not_removed,do you have a source for the claim about drug addiction do you have any idea how easy it is to blow through what if it were put into your bank account at a time struggling families would probably see an improvement in their life for sure but its not struggling families robbing you at knife point bud i cant fathom risking for the in my pockets and my three year old phone poverty and financial insecurity do horrible things to your brain
canada,not_removed,i think itll become more common to work like hour weeks for a lot of people sure a culture of competing over who can work the highest number of hours will develop but only among the shitheads who already do it nobody likes them anyway i cant wait to see their bumper stickers though some people will say theyre leaving the jobs for those who need them single parents for instance which is another reason why the conservativeprone will oppose the practice and that explanation will be valid in many cases
canada,not_removed,when people are deliberately quitting to live on it thats not helping thats a parasite when someone ends up in a tough spot because of job closure injury or illness those are unfortunate poor people there will be a stigma for any individual who lives indefinitely on assistance without a health career option or disability issue
canada,not_removed,theyll be able to get food with this as well as housing training is relatively cheap for the trades and other training programs are affordable depending on what you want to do
canada,not_removed,coffee cigarettes and alcohol television internet video games sex shopping food not all vices are illegal who are you to judge
canada,not_removed,pretty much if minicome exists and i decide to work a im going to get as high up on the ladder as possible to make the most amount of money others will do the same why work hour weeks as a frontline worker making meager pay if i can work part time doing something stupid and have minicome maybe im ignorant but i have a hard time believing that people want to be baristas at starbucks hours a week
canada,not_removed,completely agree right now the only thing keeping me in a job i dislike is the fact that i cant survive without it with a minimum income i could go back to school or look for a new jo b without worrying about going bankrupt i am motivated to work because i want more from life than just sitting around i want to do more so i am one of those people who will want more money to do more things i suspect there are a lot of people like me
canada,not_removed,this would be required otherwise people born here get edged out of the lower end job market because companies just continue paying shit wages and work conditions and bring in tfw to replace people that cant stand it anymore
canada,not_removed,how many more underthetable jobs do you think are really out there that its going to allow a large chunk of people to work like that
canada,not_removed,i have done drugs been an addict as well if someone was giving me a day when i was an addict that would go towards drugs
canada,not_removed,secure interest free loans year after year this part is just not possible no lender would do that and even if they did they would collapse soon
canada,not_removed,because its ridiculously dumb to expect anyone to give you a zerointerest loan
canada,not_removed,here in alberta the maximum payout by unemployment is weeks this is just enough for basic survival for me currently for rent for a which includes utilities so im ahead of the game there with a little extra so i can have more than beans and rice to eat yes im unemployed no i dont want to have such a baseline survival rate and yes when i was working making i was still in favor of ubi i loved my job i wanted to stick around but massive restructuring is something that happens during such deep recessions as were having which means everyone loses out i havent even had an interview in the months since despite well over applications companies are being swamped with applications so they cant even take the top candidates only the first thousand or so who are quicker than the others will even have a fraction of a chance of being seen the jobs arent there not ones that can pay the bills anyway
canada,not_removed,like cancer this school of thought eventually kills your society so looking at trade offs and modelling how policies impact the economy is killing society were already feeling the affects of late stage capitalism and automation so higher productivity is bad
canada,not_removed,thats some great work confusing the issue but trade deficits are pretty basic under your household analogy to buyimport the things we want we need to earn moneyexport things or run up debt to cover the difference you cant just run up the tab forever buying all the things you want because you deserve them dammit eventually no one will want to lend you money anymore the world doesnt owe the members of this household a comfortable life we have to earn it and if you let everyone in the house slack off and chase off the ones who dont by skimming all the fruits of their labour its going to end badly
canada,not_removed,yes there are a huge difference but money is money emergency can come in different forms wild fire flood snow storm there are a number of infinite problems that can go wrong so what the whole town goes up in flame and all the federal government says is gl but all the funds are used in ubi that is estimated revenues once you release the plans and people see the tax increase what do you think people would do spend to avoid the extra tax probably more might as well since i am spending the money or pay extra to let some other people smooch off the problem with this system and why this system will never work because you are always playing with someone elses money and eventually you run out of someone elses money
canada,not_removed,i used to think it was the best before i grew up and the veneer wore off i think i could actually get over all the other ills if the housing market in the job centers wasnt fucked but thats another topic youre actually dead on i dont contribute much beyond the piles of dollars but how many people really do just so happens dollars are the thing youre talking about splashing around
canada,not_removed,i know a ton of people who moved to the usa and live better off higher income lower price for everything and still decent area i feel like we respond with shame too often if someone criticizes this country
canada,not_removed,case in point theres always someone to blame
canada,not_removed,you think junkies and people who rob people think logically ha if you are scared about home invasions you need help they are extremely uncommon in canada
canada,not_removed,to be entirely honest with you i would be one of those people ill use another comment i wrote to illustrate exactly why ive never been homeless ive always been able to pay what little bills ive had and theres always been food on the table but i have been below the poverty line the main reason for this was a previous job after a really tough time in my life battling depression i needed to get a job to support myself and try to pull myself up in the world i didnt have any relevant training or education and essentially i was looking for a bare bones bottom of the barrel job i got a full time gig at a car detailing center it was by a longshot the worst job i have ever had they shoved me into the washrack there were several industrial blowers going at all times there was no communicating or socializing with coworkers because of this i only ever started talking to people in the last few months i was there because business was slowing down i was frequently soaked through and through and because of the mandatory uniform i couldnt wear decent water resistant gear i had to buy my own waterproof footwear because the boots they supplied were such poor quality that i was in constant pain whenever i wore them the work practically revolved around the weather and there were at times weeks where i was told not to come in or sent home because of this my average paycheque for two weeks was and in the end i was let go because i had to take doctor ordered sick leave at christmas time because my feet had frostbite my best friend is in a similar situation he works nights at a fast food chain i cant say much about the work apart from the fact that he finds it absolutely soul grinding and due to the incompetence of the managers and the massive turnover rate he works hours plus overtime six nights a week during his one day off hes too tired to do anything he cant make plans he cant take trips and hes taken up smoking just to deal with the stress and in many cases the only way to move up in these jobs is for somebody else above them to leave being stuck in a cycle of poverty is absolutely toxic to your mental and physical health and oftentimes it is compounded by the bottom of the barrel shit jobs that people have no choice but to take in order to survive if i had a chance to take some time away from work do my own thing go to school and not have to worry about how im going to pay rent i would take that chance in a heartbeat
canada,not_removed,but low income people arent usually the smartest with money i want to help these people but giving them fistfuls of cash is shortsighted and wont solve any problems longterm
canada,not_removed,if beyond housing and food you can afford training then whats to stop from putting that money towards drugselectronicsetc instead
canada,not_removed,theyll get their housing and their food covered as well as basic survival requirements training youll see a lot of the mcjobs vanish entirely that means they require technical expertise welcome to the internet where you can learn almost anything you feel like you just have to apply a dime of effort to improve your lot for stuff you require more material access to learn such as mechanical engineering which will be the baseline janitorial jobs to maintain the robots youll be going to school to do if someone really wants to spend all their time getting stoned let them doesnt hurt anyone but themselves im sure those pot producers are growing their own that means there will be an encouragement to build the tools locally to keep everything under the table and not across borders ultimately more of that ubi resource is remaining in the country prices going up not going to happen especially on homes it means that the population is going to spread out with people moving away from the high price high concentration centers and go to places where the current cost of living is cheaper itll all equalize across the board apartment prices will come down because theyll be under pressure to be able to provide an affordable suite for people on ubi this will mean that homelessness will be mostly eradicated yeah there will still be slums full of people who dont want to move up in life but those who do they can relocate anywhere in the country thats whats great about it being universal so people move the population redistributes the reason for population centralization goes away as many jobs will simply melt off but with everything done locally its a closed system so a few people here and there have a lot more time on their hands and start coming up with ideas because its universal everyone gets a piece of the pie a few people move in together to pool their resources because they have an idea and suddenly you have a startup a new software company or some hobbyist robotics team who have seen a particular niche that needs to be filled and have decided to fill it themselves ill snag from higher up in the thread we should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living it is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest the youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living we keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because according to malthusian darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist so we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors the true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living really thats all it takes one in ten thousand to come up with an idea and put in the time to implement it maybe theyll recruit a few friends maybe a small group will get together at a hackerspace where the tools and materials are and prototype something to prove it works something big enough that can be a genuine game changer sure market it market it internationally bring in more money more resources yeah youll be paying lots and lots in corporate taxes but ultimately youre still coming out way ahead and you wind up with the biggest safety net the world has ever seen an entire country of support think of all those people who have had ideas for ways to improve things in areas with critical levels of poverty world countries and the like but theyre held back by not having the time money or connections to make anything happen give them the time let them make their own connections and pool resources to have the money and suddenly things change even without corporate funding a few good ideas can be taped and bolted together to create a great idea anyway i tend to ramble on when it comes to concepts leading to the eventual postscarcity economy were on the edge of theres so much to talk about but so many are afraid of the fundamental changes that are needed for anyone who doubts ill just ask one simple question if you personally had all your financial burden taken care of all your shelter food and clothing providing for your basic entertainment and access to information given to you and a thousand peers to collaborate with what would you do with your life to fan your own spark of creativity for all the world to see
canada,not_removed,i judge all of those equally i judge because nobody else had considered what to do to help these people if i was in that situation its exactly how id expect myself to be treated
canada,not_removed,im no trying to be rude but it sounds like your argument is that there would be more competition in the workplace for the ambitious and that you want protection for that thats a very antifreemarket stance
canada,not_removed,canada isnt you or me canada can print its own currency and
canada,not_removed,this isnt a you and me this is the laws of the financial system within the bank of canada this is how it worked consistently from before and it worked great and kept our national debt relatively low did you even
canada,not_removed,with your job you had plenty of opportunity to pump your savings into the stratosphere right
canada,not_removed,i am in alberta i make about per pay cheque good to know my full time job situation is as bad as people on ei i love the way this site constantly cripples me emotionally
canada,not_removed,you cant just run up the tab forever buying all the things you want because you deserve them dammit eventually no one will want to lend you money anymore forever i disagree that we would run an eternal deficit i believe a ubi would be fiscally beneficial in the midterm eventually eventually wont happen in the midterm were talking about the future here i predict this will work in the future youre saying it wont work in the future neither of us can be proven wrong or right even with past data this is an absolutely unique scenario neither of us know what would happen and to be frank i think its an arrogant standpoint to be firm to say that this wont work when there are a lot of really vying for it from a lot of different academic domains
canada,not_removed,its not i was at this event the basic income earth network congress spend some time and before this event i hadnt heard about the idea afterwards i was an advocate i get that you have a viscerally strong attachment to moneythats not uncommon but do not let your strict adherence be your undoing the httpwwwusdebtclockorg the sun is kilometers away from us there are numbers that are so astronomically large that we cannot comprehend them seriously our heads just cant wrap around themwe can say ok i get it million km away but that doesnt mean shit even saying that it walking at it would take years to get there doesnt mean shit the scale is too big you dont need to understand this to know that the studies behind it show that it will be the greatest forward leap for our society since medicare and that there are a hell of a lot of very smart and noble people that believe in it incredibly strongly debt is make believe seriously its make believe you can say that you get it but if youre still here arguing with me you really dont nineteen trillion things that dont look like they should work are still working the liberals were elected on a deficit budget because spending during a down economy is the smartest way to turn it around this is that on a huge scale heres a httpbasicincomeeuropeorgubiebriefhistorybasicincomeideas seriously read debt the first years youre hooked on an old notionas are the vast majority of us note my name im very futureoriented our education is not geared towards nextlevel thinking there was even an article that talked about how high school economics textbooks were going to change because httppositivemoneyorg an npo dedicated to educating people about money showed that they had been spreading false information there is a gigantic gap of comprehension going onits so much more complicated than how can we pay for it i wont be able to convince you if youre stuck on that im sorry if you think this is a copout economics is a soft science wrapped up with moral philosophy im calling into question the moral philosophy and making a case for a more holistic economy that recognizes wealth on a much grander scale this was posted in the other thread but its worth posting over and over this is a quote from httpsbfiorgaboutfullerbiographywhowasbuckminsterfuller we should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living it is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest the youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living we keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because according to malthusian darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist so we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors the true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living
canada,not_removed,youre actually dead on i dont contribute much beyond the piles of dollars but how many people really do great question in about in canadians aged and over donated their time energy and skills to charities and nonprofit organizations the approximately billion volunteer hours they contributed is equivalent to more than million fulltime jobs source just so happens dollars are the thing youre talking about splashing around nobody pays me to keep the tree in my backyard standing but if i chopped it down i could make from the lumber something isnt right about a system that values extraction and devalues preservation basic income is a way of recognizing alternative value
canada,not_removed,i stand by my statement i appreciate canada for the people contributing value beyond financial wealth good people move away but theres way more than simply oh they raised taxes so im leaving the picture that was painted was two dimensional and that person doesnt exist in real life
canada,not_removed,you are making an awful lot of assumptions
canada,not_removed,cause and effect not blame there are relatively simple outcomes from making poor decisions just depends on who you believe the poor decision makers are hint not millennials
canada,not_removed,yes but the backing of those gangs comes from kids who tended to grow up in poverty who have experienced a cycle of abuses even drug abuse trends heavily with people who havent completed a high school diploma or who grew up in poverty it all starts from the distribution of wealth strong middle classes naturally neutralize
canada,not_removed,if you are scared about home invasions you need help for having fears i they are extremely uncommon in canada yeahexcept it happened around the corner from the very safe neighborhood i live inand i know several people personally who have experienced exactly this sure its anecdotalbut it hit close to home
canada,not_removed,it is kind of hard to seem like you are smart with money when you are poor it is a lot easier to tell someone to do something than to actually do it whatever genius way you think you would deal with being poor it would not work having a savings account is basically only for emergencies it will always disappear not every poor person made horrible choices some are in incredibly difficult situations and are suffering mental health problems as a result i fucked up my future am fixing it now and am poor because i grew up gay in rural ontario and had suicidal tendencies towards the end of highschool right when i should have been starting my lifebecause of homophobia which was something i could not control but severely affected how i thought the world was going to treat me i spent the majority of my early battling depression going to therapy when i could afford to and even trying anti depressants i do not have a hormonal problem or anything genetic to give me this being gay literally gave me the depression because my environment was homophobic so now here i am poor i did not choose to not focus on my schooling i straight up could not even think about my schooling because it did not matter i was going to kill myself eventually and it would have been a waste not saying every poor person is like this but many have had tough lives that prevented them from bettering themselves thank god i eventually overcame my depression by myself though it returns sometimes so i can focus on bettering myself but it has made me realize that not all poor people are just lazy eggheads that make shitty decisions some of them just never were in the right mind frame to actually better themselves
canada,not_removed,by and large they tend to manage money not terribly some will screw up but that will be the case no matter what what evidence do you have to support a massive categorically different level of mismanagement of money among the poor relative to the middle class
canada,not_removed,because people may not need training im perfectly fine with people doing whatever they want with the money
canada,not_removed,im not sure who youre responding to im in support of ubi
canada,not_removed,not at all i was countering the original point that bad jobs would still exist and that yes employers would have a tough time finding people to do those jobs
canada,not_removed,i do kinda agree with everything your saying i guess the main thing i disagree with is that theres going to be significantly more people leeching off the system than there are now but thats impossible to figure out really although presumably people already leeching of the system or even working crappy low paying jobs already dont pay taxes because they get it all back in credits also theoretically this would replace all other social programs but in reality it wed probably still offer a little extra to physically handicapped people and give extra to people who waste their free money because we somehow feel responsible for people who dont even accept responsibility for themselves if anything was going to wreck any sort of mincome scheme this would be it i think
canada,not_removed,print its own currency that devalues the currency not maybe not its complicated and not we dont quite understand it print more and the value goes down printing more on the scale needed to cover the costs mentioned above compared to the size of our economy would put our dollar in a tailspin would need to raise amount of basic income drastically to cover the rising inflation and print more and more money to achieve those amounts countries may not be people but there are basic economic rules that affect them just as surely
canada,not_removed,opportunity yeah but i didnt do it at all until my last few months i have to hold me over once unemployment runs out i spent my money on friends trying to keep them afloat and let them get ahead of things in the end we all failed to keep up
canada,not_removed,no not just ei this is the absolute maximum for ei only because of how much i made before losing my job if i were working a more reasonable job making before taxes id be making about on ei
canada,not_removed,while productivity is higher wages are substaintially lower than where they should be based off of what immense wealth hording from the upper classes of society this is an argument that is worth making then add in automation which is already causing layoffs and will continue to do so automation has increased productivity and reduced prices on things automation can also be seen as a compliment to labour the current model of looking at how automation interacts with labour is through sbtc skill biased technical change from david autor out of mit but the just of it is productivity increases tend to favour those who are able to use the technology have skills human comparative advantage will always allow us to trend towards full employment provided we still have any form of advantage
canada,not_removed,and you think people does this out of the goodness of their heart naw you do it because it looks good on your resume which increase your chances of getting a job
canada,not_removed,but theres way more than simply oh they raised taxes so im leaving so doubling mtrs and assuming zero behavioural change is ok
canada,not_removed,sorry wasnt trying to attack you i agree there are more reasons to stay here than taxes but if someone is good enough for immigration purposes and already fed up they may leave imo but there are plenty of reasons to stay hopefully premier whyne doesnt change that
canada,not_removed,because of course all the blame has to be put on a previous generation and theres no possible way that anyone else could possibly be partly to blame fuck i love the rcanada mindset
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,do you think that increasing our debt and paying interest to people outside our country is increasing our countrys dollar value what would have our dollar be worth more if our debt was the size and we paid less interest or our current situation
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,i know so many adults that volunteer that arent padding their cvs thats a really sad and cynical point of view youve shared let alone simply inaccurate
canada,not_removed,mtr mass transit rail my takehome rate no politician would double taxes overnight and expect to survive you and i both know that so why suggest it as a possibility
canada,not_removed,youre part of that though arent you theres just no way previous generations are at fault for anything is there gotta be these little lazy brat millennials
canada,not_removed,what the heck thats sad
canada,not_removed,its well established that drug use is higher among the poor im not arguing that the question is in what basis do we justify applying this to the whole category of poor persons that is restrictive measures rather than money youve established that some poor abuse drugs but what you have to demonstrate are that all or virtually all poor are poor managers of money because your statement was that the poor are generally poor managers of it
canada,not_removed,the future with robots is gonna be a huge overhaul regardless of what kinda of system we have unless were ok with an elite few and the vast majority stuck in poverty this isnt unique to mincome though its almost a completely separate issue from the way that i see it because its something we have to figure out no matter how social services are set up people like to tie the two issues together and they definitely relate with each other but dont have any dependence on each other
canada,not_removed,there is an argument to be made about the composition of the compensation which is a discussion worth having what needs to be understood here is that the automation brought on by the industrial revolution and the era that came shortly after is fundamentally different from the automation being brought about by the information age to quote cgpgrey machines dont have to be better than humans they just have to be good enough and cheaper were already at this point for a good deal of jobs mostly in the transportation and service sectors humans have no advantage whatsoever once technology is good enough and cheaper we wouldnt even have to have everyone laid off either we only need comparative advantage not absolute advantage unless youre suggesting that we will have unlimited resources to make an unlimited amount of machines to do an unlimited amount of jobs in which case congratulations youve made it to the post scarcity world enjoy drinking mountain dew and playing cod advance warfare all day
canada,not_removed,lets be honest here go ask any volunteer would they continue to help out if the place does not provide any sort of reference if they require that in canadian aged and over is going to drop massively its a barter system you give some you get something in return it may be padding their cv it may be spending time with their kids you always get something in return have you apply to university you know on the application form they always have a field asking have you ever volunteer at anywhere if so where and for how long also the static doesnt show the age grouping age that is like everyone in high school to retire people
canada,not_removed,marginal tax rate true but no economist in their right mind would assume zero behavioural change when increasing mtrs
canada,not_removed,im not saying there isnt blame elsewhere im saying this subs members are notorious for blaming literally everyone else for any any perceived hardship or slight in their lives god forbid you dont have a job paying a year in vancouver at years old and live in a bedroom house that costs the world must be out to get you if you dont have it easy im only trying to point out just how ridiculous this sub is for blaming everyone and everything for anything wrong with our country
canada,not_removed,well obviously there is no stat saying all poor people suck i just rather help people become productive members of society rather than fund their lifestyle choices
canada,not_removed,resources are the least of our concerns when it comes to automation off world mining wont be a dream if you can use machines to do the majority of work and the universe is plentiful with resources httpwwwplanetaryresourcescomhomeintro
canada,not_removed,its the literal history of money and debt you have such strong opinions on something you are adamantly refusing to understand
canada,not_removed,jeez buddy you just keep saying i dont get it and the person says heres a book explaining it to you and you respond with ill just pass laziness stop giving the rest of us potheads a bad name
canada,not_removed,but no economist in their right mind would assume zero behavioural change when increasing mtrs if we want an accurate picture i think this now moves into the realm of actuarial mathematics and working with many many many possible economic sociological anthropological and cultural metrics to gauge the change in overall value sure we can judge x number of people making y money left the country and that leaves z dent in the economybut it doesnt take into consideration the vast array of changes and benefits that will come along because of a basic incomenor can it just because theres only one thing we can measure accurately does not mean that using that one accurate measurement creates an accurate holistic picture in fact id argue that it skews it more than anything to be fiscallyfocused and shortsighted
canada,not_removed,millennials and younger have gotten the short end of the stick economicwise and have it much worse than any other previous generation i dont fault them for complaining at all what i do fault them for is their continuing foray into ever progressing read decaying social liberal values when these values actually end up hurting them theyre too dumb to understand why and how in my eyes they then have a tougher time turning around and blamingyou for their troubles
canada,not_removed,ubi would likely do that with far fewer people either resorting to crime and many more having an opportunity to get education where it wasnt an option before it also forces wages to rise for menial tasks which helps them afford closer to a living wage
canada,not_removed,the new york review of books called an encyclopedic survey an authoritative account of the background to the recent crisis an exhaustive engaging and occasionally exasperating book david graeber is an economist anarchism is selforganized systems without the use of force for coercion youre quick to judge and slow to learn reflect on yourself try to stop judging others try to stop judging yourself empathy will be your friend reflect
canada,not_removed,my god too
canada,not_removed,here someone else you can dismiss this is tell me about how deeply you can grasp his macroeconomic explanations and why hes wrong
canada,not_removed,i do not believe this someone just out for attention
canada,not_removed,the issue is that border guards have an awful lot of discretion so if they have an issue with you or story or the colour of your carjackethairshoeswhatever they can deny you entry on the other hand the fact that he was told hed have to wait a couple of hours to speak to a supervisor seemssort of shitty edit what i was trying to get at was that its within the realm of possibility that he just was unlucky and got a guard that had an issue with same sex marriagelgbtq folks in general or maybe not who knows
canada,not_removed,i cross the border constantly havent had a single problem
canada,not_removed,so many of these stories popping up can anyone speak to the legitimacy of this stuff nothing has changed at our boarder crossing so if this is a problem now it was a problem before
canada,not_removed,as a gay married person asking because thats the crux of the issue being presented
canada,not_removed,the us has the right to deny anyone and there really isnt a way to prove of he is telling the truth so id say take it with a grain of salt
canada,not_removed,it may just be of interest to the media it might have always happened
canada,not_removed,there is a change its called that big cheeto running their country and making the officers feel more emboldened
canada,not_removed,they dont fucking ask your sexual preference a the border derp derp
canada,not_removed,no but he mentioned he was going down there to buy his husband stuff
canada,not_removed,can anybody recommend some good gloves to play with httpswwwfacebookcomwherethehighwayends
canada,not_removed,hype
canada,not_removed,of course its mario kart ive never seen anything but nintendo games plastered up on the giant makeshift screens
canada,not_removed,banjo kazooie i think that was i thought you said games sorry never used gloves
canada,not_removed,are you the same guys who did that road to yellowknife youtube series really enjoyed it you should do some similar films to different locations
canada,not_removed,if you go to this much trouble to play outside you should also get a outdoor heater
canada,not_removed,thanks id love to do something big for the its not cheap though i organized and funded the trip the youtube video was made by my good friend luke graham
canada,not_removed,pretty much all fathers of young families what a sad day hope the families can rely on the community support rip
canada,not_removed,cool i will try to at least catch the episode that will show ed force one
canada,not_removed,this is from the same group that has organized antiliberalndp protests so while this stuff in the video could be accurate it certainly isnt coming from a genuine news source
canada,not_removed,im sure this piece by therebelmedia is factually correct and not biased in any way right
canada,not_removed,wrong sub i suggest posting it in rmetacanada
canada,not_removed,rebel media tho 🤢
canada,not_removed,this snarky smarmy tone is so done deliver your message make a few jokes dont be boring all of these items have had to have been negotiated and run through parliament trudeau is not a dictator everything is a negotiation pleasepleasethink for a second
canada,not_removed,the only person broken in all this is lauren southern what a miserable human being and clearly thinks shes informed simply because the subhuman altright are attracted to her booooooring
canada,not_removed,you know lauren has hit another home run when the left goes into a frenzy with zero arguments
canada,not_removed,ganized antiliberalndp protests so while this stuff in the video could be accurate it certainly isnt coming from a genuine news source what makes a news source not genuine
canada,not_removed,which part is factually incorrect
canada,not_removed,the girls hot so who cares
canada,not_removed,seriously they will never get clicks from me
canada,not_removed,uh oh a place youve decided you dont like is making a thing you refuse to watch
canada,not_removed,canadians hate rebel media love feminism love saudi arabia and hate logic and facts
canada,not_removed,why
canada,not_removed,hmmmm i didnt like this video for soooo many reasons and it missed one of the big ones which was to help the vets when they actually reopened a law suite against the vets that harpers government realized was political suicide to keep going so they closed down but i do want to comment on trudeau is not a dictactor on the face that may be true and our political system is not a dictatorship it is however how our system actually functions if there is a majority government and once the current government has established enough of their cronies in the upper house now keeping people and parties out of this look at it this way our pm whomever they may be has a majority government and has appointed enough senators to have the upper house like minded as the pm now just say you are a senator with said party the party leader then introduces a bill if the system was to work correctly you could vote for the bill or vote against it if you didnt believe in it but that is not party politics if you dont want to be thrown to the back bench and you want the party to vote in favour of you at any time in the future you have to vote for the the party line there is no way for the bill not to get pushed to the senate once at the senate again they are like minded as the current party so it gets the thumbs up basically if the pm of a majority government wants something passed they can pass it asap i like to think of our system when it is a majority goverment as a dictatorship you vote for again that is just my thoughts and that is why i wish more people would vote independent
canada,not_removed,subhuman i bet you think theyre fascist too
canada,not_removed,what makes a person subhuman
canada,not_removed,here comes the salt truck delicious
canada,not_removed,brilliant brilliant defense of liberal policy in the past months just brilliant not oh and subhuman really because they disagree with you well sieg heil there buddy too funny
canada,not_removed,did you come to that conclusion by carefully avoiding the arguments made in this thread its like when someone on the right gets all worked up reading a news story on cbc and lament on how they didnt report on so and so dying because he wasnt a gay liberal this is from an actual comment even though they did in fact run multiple stories on so and so dying not knowing something personally isnt the same as something not existing
canada,not_removed,id say impartiality is a key aspect id say rebel is more of a commentaryopinion conduit
canada,not_removed,the libel convictions keep piling up so theres that also the person who runs the revel testified that hes not a journalist
canada,not_removed,i guess completing and currently doing another of the promises is just about none httpswwwtrudeaumetreca i mean you can dislike people all you want but please dont put propaganda echo chambers at face value also the fucking dank meme that is the election one he hasnt actually broken this yet but we think he will also the whole oh no he was months late he broke his promise like his timeline might have been off but he still completed his goal then end airstrikes yea he did stop the airstrikes like he said but he kept people on the ground so uh were just going to say he broke this aswell number even we just dont think he will legalize it and then number like just not even a cohesive point hurr durr his hair waaah like shit this is riamverysmart level of memes
canada,not_removed,nothing seems factually incorrect per se to me but it still the typical bias fact cherry picking and deceptiveness that rebel media is notorious for
canada,not_removed,thats a man
canada,not_removed,interesting perspective you are aware that levant has been repeatedly convicted of libel right seems like it would be hard to defend a convicted liar of being someone who delivers facts logically i mean
canada,not_removed,im sorry youre so angry i know theres a lot to be mad about given the state of things and how bad they could potentially get but try and find some positivity and lash out less like an extremist at everything left and liberal most people reside somewhere in the middle and are very open to facts and logic when you actually have a valid argument and not just an angry offensive comment hyperpartisanism is what has made american politics so impotent we really dont need that here
canada,not_removed,a real democracy would put issues on the board and vote on them then elect people to make them happen
canada,not_removed,the altright of course because nownazis are fascists
canada,not_removed,being an altright troll is a good start ezra
canada,not_removed,triggered
canada,not_removed,commentaryopinion conduit they are definitely an news organization with a stated political bent but they do more than say the young turks who only do commentary and opinions they are actually sending out reporters and breaking news stories no one else is touching i think the fact that they state their bias and preference outright makes them more credible than news organizations feigning impartiality while clearly supporting clinton such as the cbc and cnn what do you think
canada,not_removed,lauren southern does not have any libel convictions and guilty by association is an ad hominem
canada,not_removed,i guess completing and currently doing another of the promises is just about none the title is about broken campaign promises your link says they have broken promises i think it is fair to highlight the largest ones of those broken promises
canada,not_removed,on the refugees thing he only completed his goal because he modified his goal after the fact when january came along and they only had of the refugees in the country they were hit with a real problem how do they get more government sponsored refugees into the country they realized that bringing in that many government sponsored refugees would be absolutely impossible so in order to make it happen they rescinded their promise to allow for an unlimited number of privately sponsored refugees and changed it so that all refugees would be counted towards a single number rather than having private vs government sponsored refugees keep in mind httpswwwliberalcarealchangesyrianrefugees was government sponsored refugees and as many private sponsorships they could process with increased funding that would mean more than refugees by not less by monkeying the numbers this allowed them to bring in the refugees by march their new deadline the old promise called for more refugees by january a total of refugees httpwwwcicgccaenglishrefugeeswelcome during the campaign harper of having too much red tape when taking in refugees but has since created there is still yet any work on eliminating the requirement for a un designation of being a refugee before canada accepts them admitted a year after harper was out of office the way in which we were doing refugees before simply needed to be expanded not changed we ended up going with harpers plan but pretended that it was trudeaus plan
canada,not_removed,which facts are they cherry picking
canada,not_removed,which is funny because it is actually true
canada,not_removed,canadas legal system is completely out of whack and ruled by irrational feminazis wasnt a guy basically arrested for something he posted on twitter trying to defend himself cause some bitches didnt like it your country is even worse than the us in terms of regressive left takeover
canada,not_removed,that muslims love feminism and canadian ideals and thats absolutely not a contradiction you will ever have to acknowledge even after youve flooded the country with hundreds of thousands of muslim refugees to provide corporations with cheap labor and biomass for political parties to consolidate power
canada,not_removed,im actually just fucking around im not angry at all
canada,not_removed,it would also let party members vote on behalf of their constituents and not strictly on party policy
canada,not_removed,lol everyone i dont like is a nazi
canada,not_removed,are you just saying this because of my jewish name
canada,not_removed,i think your steeply slanted bias is making it difficult for you to recognize what is and isnt actual bias in the media start looking for sourcesreferences in media and youll notice that the rebel links back to its own website while organizations like the cbc link to outside sources line studies and economic analyses performed by actual economists
canada,not_removed,actually im not sure cnn supports anyone i find they try to show both sides to an argument but they are still stupid and blow everything out of proportion also people love to scapegoat the cbc but dont hesitate to quote and support them when they agree with what is being said and lastly these same reporters are the ones organizing the protests
canada,not_removed,when her employer is a questionable bigot it strikes to credibility
canada,not_removed,sorry did you drop your argument cause i cant find it in that reply my main point is in the first twenty seconds they say he has kept just about none of them and that is
canada,not_removed,out of the first just reading the summaries only one can be technically considered broken as the year has gone by the others i voted liberal assuming that their budget numbers were off because harper hid too much data so trudeaus budget was going to be off broken yes but i dont consider it a statement that should be classed as a promise i consider it a lie the other can still be done within his term broken not really damaged yes
canada,not_removed,they are speaking on ten campaign promises that have not been fulfilled yet make no mention of the ones that have obviously this has been produced to give the false assumption that trudeau has been sitting in his office with his thumb up his ass during his year as prime minister when it couldnt be further from the truth this coming from the same organisation that sucked off the trump campaign from the start and look at all the backpeddling that has already happened with his administration that hasnt even started yet i wonder if they will have a similar video about trump in a year if i was a betting man i would say no
canada,not_removed,huh lauren southern was a dude
canada,not_removed,the drug epidemic is getting really bad
canada,not_removed,what views of the constituents do you believe are being widely ignored
canada,not_removed,your troll red herring wont work with me altright is a rebranding of farrightneonazism i also happen to disagree with it and just because edgy neckbeards cant understand that the altright is modern fascism isnt my problem
canada,not_removed,no because youre ezra levant you post nothing but your own media then ask specious questions to members of this sub when we call it for the shit that it is ezra
canada,not_removed,do i have a steeply slanted bias what do you base that accusation on
canada,not_removed,the cnn bias was pretty rough and well documented being subscribed to the cbc i had documented their videos over the course of the election it was all anti trump and pro clinton and i am prepared to provide evidence to help convince your healthy skepticism i actually believe based on evidence that they were in cahoots with the clinton campaign due to them adopting persuasion terms explicitly crafted to brand trump as dark very nuanced stuff anyway it is late here have a nice night and happy new year
canada,not_removed,bigots are bigots but how does that affect their credibility maybe a person is a very credible bigot and another is a very noncredible multiculturalist
canada,not_removed,dont you think that is more likely a figure of speech rather than a statement meant to be taken literally
canada,not_removed,harper had a surplus and it ended up being larger than expected
canada,not_removed,i dont think that is cherry picking because when you choose a topic you are allowed to focus on one class of promises or a general overall theme in this one because they do not particularly like trudeau they are focusing on the biggest promises he has broken among the class of or so thus far if the video was titled as say a report card on the trudeau government if they only graded him on his broken campaign promises and not his kept ones then i think you could accuse them of cherry picking in any case you should listen to dissenting and heterodox viewpoints rather than focussing on only the good if you want to understand and gauge what other peoples perceptions are on the issues rcanada does not have to be an echo chamber of progressive and liberal ideas
canada,not_removed,no she is a dude
canada,not_removed,helping vets is one huge example they have not kept the promise to help them they reopened the case against the vets our previous government dropped which was dropped because we the constituents wanted to drop so they did the exact opposite of what many of us wanted keeping deficits to billion for their first term they have hit it in their first year to not buy the yet they have spent over million in their first year just for an option to eventually buy one
canada,not_removed,what do you mean red herring you called people nazis and subhuman
canada,not_removed,you know i always suspected but i think youre onto something
canada,not_removed,you realize how stupid you look when you accuse someone or being a person theyre not right
canada,not_removed,nothing but your own media then ask specious questions such as
canada,not_removed,is it possible for you to not be specious and introduce red herrings ezra
canada,not_removed,read the part in my last comment about sources again
canada,not_removed,im curious what is this evidence of collusion
canada,not_removed,they made a video entirely about his failed campaign promises in the context of them being a echo chamber for right wing zealots ill take it as what it is and they probably believe he has broken most of them
canada,not_removed,pulling the numbers harpers budget averaged billion id be happy if trudeau matched that average it tends to take years to fix the economy after the usual slash n gut happens this time we also have a whole slew of lost scienceoriented data lost as well as opposed to simply selling off ip
canada,not_removed,im confused you have a link to what youre claiming
canada,not_removed,removed please do not be unnecessarily antagonistic thanks
canada,not_removed,not up to me to explain logical fallacies go look it up
canada,not_removed,irony get a life ezra
canada,not_removed,what about an informal debate would you be interested in having one say over skype you can choose the topic and we can broadcast it to reddit what do you think
canada,not_removed,what does that have to do with me personally
canada,not_removed,robert cialdini started advising clinton during her campaign after bernie sanders lost he is the godzilla of persuasion experts his nuclear grade branding device was to start calling trump dark it sounds simplistic but if you study persuasion it is extremely powerful funny enough right around this point did clinton start seeing her best numbers as soon as this branding went into motion cbc was on the forefront of pushing that narrative in cbc news and the national they were aggressively pushing that script before that term had time to be passed around ergo either it was just a coincidence that they started calling trump dark or they were taking advice from the clinton campaign as to what narrative to push the persuasion aspect in my opinion was the most interesting and educational portion of the last election what do you think
canada,not_removed,rcanada should not be calling out others as a anything echo chamber just look at my post which part is factually incorrect already downvotes for what is an honest and fair question
canada,not_removed,average compare harpers deficit to the proposed deficits of remember harper only passed a deficit on behalf of the liberalndpbloc coalition ive done the math before first four years adjusted for inflation adjusted for population per capita this is your yearly debt added on behalf of harper conservatives layton ndp of gdp dion liberals sorry i forget the source
canada,not_removed,just google it she wanted to see how cucked canada is so she went to a doctor and said i wanna be allowed to say im a dude on my canada documents and the doctor said sure
canada,not_removed,lauren southern is a man and she has all the documentation to prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt
canada,not_removed,im saying you dont know what a red herring is and you started off by calling people subhuman im pretty sure you dont even know what logical fallacies are either
canada,not_removed,lets get back on topic ezra
canada,not_removed,im thinking theres a lot of assumptions being made there its a theory that right now imo lacks any real evidence
canada,not_removed,its only a fair question if youre genuinely unaware that ezra levant and his trash journalism site are literal convicted liars the beaverton has more accurate reporting
canada,not_removed,it didnt help that harper had a deficit one year we can even pull the adjusted numbers for each and add the totals of their bestworst year only harper martin chretien mulroney trudeau sr clark trudeau sr pearson dont forget that canadas gdp is about the us gdp equivalant spending compared to obamas record should of been of the gdp harper more then doubled that with and we still went into a technical recession the link i provided if you click the name you can get the stats for each pm
canada,not_removed,should i believe you im not sure if i should
canada,not_removed,lol everyone i dont like is a nazi i never said what you quoted and therefore are introducing a red herring that is separate from the fact that the altright is simply neonazism rebranded neonazis are subhuman er go so is the altright that make things simpler for you champ
canada,not_removed,the opportunity of a lifetime to exercise your invited hatred upon a subhuman and you pass it up like a feckless troll
canada,not_removed,judge for yourself
canada,not_removed,when was his website convicted of being a liar
canada,not_removed,the stimulus did not help period it is a failed economic model forced on harper in the most ironic of circumstances considering he wrote his entire masters thesis denouncing keynesian fiscal policy hayek was spinning in his grave when he passed that stimulus but it was all political calculus to keep government
canada,not_removed,you should believe me because it is but in all seriousness she is by all official accounts a man
canada,not_removed,sure thing ezra
canada,not_removed,of course renters wont invest into any structure or infrastructure upgrades they just pay their rent and dont care about any longterm investments its landlords who should be investing in such projects which can help them decrease their expenses if power is included in rent or attract more tenants or increase their rent if tenants pay for their own power so with a smaller power bill they can afford a higher rent
canada,not_removed,growth of residential solar in canada is impeded by the terrible payback period
canada,not_removed,the problem for solar in canada is something no government policy can fix the weather there were many other green options wind tidal run of river hydro why try to force solar when it doesnt make much sense for much of canada
canada,not_removed,kind of a silly article for every renter theres an owner and owners continue to have incentives to put in solar
canada,not_removed,growth of residential solar power slows as canadians learn that adopting sunny ways does not actually increase average daily solar irradiation
canada,not_removed,lets not also forget that if you sell a home that has solar on it there is no way to transfer the contract over to the new owners you are also still on the hock for the loan that you took out to pay for the solar panels
canada,not_removed,the article does a poor job explaining their own shit arguments on this they argue that renters are those who most need cheap power but personal solar panels are not exactly that cheap solar panel systems go for like and generate next to no power in the winter when you use power the most it is like saying poor people need affordable food and then singing about how there is no incentive to buy caviar
canada,not_removed,i dont think it has to do with not caring about investments just nobody would put solar panels on a home they dont own
canada,not_removed,or landlords can get the incentives to add solar power include power in rent and use that as an incentive for renters while it wouldnt earn the landlord any extra money directly my experience apartment hunting is anything with heathot waterpower included always has a shitload of applicants so while they wouldnt get extra income directly from the renters they would experience less turnover higher vacancy more money edit oh and my apartment building does have solar panels but theyre used to light the building inside of the building not to help tenants
canada,not_removed,were considering renting out part of our home many tenants will just look at the rent not rentpower if we pay for solar the tenant will save but we wont be able to increase the rent to cover that savings in the end its cheaper for us to get a submeter and let them pay the power company
canada,not_removed,yes but amortizing the cost of solar would increase their rent significantly that makes little sense as well
canada,not_removed,landlords are useless in canada they enjoy contributing to the squalorlike conditions in canuckstan cities their indifference and neglect towards their rental units is everywhere to see and viewthey dont care as long as they are getting paid they dont care that they are actively contributing to a shittier countryshittier cities in canuckistanthey entire country is a fucking race to the bottom just wait in like years there is going to be such a huge population of africansarabsmuslimsasians of all kinds that the us will probobly put the entire country of canuckstan on a watch list and evenutally declare war because canada is basically a middle east inthemaking being built next door to the us
canada,not_removed,what is the payback period of a sqft home now what was the payback period years ago
canada,not_removed,they use solar power all throughout the torontomontreal corridor its very popular for rural homes theres several pv solar installations as well we get adequate sunlight to make pv solar work in some applications wind has similar problems tide as well run of the river does slow river velocity and reduce oxygenation lots of problems with everything which is why a combination of all of them is a great idea
canada,not_removed,yeah its the same as giving electric cars access to the hov lanes and premium parking spots a privilege for the person that can afford a tesla
canada,not_removed,except theyre allowing the technology to actually end up in use get tested against real applications and fund the continued development of the technologies that will lead to them becoming cheaper and more affordable solar panels have been increasingly dropping in price and becoming more standardized too
canada,not_removed,the incentives are to help build a new industry we need in order to move away from fossil fuels the benefit to the individual who can afford them is the only real way to make it happen the wealthy who purchase them are still acting as early adopters taking on significant financial costs for a product that will easily be outdated on a short period of time
canada,not_removed,well its the subsidies that made the price of panels go from only affordable by the richest people to upper middle class people it also helped create thousands of jobs in the case of ontario it brought in a billion dollar investment from samsung and made our province the third largest solar panel producing industry in the world next to california those wealthy peoples homes are now at least partially powering themselves instead of the part fossil fuel grid electricity we all use and in some cases powering their neighbours homes as well were not actually paying for solar panels for people were subsidizing extremely high microfit rates for the electricity they generate we should put them on schools as well but that would involve subsidizing the installation as well
canada,not_removed,incentives to what save their renter on their power bill like they have any reason to care
canada,not_removed,at least in ontario its straightforward to assign the contract to new owners
canada,not_removed,judging by the historically low vacancy rates we see in larger cities landlords have no reasons to give a shit about their tennants power costs
canada,not_removed,plus if the landlord has the tenants pay utilities they have less incentive to lower the costs of power sure they might be able to rent the place for a little bit more money but probably not as much as it would take to cover the costs
canada,not_removed,out here on the left coast where our electricity is naturally cheap and our sunlight sucks typically years some parts of canada are a bit better which is still bad plastering solar across the american southwest and using bcwa hydro as backing store would be pretty amazing though one day well get there
canada,not_removed,i installed mine years ago and it will pay for itself in another years but thats because im getting
canada,not_removed,today i believe the rate is around years ago it was probably some people who got in really early like years ago were over
canada,not_removed,wasnt there some talk about removing those environmental credits from luxury hybrids i seem to remember reading something about it after some guy got a bunch of rebates for buying a porsche edit
canada,not_removed,except hybrid vehicles outside of the tesla exist and hybrid market will only continue to grow between incentives fuel and insurance difference they are largely about the same cost as there regular trim counter parts httpwwwmtogovoncaenglishvehicleselectricelectricvehiclerebateshtml hov lanes arent a big deal premium spaces are subject to the store owner yet plenty of people ignore those parking signs as well
canada,not_removed,your example is in every way superior to mine
canada,not_removed,sounds like if people need cheap power we have a government capable of providing cheaper power who would be capable of providing for high capital costs
canada,not_removed,i have not seen it significantly lower most people who have solar also have to be very power conscience with their consumption renters likely would not
canada,not_removed,in the building im in we have and a half floors floor is only half so despite living on the no one lives above me while they dont have a big issue with vacancy despite a few apartments going empty for a few months they have a pretty big problem with turnover people who moved in less than a year ago are moving out chances are if they havent stayed the full months theyve been evicted which means theyre losing money on rent owed and especially now that the apartment is empty until they can make it ready again
canada,not_removed,but thats because im getting thats not sustainable but heck yeah enjoy it while youve got it
canada,not_removed,im in ontario as well can you point me in the direction you went for solar panels id be interested in doing something like this if it can be paid off if six years or so
canada,not_removed,its good that those environmental credits are gone but that fact they existed in the first place is crazy to me
canada,not_removed,in bc at least gashybrid cars dont count for the hov lanes
canada,not_removed,thats how community pools schools and airports work now
canada,not_removed,rebates have been adjusted higher value cars get less of a rebate while cheaper cars get higher rebates a chevy volt gets the rebate a tesla does httpwwwmtogovoncaenglishvehicleselectricelectricvehiclerebateshtml
canada,not_removed,how is that fair again the point of the rebates is to make you subsidize the electric industry without them people would have been less likely to buy an electric car thanks to them electric cars are now much cheaper than they ever would have been without the rebates and are now close to being affordable for the middle class not to mention the fact that the more expensive the car the less of a rebate you get get it
canada,not_removed,year contract as an early adopter its much lower now for new adopters
canada,not_removed,to be fair i probably wouldnt have anticipated those loopholes myself i dont know when the credits started but hybrid supercars have only popped up in the last couple years before that youd be looking at around max for a tesla roadster and those were so limited it was probably a non issue compared to priuses and other relatively cheap hybrids
canada,not_removed,they dont quality in on either but frankly its an overstated benefit because the hovs are only in select areas you still have to deal with volume elsewhere however hybrid gaselectric still represent a viable alternative to gasoline vehicles if you deal with a ton of traffic hybrids are awesome because your not expending fuel idlinglimping in traffic from a cost perspective they are marginally more expensive for superior mileage and reduction in insurance the insurance discount vs the regular gas version made it worth it for us alone getting out of a mid sized family sedan was the other
canada,not_removed,generally it does not provide no where near enough to cover your electric needs
canada,not_removed,i would say a good policy particularly for new technology should try to look to the future and put caps in to protect from abuse thats one of my problems with a lot of these government driven green policies is they arent really well thought out it seems to be more about the headline and less about the actual end result
canada,not_removed,yes but it should be pointed out that say a thousand dollar installation will not provide you with the typical household power usage if you amortize the cost or interests of the money spent over many years those costs need to be included as operating costs they would for business
canada,not_removed,seems to be a lot of antiterror activity here considering its muslimfriendly jt in fact it looks like business as usual minus useless bombdropping its interesting to see the liberals make a mandate out of amendment but take no action to do so and now this ramping up the fear much like their predecessors did being the antifear party is partly what got them elected but thats just it isnt it dont be afraid of we know best do we know how many times csis has used their new power to disrupt since came into effect
canada,not_removed,i just live far below my means probably hurts the economy too since im not spending more than i have to on anything but its nice to have your own safety net
canada,not_removed,id like to see some sort of incentive for new immigrants to reside outside of the big areas the gta and vancouver places like winnipeg saskatoon edmonton halifax all have economies that provide opportunities for immigrants its not like dropping them somewhere they cant find a job unfortunately we cant exactly say you have to live in one of these cities for a minimum of years or we deport you everyone wants to live in vancouver and the gta but those cities cant hold everyone
canada,not_removed,there just isnt enough to go around so what are we to do well all be equal when we all have nothing comrade
canada,not_removed,we need to get behind parties with immigration reform policies no matter how fringe they are for example the httpvancouversuncomnewslocalnewsantiimmigrationpartyregistersforbcelection just registered in bc a couple of weeks ago and i will vote for them even if every other policy of theirs is terrible solely because of their stance on immigration
canada,not_removed,yes not everyone can be a ceo that wont change regardless of immigration or mincome and if average salaries drops it will be paired with lowered costs for everyone i think that youll find that our job fetishism will wane as automation rises but what then how will people be driven to succeed wait rather how will people be occupied so they dont rise up against the establishment isnt that the real question the current bossesandworkers system is under threat if the subjects are all replaced by machines well have to conjure up new jobs to keep all these subjects occupied under that system or well have to do away with that system a huge tipping point is driverless trucks and theyre already starting to appear
canada,not_removed,how about instead of trying to get people to cheat the government we all just pay our taxes and do the right thing so we are all better off do i need to remind you that when you suggest working under the table you are advocating for theft from all of us universal basic income is actually a great idea considering we are bending over backwards for business plus we wouldnt need as many social welfare programs we would have a smaller and more efficient government the real shame is that adapting to current market conditions is absolutely unacceptable in todays political climate i wonder why that is
canada,not_removed,jobs are not a zero sum game as more people come more items will be bought and more workers will need to be hired to fill this supply shortage some of the new immigrants will begin new business those that come and are employed will provide more tax revenue then they consume as an individual resulting in better service for everyone on a macro scale finally our immigration is merit based and considers things such as whether there are shortages of workers in particular fields regions in need of immigrants etc all in all immigration will provide a net benefit and wont result in mass unemployment
canada,not_removed,proper immigration where people come and make their home in a place permanently increases jobs not reduces them the problem is temporary foreign workers who are here alone without families only to take jobs that could be performed by canadians full immigrants bring their families need teachers for their kids electricians to renovate their houses etc etc etc
canada,not_removed,min income will never work and i can list a couple of reasons why any investment wealthy person would see this a mile away and take what ever wealth they have and dump it in usd euro gold something stable when they massive dump their cad for the other currency the value goes down they may sell at a disadvantage it instead of cad to usd they dump it at cad to usd to get rid of it quickly so you flood the market with cad which essentially become worthless overnight no one want to be left holding a currency that devalue overnight so ever one gets which is the equivalent buying power of what in a matter of weeks so tell me what the fuck do we grow in the winter nothing what the fuck do we manufacture in canada not a whole lot which electronic manufacture open a factory in canada none so your phone is going to cost same as your appliances its either life is unfair and some people are rich or everyone is equal equally poor and equally in a shitty condition oh look you want basic income look at basic income at the aboriginals the cad government dump a shit ton of cash onto tribal leaders and most of the reservers are still shit holes without clean water so what do you think all the technical person are going to go out of the country where they can live a better life so you end up with a population that lacks the knowledge on how to do thingsits always easy to spend someone elses money
canada,not_removed,when applying i believe we use a merit based system they penalises candidates that intend on immigrating to those areas obviously plenty of people still immigrate to these make cities but they sorry tend to score highly on the other immigration criteria thus itd be a loss to canada to turn them away
canada,not_removed,it would be funny if the lieberals to pay canadians while they make other monies under the table though that feeling of satisfaction in all seriousness i think that the lieberal plan will backfire on them they cant increase the economy by paying people mincome others not working and still others working under the table they can print money but thats just inflation
canada,not_removed,interesting comment i dont think that the average person really expects to be a millionayear ceo but if it gets hard to clear yearly for an average joe we can probably expect quite a paradigm shift
canada,not_removed,starting them off at a deficit wont help them succeed like immigration or dont its still best that immigrants are given the tools necessary for success just like any other canadian
canada,not_removed,my entire point is that people that feel that they are being cheated pull out the stops and ensure that they do what have to do anyway it part of the consequences of the race to the bottom
canada,not_removed,that lump of labor thing is bullshit if you bring in too many immigrants theyll never find jobs
canada,not_removed,increases jobs not reduces them
canada,not_removed,the real joke is that our government claims that theres a skilled worker shortage and is eliminating lmia to fast track skilled workers in theres less and less value in having a couple of uni degrees and in debt or even uni degrees
canada,not_removed,you are not so good at economics you have a right to an opinion it please know its a stupid one there is no mincome plan that involves printing cash which therefore doesnt flood the market with devaluation mincome if you read about it is more about ending all of the different agencies that provide social support funding and giving straight cash or negative income tax instead it provides cost savings and those are passed on in higher benefits payments aka mincome any plan that involves printing cash is zimbabwe stupid and would never have a place in a modern country
canada,not_removed,i take home about after taxes so does anyone making under full time without deductions a policy that just gives people the equivalent of to do absolutely nothing completely undermines any argument for a minimum wage lower than that so thats shooting ones self the foot weve already got ample evidence of what happens to people with no direction or ambition being given cradletograve support by the welfare state and the result is multigenerational societal decay via increased drug addiction increased crime decreased literacymath skills decreased levels of health and and a slow spiral of incrementally worse standard of life year over year thats shooting ones self in the other foot if the welfare state must be expanded to ensure people arent starving to death en masse it should be done via public works projects that benefit all canadians not done in a way that will only result in indolence
canada,not_removed,per year or whatever it is isnt the important figure its income vs cost of living isnt it as long as people have as much freedom of economy as possible then i dont see the problems often associated with mincome immigration etc its not like the economy will shut out those bright minds who come up with the startups that drive its growth yes
canada,not_removed,if youd like i can point you to some theoretical and empirical papers the suggest exactly this only if you intend to read them i dont want to do it for no reason
canada,not_removed,that would depend on your degree
canada,not_removed,okey that doesnt fly its easy to say cut this cut that but in reality you cant cut a lot of things you cant cut health care to the amount it matters people still gets stick regardless if they eat well or not so half of that fund is a no go you cant cut eicpp either not when a portion of the population is going to riot aka they paid that their whole life and suddenly they are going to take a hit for a supposedly working plan hell if it is me i wouldnt take that chance either not to mention it will also cut a shit ton of government job and this wont happen anytime soon so the only way for this to work is to print the fucking money and what happen if the stupid people go spend their money on a iphone or something stupid drugsbeer for example are they just going to starve the cad government dump millions to reserves they get to live on the land for free and look at it now of them are shit holes with no clean water if there is any noise of this being a possibility the wealthy will move the wealth out of canada and keep it offshore in so much paperworks that it takes years and years of legal bullshit before the government will have any information on it because the first source of money the get government is going to come looking is taxes
canada,not_removed,what ample evidence is this
canada,not_removed,quite a good post im not in favor of mincome either if we have that much cash to give away id like to see disabled people get more
canada,not_removed,bright minds who come up with the startups that drive its growth yes thats more of a us thing its very very difficult to get venture capitalfunding loans here i know that some feel that the immigrants will create apple corps that will employ everybody but its harder than it sounds the economy can and does shut out people youre competing against nations that have large economies of scale and low salaries
canada,not_removed,the perception that immigrants create jobs is not backed by credible evidence
canada,not_removed,actually it depends less than it used to
canada,not_removed,the wealthy already hold their money offshore so thats not a problem other than that you dont understand the concept of mincome etc you know what people do with money they spend it you know who takes a cut off almost all consumer goods the government via taxes plus the argument is that there would be job growth because more people will have money to spend at stores who will need staff so the concept is that by expanding the consumer base with a guaranteed basic level of income the economy would be boosted by having people spending money even on stupid things like iphones and cigarettes the whole point of this concept is that it is the opposite of what rich people already do with their money hoard it im not saying it will or wont work but the basic idea involves a lot more money being used in the economy instead of sitting collecting interest for a few interested parties
canada,not_removed,every indian reservation every innercity filled with welfare recipients every whitetrash trailer park filled with welfare recipients our senate
canada,not_removed,remember that every hoop you have to get people to jump through costs money thats additional government you are advocating for
canada,not_removed,id also like to see that senior citizens who supported this country with decades worth of their tax dollars but werent lucky enough to have extra cash to kick into rrsps treated properly as well
canada,not_removed,no it isnt theres been a recent report that canada has more economic freedom than the us atm
canada,not_removed,the article you reference is strictly in reference to selfemployed immigrants and their impact on selfemployed natives which i admittedly didnt know with that said there is net positive on the selfemployed rate as one additional selfemployed immigrant results in a fractional loss in selfemployed natives still i digress that it was news to me looking at the paper you provided im going to cite another academic article within the paper kerr and lincoln they find that changes in the population account for a significant share of the growth in us immigrant science and engineering employment importantly they rule out crowding out effects on labor market outcomes employment levels unemployment rates and mean wages of native scientists and engineers and the results suggest potentially small crowdingin effects this paper argues that with targeted immigration policy towards highdemand fields such as engineering and stem careers there can be a crowdingin effect further boubtane and dumont notes that immigration in oecd countries between and has had in general a minor but positive effect on overall economic growth finally an important benefit of immigration for canada specifically is that it will ease the strain of our retiring babyboomer population
canada,not_removed,the government already takes a cut off your pay check and off your spending right now the money is actually worth something there is really no point for the government to take in billion taxes in with the buying power of billion in vs billion in the basic idea is its a feel good to get free money but the min income crowd doesnt consider the consequences of injecting money into a economy you will feel good with the buying power for about month and inflation will come with a vengeance company will scale their price every quarterly and in some cases doesnt sell their products until the currency stables
canada,not_removed,i was afraid of this this is literally the stupidest argument i have ever heard i cant even go down this path to help educate you best of luck in life
canada,not_removed,the senate bingo
canada,not_removed,it shouldnt take anything extra to bump up the income of a disabled person its just math same cheques but some toad will probably find a way to skim off the top
canada,not_removed,not true from an actual business standpoint
canada,not_removed,yeah yeah but we have to make enough jobs for those people its as simple as that beyond the theory a lot of canadians are unemployed which is a bad sign for immigrants
canada,not_removed,i dont think anyone is suggesting they fund this kind of program by printing money that would be ridiculous but most iterations of this program takes existing money gives it to people and then it is quickly cycled through the economy which grows the economy yes taxes are currently a thing but what would happen is that all of this money would be spent and be subjected to sales tax which is a source of government revenue i think your concerns are hugely overblown government regularly injects money into the economy without huge uncontrollable inflation it would take people smarter than i ie an economist to explain the relationship between government spending and inflation as well as the impact of a guaranteed income program on inflation
canada,not_removed,that isnt a refutation and your ad hominem lets me know you dont have one thanks for telling me im correct even in this roundabout way
canada,not_removed,sorry beg to differ anyway rather than bickering about that how about moving on how about the government will create the jobs and the incomes needed to sustain the economy making use of our real resources in a way that doesnt add inflationary pressures like infrastructure spending canada absolutely lacks it atm so theres huge economic growth right there yes
canada,not_removed,i think your concerns are hugely overblown government regularly injects money into the economy without huge uncontrollable inflation it would take people smarter than i ie an economist to explain the relationship between government spending and inflation as well as the impact of a guaranteed income program on inflation its an understatement its one thing to regularly inject money its another one to give free money to everyone the wealthy ie people like me wont stand idly by and get taxed to shit if there is even a chance of this happening you would see people pull their funding out of canada and store in another currency of course it only cost a few grand for a offshore legal tax avoidance you cant tax what you dont know and you cant tax what is not yours
canada,not_removed,shouting that you hold the high ground is very tacky also assuming victory is pathetic i believe you can do better
canada,not_removed,yes that would be great we have enormous potential
canada,not_removed,again this program would be partially selffunding and it wouldnt necessarily require more taxation the idea is that if everyone has enough to live the government wont need to provide expensive social programs to ensure that people stay alive and healthy it isnt a program that gets added to all the other programs the introduction of a guaranteed basic income involves almost a fundamental shift in the concept of social programs by giving people money early the government wont have to spend more later
canada,not_removed,the biggest funding source from the program are the health care and the cpp and you cant cut either not to the extend for fund that give everyone free money by giving people money early the government wont have to spend more later well fuck have you watch the news in the past few month so the government just toss a couple of million to deal with the aboriginal teen suicide thingy didnt theythe government also provide public school toss millions of dollars to aboriginals and we still pay more later didnt we
canada,not_removed,none of that makes any sense at all is english not your first language im having a hard time understanding what you mean and a guaranteed basic income isnt anything like throwing money at an acute social issue the fact that you would compare the two really suggests that you dont really understand well either to be honest you are certainly entitled to an opinion but you arent entitled to being correct
canada,not_removed,again this program would be partially selffunding and it wouldnt necessarily require more taxation it wont be people still gets sick regardless so there goes a big chunk of your health care budget you think you can cut and with the aging population it is more likely we have to pump more money into the health care system the idea is that if everyone has enough to live the government wont need to provide expensive social programs to ensure that people stay alive and healthy majority of the people have enough to live and stay alive it isnt a program that gets added to all the other programs the introduction of a guaranteed basic income involves almost a fundamental shift in the concept of social programs i am saying you cant cut either program no one paying into the cpp want to see it cut and get a reduce pay out just to help either not after they paid a shit ton their whole life and with the increasing aging population its more likely the government have to pump money into the system to sustain it instead of pulling plugs on it to reduce cost so all the social program you can cut wont count for more than of the total funding the two major ones people want to get their hands on is the cpp and the healthcare do some math its not going to work no matter how you play it out by giving people money early the government wont have to spend more later i am saying didnt we give a shit ton of money to the aboriginals we already paid for their public education healthcare and now more to deal with the child suicide thingy from one fail experiment to another its not going to work
canada,not_removed,there are plenty of economists see people who know more about this than you who believe that this is a viable program with long term benefits youre spouting anecdotal and made up facts to support your opposition to a program you dont understand comparing a mincome program to aboriginal programs is absurd and shows your clear lack of understanding
canada,not_removed,can you use it to shop online
canada,not_removed,yes works just fine with online shops worldwide with paypal and pretty much everything i tried in last years never had a problem
canada,not_removed,not all systems are set up to accept debit mastercard yet most banks here use visa debit and that still took certain sites a few months to get on board with of my banks is debit mastercard doesnt always work online and the other is a debit visa success rate
canada,not_removed,appreciate the explanation though my relatives have visa debit cards i could use them if the site allowed me to both visa and mastercard are popular in uk
canada,not_removed,uci rules much like pga golf or fis ski rules heavily restrict equipment innovation in an attempt to make it about the human factor not the technology there have been plenty of nonuci legal bikes that are much faster than any legal ones ie chris boardmans superman position
canada,not_removed,while that is true it is nice to see a company think outside of the uci box
canada,not_removed,youre right i should have said unfortunately uci rulesthe international sports federations restrict equipment too much some times
canada,not_removed,chart on page test data from the diamondback andean wind tunnel testing the blue line represents the performance of the new diamondback andean with identical components in this test the andean is faster at zero degrees and has less drag at degrees the red line depicts the performance of the andean at its fastest configuration with a hed jet disc rear wheel and all of its storage accessories
canada,not_removed,yes
canada,not_removed,the article in question was written by pierre poilievre if that doesnt say everything you need to know its nothing but cherrypicked arguments and contextually irrelevant statistics taken from stats canada no less seriously the balls on these reformists half a star dont give ottawa citizen your click
canada,not_removed,lets compare stephen harper to a prime minister who left office years before he was elected and give him the credit for anything that happened in between pierre poilievre
canada,not_removed,not so fast pretty boy i found this report yet more children and their families live in poverty as of than they did when the house of commons unanimously resolved to end child poverty more than years ago read the report the report gathered statistics canada taxfiler data and found that child and family poverty has increased to children in from children in government the number of canadians living below the low income cutoff is now at its lowest level ever since there are fewer children living in poverty in canada clearly our strategy is working expert rothman meanwhile called the statement from bergens office shallow and misleading stating canada lacks an official poverty measure and that low levels of poverty have not be achieved or sustained for a lengthy period of time so poilievre as always is full of shit
canada,not_removed,article is comparing apples to goats
canada,not_removed,i suspect the intent of the article is to make people believe justin will do what his father did and that canada made a mistake by not electing harper for another term have no idea if any of the info is true just pointing out what i think the underlying point was
canada,not_removed,dae love the work we did at harpergov as much as me
canada,not_removed,i think you meant elevated rather than alleviated harper alleviated nothing
canada,not_removed,failed attempt to build harpers legacy confirmed i would probably compare him to mulroney first and go from there
canada,not_removed,attacking the source is almost always a cheap shot
canada,not_removed,alright but it sounds like the plan to eliminate poverty by on which this is based was a pretty faulted plan in the first place and was already a decade long failure the report gathered statistics canada taxfiler data and found that child and family poverty has increased to children in from children in canada population million canada population million increase is about children in from children in increase is slightly under child poverty went down in representation to society as a whole while there are more children in poverty the one does not disprove the other last month for example unicef stated that canadas overall child poverty rate decreased from to per cent during the recession from to pulling roughly children out of poverty
canada,not_removed,yes and no they are looking at absolute poverty rate they are lokking at the low income cutoff and they are looking at tax rates one can compare apples and oranges by saying one is physically larger then the other by saying one weighs more then the other and by saying that one contains more vitamin c then the other without suggesting that an orange can replace the apples in an apple pie in truth we did had absolutely staggering issues during the pet years we had an east coast that was living on a ei program we had a stagnated western economy we had inflation that was beyond control pricing people out of home ownership things simply werent all that great during the pet years for a staggering number of people
canada,not_removed,justin will do what his father did and that canada made a mistake by not electing harper for another term both of those things are true did you miss the billion dollar deficit
canada,not_removed,i suspect the intent of the article or you could read the article and find out for yourself before commenting gosh what an idea
canada,not_removed,attacking the source is almost always a cheap shot good thing you said almost always because pierre poilevre was a cabinet minister in stephen harpers government so in this specific instance its pretty worthwhile to point out that hes got a bias
canada,not_removed,its almost like two different prime ministers serving in two different times did different things to deal with different problems to different effects
canada,not_removed,i wasnt looking if it was true or not but pointing out what my belief on the intent was
canada,not_removed,did you miss the fact that of that was harpers
canada,not_removed,yes i could use the literal reasoning in the article that trudeau sr was shit at alleviating poverty but harper was the guy who actually did it and poilievre just wanted everyone to know about it
canada,not_removed,he may indeed have a bias but merely having a bias does not mean someone is factually incorrect unless the source in question is widely known for being untrustworthy and there needs to be a valid factual reason for that allegation itself one should examine the argument and either agree or disagree based on the actual facts
canada,not_removed,yeah actually i didas that is bullshit the harper govt left trudeau a balanced budget
canada,not_removed,did did you really report my comment because i was critical of the fact that you didnt even bother to glance at the article before responding really if anything your comments here should be removed for being low content since you admitted youre just making things up based on your assumptions next time read the article and dont use the report button just because you disagree with someone or are annoyed with them
canada,not_removed,unless the source in question is widely known for being untrustworthy untrustworthy is his middle name
canada,not_removed,as i said the facts presented in the article are completely removed from any and all context is drawing comparisons that have absolutely no relevance given that pierre trudeau and stephen harper served years apart hed be better off comparing john diefenbaker to william lyon mackenzie king but that wouldnt allow him to barely conceal a personal attack against justin trudeau
canada,not_removed,but almost no assets with which to maintain a balanced budget selling everything you own to balance your books is not sound fiscal policy
canada,not_removed,no i dont give a shit about other people and what they think about me i dont even downvote because its just a waste of time i basically only upvote people besides i dont think anything you wrote was breaking any rules or worth anyones time to report
canada,not_removed,untrustworthy is his middle name and why would that be exactly other than the fact that he was a cabinet minister for a government that wasis unpopular
canada,not_removed,comparing and contrasting two different modern national leaders seems perfectly valid to me i mean where do you draw the line your objection seems arbitrary
canada,not_removed,well all i can say in response to that is that reading the article if youre going to choose to respond to it is never a waste of time
canada,not_removed,if someone were to compare specific aspects of both politicians and do it thoroughly comparing their official policies the conditions they inherited from previous administrations as well as the general conditions of the nation at the time and the outside world and the results of their policies both immediate and lasting it might be more meaningful but to quote a few discrete statistics which were gathered three decades apart and claim that as proof that stephen harper was more effective at reducing poverty is myopic and intellectually irresponsible there were years between their administrations are we to believe that nothing happened in those years nothing changed at all there are no other variables in play were talking about national politics here not the shot blocking statistics of nhl goalies making general comparisons between prime ministers is like those shitty broscience programs that tackle questions like could genghis khan beat alexander the great history doesnt work that way both of those men were shaped by the worlds they inhabited as were their opinions and actions stephen harpers politics cannot be superimposed onto pierre trudeaus time in office and vice versa that is not an arbitrary objection
canada,not_removed,now thats a thoughtful wellwritten criticism i can get behind and for what its worth i agree with you if youre wondering then why i said anything its because i see a lot of kneejerk reactions to articles and i think its unfair in general to automatically dismiss an opinionarticle just because of the source
canada,not_removed,the scoop was back in the news this month and i expect we will hear more about it in the coming years in fact i am guessing there are plans in place to make it the subject of the next national inquiry after the missing womens inquiry has wrapped up so what is the scoop it is usually described as a decade when aboriginal children were stolen from their parents by overzealous social workers attempting to perpetuate cultural genocide by placing aboriginal children in american homes is this story true it is true some of the child welfare workers who were seeing the appalling conditions on reserves for the first time were overzealous in their determination to remove children from what they saw as unsafe and inadequate homes it is also true adopting these children into american homes was a bad idea from the start the adoptions broke down at an alarming rate both for cultural reasons and the fact now recognized that many of these children had fetal alcohol spectrum disorders fasd — they were born braindamaged as a result of exposure to alcohol in the womb the adoption of aboriginal children into american homes was discontinued but the practice of removing many aboriginal children from their parents has not changed much from the to the present day even with the devolution of child welfare responsibility to aboriginal agencies in fact manitoba now has more aboriginal children in care than was the case in the so except for the international adoption aspect the childwelfare situation in manitoba is virtually the same as it was during the time of the socalled scoop what is the reason for this why are so many aboriginal children taken into care each year and why are even more left in bad homes and why are so many of these children born with fasd in a word the answer is that the parents of these children abuse alcohol they drink to the point that they are incapable of being responsible parents and how could manitobas child welfare crisis and manitobas horrendous fasd problem be brought under control in one fell swoop the answer is simple irresponsible parents would have to stop drinking many will consider this observation to be callous simplistic and even ignorant they will want to point to colonialism residential schools and other historical trauma and explain that alcohol abuse in aboriginal communities is the inevitable result of that history harold johnson says these people are wrong to think that way in an important new book titled firewater he takes direct aim at what he calls the victim model and insists the enormous problem of alcohol abuse that plagues so many aboriginal communities must be acknowledged and openly discussed if there is to be any hope of change he does not deny that the historical injustices are real but passionately believes using them as an excuse condemns aboriginal people to be helpless victims forever he asks why aboriginal leaders who are so vocal on some issues seem to be so afraid of acknowledging the problem for instance he points with some humour to the royal commission on aboriginal peoples that devoted a measly few pages of its massive report to the subject of rampant alcohol abuse in the aboriginal community and concluded — farcically — that it was no particular problem he wonders if the leaders fear that someone will raise the old drunken indian stereotype if the issue is openly and honestly discussed so they remain silent he also wonders why nonaboriginal people in important positions are so strangely silent on a problem that is so obvious he concludes correctly that any white man who uses the words indian and alcohol in the same sentence will find himself or herself branded a racist johnson says these people too must gather up their courage and speak and just who is harold johnson to say these things he is a cree indian from treaty six territory in saskatchewan the subtitle of firewater is how alcohol is killing my people and yours johnson had a hard life his father died young as did siblings he was bitter and lived a life of hard drinking as a young man but at a certain point in his life he did a major rethink he went back to school became a lawyer and then a harvard graduate he quit drinking completely and has been a respected prosecutor in saskatchewan for years johnson turned his life around not as a result of anything that a government did or did not do he did so as a person deciding how he wanted to live his own life he explains that he never saw himself as a victim but as a person responsible for his own future he explains why he wrote the book i cant stay silent any longer i cannot with good conscience bury another relative i have now buried two brothers who were killed by drunk drivers i cannot watch any longer as a constant stream of our relatives comes into the justice system because of the horrible things they did to each other while they were drunk the suffering caused by alcohol the kids with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder the violence the poverty the abandoned children the mental wards and the emergency rooms the injuries and the illnesses and the loss of hope and the suicides have all piled up within me to the point that i must speak and speak he does he estimates one in two people in treaty six communities dies directly or indirectly from alcohol he notes that in many aboriginal communities alcohol and its aftermath are the only real economy he refers to the judges lawyers and workers who hold court in these communities where virtually all the cases involve drunken misbehavior as alcohol aftermath administrators they do their work and come back only to find the same people in front of them again despite their best efforts they accomplish little johnson talks about stories he says we all live by the stories that we tell ourselves but sometimes we are fooling ourselves here are some of the stories that occur to me the story told about the scoop is of uncaring social workers stealing children from their parents and causing them hurt but the real story is about irresponsible parents abusing alcohol and placing their children in danger the real story is about drinking the story about the child welfare system is of a government and system that doesnt know what to do with the many thousands of aboriginal children who come into care that part of the story is true but the real story is about drinking the story told about the justice system is of racism and too many aboriginal people going to jail the real story is about drinking the story told about missing women is about aboriginal women being treated as less than human and casually slain and forgotten that part of the story is true but the real story is about women driven from their communities by alcoholfuelled violence and the many more aboriginal women with no option but to stay behind trapped in hopelessness the story is told of communities with epidemics of young people who see suicide as the only option the aboriginal leaders who demand that the government fix the problem and the government responding with money and programs that both the leaders and the government know will make no difference the real story is of young people driven to despair by their parents drinking the story about fasd is about how it affects all races and groups true and that there is not a grossly disproportionate number of aboriginal fasd children in our province untrue the real story is about irresponsible parents drinking johnson does offer hope he notes that according to his research per cent of aboriginal people do not drink at all that is higher than the figure for nonaboriginal nondrinkers these people can lead the way he talks of sober houses based on the block parent model where people returning from jails and treatment centres with the motivation to change could drop in and have a cup of tea and a chat instead of immediately being thrust back into a community where even their friends and family are urging them to have a drink he talks about motivated communities turning themselves into virtual treatment centres everyone in such a community would have to be fully committed to the plan as opposed to socalled dry reserves where the bootleggers are often school teachers or other middleclass people who have the money to buy pickup trucks and pay the bribes necessary to operate as wellpaid bootleggers none of these solutions has anything to do with government programs government money or national inquiries instead they involve individuals making a personal decision to stop thinking of themselves as victims and then start making a positive change finally johnson notes that maybe the elders knew best all along when treaty six was negotiated the one thing that the indian negotiators were adamant about was that there must be an absolute ban on alcohol in the treaty six area this was later struck down in the drybones case by the white elders of the supreme court who thought they knew better johnson did not have to write this book he knew he would be criticized by many for doing so he felt a duty to tell a story that needs to be told we should read his book brian giesbrecht was a provincial court judge from until he is retired
canada,not_removed,the most notable thing about this article is its condescending tone blech adds nothing that hasnt been said already without the dripping superiority
canada,not_removed,perhaps some doctors could use lsd treatment
canada,not_removed,alcohol is a weapon used by authorities to keep communities weak and sick it is an addictive drug know to destroy relationships and the health of addicts everyone who uses alcohol has some level of addiction it is physiological response that all people experience simply stop supplying the drug would solve the problem all of society suffers from alcoholism we are an alcoholic culture life will be better for us all when our whole society sobers up and gets real
canada,not_removed,what did you find condescending the problem of alcohol abuse is the elephant in room no one is talking about it which is what this retired judge is explaining
canada,not_removed,if anyone thinks that no one is or has been discussing the problems of aboriginal alcohol abuse or that dozens if not hundreds of bands are trying anything that might succeed youve been living under a rock since at least the whats condescending how about the fact that a review of the scoop found that aboriginal children were being removed from their parents for no justifiable reason whatsoever and that this problem does indeed continue and the consequences for the children are overwhelming disastrous how dare the victims of over years of cultural genocide play the victim card we whites are so tired of being held accountable so get over it already will ya
canada,not_removed,prohibition was repealed under duress the catholic church mobilized its guerrilla army and terrorized the rest of us into submission now we know better than to give into terrorists we were told it was just a gang war but al capone and his violent gangs actually bombed and murdered until the law was changed sure prohibition totally worked because alcoholics enjoy brutal violence it is a culture that is dangerous to all living things you cant wait till your next drink can you alcohol actually does make you stupid i can tell you use it

canada,not_removed,gic is covered by fdic insurance rrsps and mutual funds are segregated the exception is if your rrsp invested in the bank it self then that investment itself becomes subject to bailin
canada,not_removed,our own finance minister announced last week that canadians should get used to shortterm employment and being inbetween jobs there are some signs that were in for a recession as well this sure will be interesting when bewildered immigrants migrants arrive here and wonder why they were promised so much httpbusinessfinancialpostcominvestinginvestingprodavidrosenbergallsignsareflashingthismarketislateinthegame
canada,not_removed,just for some perspective canada has taken in well over immigrants since may so we dont even create enough jobs to keep up with current insane levels of immigration not even by half on top of that there are over million unemployed canadians with another million discouraged dropped out of the labor force or working part time but want full time for contrast the us takes in million immigrants per year but creates over that many jobs that means unemployed americans have a chance canadians do not oh and with that job creation tfws are included httpimgurcomafibqjn canada is fubar e i dont want to overwhelm but i can just keep going with more and more stats out of a nation of million we only have million fulltime workers a few mil are public sector btw that should shock people we have plenty of underutilized human capital in this country we dont need to flood the country with more before i get called a xenophobe or racist perhaps i dont want them living in modern day slavery their words requisite thanks for the gold kind stranger have a few more links to make your blood boil what happens when housing goes
canada,not_removed,mccallum either needs a sobriety test or a mental health evaluation possibly both
canada,not_removed,this guy can fuck off any time now
canada,not_removed,of course they fucking are best way to fuck over canadians and balkanize our major cities
canada,not_removed,the great thing about all this is that it might tank the liberals chance of a second term as a majority most canadians are against large increases in immigration
canada,not_removed,what did people expect when this summer minster of immigration john mccallum announced a doubling of the number of visa application centers in china
canada,not_removed,i really have been resenting seeing articles with mccallum face on it every time one comes out it just makes me scared to open it up and see what kind of stupidity he is going to reveal this idiot admits that there is a huge push back from canadians when it comes to increasing immigration and yet goes ahead with it anyways seriously what the fuck create jobs he obviously never been an immigrant or what unless you come loaded and we all know that rich investors who come dont contribute only bring their families you dont create shit when you first arrive and have a culture shock especially if you are from nonenglish speaking country it takes years to integrate and you take many precarious jobs to stand up on your feet for years all you do it work arguably taking jobs from canadians and adding to unemployment woes seriously creating jobs myth he is preaching is as far from the truth as it gets
canada,not_removed,im not anti immigrant but they really need to consider exploring reform as to how immigrants get into the country they used to intice immigrants to settle on farm land by offering out large tracks of government land to them that was zoned specifically for agriculture today if you are a permanent resident temporary foreign worker or new canadian you are probably settling in one of three cities that shocker dont have many jobs available we need to create some sort of incentive or system to drive immigration into rural areas where there are jobs and a demand for new blood but then again we also have people coming from mogadishu complaining about how rough it is living in ottawa so maybe grand prairie might be too violent
canada,not_removed,if people at home dont want to vote for you then its time to bring in more future voters
canada,not_removed,well now ill absolutely never be able to afford to live in the gta probably never get a stable job and have a comfortable existence fuck you mccallum fuck you ndp fuck you conservatives care for your fucking people first before selling your country out to millionaire chinese nobody in canada gives a shit about relevance people want good healthcare good education good infrastructure and a reasonable cost of living why did harper have to kill reform id never vote for them but at least they could keep immigration numbers in check
canada,not_removed,the people that make these decisions dont have to use public transit hide in their big homes and arent affected take a look a germany right now for an immigration nightmare
canada,not_removed,looks like they want more votes so they pander to new immigrants we do not need so many newcomers ee can barely digest the ones we recieve now
canada,not_removed,immigration referendum now this is a huge decision and this scumbag needs to ask canadians first before flushing their country down the toilet
canada,not_removed,rip in peace economy
canada,not_removed,heres an insult to injury the construction company stuart olsen imported their irish division to do a project in n van so they could get around paying canadian wages superintendents crane operators carpenters the whole bit some obscure law required that they needed a canadian tradesman as well and they offered me less than what my trade typically pays they told me id make it up in overtime last i heard ot was a disincentive to stop companies from abusing their employees not a bargaining chip to pay them less
canada,not_removed,parents work their whole life primarily to make the world a better place for their children not for immigrants if you violate that social contract by creating a situation in which native children are going to be worse off than their parents are but good news the immigrants will be a lot richer than they would have been otherwise you create unrest that results in political movements see trump this strange outgroup preference that has popped up in the west where people want to help immigrants with an incompatible culture at the expense of their own children is mind boggling people like to talk about the declining native birthrate yet immigrants have lots of kids well yeah if you take money from the native taxpayers they have less money to have kids with
canada,not_removed,the advisory councils report recommends tapping top business talent and international students realtors in toronto and vancouver are going to be happy more rich home buyers
canada,not_removed,check out this article calling for tfws with mbas his proposals are bold he says so himself repeatedly he wants to increase immigration by per cent in five years to through an increase in the economic immigration stream he wants to make it far easier for growing firms to get highly skilled employees into the country essentially recasting the temporary foreign worker program as a pipeline for mbas not unskilled labour i guess that canadians dont want highpaying corporate jobs so in come the lowpaid foreign workers
canada,not_removed,fuck offfffffffffff
canada,not_removed,when you are in government it is your job to make policies that all canadians agree with not just a slim minority of liberal sjws that you surround yourself with excessive immigration is not a canadian value there were some good immigrants like ukrainians they were hardworking and understood canadian values but these ones just will never understand the concept of democracy
canada,not_removed,why did the masses choose the liberals last year
canada,not_removed,immigrants are job takers not job makers
canada,not_removed,gotta get my family out of this disaster zone we call a country
canada,not_removed,how out of touch is the canadian government with the opinions of the canadian people
canada,not_removed,stupid stupid stupid
canada,not_removed,what specifically is wrong with the current target creating the need for a change in his view
canada,not_removed,someone tell mccallum to brush his hair he is a cabinet minister
canada,not_removed,to shaft our workers and youth ever more
canada,not_removed,this guy has no fucking clue what the real problem is we need to keep canadians in canada we have thousands of them leaving our shores for greener pastures elsewhere taking their skills and talent with them our government dollars that was spent educating training and teaching them is now a lost investment when they leave this strategy of importing immigrants in order to fill skills gap is nothing more than a quick fix hope and pray hail marry pass solution why is it politicians always look for quick fix solutions but never actually want to do the hard work funny how schools always teach you to do the long hard work yet politicians are completely the opposite and look for shortcuts
canada,not_removed,okay why the hell is there a need to increase immigration why is what we have now not more than enough
canada,not_removed,heres an article explaining why mass immigration is a bad idea
canada,not_removed,heres an idea why not communicate your problems with this to your mp instead of whining about how this will be the end of canada it sure as shit will achieve more
canada,not_removed,can we at least put the limit at kids per famry because families with tons of kids strain our social system immensely
canada,not_removed,the canadian government is more interested in what their globalist masters want and being politically correct than take care of its own citizens it is a sad situation why not focus on making incentives for canadians to have more kids tax breaks govt funded child careetc it took me years of university and college to finally get an entry level job in my field stem related and i was looking all over canada and eventually found something in regina saskatchewan i am just starting my career and will soon be even though i am truly grateful for the position i am in now i wonder how long it will be till i can afford a place of my own to get married or have kids one day canada and the west in general is in for dark times price to pay for letting banks speculators owning our politicians
canada,not_removed,this is insane
canada,not_removed,you all voted for this mess sucks to suck someone that was furiously downvoted by this sub for voting conservative
canada,not_removed,this is actually getting a bit crazy im all for immigration and i believe we do need to do our part as canadians per year for years is new canadian citizens within years we only have million canadians currently not even considering the much lower security standards which are almost certainly going to have to be there to accomodate this type of incoming population theres the major problems to consider jobs where are the massive amounts of extra jobs that are going to be needed coming from unless there is massive programs in place and already figured out to accommodate the rising population theres going to be a major raise in unemployment rates in canada housing we are already struggling with absolute insanity in both the rental and sales market places like toronto and vancouver are going to be squeezed even harder than they already are smaller cities will have to get a lot of these new canadians and with rent already at for in most cities with no new growth i dunno how the rent doesnt become even crazier also we have a huge issue in this country currently with our people on disability many people are living on less than a month the increase each year is a joke compared to the cost of living increase and living on less than a year is already far below poverty line can we at least give our own suffering people as much as we are going to give our new canadians when did this country turn into a cable company who offers better deals to new customers instead of current ones
canada,not_removed,imagine being an hr manager with the immigration increase
canada,not_removed,was having a conversation with some friends regarding this and one of them made a comment that kinda struck me now i tend to be more of the school that if you deposit one dollar into the bank the banks can then lend out dollars so while the net influx of imigrants will not have any immediate bennifit for canadians banks will get some what more profitable with the influx making micro deposits pay checks oh no says buddy while that might be true with the banks whats really on the horizon is that if the govts figures are true and we dont have enough new blood to pay for the old blood then we are faced with two options one is immigration on levels not even dreamed about by pater trudeau or the other option is to open the borders and thus the immigration by americans can you just imagine the horror in ottawa
canada,not_removed,canada might become third world in the future
canada,not_removed,glad to see the liberals at least living up to one part of their platform now wheres that electoral reform
canada,not_removed,good luck torontonians nobody turned out for the federal liberals last year quite like you did so reap the whirlwind because the area code is about to get even more crowded
canada,not_removed,i wonder if hr managers will still keep their heads up their asses and expect the world for little pay maybe we should tell these potential immigrants about the current state of the canadian job market so they can make an informed choice i have known a few immigrants over the last few years who have said if they knew then what they know now they would not have immigrated everyone tells them canada is full of opportunity and after they spend a ton of money to come here realize the reality is much different
canada,not_removed,oh boy here come the armchair economists
canada,not_removed,good we need to jumpstart our economy and one of the best ways of doing that is bringing in more well educated immigrants with money to spend we should be aiming for immigrants not minimum not including refugees during an economic downturn it may even be with up to one million that would certainly get the economy going
canada,not_removed,itt people who dont understand that httpcanadachannelcacanadianbirthdaysindexphpquotesbyprimeministersjohndiefenbaker millennials dont want to have big families fine well weve got to grow our population somehow or the economy will wither and die
canada,not_removed,dont worry guys we have mincome and legal weed in the pipeline trusttrudeau
canada,not_removed,i think its fact that immigration increases gdp which has its benefits but compresses gdp per capita
canada,not_removed,dont forget about demand for housing think its expensive now young canadians can forget about owning their own home one day
canada,not_removed,well the federal government wont have to worry about that just keep stuffing them in toronto and the problem magically solves itself forget affordable pricing or jobs with good wages just keep stuffing the country with more people
canada,not_removed,there is already million people above the age of not working more temporary workers and immigrants suppress wages and marginalises the most vulnerable in canada who have high unemployment already like elderly youth students disabled and settled immigrants wages have been stagnant for almost a decade that means we need to lower immigration not increase it
canada,not_removed,at first when i started seeing your username i thought you were quite prickly utfwgohome i have come to really appreciate the work you do to collect links like these thanks for this great post
canada,not_removed,i think the public already knew this its just our government is so corrupt at this point if we really want change we need to actually vote in a different party in so these other leaders feel the burn but unfortunately people are just afraid of change and come up with the excuse of oh there is no better party or they are the better alternative as the public we do have the power to make a difference people are just so blind about it
canada,not_removed,saved your post also adding to this the new levels will seek to offset projected demographic challenges in canada including an aging population and growing labour gaps in the target was to permit newcomers to the country the governments economic growth advisory council has recommended ramping up immigration levels to people a year over the next five years with a focus on skilled highly educated and businessoriented people mccallum has suggested that target may be overly ambitious but said the government will substantially raise the number what happens when housing goes the economy goes as well just like the energy sector has proven a significant amount of gdp is tied into realestate and the canadian financial is heavily exposed as well it will be a house of cards that comes down due to a lack of diversification
canada,not_removed,looking at the job vacancy rate can be wildly misleading for two reasons first many new immigrants dont work in canada because they already have jobs or businesses in their origin country this is something people complain about in the vancouver subreddit actually second lots of immigrants start their own businesses and this doesnt factor into the standard job vacancy numbers im a fairly recent immigrant and i fall into both of the circumstances described above i have a foreign company so when i first immigrated to canada i had a foreign payroll too i wasnt part of the canadian job market even though i lived here i later established a canadian branch office for my foreign company which now employs several canadians also i brought my wife and child wife with me neither of whom work
canada,not_removed,just for some perspective canada has taken in well over immigrants since may yet only created jobs httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofcanadianprovincesbyunemploymentrate for contrast the us takes in million immigrants per year but creates over that many jobs that means unemployed americans have a chance canadians do not us adds million jobs in for best year since the us also has million people that population creates jobs oh and with that job creation tfws are included they may make up of that job creation figure canada is fubar job quality in canada at low says cibc parttime and lowwage work on the rise and the problem is getting worse its called a recession the us is booming right now out of a nation of million we only have million fulltime workers a few mil are public sector btw million people doesnt equate to million workers and your graph shows million that should shock people we have plenty of underutilized human capital in this country we dont need to flood the country with more boy america sure is suffering before i get called a xenophobe or racist perhaps i dont want them living in modern day slavery their words temp agency work trapping immigrant women in modern day slavery immigrant families increasingly likely to rely on food banks national household survey immigrants minorities struggle in canada uh huh and what do those employers do when they cant find people to work the farming industry itself doesnt make enough revenue to pay workers for hard labour without raising prices what happens to the canadian farming industry you want cheap living costs or do you want more workers have a few more links to make your blood boil temporary foreign workers go underground government has no idea how many temporary foreign workers living illegally in canada mihychuk canadas economy is growing at the slowest pace in years and the only thing holding us up is housing what happens when housing goes well it seems most people here want housing goes people think if the housing industry collapses there will be cheap houses everywhere its true cheap houses will be everywhere too bad you wont have a job to buy it
canada,not_removed,just for some perspective canada has taken in well over immigrants since may yet only created jobs why do your numbers not match your linked source at all
canada,not_removed,the immigrants are not all of working age many if them are children and dont count in job creation statistics of the adults a significant number of them would have to study or get canadian equivalences of their degreeslicenses so they also would not count in the stats
canada,not_removed,just for some perspective canada has taken in well over immigrants since may yet only created jobs eh think you have to do more crunching than that remove immigrants remove immigrants remove those who stay out of labour market voluntarily eg mothers caring for small children people who arrive and then go to school adjust for any voluntary job destruction retirements people going to school that would need to be replaced
canada,not_removed,wait so if you consider we likely accepted a man a woman and one point something children as a group youre not impressed that we got almost jobs out of that thats pretty much perfect employment of the employable part of that group and likely partial employment of the female part since canada has poor child care support for people without social support starting out ie you have to be part of the community already to find people to take care of your children without spending a lot of money where exactly would you expect those numbers to be if things were perfect
canada,not_removed,all part of the plan if clinton wins expect prime minister zoolander to eventually be coopted into some sick north american union deal hes already given visafree travel to the mexicans
canada,not_removed,possibly both i think its intentional really
canada,not_removed,him and trudeau
canada,not_removed,yes he said he would during his election canada is supposed to be postnationalist or something so globalism which realistically means of canadians are supposed to bend over and be fucked by global elites or be called racist
canada,not_removed,is he intentionally trying to destroy canada yes him and previous leaders their part of a cabal and that cabal doesnt include the interests of canadians
canada,not_removed,the people making these decisions are at the top and them and their kids will never feel what you are describing so they really dont care
canada,not_removed,the conservatives are in such disarray that i dont imagine the real election being until all the big conservative names already said theyre not running for leadership whoever is the leader for the next election is basically the sacrificial lamb
canada,not_removed,the great thing about all this is that it might tank the liberals chance of a second term as a majority so who would replace them the cpc or the ndp the cpc left a bad taste in the mouth of voters thats why they elected the lpc maybe the ndp
canada,not_removed,i think the majority of canadians are indifferent if not supportive canada is a diverse place with citizens of different interest and priorities
canada,not_removed,source
canada,not_removed,his plan to integrate the hundreds of thousands we are receiving already plan no plan there mate the idea is to drive down wages and foment further division between we the lesser classes and the aristocracy that should inhabit the political classes without ever having to deal with us
canada,not_removed,this guy came in with an agenda and has not been listening to canadians at all we dont want this apparently his voter base wants this and more of his selfies
canada,not_removed,this idiot admits that there is a huge push back from canadians when it comes to increasing immigration and yet goes ahead with it anyways seriously what the fuck isnt it simple to realize he doesnt represent canadians or canadian interests
canada,not_removed,i wonder if this would be easier to swallow if mccallum didnt have one of the most punchable faces voices and personalities in canadian politics i think people would still hate this policy but with less rage
canada,not_removed,mass immigration and declining standard of living seem to be the plan for all western nations
canada,not_removed,as canadians what can we do about this we have a government which is making massive unasked for changes and policies they are happily taking us down the same dark path of europe and the us when it comes to demographic replacement canadians need to take a stand at the very least a referendum needs to be called in issues of this magnitude ive written to my mp but he refuses to even comment on this issue i suspect the game is rigged and it will take definitive action by the canadian public to address this
canada,not_removed,yep we have unleashed a monster i thought harper was bad with his tfws and increased immigration but the trudeau government is even worse this is because both parties and mulcairs ndp you dont hear a peep out of them are globalist parties taking orders from elsewhere we have the illusion of choice here
canada,not_removed,you voted for weed and you will get weed so stop pretending you gave a shit about anything else
canada,not_removed,how can they make everything expensive if everyone is out of work
canada,not_removed,where are these rural areas with more jobs and demand for new blood
canada,not_removed,unfortunately those labour intensive agricultural jobs you referred to from the past are now mostly mechanized if you want job growth in rural areas someone needs to start opening manufacturing facilities where landcost of living is relatively cheap of course you needs a product to produce that can compete against the cheap manufacturingwages of the asian competition
canada,not_removed,as an albertan i am happy with them all going to the gta we need to seal the area off just like vancouver
canada,not_removed,i think they should go to the ridings that voted for this mess you are all for immigrants just not where you are
canada,not_removed,people at home are the ones who voted them in i think they are doing a good job at managing canada so far federally that is
canada,not_removed,no i think the idea is that more people will allow for more jobs in construction and the service industry
canada,not_removed,take a look at germany canada right now for an immigration nightmare
canada,not_removed,lived in germany for a long time most of germany is cool with it a loud minority isnt remember that germany was the front line of the cold war and other wars so violent conflicts while unwanted isnt new to most of its inhabitants do the refugees significantly affect locals i would say barely and magnitudes less than the greek debt problem
canada,not_removed,ill be a citizen soon possibly sooner if they go through with some of their other proposals to shorten time needed to qualify but id sure as hell not vote for this liberal party
canada,not_removed,want more votes pander to new immigrants you know you have to be a canadian citizen to vote right itll be years before any of those people have the chance to vote and many of them will never achieve citizenship
canada,not_removed,ahh the old appeal to direct democracy when i dont like what government is doing i recommend you contact the federal party that best represents your antiimmigrant beliefs might i recommend the christian heritage party and vote for them in in fact i would also recommend that you support erre so that you could elect a party whose platform is focused on antiimmigration and if enough of you people vote you could get representation
canada,not_removed,more about bankrupting or making the current citizens poor and then when they lose their homes those liberal buddies can swoop in and buy them up at a steal
canada,not_removed,wow im not even shocked the protfw crowd must be really selfhating to support this
canada,not_removed,one more arena in which canadians are fucked out of a dignified life fuck this neoliberal bullshit
canada,not_removed,canada tends to get more highskilled employees than the us that ends up having a significant depressive effects on the few jobs left paying good wages
canada,not_removed,we have way too many underemployed mbas as it is i can understand difficult to acquire skilled professions like surgeons being needed but an mba is so easy to acquire and the supply is limitless in canada
canada,not_removed,canadian values are at their core western european values it make sense that europeans such as myself have zero issue integrating almost seamlessly whilst others struggle
canada,not_removed,a recent poll found that of canadians think immigration is a good thing all three parties agree the only debate is how many and how selected which are excellent questions for people with the quantitative skills to crunch the numbers such as trudeaus council of economic advisers and the bureaucrats that collect and analyze the data
canada,not_removed,the ukrainian community in the gta and kw seems really insular what makes them good immigrants compared to others
canada,not_removed,because justin has great hair
canada,not_removed,because harper was that bad he couldve won but ran a shitty campaign with shitty cabinet ministers
canada,not_removed,im confused about that as well his plan was to spend money on stuff and assumed it would balance the budget so he can keep spending more he made canada out to be this black hole country under harper imo id rather a quiet politician who stays out of the spotlight vs one who is endlessly trying to get on tabloid covers
canada,not_removed,cause the hair got a bump in voters that expect him to make weed legal
canada,not_removed,some make jobs but most do not thats why the quota should be small and selective
canada,not_removed,good riddance theres no shortage of suitable immigrants to take your place
canada,not_removed,i guess thats easier than standing and doing something about it but if we didnt have cowards to contrast them against we wouldnt have heroes
canada,not_removed,bye
canada,not_removed,sums up a lot of comments here
canada,not_removed,essentially what happened is canadas economy was sucking get immigrants to improve it still sucking get even more immigrants
canada,not_removed,here here
canada,not_removed,well said
canada,not_removed,why not both hell the government shouldnt even need people to call them to know that we dont want more immigration polls on the subject show that only of canadians want more the rest want the same or less
canada,not_removed,you all bought it even my immediate family bought it
canada,not_removed,you make it sound like voting conservatives wouldve meant a messfree government
canada,not_removed,its sunday im on thread e i should be in church praying for a miracle to save us all
canada,not_removed,wait cable companies provide good deals oh i get it the baitandswitch deal
canada,not_removed,most people will live better but not without sacrifices
canada,not_removed,hating alberta is a trudeau family tradition and vice versa
canada,not_removed,liberals are still very much committed to the electoral reform clickbaity news stories are just not great source of information anymore you can actually go on gov website to watch all the electoral reform committee discussions qa sessions and progression reports it seems to me that the reform is ongoing but taking unexpected directions in the pursuit of fairness the new electoral system might hurt of lot of people mainly older rural voters
canada,not_removed,the bulk of canada immigration is skilled workers not refugees and english is a international language easier to integrate people
canada,not_removed,what does that make you just an armchair whiner it is an economic subject why shouldnt we have a discussion on the economics
canada,not_removed,if by jumpstart you mean utterly destroy then yes
canada,not_removed,god help us all serenity now
canada,not_removed,let me tell you something my parents came here both welleducated from universities in stem with to their names they didnt have money to simply spend they had to work their way up for years despite their education level the overwhelming amount of immigrants that come here may be skilled but they are not wealthy at all it will not jumpstart spending at all i slept on the floor as a kid for months before we could afford a bed
canada,not_removed,we dont have jobs for them why doesnt this ever matter to people like you the us takes in the immigrants we do yet they have much higher gdp growth wake up
canada,not_removed,by deciding not to have children and a large part of that is due to the fact that children cost a ton of money add that to the fact that people have a hard time feeling financially secure enough to even be able to afford a house and thats a recipe for not having kids
canada,not_removed,this guy thinks that his retirement will be funded by migrants
canada,not_removed,this is about sjws neutering the local population by making all the next gen into beta males and bringing in a new more constant voter base to replace them
canada,not_removed,the average age of immighrants is not much lower than the average age of canadians also canadians are choosing to delay childbirth largely because it takes them until their if they are lucky to get financially secure and forget about owning a house were back to the days of raising kids in a studio apartment
canada,not_removed,take every dollar you spend on immigration and refugees and put it into programs incentivizing childbirth
canada,not_removed,or you know you could subsidize day care and give tax breaks as incentives to people already living here
canada,not_removed,when he said that there were about million people in canada
canada,not_removed,if we wanted to improve our numbers wed find ways to encourage people to have kids hell they could start with economics as the majority of millenials ive talked to say they cant have kids without putting themselves in poverty
canada,not_removed,their is a difference between maintaining a healthy population and driving numbers to record highs do you want economic growth at any cost or a quality standard of living for everyone
canada,not_removed,if youre in the gta or lower mainland weve already reached that point
canada,not_removed,young canadian here what you say is true
canada,not_removed,thats why we left vancouver there arent many cities in canada left that have a affordable housing and b decent jobs
canada,not_removed,im thinking to buy a place rent it out and keeping living with the rents hopefully one day be able to afford to live there
canada,not_removed,canada is not an eligible country for the green card visa lottery though
canada,not_removed,thanks that means a lot i have hundreds more links
canada,not_removed,i think the problem was we canadians were far too trusting with our government how could any economist with a straight face say we are facing a yearly inflation rate without being laughed out of the room our government removes housing food and energy fluctuations from the core cpi calculations they publish your housing shelter and food costs increased year after year according to economists those numbers dont count because they are volatile not only that but they constantly adjust the basket of goods to lower the inflation number further if beef is too expensive just replace it with chicken and we can magically pretend beef prices didnt double and still maintain that low inflation number as an immigrant who is used to governments fudging inflation numbers it feels like the past few governments have been trying to fool canadians into thinking that their quality of life hasnt been decreasing for the past few decades
canada,not_removed,stop creating our jerbs
canada,not_removed,second lots of immigrants start their own businesses and this doesnt factor into the standard job vacancy numbers wouldnt that show up in job creation what about job quality
canada,not_removed,but youre one of the others get out
canada,not_removed,how so
canada,not_removed,working age so that would be so like i said we dont even create enough jobs to keep up with half the rate of immigration why are we doing this its insanity what about all the unemployed canadians they are trying to get back into the worst labour market in years and the government is only making it harder on them its an unhealthy immigration fetish that is killing the country
canada,not_removed,tbh this person is comparing stocks and flows so its probably best to dismiss them outright
canada,not_removed,are working age remove immigrants gotta get that canada child benefit monies remove immigrants should be great for our healthcare system more dependents yay one of the highest immigration rates in the developed world hows our economy its shit but muh aging workforce canada has the immigration rate of the united states yet they have a much younger median age httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofcountriesbymedianage wow really makes you think
canada,not_removed,so youre saying were taking in immigrants who wont or cant work how does that make any sense
canada,not_removed,even with those adjustments we are still taking in twice as many immigrants as we have jobs for
canada,not_removed,youre forgetting that there over million unemployed canadians this is what i mean you immigration fetishists dont even apply logic
canada,not_removed,would that mean canada is fucked if hillary is elected
canada,not_removed,more years and then we can go back to the cpc and then we want out of the cpc we go back to the liberals ad infinitum
canada,not_removed,post nationalist not allowed to look out for our own interests
canada,not_removed,time to leave
canada,not_removed,maybe maybe not if michael chong wins and weve got a half chinesecanadian named chong advocating reduced information the liberals wont be able to play the omg your a card i dont know if thats his policy or not but it would be foolish for the conservatives to not take a reduced immigration stance given its one of the few areas they can really chip away at trudeau plus he seems like a moderate conservative and distanced from harper so he could become popular the downside for him though is that hes not a household name yet anyway
canada,not_removed,ndp might get a real shot
canada,not_removed,httpnewsnationalpostcomnewscanadamostcanadiansinfavouroflimitsonimmigrationpoll
canada,not_removed,what the hell has happened to the mulroney conservatives i never thought i would see the day where conservatives would be against trade and open markets if youre against the aristocracy then if i am correct in assuming why do you vote conservative
canada,not_removed,lol
canada,not_removed,because its considered racist to do the sensible thing nowadays
canada,not_removed,the middle class in the west were the only group of plebs that have ever given elites a run for their money they have been a target ever since
canada,not_removed,as canadians what can we do about this vote and participate the httpcapforcanadacom plans to base immigration on economic and cultural realities if you give your vote and time to these people youll see them gaining more influence
canada,not_removed,quit changing horses when they are going in the right direction harpers express entry was doing a lot of good it was a coherent plan which made immigration no longer a first come first served system it removed the automatic pr status for students so pr wasnt something you just buy with time and looked at what led to successful immigration it then selected people based on those factors the highest emphasis was given to people who could demonstrate that they were not taking any jobs from canadians and were filling genuine shortages in the labour market the government was working on the job bank site which employers were required to list on this gave the government the ability to see the applicants and make sure the employers were hiring qualified canadians if they were there they didnt get to finish and the liberals took over they replaced the quotas with family class and refugees and the scores have gone up significantly the provinces are using their slots but they are focusing on people with ties to the provinces so its more about connections and less about merits this is what the liberal party wants immigrants mean votes down the line
canada,not_removed,comes to demographic replacement you do realize that canada is way way way ahead of either europe or us on this right
canada,not_removed,as canadians what can we do about this remember this when going to the polls in but at this point i doubt that will happen on everyone in rcanada will be shitting on the conservatives in and completly forgotten what the liberals have or have not done
canada,not_removed,and mulcairs ndp you dont hear a peep out of them ndp immigration critic jenny kwan said canada could reasonably have a policy to bring in a higher number of immigrants up to annually rip all parties are a fucking disaster when it comes to immigration thats the truth we need an immigrationrealist canadians first party
canada,not_removed,we dont have any party that is opposed to the tfw program
canada,not_removed,harper restricted the tfw program significantly it was created by liberal governments before him
canada,not_removed,the economy isnt a zero sum game more people literally mean more opportunity if youre in a two player game of monopoly its all down to luck of the dice rolls if you both play well if youre playing three players you suddenly have the opportunity to trade between players and its a game of skill in dealing effectively every new player you add gives you more chances to find someone favorable to trading with you in a way that benefits you both and monopoly is a largely zero sum game where someone is losing every time youre winning but having more people in the market means more chances to enrich two parties with trade so youre playing the world like its all a matter of luck whereas the government is rightly playing the world like its a matter of bringing as many people together for positive trade as possible you should also consider that while we have a large selection of policies to keep unemployed workers afloat the only programs we really have for businesses who cannot employ staff afloat are the tfw programs this means that while a worker can lose his job and can find support from the government for a while but a business who cannot hire the people it needs to run its operations is just fucked theres not really a process engineer loans program for manufacturing that gets caught in a pinch or a heres some waitresses to cover your busy shifts program in places like alberta during the oil boom you literally couldnt hire anyone unless you paid oilfield prices and many of those people would be pretty clear they were only working for you while they looked for something in the oilfield do you think your local diner has oilfield margins your local gas station that means all those businesses who cannot find local workers in a timeframe that their business can survive die and youre left with huge multinationals like wallmart who if they run short on staff somewhere have options like recruiting and relocating at their expense tfw programs are basically programs to allow smaller enterprises the ability to find willing workers from outside their local area with a lot of the legwork and guesswork covered by the government instead of by a large multinational employing enough lawyers to make sense of the large patchwork of legal issues and jurisdictions and then keeping the advantage to themselves
canada,not_removed,i think what ugarlicroastedpotato is implying is that the demandsupply balance for jobs is more favorable in less dense population centers
canada,not_removed,a lot of those rural areas dont have job creation they need workers to be replaced a small town losing their local specialist isnt job creation but they still need a replacement
canada,not_removed,presumably all the immigrants we are getting are in areas we have needs instead if just unskilled workers or in fields overstocked with employees i know in my hometown and a lot of rural hometowns there is a very high demand for doctors nurses veterinarians and other medical professionals but a doctor will come and do a year or two and then leave as soon as they find a job in toronto
canada,not_removed,i thought they said immigrants create jobs all by themselves send them to the places that need jobs then
canada,not_removed,reminds me of this
canada,not_removed,not at all trudeau was born with a silver spoon in his mouth he knows life is a cake walk that everything you could ever dream of is placed on your lap by one of two dotting nannies he was even handed the job of pm simply because his father was a previous ruler of the nation he isnt malicious he simply lives in a fundamentally different reality
canada,not_removed,this comment is hilarious do you even read this stuff before you post submit
canada,not_removed,like the italians irish catholics and chinese lol get out of here with your agenda
canada,not_removed,yes but this appeases many generation voters many allowed in this year will be citizens by the next election as well
canada,not_removed,you know you have to be a canadian citizen to vote right itll be years before any of those people have the chance to vote takes about years
canada,not_removed,when they do become citizens they tend to vote liberal so from their standpoint an investment in mass immigration today is an investment in liberal votes tomorrow
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,they love our culture so much that they hold on to their old countries norms and create cultural ghettos really shows love for us shut immigration down to anyone not from europe
canada,not_removed,ahh the old appeal to direct democracy when i dont like what government is doing what do you mean by this is it wrong for him to want a democratic vote
canada,not_removed,this isnt about me its about the millions of canadians who are hurting the government doesnt give a shit about them and is leaving them behind canadians deserve better than this httpnewsnationalpostcomnewscanadatwoyearsintothecollapseofoilindustrythousandsofcalgariansarestilllookingforjobs i want to remain positive but i find it a real struggle sometimesi dont get the sense our politicians think this is an urgent matter
canada,not_removed,is the population of largest cities in saskatchewan combined well get a new urban saskatchewan equivalent increase every year the plan for the economy must be centered around the infrastructure to take on the new population
canada,not_removed,yes there has to be some xenophobic dislike in these pundits and some politicians theres a verifiable effort to replace canadians of every kind with lower paid substitutes
canada,not_removed,so why would canada want immigrants who struggle with the culture its bad for them and its bad for canada somehow diversity is always good or best
canada,not_removed,you are giving too much credit to western values do you pass a test or give a lecture about western values when you meet canadians you are probably white thats why you are accepted
canada,not_removed,think its good but only want more immigration
canada,not_removed,short of armed insurrection theres relatively little that can be done all parties are utterly controlled by the globalist class we need a trump
canada,not_removed,the same mentality is driving immigration to canada
canada,not_removed,sure as heck wouldve been better than this mess
canada,not_removed,yeah the great deal they usually offer for a year to entice a new customer despite already having a customer base that will never see that good price at least thats how shit works in mb lol
canada,not_removed,calm down im just pointing out the fact that whenever this topic is brought up a bunch of people start throwing out cherry picked stats
canada,not_removed,because this thread isnt about economics if it was we wouldnt be hung up on immigration because we would agree with the economists who support increasing our immigration targets this thread is not about economics
canada,not_removed,i dont want immigration but if you look at the birth rates of canadians they are hovering somewhere around thats below even replacement levels all im saying is that if we want to keep our mindset of growth and if we want to keep our generous social services which must support an increasingly elderly population with fewer children to pay into them then we must have youth to replace the old canadians wont reproduce so its up to immigrantsthat or accept a shrinking economy and drastically reduced social services
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,i need to gtfo the gta i love this place grew up here but its too much looks like either windsor or quebec for me the closer to the us border the better in my estimation
canada,not_removed,older canadian who was once young here not it isnt i mean since were being anecdotal
canada,not_removed,keep on sharing those links i make sure to save them since they do provide substance and not everybody has the time to research these matters
canada,not_removed,how not so your numbers arent in the image you linked and the image you linked is talking primarily about quebec only
canada,not_removed,all this is good for big business and the rich makes workers more desperate employers have an endless pool of people to hire from wages are easy to keep down and even shitty terrible jobs will be coveted get a job now or risk never getting one again
canada,not_removed,its an unhealthy immigration fetish that is killing the country exactly canadians arent against immigration but rather against unsustainable immigration canadians are increasingly competing against immigrants in the race to the bottom and wages are either declining or stagnant then on top of that realestate is unaffordable and favors foreigners and the cost of living keeps increasing how are canadians supposed to support increasing immigration when domestic problems arent being taken care of
canada,not_removed,ignore inconvenient facts typical you have no economic justification for immigrants a year and you know it
canada,not_removed,gotta get that canada child benefit monies someone has to replenish the population should be great for our healthcare system probably not a significant issue given the small numbers also from cic to apply for the parent and grandparent super visa you must be the parent or grandparent of a canadian citizen or a permanent resident of canada be allowed to enter canada and meet certain other conditions you must alsoprove that your child or grandchild in canada meets a minimum income threshold provide a written statement from that child or grandchild that he or she will give you financial support have valid canadian medical insurance coverage for at least one year and have an immigration medical exam
canada,not_removed,but muh aging workforce canada has the immigration rate of the united states yet they have a much younger median age you may want to check your understanding of the causal direction of this statement whats your counterfactual median age if canadas immigration rate were lower do you think that median age is affected exclusively by immigration rate and where are you getting that the canadian immigration rate is that of the usa httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofcountriesbynetmigrationrate youve repeated that number multiple times it would be nice to understand where youre sourcing it from
canada,not_removed,not at all remove immigrants get education now work later we expect the same of nonimmigrant children remove immigrants its a small number and doesnt make an enormous difference also most such people would arrive under the parentgrandparent class they a do not draw oascpp b must have their own medical insurance for at least a year c must undergo a medical exam d must have a child or grandchild who is a canadian citizen who is willing to undergo an income test that ensures the childgrandchild can provide financial assistance ifwhen needed all of this ensures that anyone arriving under this class of immigration will not drain the medicalsocial security system remove those who stay out of labour market voluntarily one example would be mothers of small children theyre spouses would probably be working this happens all the time even with nonimmigrant families why demand something different adjust for any voluntary job destruction this is probably the biggest factor the cited jobs created is a net figure it is net of jobs destructed voluntarily retirement would be a big source of this so net jobs are added but additional vacancies are created by retirement and other voluntary employment exits those add up quite a bit on an annual basis for instance canada has about workers aged if of them retired in a year there would be an additional new vacancies not counting people who voluntarily quit for other reasons
canada,not_removed,so your argument is that while we found jobs for effectively all the employable immigrants we added to the economy because some canadians are unemployed it means nothing im not following
canada,not_removed,canada is fucked if either are elected
canada,not_removed,i really wish we could get electoral reform so we can get some sort of balanced government
canada,not_removed,thats one of the things that really irks me why is it a bad thing for a government to represent the people who elect them and who pay taxes to fund them isnt that the point
canada,not_removed,for you this is my home im never leaving i will work to improve it
canada,not_removed,im a middle voter who can be swayed to vote tory and if it was chong as leader i could be persuaded to vote tory in
canada,not_removed,a three and a half year old article not really current
canada,not_removed,why do you vote conservative ive never voted for a party on the right side of the spectrum since i came of voting age in in fact having lived through the mulroney years is a very great part of that you really need to stop thinking that ad homimems are arguments and that everyone you hate votes for the tories its one of the reason no one here will ever take you and your quest for downvotes seriously
canada,not_removed,thanks bud will definitely look into them
canada,not_removed,the cultural action party has my vote
canada,not_removed,this is what the liberal party wants immigrants mean votes down the line thats all it is to them that and cheap labor while pushing wages down
canada,not_removed,yes but hes not talking about who were bringing in as canadians were all really comfortable with multiculturalism by now its about how many we bring in we should linearly bring in as many people as we can that keeps it sustainable with job growth and then some ex new jobs bring in people and let unemployed canadians get jobs fuel growth employment simultaneously its doable look at the us
canada,not_removed,just walk around toronto for a day it would be unrecognizable to a canadian from years ago the majority of people there werent even born in canada
canada,not_removed,the racism card doesnt work anymore pal nice try though
canada,not_removed,sadly it will never happen mass immigration seems to be the plan for all western nations
canada,not_removed,immigrationrealist reality is racist remember were living in a feelsreals world now
canada,not_removed,ndp immigration critic jenny kwan said canada could reasonably have a policy to bring in a higher number of immigrants up to annually what is mulcairs stance on this though it seems like all three parties favor immigration and not immigration reform
canada,not_removed,such a party would ignore the left on environment social programs and tax brackets so itll basically just divide the right if we had election reform we could have such a party not with ftpp voting and a liberal party with reduced immigration policy is just a pipe dream sadly
canada,not_removed,offshoring outsourcing automation tfws insane immigration and you wanna talk bullshit
canada,not_removed,tfw programs are basically programs to allow smaller enterprises the ability to find willing workers from outside their local area with a lot of the legwork and guesswork covered by the government instead of by a large multinational employing enough lawyers to make sense of the large patchwork of legal issues and jurisdictions and then keeping the advantage to themselves no tfw allows chinese mining firms to hire chinese only miners even when there are hundreds of canadians lined up begging to work there they get our resources and we get literally nothing in return
canada,not_removed,the level of contempt you have for canadian born workers is astounding i love the in your case low key put down of them generally speaking you shouldnt have to denigrate a group ie canadians arent skilled enough dont work hard enough etc to make a compelling argument or lift newcomers up do you honestly expect people to be persuaded when you insult them
canada,not_removed,the economy isnt a zero sum game more people literally mean more opportunity in this case thats only true for the employer which allows them to pay people less most immigrants that start businesses are starting local family only type places that dont do much for creating jobs for people the whole of your post is just talking about how businesses are able to lower their wages paid out due to immigration sure thats great for them but not so good for canadians especially in places where the cost of living isnt in line with the wages being offered
canada,not_removed,unless your a health professional it really isnt toronto is full of young people from small towns alot of immigrants will def find it easier to find work in the bigger cities especially if they know people there already which most do also you can depend on public transportation and alot of small towns are really not that welcoming to outsiders
canada,not_removed,a lot of rural towns are simply bad places to live for most people which is why the young people run away and no one lives there if they werent raised there you cant fault canadians whether immigrant or not for not living in isolated places
canada,not_removed,plus his dad was your typical college communist who was against canadas involvement in so who knows what values he taught his son
canada,not_removed,a bit too onthenose for you haha do you think that he likes canadians if he did hed want them to have jobs and be successful
canada,not_removed,yeah we should be restricting democratic rights because of what the outcomes might be s have you forgotten that it was jason kenney who was able to galvanize the immigrant vote for years and it took months of niqab bans and snitch lines to unravel it
canada,not_removed,not with express entry and the liberals bill that reduces the time period to years minus of the time before pr up to one year it will be closer to three years
canada,not_removed,yes you must be correct obviously no culture could be strong enough to connect the peoples of a large nation like canada we are not two solitudes but a thousand s
canada,not_removed,ironic af
canada,not_removed,and even if you might not know it non anglo europeans have done that in the us too the ones for the irishgermanswedes have disappeared as they arrived in the but we still have remnants of little italy and brighton beach in nyc most of your immigrants are either chinese or indian what cultural norms are they holding onto opening up new restaurants having weird dances
canada,not_removed,no but thats what elections are for its babies that cry for referendums when they disagree with democratically elected governments
canada,not_removed,nobody asked you to be their champion so why not worry about yourself
canada,not_removed,yeah im really wondering where they expect all these immigrants will live and find work if they all end up in a few major cities it will be a nightmare for congestion and im not saying it isnt an issue already
canada,not_removed,i wouldnt want anyone to come here who was going to struggle to integrate thats is the exact opposite of an immigration program that is good for the host country and it is not very humane for those arriving either theyd be better served in a location with similar cultural values
canada,not_removed,what problemsissues do you have with western values is it our belief in freedom of expression democratic institutions womens rights lgbtqia rights protection for ethnic and religious minoritieswhich value system do you find superior to ours im genuinely curious
canada,not_removed,so basically i did not integrate well into canadian society because i speak fluent english have tertiary level education have nearly a decade experience in my field that i work hard here my cultural background is similar to my host country that i made ernest attempts to have canadian friends engage in canadian culture and to embrace it as my own no no the only reason i was accepted was because im a pasty irish lad provide sources im not convinced by your argument a good start would be to show me a hundred or so black french or black british people who came here and experienced systemic racism based solely on the tone of their skin the suggestion that i was accepted because im white is racism its positive racism but it is still racist because you are distilling my efforts and experiences down to the colour of my flesh
canada,not_removed,personally i agree with them though i am open to being convinced that a small increase is desirable seems a bridge too far to me based on a gut check and not anything quantitative
canada,not_removed,lmao yeah okay thats your opinion i disagree
canada,not_removed,can you link to some economists explaining why immigration is beneficial im kind of on the fence about this issue and want to understand both sides
canada,not_removed,macroeconomic theory has relatively little to do with the wellbeing of the average citizens sure immigration will drive growth but a slightly larger pie with many more people means a smaller slice for everyone economists are only looking at the raw size of the pie and not what the average citizen gets
canada,not_removed,jesus fucking christ so can we take in then you act as though there are only options zero or formerly
canada,not_removed,heres an idea genius how bout we just let the country shrink slowly maybe it will be painful for a few decades while the boomers die off but things would even out over time fuck this constant growth post nationalist bullshit
canada,not_removed,so delusional you think this is to help us where is the evidence
canada,not_removed,born and raised in vancouver myself finally leaving to a small town in months i did love it here but its not vancouver anymore and i often feel like a stranger so i can relate
canada,not_removed,quebec is very affordable from my experience but jobs still suck as much as everywhere else
canada,not_removed,you can try the tricities or guelph to live dont know what you do for work but theyd be easier to live in than toronto
canada,not_removed,how is it anecdotal when he is providing stats backing up what he says
canada,not_removed,we could always try sweden or germany
canada,not_removed,holy shit thanks for this link i dont want to give details but i might be eligible its a long shot but still is that how you got to the states only of them will be successful still better than lotto max and
canada,not_removed,the image is from the quebec budget but it shows net job creation for all canadian provinces since may add it up and you get
canada,not_removed,its no wonder i see mental health billboards all over the place here in ontario
canada,not_removed,exactly and the rhetoric of identity politics is being used to push this through legitimate debate is being shut down with accusations of racism
canada,not_removed,looks like the government wants to starve the youth already here
canada,not_removed,someone has to replenish the population average age of an immigrant is like meanwhile canadians are delaying having children because they cant get their finances in order until they are in their
canada,not_removed,someone has to replenish the population want canadians to have more kids stop suppressing the shit out of their wages someone has to worry about the economy clearly the immigration fetishists who want to flood the country with hundreds of thousands of people we dont need or have jobs for dont give a a damn
canada,not_removed,i can do math us takes in million for a country of million canada takes in for a country of million soon well be taking in god help us thats nearly to be exact nowhere near it was a little closer to when we only took but that amount is now considered racistxenophobic
canada,not_removed,youre ruining the circle jerk buddy
canada,not_removed,so your argument is that while we found jobs for effectively all the employable immigrants we added to the economy source that isnt what i said you yourself are claiming that of the people were bringing into this country are unemployable
canada,not_removed,no trump is against the tpp if he scraps it then well also be saved from it
canada,not_removed,i really wish we could get electoral reform so we can get some sort of balanced government thats just a broken promise now
canada,not_removed,you will never in your life fix the damage being done every year by immigration
canada,not_removed,i was waiting for you to say that a nanos research survey of canadians conducted for the globe and mail in august found per cent said the government should accept fewer immigrants in than the previous year thirtyseven per cent said canada should accept the same amount in while only per cent said the target should be increased
canada,not_removed,but youre from alberta you have to be a conservative voter obviously
canada,not_removed,you really need to stop thinking that ad homimems are arguments and that everyone you hate votes for the tories its one of the reason no one here will ever take you and your quest for downvotes seriously i measure my successes in the real world not some slick online message board full of strangers
canada,not_removed,as canadians were all really comfortable with multiculturalism speak for yourself please there is a difference between being saturated with the concept as a form of social propaganda and actually being ok with it
canada,not_removed,ummm thats what i said
canada,not_removed,so all three political parties who have access to resources and studies stats canada and the public service all have it wrong on immigration and the good people of rcanada are in the know because their personal situation is representative of reality as a whole god this place sometimes
canada,not_removed,this is going to happen one thing that is going to snowball it fast is if trudeau doesnt make his promises happen with a liberal majority he wont get a chance all the young voters he made promises too will jump fast
canada,not_removed,i want to talk about how the world actually works using the metaphor of a game to make a difficult problem understandable to a layperson did you read what i wrote if you want to pretend the world is simple and get angry when your simplistic solutions turn to shit thats fine but if you learn about why we do things the way we do you might be able to contribute to the conversation that moves us forward
canada,not_removed,the quicker you come to terms with the fact that globalization is happening the better youll fee youre swimming against the tide and advocating for policies that will just further set us back as a country its the labour equivalent of climatechange deniers
canada,not_removed,those workers pay taxes that company pays taxes and royalties those workers shop at local stores and the best of ones we might eventually make canadians out of the rest we send home after they pay us taxes they dont get most of the benefits from how exactly is this a bad deal
canada,not_removed,i dont have contempt for them the only problem is that there are not enough of them literally the biggest thing holding canadian workers back is the lack of canadian workers to build our economy
canada,not_removed,im not arguing that theres a lump of labor im arguing quite literally the opposite more players means more opportunity for mutually beneficial exchange and with the economy headed towards short term engagements and small transactional businesses theres not going to be any number of any jobs in the planning sense
canada,not_removed,no the term zero sum game means that for anyone to gain someone else has to lose if someone can gain without anyone losing its not a zero sum game the economy is decidedly not a zero sum game more players means more trade means more opportunity for mutual benefits the point of my post is that if businesses that cannot hire from the local talent pool their margins die then the market shrinks and the timeframe for their needs is significantly shorter than for workers a worker can rely on the state to prop them up a long time but a business such as a restaurant is literally fucked if they cant find waitresses for a week so if you want to protect the canadian market for just canadians you run the risk of destroying canadian small businesses because they cannot handle even the shortest of term labor shortages
canada,not_removed,you cant fault canadians whether immigrant or not for not living in isolated places you can when the bulk of the immigrant inflow goes to the already overcrowded and overextended major cities its not like those who are in those major cities dont have enough issues
canada,not_removed,if you are popular and have nice hair youll never need to get a real job
canada,not_removed,did it ever occur to you that rather than hating all canadians he just happens to agree with his council of economic advisers and most other economists that based on demographics and economics a well targeted immigration program is in canadas interests occams razor either he became prime minister out of hatred and spite or he is doing what he things is right which makes more sense to you
canada,not_removed,you see what brad mccallum doesnt understand is that as a worker visitor student you have a different client id than as a pr so when you apply for citizenship this creates a mess and you will have to literally prove your presence in canada during the pre or time with a substantial amount of documentation so taking this time into account delays your application sometimes by years it is best to not take prepr time into account at all
canada,not_removed,our culture of openess isnt big enough to tolerate backwords misonyst world sects and religions so you are right
canada,not_removed,its babies that cry for referendums when they disagree with democratically elected governments governments arent tyrants people are allowed to call for referendums especially if they feel the government isnt representing them and considering only of canadians want higher immigration intake id say that the government is not respecting the peoples wishes
canada,not_removed,wow sounds like perhaps we should adjust immigration intake accordingly in the face of current economic realities
canada,not_removed,perhaps canadians need a champion
canada,not_removed,and plenty of generation chinese or indian or african kids integrate fine into canadian culture after their parents come in im sure many gen nonwhite immigrants who come to canada are probably far more qualified than you are too and who the fuck considers ukrainians as western any country within the sphere of greater russia is not a part of the west how do east europeans have anymore of an easier time integrating into canadian culture and are you really naive to believe that europeans dont form ghettos or segregate by ethnic group everyone who comes to canada who isnt from an anglo or germanic white country will have some difficulties integrating fuck off with your bullshit
canada,not_removed,lol probably millions of immigrants have similar or better education and job experiences than you the fact you are oblivious to the systematic racism and discrimination in canada is a good indicative about your beliefs and yes your experiences here are deeply related to the colour of your flesh whether you believe or not it doesnt matter it is just a fact
canada,not_removed,within these studies there are ample links that expand on the issues
canada,not_removed,youre right man economists never heard of looking at things per capita
canada,not_removed,the purpose of immigration is to grow the pie
canada,not_removed,i dont know the answer to that ask mccallum and see if hed be cool with just
canada,not_removed,sure im fine with that however what are you going to do about the shift in demographics towards an increasingly large elderly population with a shrinking youth population the elderly are entitled to social security and healthcare which they use at high rate causing a net drain on the economy somebody will have to pay for these things who is going to do it or do we just impose an tax on the working class in order to support the elderly
canada,not_removed,where did i lose you lets break this down social services require money economies require labour an elderly population plus a dwindling supply of youth bad somebody has to pay for the elderly and that means we need young people to work canadians dont reproduce so it has to be immigrants or radical social change
canada,not_removed,feeling like a stranger in your own country i know that feels
canada,not_removed,fwiw i left in the the jobsrent situation isnt something new i just think the internet is letting us all compare our own personal situation a lot better than we previously could
canada,not_removed,i had to leave vancouver due to lack of high paying enough job go live comfortably in victoria but costs getting higher here too thankfully rent is saner my bedroom is where with a roommate in kits in vancouver i paid for my half
canada,not_removed,because you are talking to alt accounts
canada,not_removed,were worse much worse what did they did year we do every year
canada,not_removed,germany haha merkels out of her own state it could easily happen to trudeau jr too
canada,not_removed,you sure this is easier than just getting a tn visa
canada,not_removed,if you qualify for one of the nafta jobs its even easier than that httpwwwtnvisaexpertcomoverviewnaftajoblist httpstravelstategovcontentvisasenemploymentnaftahtml
canada,not_removed,thats just private sector job creation though
canada,not_removed,mental health services are a joke in ontario
canada,not_removed,ironically white canadians are probably one of the least racist groups in the entire world
canada,not_removed,bingo they have a stranglehold on alot of people with propaganda alone not to mention all their other methods
canada,not_removed,true point
canada,not_removed,wages dont have alot to do with fertility rates theres plenty of wealthy couples with no kids or kid
canada,not_removed,wages likely have little to do with fertility if you take the children as a consumer good standpoint then higher income results in fewer children but greater investments per child fertility drops but child quality increases also when income is low people might use fertility kids as a source of economic security for women a higher wage raises the opportunity cost of fertility
canada,not_removed,surely the net change is relevant though if people enter but leave how many jobs do we need to create also us immigration in was not so the multiplier on inflows is arguably also that spike in us immigration happens over the exact same time period that youre citing their good economic performance you really should look into that spurious correlation thing
canada,not_removed,your source said we added of immigrants and we added of jobs and yeah who do you think we let immigrate adults come as couples with children for the most part that means two adults and some kids
canada,not_removed,everyone gives trump a hard time because he said some nasty words but if you look at his policies most are pretty reasonable im not excusing what he said but strictly talking policy he is better but of course the left shoots back yeah well i watch john oliver and read the huffpo so im well informed and know drumpf sucks
canada,not_removed,while only per cent said the target should be increased wow that was from the target were already at and now going up to insanity very antidemocratic
canada,not_removed,overall per cent of respondents disagreed there was too much immigration in canada compared to per cent who said the immigration level was too high environics has been surveying canadians about their attitudes to immigration since the the latest poll found fewer canadians now express concern about immigrants not adopting canadian values the lowest ever recorded in the last two decades nine out of said someone born elsewhere is just as likely to be a good citizen as someone born here
canada,not_removed,nothing like good old censorship when it suits you hey
canada,not_removed,google world iq map and tell me if racism is still a social construct notice any clear patterns also intelligence is genetic and heritable differences in intelligence between ethnic groups are due to genetics alone better education will not change differences in group intelligence theyll always remain human intelligence up to inheritible human intelligence is highly heritable scientific consensus is that iq tests are not racially biased very poor whites are comparably intelligent to very wealthy blacks black children raised in white households have similar iqs to black children in black households the average african iq is estimated at the average africanamerican iq is compared to the average white iq of the whiteblack gap in sat scores a proxy for iq is increasing genes for large brains linked to high iq are common everywhere except africa intelligence has at least a genetic basis iq scores are the best predictor of success in western society iq is heritable among whites frances iq drops points per decade because of african immigration
canada,not_removed,so youre saying that we should blindly put our faith in the major political parties to do everything right because they know better jesus christ
canada,not_removed,canada has one of the highest immigration rates in the developed world hows the canadian economy doing
canada,not_removed,yeah i mean we should just ignore the rising tide of nationalism happening right now throughout europe and the rise of trump in the us which is directly attributable to his stance on migration and just give up our homes jobs and wives to our new guests otherwise we might be called bigots
canada,not_removed,they are paid less than canadians sometimes much more less because they are often rippedoff on overtime and exploited in other ways they shop way less than a canadian with the same job would because they are saving every penny to send home the rest we send home after they pay us taxes they dont get most of the benefits from the taxes on minimum wage temp workers is minuscule we would be way better off putting unemployed canadians to work the ones we cant just send away if they arent paying their share the ones who are getting healthcare and everything else and not paying any taxes because they cant find a job and get them started on career paths to better jobs with better pay that pay higher taxes
canada,not_removed,many employers refuse to pay a liveable wage and provide basic benefits
canada,not_removed,thats true which is why the northern ontario medical school was created it makes much more sense to help people from the north and rural areas get into medical school and nursing school than expect people who lived in toronto there whole lives to stay in rural towns in northern ontario
canada,not_removed,it doesnt matter on these posts its the same users who post the same drivel in a concerted effort to stoke nationalist and xenophobic views its better just to make fun of them and laugh at their irrelevancy
canada,not_removed,that is incorrect my uci client id is the same as a pr as it was on both my student and work permits
canada,not_removed,then vote for the party that looks to put an end to it in just prepare to be disappointed you nativists should be pushing for erre so you can get someone in ottawa who shares your ignorant views
canada,not_removed,wow sounds like perhaps we should adjust immigration intake accordingly in the face of current economic realities ironic how you throw around the word reality when you chose to ignore the realities of immigration and its importance to our own economic prosperity the true economic reality is that immigration is essential towards economic growth across canada thats the reality and youre choosing to ignore it for reasons you have yet to come clear on why are you against empirical evidence and what is your real motive behind being so vocal against immigration
canada,not_removed,we dont but thanks for asking
canada,not_removed,and who the fuck considers ukrainians as western any country within the sphere of greater russia is not a part of the west was not my statement nor did i even imply this so do not dare attribute it to me all i said was that canadian values are western european values in a reply to someone who said this when you are in government it is your job to make policies that all canadians agree with not just a slim minority of liberal sjws that you surround yourself with excessive immigration is not a canadian value there were some good immigrants like ukrainians they were hardworking and understood canadian values but these ones just will never understand the concept of democracy i think it was obvious from that statement that ukraine is separate from that part of the world i was suggesting that fundamentally canadian values are european more specifically western european not once did i broach his statement regarding ukrainian immigrants fuck off with your bullshit no this is an open forum were we are all free to share our ideas also is this how you speak to people in your daily life because it is not conducive to any form of civil dialogue i have not once been rude to anyone here yet right here with this little jab we have established who the vulgarian is im sure many gen nonwhite immigrants who come to canada are probably far more qualified than you are too define more qualified more qualified for what the job i currently do the job i came here to do more qualified to be an immigrant in this country more academic credentials i do not understand what you mean by more qualified it is far too open ended therefore this comment cannot be rebuked or agreed with all i can say is that because we take hundreds of thousands in per year there is a statistically likelihood that some are more qualified in certain ways than i am depending upon the criteria of more qualified and plenty of generation chinese or indian or african kids integrate fine into canadian culture after their parents come in agree with you on this how do east europeans have anymore of an easier time integrating into canadian culture define east european are we talking about eastern block countries countries east of austria are we including finland are we including russia are we including countries that dont exist anymore and whose people might have came here as refugees so they come with their own baggage ie psychological trauma are we including estonia and lithuania its a fairly big area with many distinct cultural differences damn the cultural differences of groups within some countries in eastern europe can be staggering im sure depending on a variety of factors some will have an easier time than others something as simple as whether or not their educational credentials are accepted at face value will have a huge factor in determining economic success for instance i graduated from a top tier university in the uk no one ever questioned my academic credentials i also know a mechanical engineer who was educated in egypt and had to jump through a tremendous amount of hoops in order to get his academic credentials recognized he came here in the so i dont know how much has changed since then we have all heard stories of doctors working as taxi drivers this is a whole other discussion but an awful waste of talent im sure youd have a hard time say moving to hungary than to czech republic due to enormous difficulty that english speakers face when trying to learn hungarian when compared to czech i know some hungarians yugoslavians and ukrainians some good friends of mine who came as refugees and have integrated wonderfully im sure many have had a hard time i can only speak from my own personal experiences
canada,not_removed,latin american western values im honestly intrigued first define western values we cannot go further without a solid definition of what you mean by western values right now it is nebulous and fluffy and could lead to all sorts of goalposts being rearranged honestly im trying to understand your perspective here its interesting
canada,not_removed,you havent provided any proof of your claims you have only provided your feelings and assertions of the facts
canada,not_removed,do you even read these things they are saying we need to be more selective reduce immigration and that we are getting worse at immigration this from your sfu study akbari found on the basis of census data a small fiscal transfer from immigrants to the nativeborn amounting to about per year per immigrant over time the composition and income attainment of immigrants has evolved somewhat unfavourably for immigrants and we find on the basis of census data a small fiscal transfer from the native born to immigrants of about per year per immigrant
canada,not_removed,i get that but if the population grows and the pie only grows that just means less for everyone they need to ignore the pie itself and focus on maximizing the amount of slice people get
canada,not_removed,not a chance the fucker is out of his mind
canada,not_removed,immigrants on average are not much younger than the average canadian also and this may come as a shock to you but people who dont have jobs will not be funding your retirement sorry to break it to you nice try tho
canada,not_removed,its going to be ugly i think the elderly are just going to suffer a bit everyone is going to suffer the boomers didnt put enough away to take care of themselves and kept taxes and contributions low while they were working they cant expect the younger generation to take care of them especially when most of these fuckers control all the wealth my parents have made shitty decisions all their lives with regards to their retirement im not their safety valve fuck em they cant fuck us for decades and then expect good stuff back when theyre feeble
canada,not_removed,immigrants use more social services than they pay for in taxes each immigrant is a net loss and makes our situation worse our youth cant even get jobs there isnt a labour shortage anywhere in our economy also immigrants are older than canadians so are making this demographic challenge worse
canada,not_removed,where has my country gone
canada,not_removed,it has definitely accelerated though lets look at now versus the university tuition has more than tripled housing in vancouver has more than tripled where i live there are more unemployed young canadians and young canadians who are working are earning less then theres the demographic shift since then a drop of the caucasian population which is quite significant yet never brought up
canada,not_removed,so what do you think is happening when people from across the world can live in vancouver but vancouverites cant scarcity
canada,not_removed,nothing he said relates to skin color you are being dishonest
canada,not_removed,this is very condescending
canada,not_removed,youre a perfect example of everything wrong with the contemporary regressive left
canada,not_removed,so
canada,not_removed,thats not a surprise they spent their budget on billboards
canada,not_removed,at least the billboards are real
canada,not_removed,i thought laughter was the best medicine
canada,not_removed,how is this even a provable statement
canada,not_removed,yep i have never met a racist white canadian we generally want everyone to do well how the fuck is this such a surprise
canada,not_removed,really wages have nothing to do with people being able to afford to have children thats pretty hilarious
canada,not_removed,also when income is low people might use fertility kids as a source of economic security yes push out the kids so you can get more of the public dime oh boy what a resounding benefit for bringing in more immigrants
canada,not_removed,if people enter but leave how many jobs do we need to create now youre confusing job creation with immigration intake different things are you claiming all immigrants went back lol also us immigration in was not wew lad they havent even reported figures yet was under a million your numbers are way off and even if this so the multiplier on inflows is arguably was true then youre still arguing to cut canadas immigration intake in half you really should look into that spurious correlation thing wow really makes you think
canada,not_removed,are working age not as you are claiming
canada,not_removed,that and hillary cant even manage her fucking email account
canada,not_removed,and hillary wont
canada,not_removed,hes a populist so thats not surprising there are several theories of how to govern from the people elected me so i should do what i think is best to the people elected my platform so i should stick to my public platform to the people elected me so i should do what they want and act in their stead regardless of what i believe people in the first camp will say what people want to hear to get elected then not do it people in the latter camp will say what people want to hear then do their best to go out and do it the question is which trump is we know hillary is the former she admits as much in her wall street talks stating that politics is like sausage and nobody wants to see it made so its important to have public and private positions on everything
canada,not_removed,i stand by my quote
canada,not_removed,intelligence study links low iq to racism and conservatism
canada,not_removed,if the majority of political parties are overwhelmingly in support of immigration while you represent the tiny little minority that doesnt who do you think has it right mr anonymous internet guy or career politiciansacademicsspecialists who have greater access to the information than you jesus christ is righthe was also a supporter of immigration btw
canada,not_removed,id say its in the top since i went and looked that up and since almost every single one of our industries is constrained by human resources not anything else we need more people to reach bigger markets just because people are looking for work doesnt mean you dont need more talent in alberta the cattle industry died because the oilfield took up all the slaughterhouse staff if youre shipping cattle south of the border for slaughter because ita too hard to find reliable staff why not just raise the cattle south of the border too it took a decade or so but not having enough workers eventually killed most of it and moved operations elsewhere had alberta worked to limit the oil industry by applying disincentives and aggressively adding people to the workforce we could have kept a lot of our cattle lumber prefabrication and manufacturing rolling but since we doubled down hard on that one industry and everyone was servicing it and were suffering a major downturn because the reality of the world changed and all the pipelines in the world wont change the new reality of the world since seismic and fracking have turned most of the world into oil producers and the cost of exploration is a tiny fraction of what it once was and the oil in alberta is heavy and expensive to refine even if it could cheaply make it to the worlds markets its still going to sell at a discount for the same reason cane sugar outsells maple syrup as a sweetener
canada,not_removed,the rise of trumpism and nationalism has to do with career politicians who benefited extensively from free trade who are using this issue to gain political power do you think farage johnson and trump would have made their wealth in the absence of free trade they are purposely ignoring fact and evidence in an emotional appeal to people who want to blame someone for their poor decision making and lots in life when white people are running around scared despite having the greatest chances at being successful in a liberal democratic society thats were you have populist leaders rise up and take advantage of those emotions the brexit vote was little britain pointing their fingers towards visible minorities for their own poor decision making abilities in getting pissed and watching footy as opposed to studying and opening a business i have no sympathy for people who think that they dont have the ability to affect change in their own lives and simultaneously shitting on government for not finding jobs for them and making sure that they work for the next years boo fucking hoo
canada,not_removed,really because im a temporary worker in the us and i spend like a drunken sailor and according to the department of labor im in the percentile for my industry but like i said you either deal with the fact our labor markets are way too tight or you outright kill local canadian businesses large multinationals can weather short term shortages and pay over their margins until they have a staff base small businessses cant
canada,not_removed,so get a union that way you have a system by which to make workers problems the problems of employers and governments and instead of an employer dealing with a bunch of random emotional people who often negotiate poorly they deal with a trained leader who speaks for many of them leading to a much more efficient exchange that allows better planning to be executed if you leave it to the government youre leaving looking out for your needs to the party who needs to not only represent the best interests of the fish in the sea but also the plankton and the business of being the sea itself and the government only really takes a major tally of your needs every few years whereas your union is always working for you as that is literally their only job
canada,not_removed,i cant parse that can you explain it to me
canada,not_removed,do you mean the party or left leaning people either way if they believe that theyre delusional as well
canada,not_removed,you mean in their ethnic enclaves
canada,not_removed,working beside them working good one
canada,not_removed,downtown toronto is mostly white
canada,not_removed,we do
canada,not_removed,the implications made by many of the commentators here are that most of the immigrants are unskilled nonwhites who form ethnic enclaves maybe that was true in the but most immigrants nowadays need some sort of higher educational background and existing skill set to work in canada you cant just pack your bags and come here i do think canada takes in more immigrants than it needs to but not everyone is a syrian or somalian refugee by east european i was referring to slavic countries which wouldnt include finland or estonia which are finnic ethnic groups eastern european countries that were formerly a part of the soviet union are not considered western is what we consider the west sometimes argentina uruguay and chile are included
canada,not_removed,how very socialist of you
canada,not_removed,and no party is even talking about reducing httpsislimgpjpymcjpg
canada,not_removed,oh well i guess that means well at least be diverse and multicultural while our social infrastructure collapses
canada,not_removed,this is the best thread ever asks where is the evidence and then spews out a bunch of crap and provides no evidence or sources nicely done
canada,not_removed,none of what you just wrote is true and it is very irresponsible to promote such nonsense
canada,not_removed,and the government claims an inflation rate of a mere per year at least canadians are finally catching on that its not just third world governments that bs inflation and employment numbers all governments will lie through their teeth with fake numbers if you allow them to do so we need to start calling out the extremely misleading aka lies numbers coming out of our lying government
canada,not_removed,i would be for immigration if there was heavy restrictions on countries from outside of western europe and the anglosphere like there was prior to so this isnt racist
canada,not_removed,complete with a throwaway reddit account
canada,not_removed,you wont get a proper answer out of him you can present evidence and he will simply brush it aside without a second thought
canada,not_removed,its not but if you talk to a lot of different people you will quickly fond its true asians natives blacks muslims please go ahead and speak to these groups and gain their trust and find out what they really say amongst themselves
canada,not_removed,yet go ahead and talk to some of these immigrants in their native tongue the chinese are crazy racist all the time
canada,not_removed,hilariously compatible with available evidence i agree
canada,not_removed,you dont understand the argument was that less immigration results in higher wages and thus more kids i argued that even if less immigration produced higher wages that would not produce more fertility but probably less so the argument that we need to reduce immigration to stimulate canadianborn fertility is quite shaky
canada,not_removed,im not confusing job creating with immigration intake any more than you are so we dont even create enough jobs to keep up with current insane levels of immigration not even by half again you need to consider the outflows to add sense to this argument ill concede that my number on immigration rates was inaccurate the us number included students and temporary residents against just permanent residencies in canada this just underscores my point about why net migration is relevant not just inflows and yes outflows of foreignborn individuals from canada is nonnegligible finally the whole point is that immigration wont have a major effect on gdp per capita one way or another the sluggish canadian economy has almost nothing to do with migration nothing im not advocating for an increase or a decrease in immigration by any amount im saying it wont really matter because the effect of immigration on gdp per capita is small maybe theres an effect in having high skill immigration there certainly is in the usa and there is genuine concern about demographics in canada despite your claims otherwise i notice you ignored my earlier request for a counterfactual but the real point is that trying to protect these domestic retail and labour jobs that have become fully commoditized is a foolish proposition canada has no advantage in those sectors trying to retain those jobs regardless of their romanticized past puts us in competition with places like vietnam kenya and sri lanka for these marginally productive jobs which would be even more marginal in canada we should be competing with europe japan the us and the increasingly educated and productive parts of china fretting over tfws selling donuts is nonsense
canada,not_removed,yes a couple with a child over and one under will be working age but one will be working one will be taking care of children and two will likely be in school at any rate we added people and the economy grew what more do you want
canada,not_removed,sources disagree apparently what makes you think yours is better than mine
canada,not_removed,youre quoting the huffington post and google and are for sale politically youre literally linking propaganda whereas i linked multiple objective scientific journals
canada,not_removed,intelligent people generally have the education and means to remain isolated from interacting with the lower classes of other races if things get really bad and they come too close to having their antiracist worldview shattered they can always flee their neighbourhoods or even their countries to greener pastures and then blame vague tension or politicalsocioeconomic issues for what went wrong i know a white american man who said that one of the reasons he moved to canada was that were less racist he moved from a black metro area in the states to a white and black city here he didnt seem to see the irony you can easily watch the same thing play out with the global ashkenazi jewish diaspora who have some of the highest iqs out there they tend to be some of the fiercest proponents of multiculturalism right up until muslims start burning down synagogues and attacking people wearing kippahs then the wealthy ones flee to israel or the us or some other country leaving the lowermiddle class jews and europeans to fend for themselves france for example has one of the highest rates of emigration of high net worth individuals and israel is one of the highest receivers
canada,not_removed,while you represent the tiny little minority that doesnt who do you think has it right the vast majority of the population is against this
canada,not_removed,argumentum ad populum years ago expert consensus was very different than it is today on most issues the point about jesus christ seems highly irrelevant and facetious
canada,not_removed,did it ever occur to you that to many people there are things more important than money
canada,not_removed,but like i said you either deal with the fact our labor markets are way too tight or you outright kill local canadian businesses so when the racism charges fail you go to your back up fear mongering local canadians business and foreign owned business can either hire canadians at at least minimum wage or they can go bankrupt if your business model relies on exploiting world labour then your business model sucks
canada,not_removed,the urban landscape is more than just who sleeps at a given address but who works and plays in that area
canada,not_removed,thank you dear leader
canada,not_removed,i think we are basically on the same page then
canada,not_removed,it is very socialist and good on them i look favourably upon people who look out for most people instead of just the privileged dont you
canada,not_removed,im telling you facts that you can easily look up for yourself you obviously are not interested in a debate with facts however so diligently posting my sources mostly stats can wont help me much
canada,not_removed,its all true the only one promoting nonsense is you you look at immigration from the and think it applied to today canada gets worse and worse at immigration you promote the dangerous idea that we are still getting something out of this when we are definitely not
canada,not_removed,oh look the globalists are here it is nice that everyone can recognize the common tactic so throwing out thats racist in a pathetic attempt to stifle discussion
canada,not_removed,sounds like a great research project s
canada,not_removed,when i lived in south korea i was originally quite shocked at how many koreans would openly tell me that they thought very poorly of black people the shock wore off because it kept happening to the point where i just came to accept it as a cultural norm for them im still really fond of that country and the people there but yeah left wingers who think racism begins and ends with white people are living very sheltered lives
canada,not_removed,too true i used to work in my universitys international students department they were the absolute worst to deal with huge sense of entitlement and made no attempt what so ever to even interact with those outside their group
canada,not_removed,youre fine with leaving millions of canadians behind im not
canada,not_removed,i dont say that it was better i just stand by it
canada,not_removed,do you have any of studies on conspiracy theorist iqs
canada,not_removed,are statistics ok then you seem to want to refute everything that goes against your opinion
canada,not_removed,did it ever occur to you that those people are a small minority in our capitalist society money is a very important matter
canada,not_removed,who said anything about hiring less than minimum wage i said hiring at all my friend owned a downtown edmonton restaurant and couldnt find reliable staff at literally any price when they needed them you lose a cook and it takes a month to find a new one no matter what you pay what do you do for those unstaffed shifts do you always carry a ton of extra staff that you pay to do nothing to hold on to those positions can your margins support that so local business goes out of business but subway has people to figure out how to transfer staff from where they have them to where they need them so they can lose the immediate battle but win the war of staying open the canadian market has been tight on labor for a long time and its hurting us a lot at this moment it might seem crazy because of the downturn its absolutely vital to keep bringing in more workers
canada,not_removed,yeah i wonder if any of these people who call toronto an ethnic enclave have ever been here its a beautiful place with people who live here being proud to call it home
canada,not_removed,been down there worked down there more whites than in the burbs
canada,not_removed,telling us facts while refusing to provide sources under the guise of your readers not being interested in facts classic here are some facts for you the median age of newcomers in was years the median age is the point where exactly one half of the population is older and the other half is younger in comparison the median age for the total immigrant population was and for the canadianborn population source
canada,not_removed,the median age of newcomers in was years the median age is the point where exactly one half of the population is older and the other half is younger in comparison the median age for the total immigrant population was and for the canadianborn population source tell us more about how its all true
canada,not_removed,do you not realize that our entire system of law is predicated on the common law system that is based on precedence otherwise known as historical fact it is you who is willing to abandon years of economic framework due to your inability to find a job and need to blame someone else for your inadequacies
canada,not_removed,so you only talk to white people
canada,not_removed,theyre not left behind theyre here with access to social services and support until they find new jobs and we can add jobs to our economy while that happens its not a simple one or the other we can do both and help bring jobs in from the business building side as well the economy is not a zero sum game we can all make gains without anyone losing if we plan well but since canadas economy is completely limited by people not adding those people is just shooting ourselves in the foot
canada,not_removed,no but there have been plenty on httprationalwikiorgwikiusefulidiot
canada,not_removed,you mean like that tiny minority that voted for brexit and is about to put trump in the white house
canada,not_removed,this mustve been about years ago am i right edmonton now he would have his pick up workers alberta is a boombust economy due to the oilgas industry you wont fix that with immigration they will all move to bc during the bust
canada,not_removed,yep full intergrated just look at this map
canada,not_removed,lived there worked there downtown toronto is cosmopolitan and fully integrated
canada,not_removed,thanks for digging that up for me you can see that im right and you are wrong from that one single paragraph
canada,not_removed,in comparison the median age for the total immigrant population was and for the canadianborn population do you not understand what that means it means if we took all the immigrants out of our country we would be a younger country they are a decade older than us what is so hard to understand about that sentence immigrants have made our retirement crisis worse not better how is that not true
canada,not_removed,of course theyre going to need this lucrative revenue stream to pay off all of the debt they are racking up
canada,not_removed,why not per tonne right now i can just add the cost to my personal annual deficit indefinitely
canada,not_removed,to put this in perspective the alberta ndp instituted a per tonne carbon tax which represented an average tax of per person for a year this would mean theyre planning to lay a tax on the general public in years time
canada,not_removed,this carbon tax crap is being taken to far most canadians cant reduce their personal emissions in a meaningful way but reducing the number of canadians actually would to bad they keep adding in more people to compound this supposed problem that only our small country can solve
canada,not_removed,how do u want ur economy fam
canada,not_removed,its cheaper for the taxpayer if we just get rid of of humans
canada,not_removed,canadians are retarded more news at this must be why theyre all leaving lol a carbon tax seriously youre literally getting charged for a breathing tax keep voting in those liberals guys enjoy your breathing tax enjoy it
canada,not_removed,i hope they go higher faster the increase in my taxes will be pennies compared to the increase of big companies theyll have the capital and incentive to streamline consider the average canadian uses tones of carbon per year so thats tax a year which you can cut by being responsible i love it they should bump it higher faster
canada,not_removed,i thought it would be fun to do the math each person exhales pounds of carbon dioxide a day pounds a year so at albertas current carbon price the government would make half a billion a year on just us breathing at the price it would be billion
canada,not_removed,ikr fucking harper and his debt he put on us
canada,not_removed,well not really because the average person will have much lower emissions by then thats the point of the carbon tax after all
canada,not_removed,does it hurt being this stupid
canada,not_removed,about each a year just for breathing
canada,not_removed,there is no plan in this to reduce individual emissions given that most of it is collected from energy which we have no control over
canada,not_removed,but if countries all around the world agreed to cooperate on greenhouse gas emissions then we might have a chance of getting somewhere oh wait that agreement already exists and thats why we have these climate targets in the first place
canada,not_removed,china and india are leading the world in renewable energy bud i can link ya a dozen articles if you want
canada,not_removed,i mean china is doing more to combat climate change then we are we have an energy crisis in ontario and there are no plans to build infrastructure to fix it
canada,not_removed,you said virtue signalling drink send to olearys campaign
canada,not_removed,hahahaha enjoy having of your hard earned dollars confiscated for a fucking carbon tax you guys are so stupid
canada,not_removed,buy the one without the hemi next time
canada,not_removed,ctraltprojection
canada,not_removed,reading this comment chain and then this seems out of context need clarification what numbers are you referencing about
canada,not_removed,lol
canada,not_removed,fuck off denier you are blocked you are a goddamn cretin good call had some experience in a different thread today and uctraltdeceit is definitely just a lame troll account
canada,not_removed,im not mad im fine with the carbon tax and look forward to you having to pay it like it or not
canada,not_removed,what was the purpose of the hack who hacked it and when did it happen
canada,not_removed,looool
canada,not_removed,wow that escalated quickly
canada,not_removed,get your wallet ready like it or not youre going to have to start paying closer to the full price for the carbon you use
canada,not_removed,not today dude not today
canada,not_removed,stop spinning the quebec incident for less gun control
canada,not_removed,exactly as i said you people are scum
canada,not_removed,nobodys even saying that if the response to this is the same as the la loche shooting that wont even enter the equation after that there was no real effort federally or provincially to restrict guns or ammo
canada,not_removed,fuck you buddy
canada,not_removed,it does works south of the border
canada,not_removed,is already calling for stricter gun control not even hours after the shooting theres scum on both sides of this fence
canada,not_removed,you have to think about the differences between both shootings la loche was a native shooting other natives with a shotgun that nobody could really attempt to say wasnt a hunting shotgun this was a white radical shooting a visible minority with a semiautomatic firearm that of course has already been called militarystyle by the media in an attempt to deligitimize its civilian ownership the situation around this shooting is not unlike the one at ecole polytechnique and that shooting was the one that led to the creation of our current gun laws the shooting at la loche really had no political steam behind it because of the gun used and the relationship of the perpetrator to the victims with this shooting there is much more political potential for people who want to spin it because of the gun used and the relationship of the perpetrator to the victims
canada,not_removed,everyone can be duped because theres almost nothing to distinguish real news from satire a lot of the time real news is just as outlandish as the jokes that parody it
canada,not_removed,itd be really cool if this was satire
canada,not_removed,nonnative businesses lease from the band a very common business practice fn or not
canada,not_removed,this is the most canadian question ive ever seen
canada,not_removed,if you think a chinese cook is cooking your chinese food youre probably mistaken
canada,not_removed,sunrise cafe ksan golden pam massett search a village name and look for chinese restaurant
canada,not_removed,lac la ronge has a gas station with a restaurant attached thats a chinese food place its horrible compared to vancouver style bt if youve never had it i guess it could be good
canada,not_removed,quickly googling near here i found httpwwwerlindsrestaurantca so yes they do have chinese restaurants as for your other questions i have no idea
canada,not_removed,samson chinese food
canada,not_removed,if they do then its probably being cooked by first nations i am not sure if its different in other places but i heard from the bands on the reserves just north of my hometown that nonfirst nations arent allowed to work on the reserve that could just be this one reserve though so dont quote me on it i could also have been misinformed
canada,not_removed,samson ab has a place called samson chinese food no idea if its owned by a member of the band or is rented to a nonband member no idea who runs it or who its cooks are
canada,not_removed,worth pointing out that all land on reserve is either leased from the band or assigned to members by the band nobody owns private land on reserves even the band cannot sell it
canada,not_removed,depends where you live and where you go i mean in markham almost all the restaurants chinese or otherwise are run by chinese people
canada,not_removed,who is cooking my chinese food i only know the staff of one chinese restaurant and they certainly claim to be chinese
canada,not_removed,yeah heres its a thai couple at one place some japanese chefs at the next and i think the last place is owned by a family from hong kong
canada,not_removed,i dont know most of the places i have seen in sk alberta and bc had asian cooks
canada,not_removed,mmmmm moosen chow mein
canada,not_removed,the band cannot sell land because they dont own it it is owned by the crown
canada,not_removed,there are also subleases and buckshee leases so in some cases it could be an actual band member with a lease or cp certificate of possession that is initiating the lease the reason land instruments on reserve are a mess is because all reserve land is technically crown land held by her majesty and the instructions for the administration of the land the indian act is years old edit wrote out cp
canada,not_removed,the largest reserve in manitoba has people most have under how many towns of that size do you know with a chinese restaurant
canada,not_removed,well there are many reserves in manitoba that are fairly isolated and can only be accessed via winter road or plane so those are generally out of the question for business opportunities then three southern reserves i can think of off the top of my head relatively close by me are long plain dakota tipi and sandy bay and its not a surprise there are no outside businesses on the reserves when they have hard times keeping diverse band businesses operating at times just due to the nature of their locations i believe long plain has the potential due to their location but sandy bay is well its sandy bay unfortunately between location and reputation i rather doubt people would be willing to take the risk now dakota tipi is simply too close to portage la prairie to make it enticing to really draw outside business
canada,not_removed,maskwacis ab ah yes hobbema go for the chinese food stay for the gang violence
canada,not_removed,it is not owned by the crown its held in aboriginal title which is a distinct qualification of land in canada that cant be sold
canada,not_removed,all reserve land is technically crown land held by her majesty this is technically true but in application no longer matters because of section of the constitution
canada,not_removed,and it cannot be financed by any traditional means which means it cannot be developed in most cases there is nothing distinctive in canadian law in this sense you cannot sell and you cannot attach liens or instruments to anything you dont own and most first nations do not own the property which means they do not truly control the places they live many fns hate this situation many others do not
canada,not_removed,section only really guarantees the need for consultation and accommodation though what that actually means is really up in the air ultimately the title of all reserve land still holds with the queen as its defined in the indian act good point to consider though and im very interested how this meaningful consultation and accommodation process is implemented we can already see a part of the line being drawn with the recent northern gateway court decision itll be interesting to see where that ends up also just to point out that section is not limited to just reserve land but lands with associated rights as in the gateway challenge
canada,not_removed,it matters a great deal it is hard for fns to mortgage or finance deals on reserves using land as collateral because the first nations does not own it
canada,not_removed,ya section is really paternalistic and makes it really tough for bands to finance infrastructure projects especially had for bands that want to develop resource extraction project and will be a huge business problem if the ring of fire moves forward but also a detriment even to small community projects building a new school community centre and such there are some interesting new models a few banks are trying out notably rbc involving placing collateral in an offreserve trust but nobody has really figured out a comprehensive solution yet
canada,not_removed,no the scc said that should be read such that no existing aboriginal rights can be extinguished see r v sparrow scr
canada,not_removed,this isnt the case postsparrow the scc said in sparrow that no aboriginal title that exists in can be extinguished by the crown
canada,not_removed,on the other hand there is another faction of first nations groups that do not want the ability to be able to sell their land or use it as collateral to risk losing it it is not an unreasonable fear since it is a prime and irreplaceable asset like nonindigenous people they dont trust their own leadership i can see both sides
canada,not_removed,heads up you posted this times
canada,not_removed,do you mean the tsilhqotin first nation that has more to do with land title than sparrow sparrow had more to do with indigenous rights in his case fishing and the interpretation that they always existed and recognizes and affirms that thats the whole duty the government has for consultation and accommodation the line for that is still vague to me though and i would like it more clearly drawn by the scc certainly the last govt really tried to push that line and was recently struck down thankfully the tsilhqotin first nation decision about title is the one with serious implications to what we were talking about not just about rights around the land but title i havent caught up on it yet though and havent worked in lands issues in some time so my knowledge would be pretty scarce given the movement of the issues recently i think it would be less applicable in ontario and the prairies since there are treaties for that land in quebec and bc treaties dont really exist either way i think we both agree about the issues of indigenous rights and the need to recognize and affirm themsec interesting talk
canada,not_removed,there is as specific reason that chinese restaurants exist all over western canada in some very small towns that you would not expect to have anywhere to eat they often have a unique financing arrangement i love the ubiquitous signs chinese and western cuisine in eastern alberta they almost always serve that chinese staple perogies
canada,not_removed,eek im on my phone and something wonky is happening maybe a mod can delete the duplicates
canada,not_removed,theres a line in obiter of sparrow on thison my phone but ill take a look later
canada,not_removed,could someone help explain to me in laymans terms why trans mountain ✅ northern gateway ❎ whats the political environmental difference between the two projects edit thanks you guys these comments provided a lot of colour
canada,not_removed,bcer here good pragmatic decision by trudeau however lets not be naive living in vancouver i know what the environmentalists are like here its going to be very very ugly i hope it gets built but youre going to have a very tumultuous political situation happening in bc over this
canada,not_removed,these kinds of decisions are something i really struggle with i am a staunch environmentalist the damage that has been done and will be done to our environment is catastrophic biodiversity suffers species that have been evolving for hundreds of millions of years have already been wiped off the face of the earth human health suffers we die from pollution related illnesses from diseases like malaria which bloom in these conditions what is perhaps most immediately concerning is the threat of long term economic damage that climate change presents which could be truly disastrous which brings me to why this is so difficult for me it is possible to visualize a future in which renewables and nuclear maybe even fusion provide of our energy needs where a fleet of self driving electric cars the size of the present number of vehicles on the road service the bulk of our transportation needs where the full force of our economy is put behind reforestation and reclaiming polluted land where our infrastructure is built sustainably and no longer carves swaths across once contiguous ecosystems whats hard is visualizing a path from where we are today to that brighter future our entire economy is built on the presupposition of growth without growth the entire thing collapses under its own weight we are already in a relatively early stage of this dilemma as the wealth to income ratio reaches heights not seen since the early century so follows economic inequality and anemic growth all this to say we are facing two concurrent slow moving high momentum existential threat right now and they are inextricably intertwined until we have silver bullet solutions that are both economically and environmentally superior i think a balance must be struck we only have so much economic wiggle room so much capital to spend so to speak if every environmental victory costs us a tenth of a percent gdp growth thats people struggling to pay their bills thats longterm damage to job growth its also less future capital to spend on the kinds of projects that will pull us out of this tail spin if we add up too many of those tenths of a percent now we have a real economic calamity on our hands for these reasons im inclined to cut trudeau some slack a leader has so many conflicting needs to consider you cant save the environment if you destroy the economy in the process thats how trumps get elected and reverse all your work you cant build a strong economy if you allow climate change to bring it to its knees the path forward is obfuscated by a cloud of rhetoric greed and single mindedness im studying to be an engineer so i like to believe that investing strongly in finding these silver bullet solutions that reinforce both the economy and the environment simultaneously are the solution but i cant pretend to have a comprehensive plan for getting us from a to b i just hope that we can start crossing the floor to begin building that sort of comprehensive and cogent plan to realistically get us from a to b
canada,not_removed,heh incoming vancouver area protests but honestly these are all nobrainer calls
canada,not_removed,dont see why the northern gateway would have been approved since the liberals banned oil tankers off the coast of bc shortly after elected that pipeline would have been the proverbial pipeline to nowhere
canada,not_removed,really pleased with the decisions today like it or not alberta needs some major projects to stimulate its economy hopefully these announcements will help get some people back to work in the resource industry the northern gateway was just too environmentally unsound though the freshwater reserves and fragile northern bc coast have too much environmental value to risk and permanently alter with a new pipeline the ban on tanker traffic off the northern bc coast was another welcome and unexpected bit of news to come out today
canada,not_removed,cant help but recall the scathing vitriol on this sub when it was the pipelines being discussed by harper now all of a sudden its a no brainer just interesting thats all
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,well since everyone is upset its probably a good decision
canada,not_removed,awesome good news not only the approvals but im happy with northern gateway going away didnt like that plan from the start glad that the good plans are getting approved and the bad ones arent
canada,not_removed,i wasnt expecting him to ever reject all three but out of all them im glad northern gateway is going away
canada,not_removed,liberals just got more done on pipelines in one year than the conservatives got done in nine
canada,not_removed,well this should make alberta happy i just hope that this buys the feds enough political capital to do something really bigcool green tech wise
canada,not_removed,does anyone have a map of where these pipelines actually are planned to go
canada,not_removed,i approve and agree with his rationale for it
canada,not_removed,i dont see how a reasonable person could find a problem with this
canada,not_removed,disappointing considering the environmental ramifications of this i understand this is really beneficial for the albertan economy but i think weve sacrificing too much longterm for shortterm here edit sorry for being concerned about the longterm use of oil in this country i guess
canada,not_removed,i dont care if its built or not but i believe no clean up costs should land on bc taxpayers oil spill costs should be billed directly to the alberta government or the corporation in charge on the pipeline
canada,not_removed,trudeau approves two pipelines one year in with a realistic probability of construction beginning during his first term harper in ten years accomplishes nothing because he put all his eggs in the keystone basket discuss
canada,not_removed,anyone complaining about pipelines should go outside their house and shut off the gas sell their car dispose of all of their clothes and eat only what they can grow in their yard cultivated by hand
canada,not_removed,not a liberal by any stretch but its a good decision too bad they couldnt come to an agreement on northern gateway but imho building without the full consent of first nations is a nonstarter
canada,not_removed,while the governments decision may increase canadas share of greenhouse gas emissions it will not have a significant impact on overall global emissions global warming is caused by the demand consumption for fossil fuels and supply seeks to reach equilibrium with that demand in other words if you constrain supply in one country another country will step up its production to meet global demand the inverse is also true the key is to curb demand through conservation and the adoption alternative energy sources one less barrel of oil burned represents one more barrel that stays in the ground tar sands oil is certainly dirtier carbonwise than other sources however it only represents a small percentage of the global supply of around million bpd it also faces competition from newer cheaper supplies provided by fracking and as the global demand for fossil fuels lessens unconventional sources will be the first to become uneconomic this decision allows for the twinning of the existing kinder morgan pipeline and replaces the old line with a new pipeline along the same route
canada,not_removed,essentially canada cant fulfill its commitments in the paris accords with these pipelines kinder morgan is even bigger than keystone which trump will approve
canada,not_removed,not what i was expecting but outta is great
canada,not_removed,its a great decision if you dont think global warming is a problem
canada,not_removed,its above normal in the arctic with the ice receding when it should be growing weve got coral forests and biodiversity dying around the globe biblical flooding in some areas and parching droughts in others theres methane bubbling to the surface in the north and large parts of the ocean are gong acidic it has been the hottest year on record with all that as a context these fuckers sell us out and approve this shit its funny how people think theres an economic argument here during the lifetime of these projects were going to see an increase in extreme weather events the cost to clean up these events and the damage done to economy are going to make whatever fucking table scrap revenue these pipelines generate obsolete way to go pipefitters and truck drivers whatever little bump in income you make is going to get swallowed by incomecarbon tax and insurance increases to help pay for climate damage its called a negative externality but hey the chinese and a bunch of bay street fucks made a bunch of money
canada,not_removed,northern gateway always was a terrible and idiotic idea as a resident of northwest bc it pains me seeing comments from clueless people who do not live here the people of kitimat have rejected it first nations along the coast have rejected it great on the government for doing the same the douglas channel is of islands and narrow waterways until the open ocean and can be trecherous in the winter the tankers would have to pass through and risk harming httpsenmwikipediaorgwikigreatbearrainforest one of the last pristine areas of our planet left is that worth destroying forever for some short term gain today just one oil spill off the northern bc coast would kill the lively hood of everyone in northern bc and alaskan panhandle first nations or not lastly look at how terrible the cleanup has gone in bella bella due to weather and ocean conditions for just a downed tug boat imagine a tanker filled with bitumen
canada,not_removed,the international monetary fund estimates that oil and gas subsidies in canada are billion each year in direct support to producers and uncollected tax on externalized costs nbsp how much benefits do we actually get from these companies in the end
canada,not_removed,a centrist move that gets shit done whole pissing off both the far left and right sides pm zoolanders stock just rose a little in my book it now stands one notch above muppet
canada,not_removed,colbert seems to think highly of trudeau kidding
canada,not_removed,sorry no refunds
canada,not_removed,trudeau is an expert at laying pipe 🙋
canada,not_removed,i just think its hypocritical to campaign as some environment friendly pm and then approve these pipelines i think hes trying to have his cake and eat it too its like douchy celebrities that campaign for the environment and reducing ghg then are seen the next week on some mega yacht
canada,not_removed,how does canada give oil companies subsidies it is from a combination of tax breaks if im not mistaken how do these tax breaks compare to other industries sure you can say they have to the industry but how much did the industry spendmake wouldnt percentages be more accurate
canada,not_removed,this is surely going to make canada not meet the paris climate change agreement
canada,not_removed,but the revenue from taxes they get from these developments including business tax taxes from employees and taxes of selling the product just as examples these bring in more income then those tax breaks are worth i guess its a way of more money going to the corporation instead of bringing in even more tax revue do other companies that bring in that much income from tax revenue receive these breaks as well
canada,not_removed,i thought it was likely wishful thinking to believe that trudeau truly understands the urgency of climate change right now i am super saddened by this news the oil needs to stay in the ground we are fucking the earth and therefor our children and our childrens children over
canada,not_removed,trudeau can tackle climate change or expand tarsands but he cant do both glad it is finally clear where this government stands this government just proved that they will not bother living up to all their big talk on the global stage what an international embarrassment our grandchildren will never forgive us
canada,not_removed,not much to complain about with this that wont stop people though
canada,not_removed,please nobody talk about how many jobs this will create after construction pipelines are pretty much automated so that argument doesnt fly it will make a few corporations rich though
canada,not_removed,another massive blow brought to the paris agreement less than a year after raising expectations towards us even harper wouldnt have been as effective in undermining the efforts of the international community in such a short time so world pariah status on climate issues reconfirmed for canada and paper bag of shame back on the head
canada,not_removed,why dont we move away from fossil fuels instead of putting more pipelines in
canada,not_removed,im just going to leave this here for everyone in this thread claiming that theres anything pragmatic and wise about building more oil infrastructure dont worry im probably just one of those crazy vancouver environmentalists who doesnt get the real world
canada,not_removed,stephen harper
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,hard to miss a leak when the pipeline is running through your background good on trudy for understanding this
canada,not_removed,excellent hopefully this will mean something nice for alberta
canada,not_removed,this is the right decision imo yes greenhouse emissions increase but on a global scale its minor in this situation the economic benefits are more important and we should invest some of the revenue into clean energy rd so that we can make a global impact canada today lives and dies by oil tripling capacity without create new pipelines is a winwin
canada,not_removed,this is the first day i actually find the pm palatable this is something that is going to anger some of his base yet he is doing what is right and its a reasonable compromise i know the militant left like may are going to chain themselves naked to the surrounding trees with the local natives or whatever but thats just collateral damage because they choose not to join in compromise as is usual
canada,not_removed,i for one welcome our new conservative or ndp overlords in
canada,not_removed,justin you douchebag fuck all your pipelines
canada,not_removed,this is a bad day for british columbians
canada,not_removed,especially in light of this decision why the hell are we wasting money on mitigating climate change we might as well junk cap and trade and carbon pricing and raise taxes to adapt to climate change exclusively lets start retrofitting and building our communities for degrees change degrees be damned
canada,not_removed,trudeau trumped us all
canada,not_removed,federal approval and it getting built are two separate things if history has taught us anythingpretty sure the decision gets taken to court
canada,not_removed,i hope all my trudeau voters feel satisfied with themselves this man ran as an environmentalist but i think its pretty clear thats hes nothing but a corporate puppet and a fraud hell get along just fine with president climate denier trump
canada,not_removed,trudeau is so screwed its actually a comedy damed if ya do damed if ya dont fuckin rights bud have at er
canada,not_removed,a tweet as the submission serious it would be good to have a full article posted so we can all discuss it with the all the facts there was a ton of info released with the decision there were full articles which came out less than minutes after the tweet cbc ntl post ctv global globe but they get removed from rcanada without a full article posting nobody else is allowed to post one because its considered duplicate and removed
canada,not_removed,he really looks like castro
canada,not_removed,no pipelines tar sand oil production needs to gear down not up canada should not contribute more to the climate change problem
canada,not_removed,wow so people are totally just getting dumber by the second
canada,not_removed,there are a ton of issues and the submissions for each project are hundreds of pages long but basically i think it boils down to the fact that northern gateway is all new kinder morgan is essentially just twinning an existing pipeline the route is there already km also terminates in vancouver which could handle a spill better than kitimat could
canada,not_removed,the terrain on the northern bc coast is really treacherous it would be hard to navigate under good conditions on top of that the weather up there is extreme in the winter there was a tug boat sinking up there a few weeks ago and they are having a hell of a time cleaning that up because its been too windy then its a pristine environment which i personally put more value on than a built up city i also think having a bigger population around a pipeline is a good thing because there are more eyes to report when something goes wrong more people in the area to clean up any spills
canada,not_removed,kinder morgan in burnaby is a straight shot down juan de fuca strait through the short constricted waterway past the gulf islands to to the less restricted waters of georgia straight northern gateway to kitimat is a bad idea the entire route to douglas channel is fraught with small islandsconstricted waterways it would have made more sense for ng to terminate in prince rupert
canada,not_removed,the trans mountain already exists but the pipeline is being twinned doubling capacity within the same alignment
canada,not_removed,northern gateway runs through a protected rainforest enbridge has a shady reputation too
canada,not_removed,good question one of these is a pipeline expansion the other is a new pipeline the expansion will twin the pipeline to double up on oil there will also be a smaller pipeline added in that will be transferring dilutent back to the upgrader in edmonton the northern gateway would have gone over new territory in which about indian bands filed a grievance against in the eyes of the northern gateway protesters neither of these is good in the eyes of the pro pipeline people this is a bandaid
canada,not_removed,transmountain for the most part is twinning an existing pipeline on an existing rightofway northern gateway would have been from scratch the biggest difference to me is the north coast would have been more risky for shipping and more remote for spill response transmountain goes through the lower mainland so a lot more nimby people will be upset than in northern bc but many of those people would oppose any pipeline anywhere
canada,not_removed,the companies behind them and the areas they run to transmountain has a great track record embridge not so much one leads to an environmentally sensitive area the other leads to an existing tanker port
canada,not_removed,northern gateway ❎ httpsenwikipediaorgwikihecatestrait the marine environment at the surface can be equally brutal some tankers would traverse hecate strait which environment canada ranks as the fourth most dangerous body of water in the world waves in south hecate strait have reached metres – the height of a sevenstorey building all i know is from the presumably detailed explination elizabeth may roasts northern gateway approval published on jun on june green party of canada leader elizabeth may gives a strong and entertaining response to the government of canadas approval of the enbridge northern gateway pipeline project and info kitimat
canada,not_removed,yeah im on vancouver island so much opposition here but there isnt a single non ndpgreen mp here
canada,not_removed,the trending story section on my fb page is filled with people outraged over this decision and how they will stop and nothing to stall this
canada,not_removed,well said its the best decision overall it will however further the diatribe of antitrudeau in western canada
canada,not_removed,it would be a good idea to really expand the coast guard presence in this area that way protesters in boats can be quickly arrested if they try to disrupt tanker traffic
canada,not_removed,living in vancouver i know what the environmentalists are like here its going to be very very ugly good let them bring their war
canada,not_removed,god dammit of course christy clark is gonna highjack this for the election as if she actually gives a shit about the environment maybe fund the provincial ministries of the environment and mines so they can do their jobs if you actually care about bcs environment from bcs auditor general we found almost every one of our expectations for a robust compliance and enforcement program within the mem and the moe were not met source
canada,not_removed,the problem as i see it is that every piece of fossil fuel infrastructure we build makes it harder to switch to more sustainable energy sources building a pipeline is dedicating societal resources to subsidize the future consumption of fossil fuels how can this be part of a plan to switch away from polluting energy generation when what we have done is created another piece of infrastructure that advantages fossil fuels
canada,not_removed,vancouver and greater vancouver will vote left regardless
canada,not_removed,im from vancouver and i support this decision
canada,not_removed,ive hardly met anyone in vancouver that supported northern gateway why would this cause protests there edit didnt see that the kinder morgan twinning was approved whoops
canada,not_removed,but pipelines are better for the environment than trains rejecting northern gateway makes no sense
canada,not_removed,i dont know how trudeau can campaign on native reconciliation and environmentalism and then go and do this
canada,not_removed,they are not more important than the rest of canada
canada,not_removed,its gonna be like the all over again
canada,not_removed,they are only nobrainer calls because of the amount of resources that have already been invested in the tar sands and the fossil fuel economy each step appears logical nobrainer even because of all of the previous steps that have been completed but each of these logical steps is towards the cliff of catastrophic climate change at some point were going to actually engage our brains and stop taking the nobrainer approach
canada,not_removed,same city that destroyed the down town because they lost a hockey game
canada,not_removed,simple just pipe it directly into the ocean send a boat to clean it up sell and repeat
canada,not_removed,they didnt ban tankers off the coast of bc they only just announced that they will introduce legislation in spring to ban them from the north coast of bc theres been a voluntary exclusion zone since
canada,not_removed,a good compromise in my eyes the north remains tanker free and the economy gets a boost win win for most people
canada,not_removed,and therefore the world
canada,not_removed,at least this way if something fucks up it will be right in our back yard and hard to hide northern gateway would have been out of sight out of mind if something went wrong
canada,not_removed,at the same time i hope alberta takes the opportunity to diversify away from oil
canada,not_removed,like it or not alberta needs some major projects to stimulate its economy should probably get going on that international oil price we can control that right oh we cant probably makes sense to diversify away from oil then rather than putting even more eggs in one basket
canada,not_removed,i would say having a pipeline run right through vancouver and have tankers in the vancouver victoria seattle trifecta area spill would be an environmental nightmare
canada,not_removed,but why are we supporting this type of economic activity when it takes us in the opposite direction of renewables and decreasing fossil fuel consumption this doesnt make us climate leaders this doesnt help us meet our paris agreement targets its not forward thinking its a shame
canada,not_removed,totally agree politically and economically this had to be done the pipeline system now is at capacity oil by rail is a horrible stop gap to solve the capacity issue and for the whole west east relationship thing i think it was important that ottawa did something that provides a benefit there environmentally too this might be a plus approving the pipeline gives trudeau some political capital he can spend on a cap and trade system and other environmental progressive projects economically though the northern gateway wade sense because of the potential to stick a refinery up kitimat granted environmentally it did not make sense
canada,not_removed,what do we do when regular crude is still at and nobody want to buy the tar shit that cost to get out of the ground
canada,not_removed,northern gateway was always the biggest point of contention by far not only because it is a new pipeline in a dangerous area but also because harper was trying to force it though even with huge backlash from most indigenous groups affected by the decision the reason why there is less protest with this decision is because no new pipelines are being built only expanded and no new waterways are being compromised that being said i would expect to continue to see a lot of protest and opposition toward kinder morgan its just not as cutanddry as northern gateway
canada,not_removed,this sub has become substantially more potent for conservatives in the last few months
canada,not_removed,we may be hearing from albertans
canada,not_removed,til kent hehr or at least someone in his staf is a redditor
canada,not_removed,well done kent as one of your constituents who cast a vote for you i am pleased that your government made a pragmatic decision that balanced our need to export a product the world demands why albertans get all the crap for supplying a product that the world demands is another issue while protecting the environment in the long term i hope your government more actively makes the case for how this wealth benefits all canadians and our transition to a lower carbon economy
canada,not_removed,hi kent thanks for your support of this its hugely important for alberta
canada,not_removed,hi mr hehr as an albertan i have nothing more to say than congratulate you and your colleagues on the decision on the pipelines today this is the best that can be done for now hopefully alberta diversifies its economy and i trust you and your colleagues on working with alberta on that front
canada,not_removed,the ban is specific to oil tankers i believe so the lng is safe not that it makes sense either as there is a glut on the market and the timelines to completion dont make sense economically
canada,not_removed,knowing people in the regulatory side of things these pipelines were in the works for at least years lots of negotiating and er assessments its not like the government can just handwave in a pipeline
canada,not_removed,not really the conservatives did all the leg work the liberals just did a last due diligence and signed on the dotted line
canada,not_removed,i guess thats what happens when you pretend to care about the natives
canada,not_removed,it takes money to make money
canada,not_removed,i hope they do something big green tech wise in alberta it takes something big to catch on i heard something about plans for a solar farm
canada,not_removed,i assume that jts team sees that capital already spent on getting the carbon tax out there now when criticized about the carbon tax theyll be able to point to the pipelines to deflect and vice versa
canada,not_removed,theyve been making tons of green tech announcements leading up to this tons of money going to the environment already
canada,not_removed,the bc government says they have conditions which must be met in order for them to support a new crude oil pipeline successful completion of the environmental review process worldleading marine oil spill response prevention and recovery systems for bcs coastline and ocean to manage and mitigate the risks and costs of heavyoil pipelines and shipments worldleading practices for land oil spill prevention response and recovery systems to manage and mitigate the risks and costs of heavyoil pipelines legal requirements regarding aboriginal and treaty rights are addressed and first nations are provided with the opportunities information and resources necessary to participate in and benefit from a heavyoil project british columbia receives a fair share of the fiscal and economic benefits of a proposed heavyoil project that reflect the level degree and nature of the risk borne by the province the environment and taxpayers im not entirely sure what their options would be if the conditions are not met but i suspect that the federal government would want to get them onside because it would look bad if it was built with the bc government fully opposed to them
canada,not_removed,no interprovincial pipelines are in the jurisdiction of the federal government
canada,not_removed,i dont think they get much say in this
canada,not_removed,well this was all a massive compromise albertaright gets a few pipelines bcleft gets a universal carbon tax and the most dangerous and shady of the pipelines is scrapped also being able to export resources to both china and the usa lets us dictate the prices instead of letting trump bully us because we can only sell to the usa and not anyone else and sacrificing the long term for the short term is what humans do best are you surprised
canada,not_removed,but what if it leads to less use of coal in china isnt that an improved environmental outcome
canada,not_removed,what in your mind is representative of shortlongterm how many years do you believe that these pipelines wont provide any economic benefit for the longterm at all what should we be doing instead of this that will provide a much needed boost to the economy
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,if you exempt the revenues these projects generate from federal taxes and send all the provincial taxes they generate to alberta sure
canada,not_removed,because bc wont see any benefits of the pipeline right s
canada,not_removed,when has an oil spill cost been billed to taxpayers you could argue sometimes oil companies dont pay enough had a discussion about whether bp paying billion dollars for the deepwater horizon was enough but they absolutely pay im actually curious where this idea that taxpayers pay for the clean up costs comes from
canada,not_removed,corporation yes
canada,not_removed,that wouldnt be an unfair compromise hell make the pipeline owner to pay
canada,not_removed,pipeline companies pay for of their spills
canada,not_removed,no royalties either
canada,not_removed,pipeline companies are on the hook for spills in aberta and have been forever if thats not the case in bc talk to your mla
canada,not_removed,if clean up costs fall upon us then i expect the government to pay me insurence
canada,not_removed,i never thought keystone was a great idea why pump profits out of canada when we should refine it ourselves and then ship it out never made sense to me
canada,not_removed,kinder morgan and line neb process started during the harper years trudeau just hammed it up like some fucking drama teacher and made it look like he did the work
canada,not_removed,wrong under harper major pipelines to the us were constructed and operational the keystone pipeline not keystone xl the alberta clipper pipeline ill give trudeau the credit once the tmx is operational line replacement was a no brainer
canada,not_removed,or work to change the society we live in by building the infrastructure so that it is powered by renewable sources none of us chose the infrastructure we inherited we can choose the infrastructure we create
canada,not_removed,anyone complaining about pipelines should go outside their house and shut off the gas sell their car dispose of all of their clothes and eat only what they can grow in their yard cultivated by hand can we phase that in until
canada,not_removed,stop smoking lead it makes you stupid
canada,not_removed,northern gateway was always a terrible and idiotic idea the douglas channel is trecherous in the winter the tankers would pass through the httpsenmwikipediaorgwikigreatbearrainforest and they are already having problems cleaning up a small tug spill near bella bella due to weather imagine an oil tanker
canada,not_removed,which trump will approve eh even if he does it will come at a greater cost to us he will charge us up the yingyang for it because murica
canada,not_removed,whats your source for that pbo report seems to think that putting an appropriate price on carbon emissions will be the key to meeting the emissions target no reason you cant tax carbon and build a pipeline
canada,not_removed,soooare you for or against
canada,not_removed,do you want to know why some people dont believe in climate change its because of people like you and your radical nonsensical climate alarmism bullshit
canada,not_removed,the wealthy and powerful have truly done a tremendous job at convincing the masses that their shortterm financial interests are the interests of society at large and as you can see with buddy the troll below we really are in the posttruth era where no amount of facts and figures makes a damn bit of difference
canada,not_removed,it pains me seeing comments from clueless people imagine a tanker filled with bitumen its funny that you dont even know what is going through the pipes in your own town
canada,not_removed,just one oil spill off the northern bc coast would kill the lively hood of everyone in northern bc and alaskan panhandle first nations or not do you remember or are familiar with with exxon valdez did that spill kill all lively hood of everyone in northern bc and alaskan panhandle first nations not even close melodramatic sensationalization is not helpful
canada,not_removed,the imf subsidy figures are hilariously bad including things like traffic congestion because without oil and gas most people wouldnt be alive so there wouldnt be congestion and few remaining peasants would be lucky to have a horse but even if it was that high the benefits of oil and gas are in the hundreds of billions of dollars albertas economy is nearly the same size of quebec with half the population and when its growing provides the federal govt billion in excess tax revenues to spend in the rest of canada
canada,not_removed,after everything we come out ahead billion
canada,not_removed,look at the irving lng port in saintjohn newbrunswick the property tax subsidy they get on that site alone should give you an idea of how big this problem is
canada,not_removed,you do realize the approvals are for existing pipelines also one of the tasks is to upgrade one of the pipelines that was laid in the early for your last part if energy east goes ahead then at least we will be less dependent on saudi oil
canada,not_removed,i love all of the sudden tears from enlightened liberals about our children this and onoz the environment that you know whats fucking over your children and grandchildren massive deficits and a crippling debt you know whats fucking over your children and grandchildren rampant unchecked layers of bureaucracy being enforced by hundreds of thousands of nameless faceless paper pushers you know whats fucking over your children and grandchildren a school system thats more interested in teaching kids how to fist and throwing transgender fashion shows than it is in teaching math and english you people dont care about the children you never have its a total ruse that nobody buys anymore everyone knows that youre lying
canada,not_removed,ndp in alberta put a cap on total emissions allowed from oil sands and are bringing in a carbon tax its not a zero sum game we just cant shutdown the oil sands and oil by rail is less safe and more carbon intensive
canada,not_removed,jobs will be created not in the operation of the pipeline but in the industries producing the product that goes through it by getting alberta oil to world markets we can get the world price for it meaning that oil companies will be able to pursue projects that might not have been viable before hopefully the price of oil will have recovered some by the time construction is complete and then its jobs jobs jobs and not just in ab
canada,not_removed,better than nothing corporations do pay some taxes which benefits us all and they employ people and theyll be spending some of the money they make with the extra oil sales
canada,not_removed,we can talk about the income more exports will bring to our economy
canada,not_removed,its not an all or nothing game
canada,not_removed,there is no choice trump has made it clear that hes going to put his own country first unless were willing to do the same at least sometimes they will outcompete us in every industry and well be reduced to waiting in breadlines although im sure castro jr would love that he knows that it would lead to him getting destroyed by populists at the polls in so he had to throw us an economic bone
canada,not_removed,you do realize that canada is a net negative emitter of carbon in the world our trees capture more carbon than what canadians emit on a yearly basis
canada,not_removed,because cars
canada,not_removed,fossil fuels provide about of the total energy used by humanity its so large and energy is so vital to human civilization that you cant simply move away from easily or quickly because theres nothing to replace that much energy
canada,not_removed,for some reason people that suggest this can never tell me how their oilless construction equipment transport trucks and airplanes work
canada,not_removed,why not do both
canada,not_removed,because people like to pay us money for our fossil fuels
canada,not_removed,and in that years human population has grown by about billion food production has massively increased average human living standards and life expectancy has greatly increased and where modern countries can easily handle disasters that would have crippled great empires in the past a major reason for that is the incredible amount of cheap reliable energy provided by fossil fuels
canada,not_removed,nice hair though
canada,not_removed,hard to miss a leak when the pipeline is running through your background is it with the kalamazoo oil spill for example enbridge waited hours after the alarm had sounded to act
canada,not_removed,hard to miss a leak when the pipeline is running through your background except for the trucks and trains and ships that will transport the oil once it reaches the other end of the pipeline
canada,not_removed,soooo by train to my knowledge pipelines are the safest and most economical means of transport am i incorrect
canada,not_removed,and therefore the world
canada,not_removed,the oil is moving one way or another through pipelines or rail doesnt mean we cant also take steps to limit carbon emissionsbut regardless of what steps we take theres still going to be a demand for oil
canada,not_removed,because oil production and oil consumption are not the same thing
canada,not_removed,probably because a significant portion of the canadian economy relies on og exports oh and the reality that market demand drives oil production not your feefees if you want to reduce carbon emissions attack the demand rather than the supply
canada,not_removed,why and by who its the federal government decision not natives hippies or gregor robertson
canada,not_removed,is there something wrong with that its confirmed information and most certainly the first news of it
canada,not_removed,miss out on some karma
canada,not_removed,when this was posted i still hadnt seen any news articles before that the only updates i had were from an earlier reddit discussion from someone watching live if the content is accurate tweets are a legitimate source of news i appreciate op posting this as soon as something was available
canada,not_removed,it just happened the only article available pretty much said the same thing
canada,not_removed,there is a live broadcast on cbc of trudeau speaking his staff are the ones tweeting
canada,not_removed,op saw something he though interesting and posted it get off his dick
canada,not_removed,ohhh is that his new edgy creative nickname
canada,not_removed,what do you mean
canada,not_removed,ive always objected to kms language on this project though twinning implies another one exactly the same the proposed expansion would roughly triple the throughput of the pipeline system with regards to vancouvers cleanup capacity though its less true than you may think see article here i recognize its from six months ago but not much has changed the last federal government dismantled any cleanup response capacity including closing the coast guard base its been reopened but the repercussions are still felt see article and one and even httpvancouversuncomopinioncolumnistsstephenhumesmalloilspillnearbellabellahighlightsresponsedeficiencies one from the sun which is typically fairly conservative and propipeline
canada,not_removed,as well as the instability that is donald trump and his categorical rejection of even the existence of climate change let alone the need to engage in green initiatives the northern gateway is too much of a risk with him in charge in the us
canada,not_removed,thats accurate theres also the fact that northern gateway would have been cutting a new path through rainforests of northern bc and crossing through many disputed lands that are claimed by first nations on the other hand kinder morgan is mostly following an existing pipeline route
canada,not_removed,what i was going to write transport has banned tankers in northern bc coast near kitimat where the oil product goes offshore approving the pipeline and banning tankers to get them is contradictory
canada,not_removed,the coast around kitimat is a highrisk area for tankers to navigate a fact that enbridge has
canada,not_removed,i also think having a bigger population around a pipeline is a good thing because there are more eyes to report when something goes wrong more people in the area to clean up any spills this is the big one for me if we have to have a pipeline i want it somewhere people care about protecting when things go wrong having a population centre at risk puts pressure on km to prevent spills and provide adequate clean up the same political pressure would not be possible with northern gateway so far out of site sight edit accidentally a word
canada,not_removed,actually tripling capacity
canada,not_removed,actually it would be tripling capacity to
canada,not_removed,kinder morgan doesnt have the best reputation either in terms of spill response but yeah the fact that northern gateway would run through a protected rainforest and that it would greatly increase tanker traffic on the northwest coast were both huge issues given the previous statements made by trudeau re tanker traffic in that area
canada,not_removed,yah they spout off all the time what a wonderful safety record transmountain has kinder morgan tries to ride this reputation because theirs is so shitty
canada,not_removed,do they do you have any further information on that
canada,not_removed,its going to get ugly there too people forget those tankers have to go right by victoria to get out to the pacific
canada,not_removed,safe to assume its just nimby ive been there more than once i see cars and houses and the likethey need oil toojust from somewhere else
canada,not_removed,r a w s e w a g e vancouver island is very environmentally friendly sure we dump our raw sewage into the ocean and need a load of fuel and oil to ferry every single thing across but yeah were green well green in spirit at least
canada,not_removed,why do hippies oppose any sort of economic development is it because they are mostly either very poor or pretty well off and so dont care about economic development
canada,not_removed,harper failed to demonstrate he necessary commitment to environmental action to provide the social license to get a pipeline approved i always thought it would ironically take centreleft politicians to actually get these pipelines done tories are too easy of a target for the environmentalists to attack as oil tyrants but having notley and trudeau champion this pipeline that tells your average voter that it seems like a pragmatic approach
canada,not_removed,as an albertan out of work they can protest all they want im qualified to do some of the jobs involved in pipeline construction and not even mcdonalds will hire me years of actual cookingrestaurant experience before i moved out here and started making good money they probably think ill jump ship first chance i get so if these people dont want a pipeline that badly they can keep paying my ei ive got years of video games to catch up on
canada,not_removed,eating less meat driving less buying less things will do more good for the environment than protesting
canada,not_removed,not in the way you might think i think if they get shovels in the ground before the next election on km trudeau could stand to make gains in calgary and edmonton increasingly becoming more progressive in their politics bc will actually become antitrudeau while i think the rest of the west that is resource driven and pragmatic on the topic of pipelines is happy with this decision also bc isnt monolithic the opposition to pipelines is in metrovan van island and the centralnorth coast the interior cariboo country pg and northeast is pragmatic and would be mostly propipeline any antitrudeau sentiment is going to be centralized in bcs south coast
canada,not_removed,do people really try to disrupt tanker traffic seems like it would be about as effective as trying to disrupt a skyscraper with a sock full of rocks it would be a really good idea to expand coast guard presence because theyre responsible for responding to and ensuring cleanup of oil spills
canada,not_removed,theres more than one party on the left side of the spectrum though the liberals only won seats in bc in but in they won seats here out of in total edit and to clarify im not saying theyll lose most of those seats in bc next time just saying they have lots at stake
canada,not_removed,how are the liberals in the left their economic policy has been staunchly centrist
canada,not_removed,liberals arent left wing lol
canada,not_removed,other way around the fact that a pipeline has been approved is what will cause the protests
canada,not_removed,northern gateway was a nonstarter bc environmentalists need to treat that being shut down as a win for sure
canada,not_removed,northern gateway was an increase of risk for the environment due to the new shipping lane it would create however the twinning of km really doesnt seem all that bad in my opinion as a treehugging bc kid
canada,not_removed,did you miss the part of his campaign when he said he was in favor of some pipelines
canada,not_removed,people protesting doesnt mean that they think they are more important than other people
canada,not_removed,oh well be working on climate change too its funny really a lot of the money made and spent on oil will be going to fighting the effects of burning it meanwhile theres the carbon tax and the coal phaseout so its not like nothings being done on this front
canada,not_removed,same city that operates our largest port and the largest port in north america their concerns are valid
canada,not_removed,right the whole city of vancouver was involved forget the fact that only were charged a large portion of whom werent from vancouver also ignore that people showed up the next day to clean up the mess such a shite city filled with shite people
canada,not_removed,because people most of which werent even from vancouver is an entire city not to mention how thousands of people including myself and im sure many others in here went and tried to clean the city the day after
canada,not_removed,north remains tanker free for now i say this because the northwest passage will be utilized for this eventually
canada,not_removed,ultimately the pm will run afoul regardless of what he does the ngw pipeline was about as rigorously evaluated as km but hed be gambling a lot of his support in bc alternatively if he cancelled both he can pretty much kiss all of alberta goodbye in and it would kick ab more while theyre down imo more of a making the best of a bad situation either way for the government
canada,not_removed,and we are what reddit fails to realize it wasnt as easy to diversify when an can leave high school and work in og starting in the midhigh range sorta hard to attract people to alt sectors when there is bigger money around the corner
canada,not_removed,agreed this will take time though and alberta has a very large labour force trained in a resource extraction industry that is currently not providing enough jobs
canada,not_removed,if the federal government will allow us too we tried to get into manufacturing long ago and that was snuffed out
canada,not_removed,as long as the ndp is in i think they will
canada,not_removed,in theory our provincial carbon tax is going to be shot back into the economy to do just that
canada,not_removed,i wish the same thing how does a province even diversify when most of your industry is so deeply oil related or cows and agriculture honest question though you need something special to attract business to come here and unfortunately our environment isnt as nice as bc weather wise and leisure wise and our infrastructure isnt anywhere close to what ontario has or size of market
canada,not_removed,im sure this time it will be different
canada,not_removed,our current government is creating an environment that is unappealing for companies to consider move here people say well with all that vacant office space just get silicon valley to come setup a bunch of offices there when taxes and wages are being simultaneously hiked at an accelerated pace nobody is going to see any value in moving sask will draw interest over ab all day theres no incentive plus our industry ag is feeling the pressure of the new government one of the biggest feedlots in ab just httpcalgaryheraldcombusinesslocalbusinesswesternfeedlotsshuttingdowncanadasbiggestfeederblamesheadwindsincattleindustry
canada,not_removed,thats impossible they would have to magically discover some other thing that can be exported with similar value
canada,not_removed,alberta definitely needs to diversify and the ndp government has expressed great interest in doing just that however you cant diversify such a concentrated economy overnight and there are currently thousands of skilled oil and gas workers without jobs these people are angry and many would like to see a trumpstyle takeover of alberta and canada hopefully big projects such as the ones approved today can help put people back to work and quell extremist sentiment while the governments of alberta and canada work to diversify the economy
canada,not_removed,probably makes sense to diversify away from oil then rather than putting even more eggs in one basket if its so easy where should alberta diversify agriculture maybe agriculture is getting hammered right now between global markets and government policy its suffering can the province just create a whole new tech sector that might be a challenge given that a cold climate and a high tax regime arent exactly the greatest incentive for entrepreneurs and that every city is attempting to do this what about manufacturing well that could be a challenge given that alberta has the highest labour costs in the country and is geographically located far away from any major population bases diversification is such a buzz word right now but if it was so easy other cities and provinces wouldve been doing it for a long time
canada,not_removed,nothing compared to a tanker on the rocks in douglas channel
canada,not_removed,thereve been tankers there for decades with narry a spill people act like these things are bouncing off islands like italian cruise ships there are hundreds of the things going in and out every year and the last time a tanker ran aground in bc was years ago and there was no lasting damage
canada,not_removed,i think the thousands of train cars full of crude oil rolling through small towns pristine waterways and national parks every single day and through downtown vancouver is even more dangerous oil is already going to vancouver but on dangerous leakprone occasionally townexploding trains
canada,not_removed,nothing compare to an oil train explosion in lacmegantic oil isnt gonna stay in ground because pipeline isnt being built it will just find other ways to get to the coast i do think trans mountain can be improved from the current route
canada,not_removed,actually it would likely be the very best place to have an oil spill httpnewsnationalpostcomfullcommenttristinhopperthebestplacetohaveanoilspill
canada,not_removed,nowhere near as bad as it would be on the north coast
canada,not_removed,they are expanding the capacity of a pipeline thats been pumping oil to bc since
canada,not_removed,were not going to get anywhere on climate change without alberta on board under the ndp government alberta has brought in stringent climate change policy a broadbased carbon tax phasing out coalfired power capping emissions from the oil sands but notleys been crystalclear in exchange alberta wants new pipeline capacity to me this is the reason for approving the kinder morgan expansion as part of a bargain with alberta to bring in stringent climate change policy
canada,not_removed,oil isnt magically disappearing anytime soon we need to invest in renewable infrastructure too but to do that we need money which comes from exporting oil via these pipelines oil production will naturally lower when our demand lowers but not before that we need to either lower our energy demand or make other power sources more reliable consistent and affordable before oil begins to decline at which point we can stop building new pipelines pipelines are the safest way to transport oil and alberta has far more stringent environmental regulations than most other oil producers id rather canadian oil be used than saudi oil for example because it supports a far better country and that oil is gonna be consumed either way
canada,not_removed,meh
canada,not_removed,the feeling that subs are swinging right may well be caused by brigading there was a call for brigading in rthedonald targeting rcanada recently
canada,not_removed,its kent himself as far as i know
canada,not_removed,i love how a federal minister from alberta comments and you are the only one who picked up on it
canada,not_removed,i am going to call bullshit on that one the due diligence was the legwork in this situation the government should not be involved doing the proposals they came from private companies any legwork on the part of the conservatives was unnecessary the only legwork the conservatives did was with regards to foreign relations and that only applies to keystone and has nothing to do with interior pipelines they also had no consensus from the bc and mb governments hence why they were pushing so hard for keystone which went straight from ab into a bunch of red states nope the conservatives did very little of the work on these two its the two that were rejected that they worked to get built they were far too focused on pipe dreams
canada,not_removed,the aboriginal nations in these areas will benefit from the pipeline expansions
canada,not_removed,they just protest till they get their extortion money same way its always worked
canada,not_removed,lol tough we had the money issues on lock with all the taxes though i guess the pipeline will also pay those taxes
canada,not_removed,western economic diversification is pushing hard for cleantech funding right now if alberta companies want to see a dime of it they will start looking into that kind of stuff
canada,not_removed,in areas that never had a carbon tax sure but bc already have a carbon tax still needs to be higher but and from a climate change perspective this pipeline is a huge negative and thus very expensive as far as political capital goes so the carbon tax is not really enough capital to buy this pipeline in bc
canada,not_removed,well those were needed to offset current out put i feel like they need to dodescribeplan one more big thing to offset the damage of this pipeline to make it worth it for bcenvironmentalists the pipeline seems like a gift to alberta for their hard work towards reducing their now they just need something that would make it some what worth it for bcenvironmentalists i know lots of people like to say that having this pipeline will help fund theshift to green tech and that the shit is impossible with out it to any one eco minded this sounds like bs so if they could detail a plan of exactly how this pipeline will help or a plan on how they will eventually reduce the oil sands production then it might help this stuff go through
canada,not_removed,why are people protesting so much it looks like its just doubling the line we already have
canada,not_removed,edmontonburnaby
canada,not_removed,im pretty sure those were specific to northern gateway
canada,not_removed,bc can stifle by not allowing certain permits required to build the pipeline
canada,not_removed,while thats technically correct the best kind its not wholly correct in the case of northern gateway the bc government could hold it up by not granting all the licences needed for construction that are under provincial jurisdiction for trans mountain i dont think they can do anything though as its already an existing pipeline but not sure
canada,not_removed,the bc eao environmental assessment office has stated that it will seek to either approve or reject the trans mountain pipeline kinder morgan could feasibly test the bc eaos jurisdiction in court but it would probably be easier and less politically contentious to just go through with the process
canada,not_removed,yeah i understand trudeau has got a lot to balance between and i dont think hes done too badly of a job here im not surprised no but i am disappointed were going to need to start actually caring about our environment at some point
canada,not_removed,im no expert but i dont think so no not really id like to think there are better ways for china to get oil — like from the middle east — and we have to protect what we have in our country first before we help a country that already has more than enough capability for green infrastructure
canada,not_removed,im sure there are proper terms and units for things like that but in my head long term is anywhere from years from now the problem is in my opinion were picking between economy and environment thats not a sustainable way of thinking because it sets it up as a zerosum game we need to develop an economy that utilizes and protects our environment we can have a great economy for the next years but its not going to mean shit if it means our kids are wearing gas masks outside for the next or so
canada,not_removed,not relative to the risk they are taking on no
canada,not_removed,other than initial construction jobs no
canada,not_removed,bc will see next to no economic benefit from this pipeline particularly in light of the amount of risk that it is taking on kinder morgan itself estimates that the pipeline will create person years ie equivalent of one year of fulltime employment and that a spill could cost up to independent studies have asserted that realistically this is more like person years and in cleanup costs not to mention that kinder morgan has a less than stellar safety record the companys minor spill in burnaby several years ago is estimated to have cost to clean up imagine that on even a slightly larger scale or occurring on water instead of on land
canada,not_removed,our economy here kinda relies on our enviornment
canada,not_removed,ask ecuadors outstanding from chevronask govt of alberta and other provinces with orphaned wells
canada,not_removed,bp was fined billion for negligence it was also given a billion tax deduction taxpayers definitely contribute to picking up the cleanup bill
canada,not_removed,the government struck a billion settlement with bp which is a big number yet bp should be able to deduct the vast majority a whopping billion on its us tax return that means american taxpayers are contributing quite a lot to this settlement whether they know it or not
canada,not_removed,bankrupt sorry shrug
canada,not_removed,we have different definitions of if oil companies collect annual tax subsidies that surpass the cost of a spill are they really paying for them do oil companies pay out lost profits for the fishing and tourism sectors damaged by spills what about the medical bills of the coastal communities affected
canada,not_removed,why would a company pay to have refineries built in canada when they already have refineries in the united states what incentives does canada give that would make such a huge project feasible for any company
canada,not_removed,refineries are expensive a lot of those profits would have to go towards building and maintaining one building a new one for a product that we expect to decrease over the decades wasnt seen to be a profitable idea
canada,not_removed,shits happening right now you dumb fuck httpwwwmacleanscanewsarctictippingpoints httpvancouversuncomnewslocalnewswarmwetnovemberbreakingbcrecordsdisruptingwildlifebehaviour
canada,not_removed,ahh there is no bitumen going thru the pipes in my town so not sure what u are getting at
canada,not_removed,httpwwwevostcstateakusindexcfmfastatusherring httpwwwevostcstateakusindexcfmfafactsecon only when we run out of clean water to live and fresh food we as a species may realize we cannot eat money its quite sad we have instilled an unsustainable economic model which requires unlimited growth consumption and spending on a world of finite resources
canada,not_removed,from what i can find the industry that develops oil and gas resources in this country pays on average a year in taxes and royalties to different governments across canada nbsp but your basically claiming that any problems the oil industry might cause to health and environment and that the taxpayers pick up the bill for shouldnt be counted as a subsidy and that of course the imf are just making things up
canada,not_removed,first of all i dont identify as a liberal i agree with you that all of those things are fucking over our children as well i believe in science all of those things that you listed are realities but they are political constructs hypothetically if the economy was to go to complete and utter shit we as human beings and society in general have the ability to create a new economy or to save the one that has crashed obviously the economy is extremely important but we are living in a very critical period of time where it is imperative that we act immediately to try and slow down climate change there is an overwhelming consensus in the scientific community that urgent action is desperately needed to save our fucking planet
canada,not_removed,texasnorth plz go
canada,not_removed,you have very odd priorities
canada,not_removed,seriously love youre posts spot on
canada,not_removed,its not a zero sum game we just cant shutdown the oil sands unfortunately you cant meet climate targets without a thats simply how our temperature targets and reserve volumes add up it is a zero sum game the world can only emit within a carbon budget to be perfectly clear extracting from existing wells without any expansion already would take us over the targets so to be frank unless were planning to buy carbon credits to offset the oilsands production max is correct you cant do both also noteworthy is and oil by rail is less safe and more carbon intensive the carbon intensive part youre correct the safe part well thats a pretty statement
canada,not_removed,the world will stop using oil when theres no oil left you may as well accept that because its never going to change
canada,not_removed,i heard overheard one of those new mcdonalds automated cashiers talking about quitting and moving out west
canada,not_removed,actually when you examine the climate science and our reliance on fossil fuels it very much is just look at all the propipeline people in this thread who have no idea whats really happening in the world we can either protect the planet for our kids or we can have short term oil profits and campaign slogans we cant have both
canada,not_removed,because tupperwear yoga mats trips to south east asia and drugs thats why
canada,not_removed,fossil fuels are one of the leading causes of global warming and we are fine with pumping more out of the ground and effectively fucking over future generations instead of focusing so much on fossil fuels we should focus on alternative energy sources like solar or nuclear energy trudeau talks about how much of an environmentalist he is but he is just a lying sack of shit he doesnt give a shit about the environment all he cares about is money
canada,not_removed,well they recently developped viable aviation engines that are electric transport trucks can be electric and most construction equipment has been electric for quite some time now so what the f are you talking about
canada,not_removed,because if we create pipelines we are going to have to pump oil through them for a long time oil that is destroying our earth and warming our climate at a rapid rate
canada,not_removed,whats the point of money if our earth is destroyed
canada,not_removed,whats your point global warming doesnt exist
canada,not_removed,per km pipelines are the safest mode of transportation i understand halting some pipelines but we still use oil all of the time
canada,not_removed,you got a source for that i was under the impression pipelines increase oil production not change it from rail to pipeline in fact wouldnt a new pipeline increase rail and ship transport as well since surely all that oil is not just going to stay at the other end of the pipeline and go nowhere
canada,not_removed,why produce what wont be consumed
canada,not_removed,pourquoi pas les deux
canada,not_removed,this is what happened last time when harper approved it the tide foundation and their cohorts are pretty good at this kind of stuff though i do share your sentiments
canada,not_removed,rule low content lots of info out there on what constitutes low content especially for news so major that the entire country has been waiting years to learn
canada,not_removed,oh i decided not to sit on it the instant op started sporking everywhere from all the karma being sucked in
canada,not_removed,man whoever came up with this is hilarious at least on the same level as rob schneider
canada,not_removed,first they were calling him justine then it was turdeau then it was the dolphin a corruption of the dauphin then it was shiny pony then it was selfie boy castreau actually made me laugh a little
canada,not_removed,what was it
canada,not_removed,with regards to vancouvers cleanup capacity though its less true than you may think its possible that in spite of the shortcomings you outline vancouver is still probably vastly better prepared for such an incident than kitimat
canada,not_removed,my point with the cleanup stuff is that itd be easier to build and maintain that type of facility in vancouver as it already has a lot of tanker traffic
canada,not_removed,twinning implies another one exactly the same it doesnt really i mean i can see how you would parse it that way but thats not what theyre actually saying it just means that rather than replacing the current pipeline theyre building a second one right beside it
canada,not_removed,exactly right there are some very effective cleanup plans that have been offered to the gov and rejected
canada,not_removed,twinning implies another one its a term popular in alberta highway from grasslands to fort mac was twinned so they built a new road next to the existing one its the same for a pipeline there will be the new line and at the same time they will make necessary repairs to the old one
canada,not_removed,just like the of tankers that currently have run that route for decades edit hey i have an idea guys lets stop exporting across oceans canadas economy will be we can all trade hemp baskets and pottery amongst ourselves
canada,not_removed,yeahhaving to steam through juan de fuca strait aka victorias cess pool
canada,not_removed,like theyre not already heading for cherry pt and anacortes en masse
canada,not_removed,thats true but i think during construction will be the worst i can imagine crowds of protesters at construction sites especially in the lower mainland
canada,not_removed,km pipeline isnt for domestic use its for export attacking protestors for using oil is a logical fallacy httpsyourlogicalfallacyiscomtuquoquead hominem as you fail to address their argument lincoln lived in a system that benefitted from slavery was he a hypocrite for ending it
canada,not_removed,its already all a shipping route for oil yeah they just want less not more its mostly nimby but also some unreasonable expectations of stopping all oil production the island has some of canadas most extreme environmentalists you cant just grind the entire global system to a halt honestly i am partial to norways strategy of becoming green by using the profits of oil revenues they are actually closer than anyone else in doing this
canada,not_removed,there is more to it than mere nimby there is a large component of wishful thinking and ideology as well and its the latter that is going to be the problem in the end those whose lives beat to the drum of the notion that these pipelines will literally be murdering millions and bringing in the four horsemen of the apocalypse they live in their own echo chamber no matter how misinformed and lacking perspective and that notion is one hell of a motivator there will be drama
canada,not_removed,only nixon could go to china type of thing
canada,not_removed,trudeau hasnt demonstrated necessary commitment to environmental action either after harper scrapped the canadian environmental plan trudeau commissioned a new one but its still just proposed regulations many people that i know and work with have been involved with assessments and recommendations and these recommendations are being largely ignored the standing sentiment of the government and projects is that oil and gas are temporary activities that can be re mediated after this simply isnt true or possible from an ecological perspective there are other alternative energy sources that would be far and away more efficient
canada,not_removed,so many good games i have in my backlog
canada,not_removed,people do try and disrupt tankers by going out in small boats and canoes and basically blocking the tanker with their bodies obviously this just makes docking more dangerous
canada,not_removed,its entirely possible this will have an impact on the next federal election its also possible that everybody will have forgotten by then and the liberals will be reelected in those seats
canada,not_removed,a part of the reason they won so many votes in was also strategic voting to get harper out i voted liberal specifically for that reason and i know many young votersstudents did as well by the time the next election rolls around there wont be that need and everyone is just going to vote however they please if the ndp can pull it together i suspect theyll pull a sharp lead
canada,not_removed,then who is on the left the liberals have run large deficits to reinvest and expand direct individual transfers and program spending they raised taxes on the top they established the tax refundable and tax free ccb which essentially basic income nit for kids they are massively expanding arts funding setting a hard price on carbon theyre very much making good on their promises and running the most progressive government weve seen in canada in at least years the ndp promised a balanced budget which would mean austerity in comparison
canada,not_removed,because the economic and social spectrums are two different things
canada,not_removed,i mean come on look at their policies theyre at least centerleft
canada,not_removed,yea my bad i glossed over the trans mountain twinning because i saw northern gateway
canada,not_removed,whether by us or others cough america cough
canada,not_removed,as has been said the best compromise is the one that leaves both parties unhappy
canada,not_removed,i have a strange doubt he is going to pick up many seats in alberta regardless of his actions however at least it shows he is a pragmatic on the subject in other possible swing ridings
canada,not_removed,this is analagous to the argument in favour of pricing carbon eg carbon tax people as a whole only move away from old habits or the easy route if it hits them in the pocket book its more than just alberta lots of maritimers out there
canada,not_removed,they say this every time it fails i remember the if the boom ever comes back bumper stickers in the then they vote in right wingers who blow it all on tax cuts for the oil sector
canada,not_removed,maybe they should upgrade their skills training and move to where the jobs are you know like years ago when harper told everyone in the maritimes to move to alberta if they wanted jobs here all the tech companies are hiring very good pay and benefits
canada,not_removed,yeah but its not a big pivot to other big industrial which includes stuff like solar and wind see httpwwwironandearthorg plan
canada,not_removed,pressure from ontario
canada,not_removed,but you cant replace an export product with one that depends on your own population the demand isnt there to support alternatives
canada,not_removed,so we work on it we have yyc and yeg two world class cities
canada,not_removed,i work in the ag industry and its hurting from grain to livestock with oversupply and poor quality issues abundant many farmers and thus grain companies are looking at a very tough year ahead
canada,not_removed,the corporate tax hike i think were still among the lowest in the country arent we plus i believe we have some programs like the sred tax credit that helps those kinds of companies out
canada,not_removed,others dont do it because its hard af energy sectors usually push wages well beyond normal productivity levels and governments and the public that elect them typically do not like to plan for the future an example would be our research and development canada as a whole has a pitiful rd sector with one of the lowest of gdp as rd expenditure levels in the oecd this is also true of norway which has a lot more resources than us to invest
canada,not_removed,renewable energy alberta is big flat httpswwwcurrentresultscomweathercanadacitieswindannualaveragephp httpswwwcurrentresultscomweathercanadacitiessunshineannualaveragephp sell it all to bc washington state oregon alaska
canada,not_removed,if its so easy where should alberta diversify this is a nonsequitur a straw man even i said nothing of easy i said investing more into an economy that failed due to factors out of its own control is a bad idea
canada,not_removed,the burnaby fire department has actually released numerous statements against the twinning because it will also double the size of the tank farm in the city we also had a significant oil spill here when a kinder morgan pipe broke in a residential neighbourhood there are very very significant fire and explosion hazards involved putting aside tanker spills entirely
canada,not_removed,source
canada,not_removed,trudeau pretty much said that to alberta literally cannot afford to be environmentally friendly right now so the trade off was morea few pipelines to spark the alberta economy so the carbon taxes and the other initiatives dont put albertans under the poverty line
canada,not_removed,i wouldnt say the online conservative community was small but it was certainly divided and disorganized at most you would just read the comments on news articles to find these people
canada,not_removed,he comments in rcalgary quite a bit and he earned my vote there ive had a few productive exchanges with him and its nice to see an mp embrace this medium versus twitter as it allows for a more extensive back and forth more mps should have the courage to come on reddit kents staff advised him against it as it is high risk low reward but he does it anyway no staffer wants to see their mp get ramparted but having actual discussions on issues is a part of democracy thats suffered recently and i am happy he is willing to communicate in a more open space with room for big arguments and downvotes
canada,not_removed,they were far too focused on pipe dreams ☜ﾟヮﾟ☜
canada,not_removed,detailed nuanced answer less upvotes than a retarded circlejerk answer with the logic of a child welcome to rcanada
canada,not_removed,yes assuring canadian first nations that we know whats best for them cause thats gone over great in the past
canada,not_removed,not an expert on this but if a carbon tax cant reduce ghg emissions then its not aggressive enough all of this hand wringing over whether or not to build pipelinesjust price carbon and let people decide whether its worth it or not to buy carbon emitting goods
canada,not_removed,it might have to do with all the greenhouse gasses that are going to be released into the atmosphere as a result of this people worried about the future of planet and whatnot
canada,not_removed,tripling one line but yes its only expanding on existing pipelines
canada,not_removed,im not well versed in my pipelines kinder morgan is the one planned to go though burnaby mountain
canada,not_removed,that might be what they initially said but since then they announced that the conditions apply to any new crude oil pipeline through bc that said im sure theyll be looking to make a deal and get their conditions met by proving that they squeezed out some benefits for bc possibly by selling electricity from site c to alberta
canada,not_removed,and corporations sue the government and win
canada,not_removed,they can prevent things like additional power hookups building permits for infrastructure like pumping stations could get delayed there are a lot of levels of bureaucracy that could either outright prevent or drastically slow down the process stuff like that really isnt deemed worth doing if you have a government or municipal governments for some permitting who are going to delay andor block
canada,not_removed,bc doesnt want to go toe to toe with federal gov and guaranteed they wont no province but quebec would because they have enough special rights to do so and not be drastically harmed
canada,not_removed,i would certainly agree that we need to work towards balancing the two the problem with this is the politics lack of investment into things that can hopefully make the economic outlook be more positive in the short term years is going to do more for trudeau and the lpc if they had gone ahead and not approved any of the pipelines then there would be different economic growth they would have instead been exploring and pursuing alternative avenues of growth and investment instead we can only hope and assume that they compared the approval of the pipelines and their economic benefits against that of alternatives that would have come about had they not inaction and not approving the pipelines would have looked poorly on them politically as generally speaking voters typically prefer the benefits of a better performing economy than one that could potentially be performing at a suboptimal level but instead values the protection of the environment more the point we need to consider is whether investments like this should be made into an industry with a finite cap on it where we know generally how long it can be sustained for alternative avenues of energy production certainly should be explored and invested in however the shortrun economic benefits that people so desperately need most likely arent going to come about people would be forced to bite their tongues and wait with the hopes that their children and future generations will be in a stronger economic climate than themselves however thats a mighty fine gamble to take considering governments change world events happen etc we can only hope that this was one of the better moves both economically as well as environmentally in the long run since its what were pursuing
canada,not_removed,i guess we can send albertans into bc to buildmaintain the pipes then and send albertans to work at the output sites bc doesnt need those lucrative jobs right
canada,not_removed,you clearly have no clue as to the wealth created for canada versus the risk of a spill
canada,not_removed,in whose evaluation
canada,not_removed,how did you calculate the risk vs benefits out of curiosity
canada,not_removed,not property tax pump station jobs tugboat jobs port jobs increase to canadas gdp larger corporate taxes none of those things will benefit bc educate yourself
canada,not_removed,so shipping and pipeline maintenance dont count nor the increase in canadian economic activity or corporate taxes or income taxes
canada,not_removed,so you started with that a spill could cost up to independent studies have asserted that realistically this is more like person years and in cleanup costs thats cost inflation of over and then the companys minor spill in burnaby several years ago is estimated to have cost to clean up wait so were now escalating a million spill up to billion so over more thats a little more than a slightly larger scale not to mention the fact that person years of employment at an average income of would equate to billion in direct employment income which excludes indirect economic contributions to the people of bc and canada
canada,not_removed,no jobs no tax gains nothing
canada,not_removed,a tax deduction usually reduces the profit before paying taxes that means that bp would save x us corporate tax rate in taxes it doesnt save the whole it still pays out in total to the us government
canada,not_removed,do you believe that taxpayers subsidize every single company on this planet for example i can write off the cost of repairing a rental house as a business expense are taxpayers subsidizing me i think its a reasonable discussion to have but it is irrelevant to whether an oil company pays for an oil spill
canada,not_removed,do you understand what that means and how tax writeoffs work its okay if you dont i can explain it to you if you do why should a company not be able to deduct their expenses from their tax return do you believe that taxpayers are paying subsidies to every single company that has existed i think this could be a fair argument but it would be a different topic than taxpayers paying the costs of a clean up heres my source for my numbers
canada,not_removed,thats not taxpayers paying for it with the cost of the settlement bp makes a smaller profit and naturally pays less taxes its also likely the settlement was grossed up to account for the deducted taxes anyways
canada,not_removed,i mean id hope that canadas largest company by enterprise value doesnt go bankrupt to avoid paying for the cleanup of a spill
canada,not_removed,insurance bro
canada,not_removed,well they should stop drinking sea water
canada,not_removed,no incentive at all higher corporate taxes higher environmental standards and way smaller market to sell refined products too
canada,not_removed,i agree alberta is building a big one right now but we could use more it makes no sense to ship out a raw product and then buy back a finished product
canada,not_removed,dont drink seawater dentists agree
canada,not_removed,apologies i missed the part where it killed the lively hood of everyone in northern bc and alaskan panhandle first nations like you claim a spill would do i travel up the coast and alaska frequently seen lots of native people fishing i am not even in favour of northern gateway pipeline but spreading this kind of nonsense drama is what takes away credibility from environmental opposition with valid founded concerns to development projects
canada,not_removed,so you will be the first one to hand in your car keys right to save the planet you will quit driving also no more man made fibers so youll have to get rid of most of your clothing and no more canned goods i could go on and on but hopefully you get my point
canada,not_removed,thanks bud
canada,not_removed,this is precisely why carbon pricing is so important it gives individuals a direct financial incentive to reduce their emissions what we need is a rising carbon price were not going to get anywhere on this without alberta on board hence todays announcement notleys brought in a broadbased carbon tax but shes also made it totally clear that in exchange alberta needs new pipeline capacity
canada,not_removed,i agree that it is an all or nothing game in this case we need to categorically stop any expansion upon fossil fuel extractionuse and work on fading it out as quickly as possible canada should wind down extraction and strain the market out of supply as much as possible to raise the cost whatever difference we can make is a positive we hardly have a monopoly but we should take anything we should get this would make renewable sources a relatively better option if oil is expensive enough countries will be forced to be green since they clearly wont do it out of concern for the future
canada,not_removed,you cant protect the planet when you have no money renewable energy isnt free
canada,not_removed,we had a director from the pembina institue speak at my company recently and i asked what his opinions on the various pipelines being proposed was and he said we should build kinder morgan and cancel the others im inclined to trust his opinion because you know research and stuff
canada,not_removed,fossil fuels are one of the leading causes of global warming and we are fine with pumping more out of the ground and effectively fucking over future generations yes capitalism and markets have deemed it necessary never swim upstream of a raging river it cant be done without severe consequences let the markets do their thing you have no idea how fast the cost of solar technology is coming down every day innovation in this space will eventually take us to a better place government sucks at this stuff the un and global governments have gotten absolutely nowhere in trying to reduce carbon emissions for the past years despite all the bs agreements like paris et al look at tesla motors they are driving change in the private sector by innovating better battery tech that is what we need capitalism got us into this mess and itll be the only thing that will get us out of it when heating your home or running your business with solar will be cheaper than gas or oil then the global emissions of carbon will be reduced very fast that future is closer around the corner than most people think let capitalism work
canada,not_removed,most construction equipment has been electric for quite some time now what are you talking about drills and saws and shit im talking the big stuff that sucks much more energy like bulldozers excavators dump trucks if those electric planes and transport trucks were so viable wed be using them
canada,not_removed,because there is demand for oil people like to drive fly have food delivered to grocery stores build and heat big homes thats why we need oilgas
canada,not_removed,oil that is destroying our earth and warming our climate at a rapid rate environmental extremist i hope you turn off your computer never ride a bus make coffee or read a fucking book under light that doesnt come from the sun ever again
canada,not_removed,does every hardcore environmentalist only think in doomsday scenarios
canada,not_removed,im pointing out what having oil infrastructure helps provide
canada,not_removed,so instead of solving that problem were going to build more pipelines i hope you have property in the cape breton highlands
canada,not_removed,you are
canada,not_removed,youre right that would be stupid good thing oil is going to be consumed in an immeasurably massive quantity worldwide for decades at least
canada,not_removed,it is going to international markets where it will be consumed
canada,not_removed,while i appreciate your stance it isnt very realistic unfortunately
canada,not_removed,because attacking the supply side is pointless supply is demand driven when theres demand for something the supply will always be provided regardless of any laws or other barriers i should hardly have to enumerate examples of this remove the demand for oil and the supply will go with it
canada,not_removed,especially for news so major that the entire country has been waiting years to learn it was just announced i wouldnt expect nor would i expect the moderators to expect for there to be a breakdown of the implications of the accepting or rejection of individual pipelines
canada,not_removed,justin castreau
canada,not_removed,keep our oceans free from spills sell that oil over the internet
canada,not_removed,so what youre saying is my hemp and moulding clay business will be a success
canada,not_removed,we have everything we need fresh water lumber grain oil we can be completely self sustaining who needs those other countries lets go back to living off the land like our ancestors it would be so progressive of us were so progressive that we go backwards
canada,not_removed,but whos going to supply the unicorn farts for heat and the welfare for their weed
canada,not_removed,i can make hemp baskets looks like everythings coming up
canada,not_removed,yah its going to make for some incredibly dramatic television scenes on the news
canada,not_removed,as a born in vancouverite this is pretty much how i feel as well
canada,not_removed,that lincolnslavery argument isnt the same though lincoln didnt own slaves when he was in office these protestors use oil and gas every day if they lived self sufficiently in the forest with a wood stove then sure but they drive cars like everyone else and live in houses that need to be heated the export argument makes sense though
canada,not_removed,lincoln didnt own slaves
canada,not_removed,i meant they seem to be ok with the import of oilgas for use but not ok with it sailing by for export no comment to that
canada,not_removed,norway has more hydropower than they need thats not the case here in canada if alberta could dam the great divide for energy security it would have already done so
canada,not_removed,the wishy washy approach gets enough political capital in line to actually get it done
canada,not_removed,the difference is that with trudeau and notley theres an expectation and reality of an actual environmental study and more important a price on carbon thats what helps thesocial licence
canada,not_removed,harper didnt understand the concept of compromise on this issue trudeau recognized that by doing things that are environmentally beneficial carbon tax coalpower phaseout rejecting northern gateway pipeline people will be more willing to accept something that is environmentally negative kinder morgan pipeline
canada,not_removed,yup you dont want to be honest with the electorate during the election campaign you say whatever it is people want to hear for example you say no to pipelines and the deficit will be capped at at billion per year and the tax decrease will be offset by the tax increase for high earners then you get elected and all that is thrown out the window fool me once
canada,not_removed,harpers government was anything but straightforward and honest during the campaign trudeau voiced his support for pipelines this move is in no way dishonest or surprising im way more surprised at how seriously the liberals appear to be taking climate change and protecting the environment
canada,not_removed,ive gotten bad with my backlog id pick up something on sale or used with the intention of playing it and once what was a to hour work week was done i wouldnt be interested in gaming once i start i have a hard time stopping the usual one more level before bed oh shit its midnight and i gotta be at work in hours dead tired the next day id just do errands watch some tv and catch up on sleep ive spent maybe or hours a day average for the last few months looking for and applying for work and the rest gaming powered through gears of war in days after letting it sit for years i think my next game will be farcry
canada,not_removed,thats ridiculous im against oil tankers because theyre bad for the environment so instead of doing something productive about it im going to fuck around and increase the odds that something bad will happen
canada,not_removed,absolutely and about of british columbians arent antipipeline although the antipipeline people are probably more likely to consider it a key votedeciding issue than the propipeline people i expect the liberals could get reelected in a lot of those seats but itll be interesting to see how much impact this has
canada,not_removed,depends on how many pipeline leaks there are leading up to the election
canada,not_removed,even if they lose all but one of those new seat gains in bc it wouldnt likely actually change anything liberal majority and the likelihood that they would lose that many seats in bc with no change anywhere else is remarkably small all that would change is ndp as official opposition rather than conservatives
canada,not_removed,tbh when ndp announced the balanced budget last year was when they lost me i still strategically vote for them but was much happier that lpc got to form government
canada,not_removed,i think you misspelled russia
canada,not_removed,and why compromise in general is kind of sucky a trade is better than a compromise its the tepid tea problem if one person wants hot tea and one wants iced tea a compromise is lukewarm tea that neither party wants if on the other hand one party can acquiesce on one thing in exchange for the other party doing the same on another issue everyone gets value in this case pipelines were going to happen no matter what what would have been better for the environmentalists to do was kick up a fuss and demand something in exchange for agreeing to and endorsing the pipelines instead trudeau did what he inevitably would have to do in his position and as far as i can see theres nothing that the environmentalists are getting besides platitudes and business as usual from the government good job protestors youve secured another noble defeat in the name of whatever it is you think you were doing youll get em next time im sure
canada,not_removed,never heard this interesting idea thanks
canada,not_removed,he wont if the election is held tomorrow he may be able to save the ones he already has at best
canada,not_removed,the largest city in newfoundland has been ft mac for quite some time
canada,not_removed,to what technology theres nothing to move to its insane
canada,not_removed,ehhhh yes and no i work in the tech industry and sure we have the occasional position but we also get applicants for everything and of those applicants more than a few of them will have the experience we are looking for vs someone who is fresh out of schoolretraining that being said im also in alberta where everything has been nailed if people are open to moving it would probably be a decent idea
canada,not_removed,there are no other places with jobs harper said to go west because the west actually needed more workers at the time
canada,not_removed,now would be a good time to try again since ontario is hell bent on losing it all
canada,not_removed,dont forget about competing for rail access with oil
canada,not_removed,i said investing more into an economy that failed due to factors out of its own control is a bad idea no you said nothing of the sort you said probably makes sense to diversify away from oil then rather than putting even more eggs in one basket further to that adding pipeline capacity to meet existing production capacity and commodity demand is not shifting more eggs into one basket its merely attempting to maximize the potential of existing resources as it stands wcs trades at a steep discount to wti and brent added pipeline helps reduce that disparity without taking resources away from other industries
canada,not_removed,exactly and what pisses people off is by twinning this pipeline your theoretically doubling your chances at a spill or a pipe burst this shit happens the alberta tar sands already produce a ridiculous amount of oil as it is have these people in here that are saying its going to bring back jobs to alberta heard of the great migration guess what jobs change over time people move industries die we cant keep expanding this industry and expect anything good to come from it the prime example would be the gold rush there are hundreds of gold mining towns in bc that are ghost towns those people survived how they moved on to some other industry this is how the human society works
canada,not_removed,on what
canada,not_removed,at this years rate oilsand will be exhausted in years in the boom cycle the rate is much higher and will be exhausted in less than years imo canada as a country is so behind in the renewable energy technology and it will remain so for years to come if we dont increase oil revenue both internal usage and selling it offshore we may not even make it in years besides oil is not only used as energy product plastic bitumen are also oil product that will be consumed at increasing rate over of years
canada,not_removed,alberta would love to not have to rely so much on the oil industry
canada,not_removed,considering there are only redditors on rcanada i wouldnt be too harsh on them for not coming out here facebook and twitter have millions of canadians those here have strong opinions and if my experience is anything to go by are unlikely to change them so i understand why politicians dont come here that being said i agree its good to see them popping up in here randomly its a bit like having them low key walking into a community league meeting
canada,not_removed,hah as if those on the other side of this arent just as guilty at least the pipeline side isnt using these groups as a tool to further their own objectives
canada,not_removed,they were consulted and agreed
canada,not_removed,that would work if canadians or people who are subject too this tax were the ones buying the oil correct me if i am wrong but all of the oil in the kinder morgan pipes are slated for over seas sales i am not an expert but does the canadian carbon tax apply to export sails i know it would make the production and operations more costly but
canada,not_removed,you dont seem to get that federal trumps provincial
canada,not_removed,bc doesnt want to go toe to toe with federal gov and guaranteed they wont they already did over northern gateway
canada,not_removed,yeah i definitely agree its a balancing act hes come off a bit on the wrong here because he said he wanted to repair indigenous relations and he cant do that with pipelines but they arent the ones who will keep his party in power — albertans are and who knows maybe he approved kinder morgan because he knew it wouldnt get past protestors he gets to throw his hands up and say well i tried without going through on it it wouldnt do anything for interprovincial relations but trudeau could absolve some blame that might be a bit tin foil though ahha
canada,not_removed,i dont know how lucrative these jobs will be after the pipeline is complete i dont see that many permanent jobs after its all said and done for anyone in bc or ab jobs wise its good short term but long term i dont think so im totally against shipping crude to other countries in the first place we should be refining it here which employs way more people
canada,not_removed,property tax doesnt increase with pipelines pump stations are in alberta tugboats are independent contractors port jobs are miniscule and km doesnt use the main port they just hook up to their own ships albertas oil revenues are less than of their actual value because the oil rights are bought out by multinational conglomerates who are shipping it overseas to refine it mark it up and resell it canada keeps next to none of the profits which is why gas prices are super high even when oil prices drop by corporate taxes wont go up for the same reason not to mention the billions in subsidies that the fossil fuel industry receives make it revenue neutral the taxes come from employees many of whom will lose their jobs because pipelines are made in order to decrease the number of employees needed to package and transport the crude and in order to avoid refining the oil in canada so they can export it to world countries for refining and not have to pay living wages or obey environmental laws in refining
canada,not_removed,nopethose are laughably small and negligible compared to alberta getting oil out and transporting it through bc
canada,not_removed,yeah i cant wait to see the lucrative property taxes levied on homes affected by an oil spill trololololol
canada,not_removed,yea people in a control looking at graphs all day pipelines have next to zero jobs after they are built
canada,not_removed,very little its pretty much automated
canada,not_removed,what do you mean cost inflation it looks like estimates from two different sides of the spectrum the oil company says the spill wont cost that much to clean up the other guys say itll be what the oil company says it will cost
canada,not_removed,im not asserting that either claim is accurate as liquidpig suggests one is a very conservative estimate one very liberal though if i had to choose one i would be more inclined to go for the study that was conducted by someone other than a vested interest my point in bringing up the burnaby spill was that it was very small compared to what could occur yet still cost that much to clean up i wasnt saying that a slightly larger scale would mean in costs just that even a moderate spill as described by km would have immense costs
canada,not_removed,leftists believe that not taxing something is a giveaway as for subsidies to companies that criticism is pretty rich coming from a the left since they believe that the government should just own the means of production outright a subsidy if you will
canada,not_removed,does the government get to write off the cost of cleaning up the oil spill i understand who is left holding the bag
canada,not_removed,the difference is that corporations can defer expenses and taxes from year to year something that you or i cant do they can take those in expenses and readjust previous years taxes or future years to show losses instead of profits clawing back taxes they had previously paid so imagine you have a sweet job and take out a mortgage and pay about in taxes for a few years then you blow too much on your credit cards lose some money on the ponies and then lose your job then you go to the government and say hey you know that i paid in tax over the past years yeah im gonna need that back
canada,not_removed,that may have been a bit flippant of me but making the oil company pay isnt as easy as it seems husky has avoided paying for the full cost of the prince albert spill by claiming it was all good their interest is in making money not in cleaning up spills so at some point they are going to want to stop cleaning before its all fixed
canada,not_removed,i think maybe you didnt mean to reply to me
canada,not_removed,it makes no sense to ship out a raw product and then buy back a finished product since you did reply to me i might as well comment back it might entirely make sense to ship out the raw product to somewhere else to be processed we do it with all kinds of things thats the point of globalization yes we could build a refinery here but if it takes years to pay it back all while oil is becoming less used and more rare then maybe it doesnt make sense maybe theres other things to invest in instead that would have an even better return
canada,not_removed,we arent shipping oil to other countries to get it refined we dont own the oil or the gas companies buy the rights from the government to extract the resources and they sell it this is not the governments job to do there is no we in this equation
canada,not_removed,youve never heard of this thing called government investment its how your tax dollars get spent
canada,not_removed,they are currently being implemented in certain areas prices are still high so you wont see full implementation just yet but prices keeps getting lower and technology keeps advancing fast so it will be very soon unless you are years old you will live to see it fully implemented
canada,not_removed,oh there is a demand for it let us just keep using it and destroy our earth good idea we need rapid change and if that means not using fossil fuels im all for it
canada,not_removed,stop smoking lead it makes you stupid
canada,not_removed,yes black or white total apocalyptic devastation no compromise
canada,not_removed,you dont have to be a hardcore environmentalist to understand the urgency of climate change this is just science and yeah things arent looking good
canada,not_removed,isnt it better to plan for the worst than hope for the best
canada,not_removed,while ignoring the reality of today
canada,not_removed,a surprising amount of people want us to just stop using oil all together like right away and get rid of cars and all that
canada,not_removed,you wouldnt download oil
canada,not_removed,you wouldnt download oil
canada,not_removed,i honestly cant tell if this is a joke or you are being serious i pray to all the gods it is a joke
canada,not_removed,ferries and pixies duh
canada,not_removed,if we didnt have to use gas we wouldnt there are definitely ways for the individual to reduce their reliance on gas but only so much of it is affordable leadership from the government can mean a whole heck of a lot with things like that
canada,not_removed,everything lincoln bough was most likely producedfacilitated by slaves hell most of western civilization was build on slaves the same is true for oil but you can still want to wean yourself off it
canada,not_removed,im a local of bc who will be affected by this im sorry you dont full understand why people will protest it just because they use oil everyone does its in everything from tires to barbie dolls doesnt mean we have to expand it the tar sands already produce a ridiculous amount of oil everyday people are upset because they dont want an oil spill adding the km expansion increases the amount of oil shipped by we are getting far to greedy at this point also the tar sands are already the largest oil reserve in north america this may not affect you but i live on the coast where i fish for food i dont want to see a perfectly good renewable food source destroyed because some corporation wants more
canada,not_removed,we are all part of a society that is built upon a fossil fuel infrastructure we did not choose and did not have to build what we can choose is what infrastructure we build and we have a moral obligation to make those choices with the future of the society in mind
canada,not_removed,im sorry but i was born in a house in downtown toronto i dont know how to run a selfsufficient homestead and even if i did i wouldnt thats not the point environmentalists arent fighting for a return to primitive subsistence agriculture were fighting for an advanced and interconnected human species that lives sustainably i dont want a world without cars i want a world with cars run on sustainable energy i dont want a world without cities i want a world with clean cities that produce the bulk of their own food internally the whole environmentalists use fossil fuels therefore theyre hypocrites argument is bunk what am i supposed to do stand naked at the edge of the woods and scream at passing cars
canada,not_removed,thats not the case here in canada not true canada has nearly of its power provided by hydro so much so that we are one of the few places where hydro is synonymous with the electric bill if we were to actually build more damns in alberta bc yukon and alaska last one not canada i know but we export out of the east why not import we would dwarf norways capacity the only problem is no one lives near where our hydroelectric potential is follow the rockies north to the bering strait and you have near limitless potential the norwegians built power lines connecting their costal villages all the way past the arctic circle and dammed the rivers flowing into the fjords that sheltered those villages the problem is we dont have much north of edmonton which itself is in the wrong direction from the mountains the problem isnt hydroelectric its power lines if we had them we could be green easily i do understand the economic problems involved in building so many large scale power lines i am simply pointing out that you have the problem all wrongbut hey maybe we can get mexico to pay for it as it stands right now ab yk and bc are no where near their potential for hydroelectric power most of our fast running water is in the west of the country yet most of our hydro dams are in the east
canada,not_removed,uh canada has more hydro than it can use httpscanadahydrocahydropowerpotential canadian hydropower can provide percent of power used today overall
canada,not_removed,when did the liberals ever say a categorical no to pipelines
canada,not_removed,the issue is that these people dont think rationally its the same sort of thing as chaining yourself to a tree but instead of stopping tankers youre actually increasing the chance that the thing youre afraid of will happen
canada,not_removed,most are neutral and prefer a balance between protecting the environment and boosting the economy
canada,not_removed,no america they dont recognize the nwp as internal waters
canada,not_removed,well trudeau did ban tankers from northern bc waters and alberta is going to bring in some things like carbon tax etc they essentially did compromise
canada,not_removed,distributed solar wind whatever elon musk has engineered last week
canada,not_removed,no there are jobs here you just need to be willing to get retrained and upgrade your skills
canada,not_removed,yeah for sure hopefully we can get some more meaningful legislation through that gives the grain companies a bit more strength against the railways
canada,not_removed,the problem for alberta is that diversifying is necessary due to the world eventually moving away from oil in our lifetimes i dont see a move from gas for a while but it might happen and the reason you stated that it is hard but other places do it and we have to find a way i dont know or else id be making millions as a consultant to the govt and private sector denver was a similar city to us up until the and they diversified now this downturn in energy is hurting them a lot less than us
canada,not_removed,well cleanup costs ran upwards of million if i remember correctly—i suppose i consider that significant and it was hit by sewage workers i believe they were given faultyinconsistent information by trans mountain the company operating the pipeline at that time
canada,not_removed,on your statement that a tanker ran aground years ago in bc waters
canada,not_removed,agreed its great for some people when its good and terrible for a lot when there is a bust
canada,not_removed,ask your mp to do an ama
canada,not_removed,of them agreed
canada,not_removed,im confused whether the carbon outputs of oil exports count against us or against the users of that oil my view is that it should count against the users because we cant control for the efficiency of their oil burning carbon caused by the production of oil sands bitumen should count against our paris targets those activities should have a carbon tax if kinder morgan thinks bitumen produced under a carbon tax and a pipeline that can only fill mediumsized tankers of the way is still profitable then sure they should go for it not being an economist it seems to me that the odds are stacked against them or export is so difficult that this will relatively seem like a deal
canada,not_removed,you dont seem to understand what jurisdiction means federal cant tell the provinces what to do when something isnt within the federal governments jurisdiction
canada,not_removed,nice talking points care to explain the billions in subsidies are
canada,not_removed,you cant pump it from edmonton to burnaby with one station youd blow up the line in edmonton because physics not saying that pump stations create many jobs but ther will be several all along the line
canada,not_removed,kinda like bc profiting from all the goods that land on the coast and shipped east to the rest of canada were a country i want to see all the provinces prosper a strong alberta benefits canada just like a strong bc saskatchewan etc
canada,not_removed,when alberta does well canada does well and bc doing well means canada does well were united country supposedly everyone benefits thousands of british colombians work oilgas in alberta
canada,not_removed,pipelines pumping stations tank farms and other such infrastructure sit on or under land land that is subject to property taxes its really quite obvious
canada,not_removed,the pipeline only moves oil there you will need people on the ground to receive it and move the oil from pipeline to ships you need people to work at the port to manage logistics and the flow of product in vancouver it would contribute significantly to the oil refinery industry which in turn touches many other industries ie retail gasoline shipping distribution plastics packaging manufacturing etc all in all a lot of jobs
canada,not_removed,this is literally the point of building pipelines they are cheap to operate aka dont employ anyone
canada,not_removed,you need people to service the line inspections cleaning the line on a regular basis they have people flying over the lines looking for spills there is a lot of electronic instrumentation on modern pipelines emergency shutdown esd systems and ground stability audits up or down any significant slope not to mention the office support for all those frontline jobs
canada,not_removed,you have no idea yet have an opinion
canada,not_removed,i work in a pipeline terminal we have over people on staff thats just the one terminal
canada,not_removed,i work in pipeline inspection and maintenance my company employs hundreds of people in this field and we do work for dozens of different pipeline companies there are several similar companies to mine that do the exact same work thats lots of people just in one dedicated field literally thousands of jobs just in inspections and pre failure repairs plus all the other companies that work with us for things like equipment sales and rentals transportation the hotels we all stay in and food we eat while working across the country etc and thats just maintance you still have the other dozens of fields nessesary to operating these pipelines what about the operations personal that keep the hundreds of new facilities and pump stations running the payroll people that make sure those operators get paid on time the pilots flying over these lines daily to do visual inspections and all the people employeed with keeping those planes in the air the mechanics that keep the thousands of pieces of equipment running the engineers reviewing data from scan tools the hr people making sure those engineers are treated fairly these and manymany many more are the thousands and thousands of full time jobs that exist and will be extensively expanded from these approvals and this is all after construction hardly half a dozen people in a control room
canada,not_removed,im saying that the following is incorrect bc will see next to no economic benefit from this pipeline bc is seeing significant economic benefit given the number of jobs directly and indirectly created not to mention the impact of positive externalities and also particularly in light of the amount of risk that it is taking on the highest spill estimations by nonindependent parties have cleanup costs estimated at the cleanup of the last spill kinder morgan had which is a gross inflation of realistic costs its like making an argument that people shouldnt drive at all because in the absolute worse case scenario someone may end up in a fatal accident that also includes over in accident settlements
canada,not_removed,the government bills the company directly for the costs say a fire department was sent out and a police squad was sent out the two departments bill the city each for example the city then will bill the company for the company pays the invoice as a business expense as if they had paid for a contractor or vendor at the end of the year revenues expenses profits the fact that the cleanup takes place means that expenses are higher and profits are lower because profits are lower they pay less tax for the government they dont see any change in their balance sheet since they paid the firepolice department then the company paid them back theres no writeoff or anything maybe im not understanding your question
canada,not_removed,individuals can do that sort of thing too i had capital losses in previous years that i was able to carry forward to offset capital gains in when i sold some stock positions
canada,not_removed,right if i had a business i could do the same thing not just oil companies but apple google and mom and pop convenience store down the street in a similar but more personal vein if i take capital losses this year i can carry those forward and offset capital gains in the future itd be interesting if we could pay taxes like a corporation if i get to deduct my foodshelter expenses and only pay taxes on my profit thatd be interesting but i think that claiming we are subsidizing oil companies because they get to write off business expenses is misleading
canada,not_removed,its still in the best financial interest of the company not to have the oil spill or you to gamble away a million dollars in the first place being able to claim it as a deduction only reduces some of the costs
canada,not_removed,sorry could you provide me a link to this this is what i could find that says several times that they are paying for everything in several municipalities
canada,not_removed,all pipeline companies are required to put up a bond to cover issues if they go bankrupt those that are still in business are free to dispute costs my issue is that small fines for companies that are negligent with inspections and training
canada,not_removed,well you need more carbon taxes so people drive smaller vehicles need carbon tax on airlines and ships carbon tax on big houses the problem is the demand not the supply
canada,not_removed,do you live by yourself in the woods so that you are prepared for the worst case of society completely breaking down thats why no it isnt better to plan for the absolute worst
canada,not_removed,the only ones who ignore the reality of today are the ones who think stopping pipelines in canada will have any impact on the continued importance of fossil fuels to human civilization
canada,not_removed,im one of them and i support this decision the ability to get off oil requires getting everyone off of oil not just ecocommunes that involves pricing carbon and getting others to price carbon the cost of pricing carbon for much of western canada was pipeline approval i see this as ceding a battle in order to win the war
canada,not_removed,they also forget things are made from oil
canada,not_removed,i would
canada,not_removed,its amazing how far weve come as a culture that youre worried this might not be a joke there are actually be out there that believe stuff like that kinda sad really but yeah no im not serious i live in reality where i understand how the world works and weve gotten where we are in society because of globalization
canada,not_removed,everything lincoln bough was most likely producedfacilitated by slaves that isnt true the northern us was heavily industrialized and as a result much less reliance on slavery the southern us was built on cotton which did need slaves youre flat out wrong
canada,not_removed,western civilization try all civilization
canada,not_removed,everything lincoln bough was most likely producedfacilitated by slaves thats not accurate free men have always been the clear majority of labourers in the us especially in the north hell most of western civilization was build on slaves not to trivialize slavery but the most difficult part of the creation of the west was not the literal labour required but rather the cultural and political ideas which were produced in whole by free men
canada,not_removed,i just checked it out and its hydropower in which is a lot higher than i thought
canada,not_removed,canada already dwarfs norway in hydro outproducing it to in annual production the real problem is weve entered an era where canada has trouble building any major infrastructure without protests from somebody look at the hassle that bc has with getting the relatively small site c dam built building multigw dams that will need to flood thousands of square km of land will make the oil pipelines look like a walk in the park
canada,not_removed,im in this bucket voted ndp last election because they had a higher chance in our riding but preferred lpcs platform this doesnt change my stance on lpc i still think they manage the best balance between environment and economy
canada,not_removed,they cant recognize it officially but i am damn sure that unofficially they treat it as canadian waters and quietly notify canada when entering it
canada,not_removed,i think russia would give them a hard time with that
canada,not_removed,even if you could produce enough to replace our basic energy needs with those you cant how are you going to make batteries for storage without oil the extraction and production of those elements are as bad or worse than oil
canada,not_removed,didnt the wheat board accomplish this by owning their own rail cars terminals etc
canada,not_removed,for some reason i thought the exxon valdez was in bc not alaska my mistake
canada,not_removed,valdez was years ago but i dont recall bc spill myself
canada,not_removed,source for the above claim even with significant offers of financial compensation of bands are refusing to cooperatesupport the pipeline
canada,not_removed,another way of saying we consulted until we found a few willing fools to pad the result
canada,not_removed,how to tax the oil is tricky the production must be taxed riots if not and ideally i would have them also pay for the actual oil that they export as they are activly adding to to the on earth but with out knowing how much is happening down stream that could be challenging at best but yeah i do think a flat rate per barrel would be best though painful for that industry as for how profitable it will be tanker traffic is expected to go from the limit of to so prophet may be an understatement assuming people actually want to buy our oil
canada,not_removed,im in the controls field i know what this is
canada,not_removed,the highest spill estimations by nonindependent parties have cleanup costs estimated at the cleanup of the last spill kinder morgan had which is a gross inflation of realistic costs its like making an argument that people shouldnt drive at all because in the absolute worse case scenario someone may end up in a fatal accident that also includes over in accident settlements thats not the last spill km had they have spills along tm all the time most are very small and cost next to nothing to clean up the estimations are for a large spill part of the discrepancy is what that means
canada,not_removed,yes the country sees less tax collected at the end of the day guess who will be making up the difference tax payers
canada,not_removed,true but the bp spill costs werent an expense it was negligence that should be different imagine being able to deduct your speeding ticket on your income tax
canada,not_removed,ok so lets build pipelines that are scheduled to last years
canada,not_removed,we wont get off oil any time soon at least until a viable solution is found for every average joe to get to and from a and b i cant bike to work i cant take transit and i cant walk that far i have to drive to and from work every day
canada,not_removed,carbon tax is about reduction not getting off of it entirely its also important to keep in mind that oil is used to create most plastics and medications lots of common products would have to go way up in price since the cheap plastic would be gone
canada,not_removed,oh yeah and what are you going to use to run those combines we need for food
canada,not_removed,damn you guys are pedantic it doesnt matter if only one of his shirts was made of cotton picked by a slave the point is the same
canada,not_removed,so lincoln never wore cotton
canada,not_removed,according to whom the hydroelectric producers themselves estimated across canada also that percentage is mostly isolated to quebec and ontario in fact they even export a lot more to the us alberta has always had the problem of over subsidizing oil why build a big expensive dam when the government is basically paying you to burn fossil fuels bc has the problem of building power lines through the interior dam isnt any good unless you have a plan to get the power somewhere
canada,not_removed,that problem was always there the issue now is that the empty platitudes of the past about compensation and environmental protection are held to account with the internet etc it is far easier to find out how much you are owed for your flooded landdried up riverbank it is also easier to hold the government to account for fuck ups etc however much like the opcompromises are possible there are definitely places that no one should build and places that people should i think todays news is a lesson on what makes a good project and what makes a bad one in this new era kinder and b are going through and not all that much craziness will happen imo had keystone been tried shit would have hit the fan thats the difference there are plenty of dam locations where indigenous bands and local environmental groups can be brought on board you will never convince nimby neighbors so you just have to compensate them and fringeforeign environmentalists are not going to affect public opinion all this makes it ever so slightly more expensive to build infrastructure the real problem is people voting in tax cuts and more tax cuts slash the government budget tories if the price is going up and you keep demanding it go down it gets to the point where nothing gets done these sorts of projects arent really feasible without government money and that comes from taxes
canada,not_removed,i believe its under a gentlemens agreement of theyll ask as long as we allow which means we dont exercise total sovereignty over the region
canada,not_removed,hydro its continuous like oilgas and unlike solar or wind it already supplies a huge chunk of canadas power and if we could get infrastructure long haul power lines approved the rivers in the north could supply an incredible amount of energy to tide us over until either we get bettter battery technology for solar on earth or better wireless energy transfer for solar on the moonin orbit
canada,not_removed,the main thing the wheat board did was handle the marketing of farmers grain to end users grain companies such as cargill and viterra handled the logistics of it all the main issue is the railways literally have the grain companies by the throat because if they dont get any cars then they cant move grain to port which causes a few issues to say the least
canada,not_removed,nah it was a problem back then too
canada,not_removed,no worries i was thinking of the nastucca spill off the washington coast in gallons spilledthat was a mere barge too
canada,not_removed,i was young when it happened old enough to remember but not old enough to remember accurately always thought it was in northern bc
canada,not_removed,as an addendum from the article there is a fear among first nations that if they do not sign a deal by the time a decision is reached in ottawa they risk being left out even though the pipeline will travel through their territory so an unknowable number of the bands that did signal support likely did so out of concern that they were going to lose their rights anyways so they might as well get some money out of it
canada,not_removed,ya they are but youre not going to change the program unfortunately
canada,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofcanadianprovincesandterritoriesbygrossdomesticproduct
canada,not_removed,people in the east produce og workers and export them to alberta
canada,not_removed,i have a close friend who works for kinder morgan youve got pipeline maintenance and inspections tank farm jobs jobs at the loading port just last week i read there will be jobs for tug boat workers open your eyes a bit lots of jobs
canada,not_removed,i doubt youre in the controls field otherwise youd know pipeline companies are already responsible for of the cleanup and remediation costs you probably man a playstation controller
canada,not_removed,i think what youre saying is fair maybe bp shouldnt have been allowed to claim penalties as tax credit i believe it was part of the settlement too in that they were penalized but were only allowed to claim of it as a credit ie is directly off after tax dollars you could argue that the doj went easy on them for their insane fuckup however were also moving past what we were originally discussing theres another billion dollars that bp paid out in costs directly related to the clean up and not legalcivil penalties thats of the cost of the clean up the justice system dollars is outside of the fact that the bp completely covered the costs of the spill which can be said to be a business expense as a criminal and legal settlement theres a lot less precedent in terms of what is appropriate if i get a speeding ticket i can go to the courts and beg for mercy and usually they cut the fine in half all of the penalties and such are negotiable what isnt negotiable is the company being responsible for of the direct clean up costs and it is extremely rare that they dont do it especially with large companies on the scale of bpenbridgetranscanada that wont go bankrupt
canada,not_removed,plus canadian winters solar is improving rapidly in terms of basic household use but its not going to be able to replace every combustion engine and generator any time soon
canada,not_removed,now or when we get off of oil
canada,not_removed,everything lincoln bough was most likely producedfacilitated by slaves it does matter one shirt is not the same as everything he touched one indicates a man who wants to abolish slavery while heavily enjoying what it produces the other indicates someone who along with his country has purposely diminished and reduced slavery except where no alternative exists the british marauded and freed slaves all over the world but they still bought cotton too because they had to buy it
canada,not_removed,everything lincoln bough was most likely producedfacilitated by slaves
canada,not_removed,the neb too lazy to format sorry
canada,not_removed,it is not that if the us recognizes canadas claim they will have to recognize claims made by countries like china
canada,not_removed,this is gonna be the case unfortunate for them
canada,not_removed,and they carry insurance to cover portions of that but if a company has to many fuck ups those insurance prices get very expensive
canada,not_removed,of course not now we know how they run now
canada,not_removed,i still fail to see how the analogy is not apt
canada,not_removed,while this may be hyperbole to say everything it doesnt discredit the argument that lincoln using cotton dye—or whatever other products of slavery—could oppose slavery without hypocrisy economies are entangled
canada,not_removed,ive mentioned this as well before theres a turning point wherein company profits fall because nobody can purchase their products and services even though the company saves money by not hiring
canada,not_removed,the whole point of technology is not to convert people into more efficient slaves but to reduce the amount of work needed to do the same job so that people have more time for leisure and have better living standards if automation takes over capitalism will simply not work you will have to move back into a socialist society where there is basic income and corporations are taxed much higher that tax would be justified because companies simply make more money by cutting out middle men due to global connectivity and automation canada seems to be on the right track which is why people are better off relatively here than our land of opportunity neighbour with donald trump extremely rich and horrible income inequality
canada,not_removed,three options for the future a dystopic hellhole somewhere where neoliberalism can do no wrong and the poor are left starve while the rich seclude themselves in fortress communities and wait out the turmoil when a large chunk of the labour force is made redundant governments around the world respond by placating the people with just enough money to keep them from burning down their capitals i think most governments will choose this option even if it leads to a lower standard of life for everyone taxes on the super wealthy and corporations will rise to accommodate for this new economic system the luddites make a comeback and demand meaningless jobs for everyone be legislated rather than free money from the government judging by the mexicans took er jerbs sentiment from down south this is actually plausible
canada,not_removed,let me introduce you to the concept of basic income
canada,not_removed,if automation is involved in the process that car is cheaper and more affordable for the poor not more expensive let me ask you this question when tractors and combustion engines made of farm labour redundant when of canadians worked in agriculture did that result in massive unemployment and economic inequality
canada,not_removed,that could work so long as theres enough people paying taxes to support those on it however if productivity is way down in the toilet the economy just becomes a huge depression with huge inflation numbers
canada,not_removed,such a currencybased outlook who cares if anyone pays taxes robots mine ores and process into more robots who do literally everything else
canada,not_removed,not nearly enough
canada,not_removed,why is white collar crime usually given less time then other crimes
canada,not_removed,dont drop the soap mick
canada,not_removed,why is white collar crime usually given less time then other crimes because they typically dont have a prior criminal record and are unlikely to hold office ever again

canada,not_removed,i take part in marathon distance mountain biking why is this relevant its relevant because i travel upwards of or more a ride and through these rides i smell pot in almost every park in the city during almost any time of day or night i rode in a race last weekend what did i smell during the race people smoking pot i personally support full legalization but i think its absolutely stupid to have this illegal in any way when people are smoking it all over the place at almost all times
canada,not_removed,jane philpott the federal health minister who will be at this press conference has already stated that a task force is about to be announced anyone expecting this announcement to be anything other than the introduction to an official task force is setting up for disappointment
canada,not_removed,task force members will likely be announced
canada,not_removed,hoping its one of the following small time possession people will be released small possession charges on past records to be expunged between now and next spring only tickets will be given out to people who are smoking in public i mean this would really make me feel happy any of them
canada,not_removed,its a long weekend announcement bad news is buried before weekends by governments i hope i am wrong but i am expecting bad news ie reaffirming dispensaries are illegal and will be prosecuted etc if this were a monday announcement that would get the weeks media play i would be excited because its more likely to be a favourable announcement
canada,not_removed,smoke out in the chambers on canada day everyones welcome to join us

canada,not_removed,listening to the press conf right now what a bunch of political double speak and bs wont someone think of the children over and over againwe get it theyve had each of the six bureaucrats actually repeat the same thing over and overstrict regulationkept out of the hands of childrencurrent law is the lawwere working diligently to move forwardyaddayaddayadda
canada,not_removed,is there anything else going on tomorrow that should be capturing our interest im always suspicious of the timing of these things pot is overall a pretty minor issue versus things that are really important to solve soon but its an excellent way to distract everyones attention from something else
canada,not_removed,tweed stock will sky rocket
canada,not_removed,so is that like an announcement for an announcement
canada,not_removed,trudeau dont worry be happy
canada,not_removed,theyre just announcing it now its the first step launch of a task force headed by anne mclellan and thats all nothing more than that folks sorry oh and the audio level on the periscope broadcast is total shite too feh
canada,not_removed,is there a transcript of the announcement somewhere
canada,not_removed,lol theyre going to look into it maybe they know hillary
canada,not_removed,i lost count how many times i shook my head in that mins
canada,not_removed,this is a big if as in if we get reelected then maybe youll get your marijuana legislation
canada,not_removed,attention voters we have a new piece of candy to wave in your face the next time we have to do something politically unfavorable lpc
canada,not_removed,i find all the negativity in this thread ironic and amusing because we keep hearing from cannabis consumers of which i am one that governments not moving fast enough whats going on blah blah blah theyre making an announcement which is what people wanted and now we have a thread that is at least negative before the announcement why dont we wait for the announcement before we start bitching and moaning people
canada,not_removed,it would be really hard for them to do nothing such as study and bury because the membership of the liberal party really wants reform on this issue it is one of the reasons that marijuana was the first platform item presented by the liberals prior to the last election the other being it was an issue the liberals were sure the conservatives would not coopt there are many decisions that leadership teams of parties make that differ from the rank and file but if an issue is important to the membership the leader takes a real risk ignoring it we say that leaders are tossed out by the electorate but it is actually often parties that toss leaders with the electorate tossing governing parties even leaders with majority governments have been forced to step down trudeau wouldnt face a party revolt over this issue but he would be burning a fair chunk of party goodwill by the way uatadvice thanks for posting
canada,not_removed,dear god the question dodging
canada,not_removed,dear suckers thanks for the single issue vote weed will remain illegal jt ps hahaha haha pps thanks for the nannies
canada,not_removed,im assuming it will concern how medical marijuana will be distributed during the postal strike
canada,not_removed,trudeau ayo hol up sparks the blunt trudeauu be sayin takes a hit trudeauthat we be legalizing n shit exhales philpott delayed till
canada,not_removed,weed decriminalized happy canada day
canada,not_removed,canada okay so after all your weed marches and griping we have decided to decriminalize weed in but it will be only legal if it is sold in government regulated dispensaries bucks a gram taxes woo you are welcome us shit
canada,not_removed,the law is the law until new legislation is in place
canada,not_removed,hopefully decriminilization
canada,not_removed,going into a long weekend cant be anything of significance
canada,not_removed,cant hear a fucking word theyre saying stop mumbling and speak up
canada,not_removed,so weve been thinking and maybe this legalisation things isnt such a great idea after all were calling the whole thing off
canada,not_removed,im a single issue voter if it isnt legalized or at least decriminalized by the next election im voting for the liberals direct competitor
canada,not_removed,the government of canada is committed to considering exploring the possibility of taking steps toward actions that will lead to over time the potential decriminalization of marijauna and after a trial period the possibility of controlled legalization as of today we have assembled a government thinktank of professional friendsoffriends who will in turn assemble their own small councils and exploratory committees with express purpose of discussing our intentions and man can these people discuss this is a great day for our nation edit never mind somebody already did it but better
canada,not_removed,oh the disappointment when our fellow redactors learn this isnt an announcement involving free tokes for all canadian citizens tomorrow and forever afterwards
canada,not_removed,they just basically said production will be strictly controlledagain to protect children smh because marijuana is dangerous no way youre going to be permitted to grow your own reporter missed a chance to follow up with a question on why they think alcohol is less dangerousit must be because youre allowed to brew your own booze
canada,not_removed,marijuana is bad for you thank you
canada,not_removed,i am staying up all night so i dont sleep through the conference i am probably just setting myself for disappointment as i hear it is just them announcing the task force members i do hope though that they are like ayy lmao dude here with the hip liberals we are decrimming marijuana until we can figure our tax shit out fam burn it up blaze it the odds of this are as ridiculous as the statement i just made
canada,not_removed,i am scared philpot and blair two prohibitionists in charge of legalization making an announcement right after the leader of the country responsible for prohibition worldwide has visited urnngh
canada,not_removed,ugh this gives me a horrible feeling its like someone announcing that tomorrow we are going to open a box with your lunch inside hoping for blt but honestly expecting a shit sandwich
canada,not_removed,ban people from smoking it in public im all for legalization and im all for people smoking it but do it home just like drinking alcohol its so annoying to smell it outside while trying to enjoy the day
canada,not_removed,i hope its good news to toke to
canada,not_removed,the pm is definitely hitting the slopes tomorrow thats all we can say for now
canada,not_removed,time to buy more stocks i think
canada,not_removed,remindme minutes what was the announcement
canada,not_removed,canada one step closer to marijuana legalization
canada,not_removed,i for one call for the immediate extermination of the health minister to teach the next one to not waste time
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,tomorrow morning wtf they should know stoners are not early risers
canada,not_removed,you dont want legalization you want decriminalization big big difference
canada,not_removed,would be silly to legalize marijuana when canadas economy is slowing
canada,not_removed,thankfully trudeaus too milquetoast to seriously do anything its probably a phased plan n e o p r o h i b i t i o n countries with a hard line on drug control work infinitely better than sanctioning criminals and drug addicts selling their meme as significant every will
canada,not_removed,httpperiscopetvhealthcanada
canada,not_removed,blunt wraps illegal thanks government
canada,not_removed,nope just dabs with jt
canada,not_removed,you ever see the pbs documentary on obama apparently in highschool he was literally known as the biggest stoner i forget his nickname but it had to do with marijuana
canada,not_removed,he took a pill in ibiza
canada,not_removed,hey they said a weed announcement not humans rights porn
canada,not_removed,what a wonderful world plays in the background
canada,not_removed,baked for this comment
canada,not_removed,weed is now legal in canada blaze that shit yo hey hey hey heysmoke weed everyday that is all snoop dogg minister of weed
canada,not_removed,non pot smoker here and i agree
canada,not_removed,gotta love summer solstice yep it was everywhere
canada,not_removed,can confirm i was one of those people smoking pot at the bicycle race
canada,not_removed,things i should do more often at bicycle races
canada,not_removed,i pass by moss park in downtown toronto twice a day when bike commuting and more often than not i smell pot whenever i ride by that area
canada,not_removed,i agree i dont smoke it but during my travels across canada this week ive smelled it outside every hotel ive been at ottawa belleville winnipeg calgary and kelowna all have had people smoking pot and in calgary a couple of beat cops walked by i knew they smelled it but they didnt care its time to end the farce
canada,not_removed,people dont realize that once legalized it will still be illegal to smoke it anywhere im not sure why people think there will be this world where people will be free to smoke up in public
canada,not_removed,thousands of people literally blazed in front of parliament hill and nothing happened
canada,not_removed,nonpot smoker here when it leaks into my apartment by one man who is a legal user and another on the other side who are notyeahi agree there needs to be regulations on where it can be done inside your own apartment should not be one of these places treat it like tobacco smoking
canada,not_removed,if youre a non smoker and dont like it its suffocating and offensive if you smoke or like the smell your more like mmmmm as a farm kid the smell of manure is whatever to me but some people lose their shit over it
canada,not_removed,juicing cannabis leaves will improve your performance you ought to try it you wont get high
canada,not_removed,im sure some of those times you are smelling skunk skunks dislike cyclists and attempt to spray them quite often
canada,not_removed,it should be treated in the same way as tobacco why single out mj you dont like the smell
canada,not_removed,the ever elusive preannouncement announcement announcement
canada,not_removed,that sounds ambitious
canada,not_removed,key word feasibility in other words wont happen but thanks for voting for me
canada,not_removed,but in the interim it will be decriminalized and only fines will be issued to people who use it in undesignated areas much like we do with alcohol please please please
canada,not_removed,nailed it
canada,not_removed,you mean theyll block it i mean they will give it the most serious and urgent consideration and insist on a thorough and rigorous examination of all the proposals allied to a detailed feasibility study and budget analysis before producing a consultative document for consideration by all interested bodies and seeking comments and recommendations to be included in a brief for a series of working parties who will produce individual studies which will provide the background for a more wideranging document considering whether or not the proposal should be taken forward to the next stage you mean theyll block it yeah
canada,not_removed,so close to reality that i actually went to cbc to see if the press conference had already happened
canada,not_removed,does every canadian have thier fucked in the ass punch card get ready folks punch out one hole when nothing gets done with legalization and punch out a second when nothing is done with first past the post get a free timmys doughnut
canada,not_removed,hope instead theyre as high as fuck and start banging on about chem trails
canada,not_removed,ill move to the fucking states
canada,not_removed,as soon as i saw this comment the reality distortion field wore off haha
canada,not_removed,funding research dont go crazy now
canada,not_removed,and then they milk it for another election cycle
canada,not_removed,you were close justice minister jody wilsonraybould and health minister jane philpott announced today the launch of a task force to advise the government on how best to move forward with its plan to legalize marijuana
canada,not_removed,bingo
canada,not_removed,youre boring
canada,not_removed,announces new collaborative afghancanadian hashish quality testing initiative
canada,not_removed,let me guess former municipal police chief provincial police chief and a token doctor to support their policing points
canada,not_removed,i thought they already were isnt bill blair in charge of the file
canada,not_removed,looks like you win
canada,not_removed,id like to hear them announce that commercial legalization for medical use is being fasttracked set food qualitysupply chain managementqctestinglabelling regulations and let them go to town with developing strains that can be proven to best benefit medical users id also like to hear them announce legalization for personal amounts grown stored and carried costco in the legalized us states sells growtents so many people would try out their green thumb that it would decimate the criminal element of the chain i expect well hear something mealymouthed instead i can not imagine that well hear anything that is actually an indication that theres real measurable progress on the issue
canada,not_removed,small possession charges on past records to be expunged legal systems usually dont remove past legal records their argument being you still committed a crime while it was illegal
canada,not_removed,replace the word small with all and i agree
canada,not_removed,i think once the legalization occurs that appeals can start to happen i mean i hope
canada,not_removed,are you sure youre not high right now
canada,not_removed,kind of reminds mod people i see bitching about the dispensary in to that got shut down like they were selling weed that is illegal whether or not it should be is not relevant to shutting down the business p
canada,not_removed,why did they call it marihuana to begin with
canada,not_removed,good catch
canada,not_removed,maybe one day theyll actually call it by its real namecannabis
canada,not_removed,so we can put our own monopolies in place just in time for legalization
canada,not_removed,contains httpswwwgooglecomsearchqmxpnlcom javascript code what are they gathering ip address information for and what else is that code monitoring after the broadcast
canada,not_removed,ya from a few minutes it looks to be more of the same we are pleased to announce we are taking the first steps to enact legislation with an unknown arrival date but remind everyone that we will be enforcing current laws to their maximum in the interim
canada,not_removed,the cbc livestream is much better than the terrible periscope
canada,not_removed,they can say they wont allow it but i mean really whos gonna care when its legal
canada,not_removed,that was gold and probably what most of us wanted to say
canada,not_removed,that would be a death sentence for the libs
canada,not_removed,somebody should make a website where the center is this quote but who its quoting is randomly chosen from a huge group of politicians who can all be linked back to broken promises
canada,not_removed,philpot wouldnt do us wrong
canada,not_removed,but why you no trusty the justy can you somehow not feel deep inside your uhh whatever that he really is truly the one
canada,not_removed,just in time for canada post to go on strike
canada,not_removed,probably wont come in time to save httpwwwsouthcoasttodaycacontentnovascotiamedicalpotprojecthitsdeadend though
canada,not_removed,totally agreed the bs is unbearable to the younger generation however that kind of bs is important to sway the parents views on marijuana who are specifically worried about their kids getting it and in turn think it should be illegal
canada,not_removed,i dont know about the rest of canada but the crowd here in vancouver has also taken canada day over and call it cannabis day they probably want to preempt any possible media attention this gets even if its just rhetoric im thinking its just a were doing stuff really guys look were even talking about it
canada,not_removed,well isnt obama in town imagine a joint heheh announcement that both countries are fast tracking legalization everyone would forget about that whole brexit shit
canada,not_removed,they just sold the us all the rights to the great lakes the cn tower and whistler mountain for so did you hear about that weed announcement
canada,not_removed,if we had the chance to cut spending by millions add billions in revenue stopping funding to big drug cartels who do unspeakable things and most importantly to stop innocent canadians from going to jail for something less harmful than alcohol you dont consider that important i mean sure election reform blah blah blah think about our economy thousands out of work suddenly new infrastructure is needed and thousands of jobs will open in the industry best of all there isnt a location it needs to be like with oil so they can open these facilities anywhere in canada and give communities without much else a huge boost to their economy
canada,not_removed,it isnt that big of a deal but it does affect a lot of peoples day to day
canada,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing
canada,not_removed,an announcement of a press conference from the looks of it
canada,not_removed,yo dawg i heard you like announcements so weve made an announcement to announce an announcement where were going to announce another announcement
canada,not_removed,got to have some way of letting the press know about media events
canada,not_removed,they just announced public consultation groups that will help form the laws this is big to me personally didnt expect it
canada,not_removed,damn it i was gonna say this they probably had a laughing fit discussing the announcement and decided to go get some taco bell instead
canada,not_removed,they were all right though
canada,not_removed,because its rcanada here we spitball strong opinions based on half information and get outraged for no reason i just read the articles and avoid the comments most of the time
canada,not_removed,that makes sense ive already gotten the email from rogers apparently theyre rather concerned about how im going to get their monthly bill during the strike too its going to be a complete pain in the butt for all parties involved id expect
canada,not_removed,enjoy your canada day but dont enjoy it too much
canada,not_removed,read the top comments on the thread they pretty much nailed it hours in advance
canada,not_removed,youre allowed to brew your own booze and grow your own tobacco
canada,not_removed,i missed this interview what was the answer on growing your own did they say outright no or was it a dance around the issue
canada,not_removed,first i wanna say i agree that trudeau has not been all that great second schools are covered by provincial government so blame your local mpp third the gender change to the anthem was a dying mans last wish who also happens to be my mp and neighbour so show a little empathy and respect how in the fuck does changing one word cost the taxpayer millions lol if you feel the country is going to shit so badly why dont you try running in the next election and actually change something
canada,not_removed,explain how closing schools costs tax dollars explain how a vote to change our gender exclusive national anthem costs tax dollars
canada,not_removed,not really
canada,not_removed,glad i have your vote in
canada,not_removed,what kind of bread is it on
canada,not_removed,i mean there are designated locations for the consumption of boxes alcohol that arent your home ie the bar also people drunk when theyre camping and such and i gotta tell you as a person who doesnt drink i definitely dont appreciate that however a nice mid camp toke cant beat that
canada,not_removed,cgc for the long haul
canada,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of minutes what was the announcement to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
canada,not_removed,canada one step closer to costly and ineffective consultation task force more money down the pisshole theyll come back in a few months with some mealymouthed shit about how they just couldnt come to a consensus on how to safely deliver blah blah muh children muh public safety muh treaties muh current year
canada,not_removed,actual potheads would waste less time
canada,not_removed,speak for yourself
canada,not_removed,nope i want legalization i want it taxed like smokes and booze i want to be able to buy a few brownies and some cbd oil get a bottle of cabernet and a cigar from the grownup store because im a grownup
canada,not_removed,care to elaborate on why you think you know what everyone wants
canada,not_removed,legalization forces the biker and mob gangs to go legit — like the rumrunning seagrams and walker families did back in the day decriminalization does not
canada,not_removed,pretty sure i want legalization
canada,not_removed,yeah why on earth would canada want to open up billions of dollars of economic activity when our economy is slowing down thats just crazy talk
canada,not_removed,countries with a hard line on drug control work infinitely better than sanctioning criminals and drug addicts selling their meme as significant every will that is literally the opposite of everything we actually know to be true based on all of the available evidence its astounding how wrong you are
canada,not_removed,httpswwwperiscopetvhealthcanada
canada,not_removed,you mean thx wynne its only banned in ontario by the liberals
canada,not_removed,making a come back just the flavored will remain illegal
canada,not_removed,i dont know why anyone would want to fuck up their weed buy adding tobacco to it all that gets you is shitty tasting weed and an addiction to nicotine ps anyone who says they are addicted to weed probably smokes blunts
canada,not_removed,obamajuana obonga sir tokesalot i almost dont want to know what it really was this is fun
canada,not_removed,kid
canada,not_removed,too baked for redditing at a are you literally floating when you hit a
canada,not_removed,you got it
canada,not_removed,i smoke pot but i dont know what summer solstice has to do with anything
canada,not_removed,so hot and dusty this year i actually only smelled it once good for sore muscles
canada,not_removed,statistically i am probably one of these cases as well
canada,not_removed,well it is moss park not the most family friendly park in the gta maybe the least family friendly park in the world
canada,not_removed,vape eat other
canada,not_removed,nor will your local grower and weed shop ever be legal it will be legalized and the profits tightly controlled by big business through exclusive licenses that is simply not offered to small time sellersgrowers
canada,not_removed,very true also if its legalized people will be able to smoke in their own homes or backyards worry free and thus not be as inclined to smoke in pubilc
canada,not_removed,ive smoked pot for decades and come from a really rural area guaranteed i can tell them apart
canada,not_removed,he didnt appear to be complaining about it
canada,not_removed,no hes saying the opposite
canada,not_removed,you might need to reread what i wrote
canada,not_removed,oh the sweet sweet anticipation of the preannouncement announcement
canada,not_removed,wont happen but thanks for voting for me more like well push it too the very end of my term so youre happy when im running again
canada,not_removed,you must have brain damage if you think hes not gonna do it would be political suicide for him and his party
canada,not_removed,you just have to look at how assisted dying went through to see how much political red tap marijuana legalization will have to go through decriminialization was the sensible transition
canada,not_removed,it definitely will he needs the tax revenue to balance his budgets his budget plan has the mj taxes built into it if he wants to stay in office for a second term he will need to legalize and tax it his job literally depends on it
canada,not_removed,i dont know why everyone is so fond of decriminalization fining potheads will just increase incentives for the police to be dicks if you live in a bigger city go look at its budget and see how much that city actually depends on fines for income
canada,not_removed,no that would be a bad thing if they decriminalize it legalization would take way longer or stall completely the pressure would be off because see we did things better to wait a bit longer and do it all in one fell swoop rather than go half way and then possibly never finish
canada,not_removed,theyve already stated pretty clearly that thats not going to happen
canada,not_removed,decrim is very boring we will not notice a difference day to day
canada,not_removed,yes minister
canada,not_removed,punch out third hole when you realize timmies discontinued your favourite doughnut in favor of shitty chicken burgers sigh
canada,not_removed,lets give the npd a majotity gov next time
canada,not_removed,yeah we can always dream and hope but when it comes right down to it i have very little faith in governments of the world to do the right thing the politics game and the way its played makes for poor decisions or just a lack of any action taken whatsoever
canada,not_removed,im also correct
canada,not_removed,you mean they are going to make it official i see all that yummy mazar i sharif hashish and a gram is much too expensive
canada,not_removed,you know trudeau smokes right he says it was only while he was an mp and earlier but yeah right he isnt antipot
canada,not_removed,so many people would try out their green thumb for one or two crops tops and then theyd be right back at their dealers again once they realise how much work it actually is and how long it really takes its not for everyone and the majority of people are lazy
canada,not_removed,i suffer from a neurogenic bladder and cbd works wonders for as needed pain relief of the claret bladder spasms my urologist took me off other meds because the side effects werent worth the miniscule benefit once medical usage is properly regulated itll be easier to get cbd pills
canada,not_removed,i fear itll be the opposite
canada,not_removed,id like to hear them announce that commercial legalization for medical use is being fasttracked canada has had a medical cannabis program since and a regulated commercial medical program since what do you mean
canada,not_removed,hahahaha justice was on your side but the law the law was against you
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,finally someone makes sense
canada,not_removed,to make it sound mexican and rapey
canada,not_removed,because dirty mexicans will take your precious white daughters seriously thats how the marihuana spelling began it was a political dog whistle it continued because it became embedded in the drug war and hey the dog whistle aspect doesnt hurt especially when the dea is tramping around south america
canada,not_removed,because cannabis is too difficult to say
canada,not_removed,because it was during harpers regime and thats the way that the american government spells it
canada,not_removed,i wish i really detest that stupid m word
canada,not_removed,isnt provincial going to be deciding that
canada,not_removed,yes this is a logical step and should surprise no one how many moonshine stills do we allow the point is the government wants to tax everything which requires a monopoly
canada,not_removed,maybe they just want to know who is watching it on computer and who watches it on mobile
canada,not_removed,its just mixpanel analytics code from periscope you can block it easily
canada,not_removed,note that is a periscope thing not a canadian government thing
canada,not_removed,link
canada,not_removed,cops
canada,not_removed,exactly of course growing plants in your basement might get you in some legal trouble but plants in your home wont
canada,not_removed,shit someone whos making sense and calling us out shut it all down were done here
canada,not_removed,bull shit it would the liberals have a long and colorful history of being reelected after years of blatant lies
canada,not_removed,no it wouldnt the liberals coasted to victory by appealing to smalll liberal baby boomers who soaked their panties at the thought of another trudeau in the pmo the potheads who voted for them are a drop in the bucket and wont matter one bit next time around
canada,not_removed,nah man everyone is already smitten by trudeau and we havent given him shit for rushing throught that assited dying bill theyre going to be fine pot legalization is not as big an issue as some people imagine
canada,not_removed,i know it seems like it when everyone you know is a giant pothead but the average canadian doesnt give a shit about this issue
canada,not_removed,was that sarcasm they uh sound like scammers why would we care if they were saved
canada,not_removed,totally agreed the bs is unbearable to the younger generation its totally unbearable to the boomer generation as well you know at my age i need some pain relief and finding a genuine doctor who actually will prescribe cannabis is all but fucking impossible
canada,not_removed,this it is important to reassure the generations who were subjected to reffer madness madness that there is a professional approach being taking to getting this done the comments here seem like a bunch of butthurt folks mad cause they didnt drop the mic and just give candy to the kids
canada,not_removed,by grabnars hammer i believe youve nailed it
canada,not_removed,oh thats a good one heads would asplode in the usa
canada,not_removed,obama left yesterday
canada,not_removed,marc bergevin isnt in charge of those negotiations
canada,not_removed,medicine is not taxed in canada charging the tax on medical cannabis puts an unfair burden on very sick people
canada,not_removed,you arent wrong but youre missing his point which is important if this is a sleight of hand where else should we be looking
canada,not_removed,this is big to me personally seriously sorry but ive been down this exact same road before this is just another httpsenwikipediaorgwikiledaincommissionofinquiryintothenonmedicaluseofdrugs being launched and nothing more its results will be ignored in exactly the same manner that his father did it was an election ploy period
canada,not_removed,total dance around guy called in and asked that exact question and was basically told ask us again in a couple weeks
canada,not_removed,that burned me bad wynne will screw us over with mj for sure
canada,not_removed,scab
canada,not_removed,i gotta tell you as a person who doesnt drink melvin c thudpucker does not drink anymore now wtf
canada,not_removed,for fuck sakes there are already vape bars in canada where you and your friends can sit down get stoned as hell in the middle of toronto with weed paraphernalia on sale at the front nobody cards you or ask what youve brought its just that you have to keep to your own stash also its really easy to tell where your able to smoke theres already no smoking signs everywhere and portable vapes remove the majority of the smell and longevity ive walked through the streets of montreal as if it was already legal we have a dont ask dont tell policy across most of the country but i have heard that if you are of colour you get asked a lot
canada,not_removed,they already do
canada,not_removed,strata bylaws are your friend
canada,not_removed,never hold just one stock
canada,not_removed,truth upvoted accordingly
canada,not_removed,is actually the best time of the day
canada,not_removed,we dont do grownup in canada beer on the beach ffs man youll get drunk and become a fishraping maniac
canada,not_removed,so those things dont exist without provincial oversight sounds like opposite day in your world but on a lighter note whos a big boy yes you are
canada,not_removed,decriminalization no lawsno taxes legalization heavy regulationstaxes the amount raised by tax will not be near what colorado or washington in the states makes a better comparison would be alaska where it had been decriminalized since the for oz carry or mature plants at home basically an impossible unit of measure last year they legalized it and none has yet to be sold no taxes have been raised and weed is harder to find
canada,not_removed,alaska had of those issues pretty sure the mafia isnt going hard over weed
canada,not_removed,i dont believe that more work will be done only more pot grown and marijuana inducing people to work less
canada,not_removed,singapore demonstrably works a clean civil service a wellfunded state strong police presence very easily accomplished within a first world country
canada,not_removed,confirmed that its a task force announcement
canada,not_removed,you mean thanks harper bill made it illegal to import manufacture or sell blunt wraps in canada among other tobacco related things
canada,not_removed,alberta too sorry i used to love the wraps but then they got taken away that was a couple of years ago actually conservatard bastards
canada,not_removed,banned by the conservatives
canada,not_removed,huh blunts are awesome
canada,not_removed,weed is psychologically and somewhat physycally addictive i need to quit up to a week before i stop craving it during that week i cant sleep well have a hard time eating and things are more boring
canada,not_removed,come on man i was a solid last night
canada,not_removed,its the name of the race he was at
canada,not_removed,im still getting all the dirt out of everything i own
canada,not_removed,realistically i might know what youre talking about for some its performance enhancing
canada,not_removed,moss loves it
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,illegal illegal and also illegal its not how you consume it that makes it illegal youre gonna vape in public youll be fined in public
canada,not_removed,well then ill just delete my comment
canada,not_removed,if youre not acting like a tard i dont see why it should be illegal similarly with alcohol public intoxication should only be if youre being an idiot or like falling over
canada,not_removed,because normalizing the idea of responsible drinking isnt a bad thing
canada,not_removed,end of my term so youre happy when im running again lol even that is unlikely i see him saying give me a few more months and ill get it pushed through as the campaigning is going on
canada,not_removed,given that theyve already stated that theyre going to get legislation out by the end of spring next year that would really be giving ammunition to the opposition to delay it until after the next election do you really thing that the government thinks delaying on enacting promised legislation will earn them votes
canada,not_removed,wouldnt be the first time the liberals got voted back in after telling the country years of lies
canada,not_removed,source
canada,not_removed,actually no the costing does absolutely not take pot into account
canada,not_removed,but they will only be able to fine people smoking outside of designated areas the same way they do with alcohol personally ill take a ticket over a lifetime criminal record not to mention all the wasted time and money in court any day
canada,not_removed,the pressure would be off because see we did things but they wouldnt be getting boatfaceloads of money if they stop at decriminalization
canada,not_removed,minorities still get sent to jail regularly for possession and toronto dispensaries have been getting raided like crazy over the past weeks you might not notice a difference but they definitely will
canada,not_removed,bingo
canada,not_removed,i used my last punch card when they switched to heating up frozen donuts
canada,not_removed,weve already tried that once before i say we just go bat shit insane and give the old green party a try i know the rest of the worlds governments will look at us like were off our meds but we have little enough people and a large enough space to fuck shit up
canada,not_removed,whatve you got
canada,not_removed,nothing im white
canada,not_removed,move to mexico
canada,not_removed,why do you think the private marijuana industry flourished in bc they just need to do what they said and cut the red tape i really hope trudeau is not going to drag his feet here but honestly where i live its like its already happened no one cares its still federally illegal
canada,not_removed,no but he is very promonopoly control of the drug this is why so many lps are either funded by friends of the government or former authorities like police chiefs etc im glad its finally going to be legalized but if there isnt a home grow option like with beer and wine theres going to be more protests and more expensive wasteful lawsuits that the public get to pay for
canada,not_removed,theres a reason why homebrewing is for hobbyist geeks and driven alcoholics
canada,not_removed,it also stinks unless you are very diligent
canada,not_removed,you say this but it will spawn an industry of do it yourself packs tons of pre made environments for growing individually planned plants are sprouting over crowdfunding sites already im sure somebody would make the jump
canada,not_removed,but theyre not going to go back to a dealer theyre going to get supply from a friend and probably for free like zucchini plums or homebrewed beer
canada,not_removed,bro one crop will last you a long time
canada,not_removed,its still a bitch to get a scrip from your regular family doctor the regulations are all fuzzed up such that no ones really sure whats legal or how to track it and were still not taking a scientific approach to developing it as an effective medicine
canada,not_removed,id say thats from state v federal level disagreement the federal crime was circumvented by the state but is still in place at the federal level in canada i think it will be different
canada,not_removed,it doesnt make sense to continue to punish someone for breaking a law everyone agrees was unjust breaking unjust laws is how society improves those who help society improve should be exonerated after the fact otherwise were just making improvements that much harder
canada,not_removed,i thought even marijuana with a j served that purpose and is slang
canada,not_removed,not my precious white daughters i need them for business deals and political leverage
canada,not_removed,its often spelled with a g in spanish
canada,not_removed,hard to say ethanol is taxed federally and provincially but distribution is regulated provincially
canada,not_removed,how many people have gone blind or died from improperly grown cannabis
canada,not_removed,none but how many homebrew beer and wine makers are out there
canada,not_removed,that step was already implemented by the harper government for medicinal uses
canada,not_removed,for what purpose marketing or other if its only a computer then all that theyve got is your ip address and hence your location but if its a phone instead then theyve got a bit more than that
canada,not_removed,you can block it easily is httpsnoscriptnet available on phone browsers too
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,the law is the law until its changed
canada,not_removed,not with this lie the millennials will execute you in the polls look what they have created httpswwwtrudeaumetreca
canada,not_removed,so like every other party then
canada,not_removed,umm idk i think it would be different i think it was a pretty big one issue voter thing honestly im liberal but fuck it give me less taxes if you arent gunna legalize ¯ツ¯
canada,not_removed,its the pro evidence anti criminalization of normal behaviour types he has to worry about not the potheads there are way more of us than there are potheads
canada,not_removed,i dont even think it goes that far they coasted to victory because the conservatives have gone absolutely batshit and the ndp royally fucked the dog during election season in a year ive gone from being an ndp voter to being unable to envision a future where i vote for them
canada,not_removed,they should though considering all the tax money generated and money saved punishing pot related crimes
canada,not_removed,they should i dont touch the stuff but i think it is fucked up that we are jailing people for it
canada,not_removed,oh course they do it effects every canadian and they know it it is a drain on our society the most destructive element of an age long gone everyone knows the americas war on drugs was a scam everyone
canada,not_removed,i know it seems like it when everyone you know is a giant pothead but the average canadian doesnt give a shit about this issue i know it seems like it when everyone you know is a short sighted jackass but the average canadian doesnt want their tax dollars wasted and harmless people jailed
canada,not_removed,its atlantic canada people in that area who need jobs may care a bit edit and why exactly was harper visiting them anyway plus whats with the google blindness too go to google maps and try looking for vida cannabis stellarton ns to see what i mean whats up with that i wonder
canada,not_removed,come on im not asking for a drop the mic and give candy to the kids in any way whatsoever id like to see some new information come out if youre going to hold a press conference instead of their constant save the children tight controls droning bureaucratspeak
canada,not_removed,it is important to reassure the generations who were subjected to reffer madness its not a generational thing its a motherswithchildren thing havent you ever been nagged by a wife yet
canada,not_removed,its grabthars you fucking pleb
canada,not_removed,stop
canada,not_removed,too soon bro i aint ready yet
canada,not_removed,im talking about recreation use it will be taxed like cigs like booze like everything else
canada,not_removed,tpp
canada,not_removed,yeah my brain doesnt work like that i dont do everything my dad does and neither does trudeau i think public consultation groups are a great way to approach it and im not going to assume it isnt before it happens because of something that happened fucking years ago jesus
canada,not_removed,how does one assume what happened years ago will happen again shouldnt we consider that given the progression and understanding of cannabis that we wont suffer the same problems as the past
canada,not_removed,or maybe they combined the amigos summit with a taco bell run it it fits in an odd sort of international integration sort of way
canada,not_removed,fuck sakes i hope they understand that if they dont allow for small personal production theyll just keep throwing innocent people in jail
canada,not_removed,they did a bit of a dance didnt come out and say outright no but they said marijuana is not a benign substance and they would be putting tight controls on production and distribution the keep it out of the hands of children and organized crime reading between the lines it isnt difficult to conclude there will not be provisions for growing your own
canada,not_removed,pm
canada,not_removed,one time
canada,not_removed,that is absolutely not what decriminalization means youre misinformed potatoes are legalized would you call them heavily taxed regulated parking violations arent criminalized would you say there are no laws for parking incorrectly
canada,not_removed,youre full of shit boy
canada,not_removed,i want colorado style system
canada,not_removed,hells angels are
canada,not_removed,people who want to smoke weed already are smoking weed
canada,not_removed,so the platypus has stopped drinking and now the plankbo is against smoking too what the hell does xep have to say about all this
canada,not_removed,hahaha this guy
canada,not_removed,haha wow and people actually believe this
canada,not_removed,singapore is a dictatorship
canada,not_removed,but the post i read on facebook said it was the liberals fault and we know those evil liberals are out to ruin this country be gone vile man be gone
canada,not_removed,no we have to dog pile on trudeau now its baby justins fault
canada,not_removed,which i take it that no headshop fallows or self respecting police officer enforces you know considering that mulroney made bongs illegal and i can still walk down the street and find no shortage of them
canada,not_removed,you can still buy them in halifax they sell them as cigars but you can pull the outer wrap off for a blunt and you have tobacco for some clip if thats what you like
canada,not_removed,only banned candy flavored tobacco and wrap products because they were primarily targeted at youth an unflavored or not candy flavored blunt wrap was in no way targeted or made illegal and most retailers simply ignored it regardless ontario introduced more extensive legislation about candy flavored products in and because the province actually enforces tobacco laws at the retail level retailers finally paid heed
canada,not_removed,as a customs broker i can tell you thats wrong i would consult your dmemorandum for the regulation of tobacco based products a blunt wrap is literally just a cigar leaf and are legal in ontario flavoured wraps are banned you can still buy the zig zag sloburn ones century sams etc but most of those come from the dominican and etc what typically happens is we export tobacco from tillsonburg and send it georgia the state where they sell a lot of wraps post processing of the goods to make them into cigars and we bring them back sorry for run on sentences etc first thing i woke up i wrote this
canada,not_removed,thanks but no thanks im blaming wynne far and away the worst leader of anything in any developed country
canada,not_removed,they are my absolute favourite papers as well but in a large quantity works out to less than a booklet so its not a bad deal you can sell some to your friends if you find its too many everyone seems to love them
canada,not_removed,to each their own i suppose i know that in some places in europe they roll gigantic joints that are like tobacco which i think is ridiculous and cant see the logic why not just do a hit off a pipebong and then smoke a cigarette if you want nicotine instead of messing up the taste of your weed with tobacco
canada,not_removed,i guess it effects people differently ive personally smoked on and off for decades and am currently days into a dry spell after months of daily use and for me its about as addictive as anything else i enjoy like listening to music or riding my bike etc if i dont do those things for a while i think about doing them because i enjoy it and miss doing it but i dont get any physical side effects like i do if i stop drinking coffee or when i quit smoking cigarettes
canada,not_removed,lol i thought it was something the kids these days are into smoking herb on summer solstice sounded weird but who am i to judge
canada,not_removed,i think it will be a month until its out of my lungs
canada,not_removed,it performance enchances my snack eating skills
canada,not_removed,easy there tiger no jaywalking for you either pick up that can
canada,not_removed,yup there should be an asshole rule why my wife and i cant have a glass of wine at the beach while sharing a picnic lunch is beyond me dont get me wrong we are scofflaws and still have a glass of wine but we shouldnt have to be sneaky about it
canada,not_removed,what a way to piss off young voters the liberals have done this in the past too
canada,not_removed,given that theyve already stated that theyre going to get legislation out by the end of spring next year that would really be giving ammunition to the opposition to delay it until after the next election do you really thing that the government thinks delaying on enacting promised legislation will earn them votes
canada,not_removed,but theyve already started laying out timelines for it its not like theyve done nothing to move forward this is happening nothing would bring out the younger generation to vote quite like him fucking this
canada,not_removed,youre missing my point fines are an incentive to increase enforcement not decrease it
canada,not_removed,upvote for correct use of boatfaceloads
canada,not_removed,i thought ppl were saying that minorities were charged more but not actually given jail time i mean im all for decrim in the short term if it doesnt delay legalization but im just not too hyped up for it
canada,not_removed,love that show
canada,not_removed,weve already tried that once before when canada has never yet had an ndp federal government and it would be incredibly foolish to play fuck shit up with the tenthlargest economy on the planet too in my opinion
canada,not_removed,i really cant imagine they could criminalize growing a legal product at home for your own use they could try but the court would strike that for sure on the other hand could your municipality have a bylaw banning it absolutely
canada,not_removed,yeah if he does that there will be court appeals for sure
canada,not_removed,and also why almost noone grows their own tobacco even though that is legal in canada
canada,not_removed,which one does that make me
canada,not_removed,yes there is that
canada,not_removed,it doesnt really stink unless youre doing it wrong or growing a lot your plants shouldnt really be stressed except for the hour or so after the lights cycle during flower
canada,not_removed,you say this but it will spawn an industry of do it yourself packs yes it will and they will sell like hotcakes i know that but the buyers will still only grow one or two crops at most though do you remember the same deal they sold like hotcakes and theyre still selling to this day in fact but do you really know anyone who actually uses them ditto for the how many of those are rotting away in garages attics and basements now disused for years most of them id wager but the company is still making and selling them all the same though and the same type of people are still buying them using them for one or two crops and then putting them up for sale on kijiji or whatever yes people will make the jump as you say but they wont actually stick with it because they are lazy once their curiosity has been satisfied and its down to the regular work part they quit for that is human nature but there is certainly a bright future for you in making and elling those kits all the same though
canada,not_removed,i mostly buy my zucchinis plums and beer
canada,not_removed,realistically take your usual rate of consumption per week and then multiply that by the growing period for your favourite strain along with the typical yield per plant for example i favour a sativa that has a growing period of sixteen weeks from seedling to bud and one plant per httpwwwspacebucketscom typically produces about one ounce at harvest i currently smoke about one ounce per every two weeks so in order to maintain that rate of consumption i would then need eight buckets with no crop failures whatsoever so realistically about ten buckets instead then there thats a bit more accurate than a long time now isnt it
canada,not_removed,a state government cant remove federal charges theyre talking about expunging people who were charged under state laws that no longer exist for something like marijuana it makes complete sense theyre acknowledging that the laws werent just
canada,not_removed,the law is the law if it was broken when it was illegal and later made legal the punishment should stand because it was against the law at the time the crime was committed
canada,not_removed,yeah that was the idea the h in place of the j just took it one step further
canada,not_removed,never seen it spelled with a g in spanish
canada,not_removed,all of them too many marijuanas
canada,not_removed,all websites always needs your ip address thats how it knows where to send the data as for the other stuff one standard reason is to know what they should focus their development and testing on if your site is getting a lot of visitors from one type of phone you should make sure you test it out on that phone often to make sure it fits on the screen everything loads properly the touchscreen stuff works etc
canada,not_removed,focus by firefox for the ios not sure about android
canada,not_removed,live event is over and unlike periscope it wont replay did anyone upload the cbc version to youtube yet
canada,not_removed,and the law states that six plants is the felony two for personal isnt a problem
canada,not_removed,funny how that works eh
canada,not_removed,i dont know harper did most of what he said he would do its just that most of those things were not good
canada,not_removed,youre assuming the canadian public employs reason when an issue approaches anything beyond their immediate concerns dont do that
canada,not_removed,okay sure but you think it would be a death sentence for the libs if they didnt come through on this again the average canadian doesnt care that much to think otherwise is to give your pet interest a ridiculous sense of importance
canada,not_removed,sure okay but the liberals arent going to lose an election over this
canada,not_removed,thats a nice sentiment but you think the liberals would lose an election over it
canada,not_removed,sure right but is this issue going to destroy the liberal party no
canada,not_removed,my wife listens to me and mothers with children or helicopter parents really need to take a back seat im sure this task force will ease their minds and if not they have mothers little helper to smooth them
canada,not_removed,by grabthars hammer what a savings
canada,not_removed,you shall be revenged
canada,not_removed,so it is comic book man so it is i bow to your great neckbeard
canada,not_removed,wow that must sting a little
canada,not_removed,a lot of people dont see the difference currently patients have been ordered to pay gst on cannabis thats a lot for low income seniors and disabled people
canada,not_removed,deleted
canada,not_removed,it was nothing more than an election ploy to grab the youth vote period simply because a majority of people were gullible enough to actually fall for it doesnt make it any less real
canada,not_removed,whos going to get caught with a small personal production with proper growing techniques you should be able to make plants turn over several ounces in three months no reason a person needs to have a garage of plants thats not personal
canada,not_removed,and you seriously think that they actually care about that all that they really give a damn about is their optics people in jail are only statistics to them oh and we can all kiss the canadian mailorder seed businesses goodbye soon too most likely
canada,not_removed,like cigarettes
canada,not_removed,most people are usually still at work
canada,not_removed,youre right my direct historical evidence makes me misinformed potatoes and parking violations obviously are great examples of why i and the citizens of alaska washington colorado and oregon are wrong
canada,not_removed,about which point
canada,not_removed,which provinces have a similar tax base
canada,not_removed,fucking where weed isnt even on their radar if theyre selling it its because theyre doing it wrong my seller is the grower as is the case for most adult smokers
canada,not_removed,factually wrong
canada,not_removed,the ontario liberals are pretty terrible by any metric left or right
canada,not_removed,take a selfie on your way out s edit i was meaning this to be sarcastic reddit
canada,not_removed,the ontario liberals have positively nothing to do with trudeau
canada,not_removed,so why are bc and ontario currently leading the entire country for jobs and employment then even though they both have very unpopular female premiers after two years of getting absolutely nothing in alberta i moved to ontario and have already worked at three jobs since explain please
canada,not_removed,no kidding damn they are good thanks
canada,not_removed,why does it say format audio cd
canada,not_removed,have you ever tried blunt wraps just the wrap has nicotine in it if any no one is talking about adding tobacco to the blunt
canada,not_removed,same here i pictured them building a recreation of stonehenge and getting really high and naked and dancing around it
canada,not_removed,yes they should germany and france have legal public drinking and they dont seem to have many issues with it
canada,not_removed,the smell is subjective as are a countries imposition of liquor law just because north americans have laws to prevent drinking in public does not mean all do many countries allow you to drink in public unless you are causing trouble or breaking laws and guess what the children and those passing by dont melt the children dont grow up scarred for life and only the most narsassistic and self absorbed make a fuss about how the someone cracking a beer in the park is negatively impacting their life north america has a really unhealthy relationship with alcohol that causes a lot of problems dont pretend like your shitty beliefs that deny other people what they would do when coicidently all your beliefs completely line up with the law right should be forced on everyone else
canada,not_removed,this guy hates fun edit let me elaborate holy shit why the fawk should i not go down to the river bank and have a beer on a hot day no one is saying go to your kids soccer game with a cooler of beer and bag of pot theres no riots happening in japan because people can walk around with a beer theres no riots in portugal because drugs have been decriminalized i would really like to have a beer on a hill watching the sunset with you
canada,not_removed,in quebec you can drink in parks or beaches or whatever as long as its not glass bottles and you are not being disruptful
canada,not_removed,can we have one party that isnt full of shit or completely ignores reality
canada,not_removed,vote bait
canada,not_removed,the opposition bwahahaaahhaaaaaaaa jt can do whatever he wants at this point mulcairs credibility is shot after the campaign and elbowgate and rona ambrose every time i hear her speak i think gosh she sounds pretty theres no credible opposition at this point imo
canada,not_removed,do you really thing that the government thinks delaying on enacting promised legislation will earn them votes yes if they say its due to delays and legalization requires that they are voted in again
canada,not_removed,no i understood the point you were making the point i was trying to make is that they cant just give out fines randomly to people if you dont want a fine dont smoke a joint while walking down the street or in a busy park if people are discreet about it nobody will get fined much like it is with alcohol
canada,not_removed,all usage of boat must be replaced with boatface
canada,not_removed,even if they dont go to jail being charged isnt just an inconvenience even if they dont end up convicted which strictly legally speaking they should be they are still breaking the law thats a huge amount of stress and time lost to the process not to mention the secondary effects social stigma losing jobs etc given how many people are living paycheque to paycheque these days even a quick process where the charged get dropped could completely derail a persons life if they are convicted their life can be absolutely ruined between additional legal stuff for appeals probation costs even if the sentence is a relative slap on the wrist the worst part is that theyll always have to answer yes to the have you ever been convicted of a criminal offense question on job applications thats an automatic no hire for a lot of employers i want full legalization as soon as possible too but i think that immediate decriminalization will have a more important impact
canada,not_removed,wow til thanks
canada,not_removed,to be fair ive tried my hand at both very much at the hobby level and while weed is challenging tobacco is a bitch to get right
canada,not_removed,weed doesnt take months of curingfermentation to be smokeable and the fermentation process doesnt scale well to small quantities
canada,not_removed,its like making your own beer its fun if you like that kind of thing but most people just want a beer
canada,not_removed,we can use common sense when dealing with the law you dont always get a speeding ticket hell we even let people petition the court to expunge their records under special circumstances id say an unjust law is special circumstances do you think rosa parks should have been thrown in prison the founding fathers should have been killed for treason they are very different laws of course but the point is you dont usually keep punishing people for breaking unjust laws because then it discourages society from pointing out and fighting to fix other unjust laws having a criminal record is incredibly damaging to your potential for success in life
canada,not_removed,are acceptable they use them pretty interchangeably in mexico dont know about other places
canada,not_removed,care to explain httpwwwsitealyzernetenpsbremovecdnmxpnlcom then
canada,not_removed,the law states that plants or more gets you a mandatory minimum sentence it does not at all state that two plants for personal isnt a problem
canada,not_removed,exactly didnt someone once say that speaking to the average voter is the best argument against democracy
canada,not_removed,lol i never said that they do i said that they should please read before responding so aggressively
canada,not_removed,yeah i guess its cool that people go to jail for it lives get ruined over it jobs get lost over it etc right so are you saying you dont care about anything in this country unless it directly effects you
canada,not_removed,i never said i think that they do i said they should
canada,not_removed,sadly i suspect that is true hell at this point theyre pretty much unopposed
canada,not_removed,yup
canada,not_removed,fall for what our country is arugably more pro recreational use than many other nations there is an argument that in canada it is already legal in fact there are plenty of online shops that will have that shipped right to your door its a billion dollar industry that can help fill gaps in our economy but sure it was an election ploy to get the stoners out to vote
canada,not_removed,i agree but there will be cases where some poor bastard gets caught with two plants and some overzealous cops bust them to the full extent of the law mostly it will probably be like they do now cut the plants down and leave
canada,not_removed,thanks
canada,not_removed,the point thats behind the eyes and right between the ears boy
canada,not_removed,what does the tax base have to do with anything
canada,not_removed,youre clueless
canada,not_removed,its like youre allergic to being correct how would you define a single party state ruled by the same person for years without an election
canada,not_removed,i heard they sexd together
canada,not_removed,i agree but trudeau makes a point of appearing close to wynne which makes zero sense given shes one of the least popular leaders in canada
canada,not_removed,youre an idiot when did i ever mention bc or wynnes gender and you realize that ontario is the most indebted substate level government in the world right the woman is completely out of touch with reality on so many issues she has had zero to do with job creation here and you do realize that albertas in a recession right because of oil right so your lack of job opportunities in alberta is irrelevant and unsurprising
canada,not_removed,ive never tried blunt wraps but actual blunts are rolled with cigar leaves which are very high in nicotine content that is why you dont inhale cigar smoke enough nicotine is absorbed without having to inhale
canada,not_removed,i think we might be onto something here if the kids arent doing it yet we should think about starting it up this sounds awesome
canada,not_removed,people who dont smoke weed treat it like alcohol and dont realize how different it is i see no real problem with smoking weed in at a park or beach as long as you arent driving stoned limiting weed to your home just cause some people are afraid of it or dont like the smell is stupid imo it should be sold like alcohol and treated like tobacco
canada,not_removed,wine with a piknik in the park is pretty good too my girlfriend and i brought gasp sangria to the beach to have with our lunch it was terrible as soon as we opened it the beach immediately turned into something out of an apocalypse film
canada,not_removed,can we wait until it actually happens before talking shit
canada,not_removed,no that would make too much sense
canada,not_removed,sounds like a job for the dictatorship of the proletariat
canada,not_removed,wed probably call such a party racist
canada,not_removed,well the greens were the only ones who brought solid numbers and real facts to the table during the debates but dude weed lmao dude a drama teacher lmao dude hes hot lmao
canada,not_removed,i think you mean petty
canada,not_removed,the point i was trying to make is that they cant just give out fines randomly to people i dunno where you live in canada but around here there are a lot of pot smokers and those pot smokers are wearing decent clothes in montreal we have this thing called tam tams where thousands of people congregate in one park to get high and do crazy stuff while a bunch of people play drums so i can only suspect that if marijuana becomes decriminalized it will mean for montreal a lot more than drinking in public this will only encourage greater enforcement every sunday at the tams boom lots of money legalize it or leave it alone anything else will just be worse
canada,not_removed,get this opium poppies are legal to grow as long as you dont know what you can do with them somehow their legality changes based on whats inside your head edit httpmichaelpollancomarticlesarchiveopiummadeeasy the law on this one at least in the usa assuming thats pollans home turf is downright weird
canada,not_removed,also people dont smoke joints a day hi snoop dog
canada,not_removed,no half that still labor intensive if youre shooting for quality
canada,not_removed,and the fermentation process doesnt scale well to small quantities sure it does mason jars in a refrigerator open each jar for a few minutes each day then close it up and put it back in again takes less time than curing tobacco to be sure but the results are definitely worth the while yes i know that you can dry it as soon as you harvest but that product is considerably rougher when you smoke it though
canada,not_removed,the point is that if its illegal now and you get trouble and a criminal record because of it its still against the law when the crime was done retroactively expunging records is a waste of time and money
canada,not_removed,well whoever made that page is not explaining everything its probably coming from ads on the page that could be blocked by adblock i doubt its a browser hijacker either way i wouldnt download the fixer program because that is a much much bigger risk to your system and privacy to download random apps and its an additional red flag that whoever wrote it is not fully explaining what is going oneither youre getting something from a wellmeaning amateur or youre getting a trojan i would not take that risk
canada,not_removed,yeah churchill not exactly a good man to use as a role model especially when hes generalizing entire nations as idiots
canada,not_removed,what nice high horse youve got yourself up on for no reason im making one simple point the liberals would not be destroyed a death sentence for the libs if they reversed on pot nobody but stoners would care come election day and stoners dont make or break a government thank christ quite why youre going on about your pet insecurities is beyond me thats not really the discussion
canada,not_removed,look at all my fancy rhetoric and strawmen i bet you dont have an answer to me taking your words out of context do you
canada,not_removed,right thats nice but were not talking about that are we having two different conversations or something all i said is that the average voter will not give a shit about this issue during the next election the end whether they should or not isnt really the issue
canada,not_removed,in fact there are plenty of online shops that will have that shipped right to your door where show me actual links please
canada,not_removed,in those cases i would argue that the person didnt take to kindly to the cop cutting it down probably lied and created a scene and then they got the book thrown at them
canada,not_removed,um you weird fuck
canada,not_removed,the amount of money the province can make looking again at the states if there is a financial windfall colorado washington and oregon then it happened quickly and easily if there is a lower population and therefor less money to be had alaska then it has moved slowly and painfully alaska was the second state to legalize and you still cant purchase legally
canada,not_removed,im allergic to dust mites which you are correct to say is an accurate description for most of rliberalpartyofcanada lol he cant respond to this
canada,not_removed,they were making babies and i saw one of the babies and the baby looked at me
canada,not_removed,have you seen how hes acted towards tpp or even if he follows through on weed hes already ruined his trust with many voters the conservatives jump between shit and ignorance and the ndp seems to have their head in the sky albeit with good intentions usually
canada,not_removed,yeah how can you bribe someone not full of shit
canada,not_removed,because its
canada,not_removed,they are all petty theyre politicians i think he is insinuating that a pretty female politician is in place for optics not for their hardhitting political chops
canada,not_removed,i live in ontario and one of the first questions people usually ask when meeting someone is do you smoke in the sorts of events where there have been masses of people smoking pot like protests or outdoor concerts etc the cops usually look the other way as long as nobody is endangering the well being of others they dont bother people are constantly drinking alcohol out in public but most know to do so discreetly its only the few who make it obvious what theyre doing that end up with a fine i think the same would be true for weed
canada,not_removed,no its what you intend to do with them so if youre just growing them thats fine but if you start harvesting the latex which is an obvious and labor intensive process then youre manufacturing opium
canada,not_removed,thought crime is a real thing
canada,not_removed,i meant the tobacco fermentation process doesnt lend well to small quantities
canada,not_removed,the point is that if its illegal now so you would agree that rosa parks should have been put in prison the founding fathers of many countries should have been killed for treason and homosexuals in countries where homosexuality is punishable by death should be killed because the important thing is to enforce the law not to worry whether it is just or unjust just about every major improvement in our societys history has been done against the law at the time
canada,not_removed,im not taking any risk i do not run windows on my computers and i did not give noscript permission to run the mxpnlcom script the video however did play normally with that script blocked regardless thus indicating that the mxpnlcom script is not actually required for that page to function and if it is not required then what the hell is it really doing there its creators can go pound sand for all that i care
canada,not_removed,to be fair to winston his country just put on a hell of display of mass stupidity
canada,not_removed,yeah he only saved us from the nazis using basically his willpower alone but not a good role model gotcha
canada,not_removed,these guys sure are quick to get all indignant theyre church ladylike in their devotion to their cause reminds me a lot of the religious right and their reaction to abortion gay rights etc
canada,not_removed,nice try task force but if you cant use google then i cant help you
canada,not_removed,isnt it all relative though the proportion of money would be the same for any state or province if they implemented a colorado style system it just differs due to the different attitudes and political leanings in each state or province ontario for instance is larger than colorado but i doubt it will be as successful due to wynne already leaning towards over regulation and government monopoly
canada,not_removed,on tpp he said hes more or less in favour but hed take a look which hes doing on he said he supports part of the bill but would introduce oversight which hes doing and will amend the worst parts which he says he still plans to do so on both those he is doing exactly what the platform said why do you think it will be different with legalization which has been promised by april of next year
canada,not_removed,he cops usually look the other way as long as nobody is endangering the well being of others they dont bother they dont bother because there is no financial benefit decriminalization means that pot is an offense you can be fined for so you better believe cops are going to start enforcement a lot more they have ticket quotas to fill after all
canada,not_removed,rtfa
canada,not_removed,was she smoking pot at the front of the bus i think mind altering drugs and sitting at the front of a bus during the time where they were not allowed to sit at the front of a bus are completely different crimes pot is dangerous more dangerous than what rosa parks did all im saying is that if something is illegal and can cause harm to others the punishment should stand whether or not it was made legal the crime would have been done when it was illegal it is fairly well known the consequences of being caught smoking pot so if they were charged take it like an adult and fix the problem
canada,not_removed,thats exactly why that quote was on my mind didnt realize the guy who said it was from the uk
canada,not_removed,youre full of shit
canada,not_removed,true but ive noticed that the smaller the population the harder people have to push the government because theres fewer shekels to be had despite elected attitude i had read in an alaskan newspaper that the department of revenue basically didnt give a shit about weed tax because it wouldnt fill the budget shortfall weed legislation is fucking weird and id rather just grow it myself or buy from a grower that im familiar with
canada,not_removed,in cases like this its like hes the canadian obama people put their words in his mouth and think he supports their version of their agenda completely even if he only mentioned that he supports something somewhat similar hes a liberal party politician not a libertarian socialist of course he supports the tpp and parts of
canada,not_removed,are you saying it takes time to study complex issues and make appropriate changes preposterous
canada,not_removed,the tpp is signed and filed looking into it is code for letting the withdrawal deadline quietly pass
canada,not_removed,because his voters dont want those things to happen he said wed have a full debate on the topic but seems to have ignored voter input for he basically said we support it but just so harper doesnt make fun of us and we pinkey promise we dont really support it and changed his tune after hes basically been a let down and his real changes so far have been mostly unpopular
canada,not_removed,perhaps but how many people do you know who have been fined for drinking in public also that whole ticket quota thing is bullshit at least it is where i live according to the cops i know and if you ask people like my friend who was charged with possession less than half a gram of hash years ago they will tell you a fine is infinitely better than a lifetime criminal record that drastically reduces your eligibility for certain employment opportunities and any hopes of visiting the usa
canada,not_removed,the article in which both protagonists are cultivating opium poppies specifically for the purpose of consuming opium not to mention theyre in a different country with different laws
canada,not_removed,all im saying is that if something is illegal and can cause harm to others the punishment should stand whether or not it was made legal causes what harm to others its a medicine that could have given support and lessened the suffering of millions through its use in cancer ms epilepsy and more and you are wanting to punish those who fought to get everyone equal access to an important medicine for the sick my friend spent time in prison for growing for of his elderly friends who were slowly and very painfully dying that you think its nothing but pot heads shows just how out of touch with the struggles that have been going on you are at this point
canada,not_removed,cry all ya want i just dont outright trust people i meet on the internet
canada,not_removed,owned by george soros so fuck it i say not only shut it down but reduce it to ashes his borderless world influence and support for radicals needs to be stopped hes a piece of shit and the sooner the world gets rid of any influence hes had or has the better
canada,not_removed,sure mike whatever the fuck we can do for you expat who hasnt paid a dime in taxes over the last years asking for our help whenever its convenient get fucked michael and drop your citizenship already who are you kidding
canada,not_removed,this
canada,not_removed,its not about helping mike its about supporting a university which a offers easily the best graduate education and academic research in centraleastern europe b provides generous stipends for talented students from countries across the former soviet union and southeastern europe who otherwise have relatively few opportunities and c serves as a rare remaining place where independent thinking is fostered and encouraged in a country whose government has been systematically working to stifle all dissent and opposition
canada,not_removed,the government is not being asked to invest any canadian monies in the university its being asked to speak out and if possible exert any diplomatic pressure it might be able to bring to bear
canada,not_removed,im the owner of a jetta tdi while the court proceedings have been extremely slow they havent been silent they announced details for a very generous buyback in the us on tuesday theyve promised to update canadian courts with their plan for canada no later than july while they havent made any promises theyve stated that they intend to give canadians a deal on pace with the us ive been getting my updates from vw directly at vwemissionsinfoca
canada,not_removed,still a lot better than the lifted diesel trucks rolling coal and shooting soot out the exhaust
canada,not_removed,they arent lemons they simply do not meet the emissions stated in the sales material
canada,not_removed,except they arent lemons they just dont meet california emission standards which is the standard we use and cant use fleet standards like the big
canada,not_removed,im angry and feel betrayed i might still buy a beetle though my wife wants one yeah important breaking news from regina the city that actually smells like it sounds
canada,not_removed,except not silent we need to wait till july
canada,not_removed,passant
canada,not_removed,we did nazi that coming
canada,not_removed,serious question what did you use the has to be used at vw credit card on
canada,not_removed,fucking morons hey wow youre sooo cool running your engine so inefficiently he must not give a fuck about anyone yet demands their respect
canada,not_removed,they will be lemons when provinces stop allowing people to drive them ontario has already said if the volkswagen does not issue a fix and owners do not get that fix then they will not issue plate renewal stickers
canada,not_removed,good luck reselling it vote with your wallets and never buy volkswagen again
canada,not_removed,i might still buy a beetle though my wife wants one my sides
canada,not_removed,regina the city that actually smells like it sounds thatsbeautiful
canada,not_removed,havent spent it yet am waiting to see if theres a buyback plan in place before it expires so i can use it when i trade in the jetta if not i guess ill need to burn it on some oil changes or something
canada,not_removed,they all have little man syndrome its awesome smoking them in my little volvo since their trucks are fucking slow af lol what vw did is unfair because there are other companies with superb diesel lines like toyota volvo etc who would love to sell their vehicles in north america but the us government makes it economically unfeasible the big lobby the us government to keep foreign diesel out based on the vehicles wheelbase thats why the few diesel vehicles we have in north america vwag bmw mercedes are so fucking expensive
canada,not_removed,really thats news to be whats to stop people from reverting the fix
canada,not_removed,source
canada,not_removed,maybe in southern ontario but up in northern ontario we dont have emissions testing sounds like a bumper crop of diesels will come our way p
canada,not_removed,depends on what the fix is if volkswagen reflashes the ecu to force it to run in test mode the mode where it engages the emissions controls worse fuel economy but better emissions numbers then i am not sure how many owners are going to be able to revert that however the provinces could order software to test the cars to ensure the fix is applied when it is tested if the fix is to attach additional parts test shops could be issued new guidelines to check to ensure those parts are fitted when testing the cars
canada,not_removed,i drive an not only do they keep issuing me renewal stickers they dont even bother to emissions test it the horror
canada,not_removed,flashing aftermarket firmware to cars for engine control among other things has been around for a while and its not too difficult to find someone to do it
canada,not_removed,yes you can pay people to do it the owners themselves are unlikely to have the skill or equipment to do it the government could pass a law that makes it illegal to flash emissions bypass software it would still be available although it would start costing a hell of a lot more
canada,not_removed,theres no feasible way to do that unless you basically outlaw all firmware flashing and even then if you drive enough itll be worth it to have the legal software flashed before you etest and then flash back again after
canada,not_removed,in our province we have one library for every people in manitoba its one for every in alberta its one for every morgan said wednesday and yet he is somehow managing to frame that as a bad thing instead of as a point of superiority over the neighboring provinces
canada,not_removed,rmostironicnewstitle
canada,not_removed,education minister that hates books
canada,not_removed,obligatory saskatchewan has libraries
canada,not_removed,cant have people looking up how they were lied to in university

canada,not_removed,fuck you bell canada
canada,not_removed,xenophobic local taxes make capital move jurisdictions shocking
canada,not_removed,ive heard it said by many economists and businessfolk that most startups like fail within the first year i can imagine the rate for startups by immigrants to be in the upper portion of those percentages if they dont continue to try and create businesses after the first failure or even give up after multiple failures than they are no longer creating jobs i wonder if this metric is tracked startup failure rates for immigrants to see if they really are job creators in canada that is
canada,not_removed,as an immigrant the perception of canada as welcoming place full of limitless opportunity is not backed by credible evidence
canada,not_removed,still waiting for the jobs that the immigrants were supposed to create
canada,not_removed,read the very last paragraph this paper does not say that immigrants are a drain on the economy at all and even suggests an association between upward economic mobility and immigrants the only groups who usually dont improve their situation are the very low skilled labourers
canada,not_removed,i guess they create government jobs because people need to keep track of them and how theyre getting assistance and then to look after them once theyre in jail and then handling their cases as theyre deported so yeah they create a lot of worthless union govt jobs and thats really what the libs are after
canada,not_removed,username checks out
canada,not_removed,no shit now here is the truth government does not want you to know
canada,not_removed,apparently today is spam rcanada with antiimmigrant nonsense day
canada,not_removed,the begs to differ in he reported just the oh the dilemma of who to believe edit to combine two posts
canada,not_removed,the reason i hold this belief is that the entire economy in this country and the usa was from jobs created by immigrants but they have to be educated and skilled of course i mean there are countries with many more people than canada that are still developing or undeveloped so plain people power isnt enough
canada,not_removed,immigrant owners with college degrees are more likely than natives to have stem degrees of course if canadian citizens could waltz into the eu like all the immigrants canada gets and get a cheapnext to free college degree alot more people would be educated too
canada,not_removed,start ups dont create jobs demand does
canada,not_removed,if were defining startups as techoriented and targeting high growth and venture funding why would immigrants necessarily see different failure rates from nonimmigrants honestly if there isnt a high failure rate of startups people arent taking enough risk
canada,not_removed,so hows life under that rock of yours some light from the same site edit provided some evidence for my view point
canada,not_removed,its regressive left proimmigrant myth busting day if you have issues with the study linked in the post please feel free to contact the lead author robert w fairlie professor department of economics university of california santa cruz phone email rfairlieucscedu
canada,not_removed,looks as though meta has come for a visit
canada,not_removed,otherwise known as mondaytuesdaywednesdaythursdayfridaysaturdaysunday edit as if im downloading a document from some sketchy website no thanks
canada,not_removed,today httpswwwyoutubecomwatchveajrbiekxwo
canada,not_removed,ok great can we take in the average oecd rate of immigration thats going to be what annually sign me up
canada,not_removed,those are different countries lets limit the discussion to canada
canada,not_removed,yes can we please kill the idea that business owners and and corporate executives create jobs thats part of the bs trickle down economics rhetoric the economy is bottomup not topdown jobs are created because businesses require employees to meet demand once demand is met no more employees will be hired no matter how many tax breaks you give them its a waste of their money to hire redundant people so they wont do it you want to create jobs increase aggregate demand
canada,not_removed,however if you can create the demand start ups do canadian start ups have a real inability to get to mass markets and mass appeal something like apple could never start in canada the same is true of elon musk he made paypal and sold it to mostly americans americans ate that shit up if he actually tried to sell it in canada people would have told him it is a great idea that he could sell to a bank so when he made tesla and space x he didnt go to canada with it for start up companies most of the time the consumers are not traditional consumers but instead investors they are businesses built on a house of cards tesla posted four consecutive years of losses every single car they made had investors roaring and people buying but no one was actually making money and then they invented a product people actually would pay for and was profitable a battery but still not at the point where they can pay investors a dividend canada doesnt have that investors market people simply arent willing to gamble for years to earn a buck
canada,not_removed,i see your point but trade would seem to play a big role in this a business could meet foreign demand and create jobs without local demand conversely increases in local demand can be met with imports and minimal local jobs
canada,not_removed,do you actually think that or are you just trolling
canada,not_removed,the discussion is only about immigrants that start up businesses in canada i mean the entire purpose of the report is immigrant entrepreneurs in this chapter we provide an overview of the economics literature with respect to some of the most fundamental immigrant entrepreneurship issues as well as the empirical methods and data used the main themes we address are immigrant entrepreneurs contributions to the economy entrepreneurship differences across groups and group differences in entrepreneurial success there is no argument against all immigration did you reply in the wrong post
canada,not_removed,are we defining them as that i know i didnt but immigrating to a new country isnt easy isnt easy to be a pr in a new country and try and get a company up and running the fie program was terminated back in but if you are an immigrant you come into the country under that program or something similar and you fail to start a successful business you might be worried that youll be kicked out
canada,not_removed,why would immigrants necessarily see different failure rates from nonimmigrants if the immigrants were selected based on factors that lead to success then one would expect their rates to be higher if their failure rate is the same as canadians then there would be little point to entrepreneurial immigration
canada,not_removed,itt armchair economists who have never heard of ideas lol
canada,not_removed,annually where did you come up with that number up to canada welcomed more than new people to our country well maybe not you but the rest of us did proud of it to we should bring in more people from around the world to this wonderfully diverse country of ours
canada,not_removed,then delete the whole thread the article that started all this is about the us not canada
canada,not_removed,startups can create jobs if that demand is coming from a foreign country demand increased by lowering trade barriers the entrepeneur is responsible for developing the market in the first place demand coming from a new better method being selected by consumers to better manage their utility
canada,not_removed,or you take demand that was being satisfied by a foreign business and move it to a domestic one
canada,not_removed,hes a troll
canada,not_removed,are you trolling
canada,not_removed,im a canadian emigrant who has started a business in a new country i know it isnt easy countries worldwide need to do a better job of allowing immigrants to start businesses without worrying about deportation if failure happens in fact i would bet you that countries that accommodate that would advantage greatly failure is a good thing its how you learn
canada,not_removed,failure is part of being an entrepreneur it needs to be allowed to happen or people will not take risk
canada,not_removed,itt users quoting a prof from ucsanta cruz as if prominent and evidence for every of these there are reports from credible economists
canada,not_removed,you posted an oecd study regarding immigration so we should take in the average oecd rate of immigration
canada,not_removed,probably wasteful if that foreign business is making a product its probably got a comparative advantage protectionism is dumb doesnt work that line of thinking inevitably leads to being against automation and from there you might as well ban excavators in favour of shovels far better to push for global regulations that charge back externalities like dangerous labour conditions and pollution to their sources only jobs we have a material comparative advantage would come back
canada,not_removed,nope
canada,not_removed,was there a huge demand for lightsabers before they invented star wars a huge demand for sleeping in strangers houses before they invented airbnb startups create demand
canada,not_removed,then there is the refugee sponsorship process
canada,not_removed,ah okay yeah i can agree with that
canada,not_removed,it is but that doesnt mean we cant try to reduce that risk
canada,not_removed,so just
canada,not_removed,read through the report i linked to and did not find the number you quoted curious were that number comes from reading through it again this line jumped out at me since immigrants have represented of the increase in the highly educated labour force in canada
canada,not_removed,innovation can always change the comparative advantage to your favor and global regulation is impossible as you could never get an agreement as to who can police it instead you use increased trade to push back the externalies you mentioned
canada,not_removed,was there a huge demand for lightsabers before they invented star wars there is always demand for era relevant entertainment definitely was definitely demand for space sci fi thanks nasa mixed with gaia theory mysticism thanks hippies in the a huge demand for sleeping in strangers houses before they invented airbnb theres always demand for cheaper housing particularly when more nonrich people want to travel thanks widening global awareness via internetand need temporary housing it all comes back to demand which is influenced by culture
canada,not_removed,cab drivers
canada,not_removed,innovation can always change the comparative advantage to your favor it will printing will make transportation the primary cost of production manufacturing will come home but the jobs wont and global regulation is impossible as you could never get an agreement as to who can police it you use the same strategies that forced the developing world into neoliberalism leveraging world bank loans for one if a significant number of major member countries could be controlled by movements favorable to this you could turn the world around not to mention less above the table tactics
canada,not_removed,so once again annually where did you come up with that number
canada,not_removed,why would a developing country every agree to these regulations developed countries were allowed to grow without them they should tool a far better way is to send them trade and grow the country and then using that trade as leverage start to change their labour and pollution laws it hurts to take something that you already have a lot more than it hurts to never have it in the first place
canada,not_removed,ok great can we take in the average oecd rate of immigration thats going to be what annually sign me up it was clearly a guestimate of the average oecd migration rate i obviously dont have the average of the countries but im sure its a lot lower than what canada is currently taking in since canada is on the very high end of immigration intake
canada,not_removed,why would a developing country every agree to these regulations developed countries were allowed to grow without them they should too we cant afford to gas the planet industrial revolution style with a population of billion we can always demand unions are promoted so they can gradually increase labour conditions we hold their get out of poverty ticket capital a far better way is to send them trade and grow the country and then using that trade as leverage start to change their labour and pollution laws it hurts to take something that you already have a lot more than it hurts to never have it in the first place that too but were at the send them trade and let them grow stage
canada,not_removed,on one hand i love the idea of charging foreign students the tuition we do on the other hand actually i just want your money welcome american students
canada,not_removed,students are also drawn by the schools diversity and canadas affordable cost of living she said canadas affordable cost of living ᵃᶠᶠᵒʳᵈᵃᵇᶫᵉ ᶜᵒˢᵗ ᵒᶠ ᶫᶦᵛᶦᶰᵍ hahahaha kill me
canada,not_removed,this is a nonstory reports say that only more us citizens applied to come here after the trump win its mostly just triggered people rabbleing
canada,not_removed,we dont need more special snowflake sensitive crybaby college students on our campuses
canada,not_removed,now im going to go on a wild guess here but something tell me that its not so much trumps win but the bottom low loonie that makes our postsecondary a hell of a lot more affordable than before economists expect it to hit per us this year as our economy is struggling and us is booming but i know press loves to blame trump on all the woes in the world
canada,not_removed,even though id love for them to come here and pay times what im paying for uni right now id rather they stay there far far away from me i cant stand those puddles who want to run away because they cant handle a republican winning it seems so damn childish to me
canada,not_removed,not chinese studentsso no problem is the thinking on here
canada,not_removed,yawn like all those hollywood celebs were moving to canada also right whats the actual count of people that have moved
canada,not_removed,time to jack up the rates for foreign students
canada,not_removed,good well educated englishspeaking young people exactly the sort of people canada needs to attract to maintain our workforce ive said it before and ill say it again canadas actually got a lot to gain from drumpf running the us economy into the ground millions of brilliant computer technologists the next wave of the sergei brins the elon musks the steve jobs are going to be faced with an america building walls instead of bridges canadas great opportunity is to show this next wave of great entrepreneurs that we are a tolerant progressive proentrepreneur country looking to build bridges instead of walls if we can do this we have a good chance at ensuring the next tesla apple etc launch in toronto waterloo vancouver etc
canada,not_removed,parents moved to the us and im visiting for christmas its cheap as fuck unless you live in new york or san francisco
canada,not_removed,its cheaper for me overall after i moved back to canada
canada,not_removed,with dollars that are actually worth a dollar it is much more affordable even with the monopolies and gouging that dominate our economy of course academics will continue to tell you that we are all better off earning on the dollar postgouging before taxes for the sake of exports and competition so that our economy can have some semblance of life left to it
canada,not_removed,compared to the us its like vacation time in discount city for them when i went to the us when the dollar was at parity my money went further than it did in canada and around that time i was spending money on things that now i wouldnt even consider i welcome the americans to spend money here that i just wont because i need it for just basic living
canada,not_removed,its dirt cheap in canada including vancouver and toronto if you compare to major us cities like seattle san fran la boston nyc and etc toronto is so cheap its ridiculousa single income earner making can easily afford a new condo in downtown core
canada,not_removed,among other concerns godoff a democrat said she fears trumps administration will ease enforcement of federal rules against sexual assault making campuses less safe for women this is just plain silly meanwhile waterloo grads head to silicon valley in droves with obscene salary offers
canada,not_removed,and of those are the celebrities who said they would
canada,not_removed,how is that even relevant to this canadian school applications by americans are skyrocketing applications to the university of toronto from american students have jumped percent compared with this time last year while several other canadian schools have seen increases of percent or more us applications to mcmaster university in hamilton ontario are up percent no one is triggered theyre just analysing the situation this is a nonstory reports say that only more us citizens applied to come here after the trump win people who dont want to be in america during a trump presidency seem to be trying to find other ways than applying for citizenship which makes sense since its the easier route
canada,not_removed,if theyre paying international student fees well take it
canada,not_removed,weve got enough already on canadian campuses
canada,not_removed,keep calling them snowflakes these people will be the next generation of elites that youd cry to your friends about in years
canada,not_removed,turn it up
canada,not_removed,give it a year all the woes will be directly linked to trump
canada,not_removed,a single income earner making can easily afford a new condo in downtown core now to easily make
canada,not_removed,those cowards
canada,not_removed,i dont see the big deal a lot of them probably applied in panic percent more can apply but the u of t didnt suddenly get percent larger the upside is that english might become the main language in the classes again chinese kids will have some competition people are triggered by trump but they can run to canada most will have to go back anyway the rest can stay here which is better in some ways but worse than others the grass is always greener as they say
canada,not_removed,typical of neo marxists
canada,not_removed,wew lad
canada,not_removed,unfortunately
canada,not_removed,um did you happen to miss the us election that happened weeks ago because the guy who won was a giant orange cheeto named drumpf whose campaign was based on hate speech against people of color women immigrants lgbtqias and pretty anyone else who wasnt a straight white male and building the wall
canada,not_removed,also not hard at allthats a mid level analyst salary basically someone with experience with a general degree can be making that
canada,not_removed,canadian schools trump political american refugees democrats neo marxists we are now here from out of no where cbc sucks where conversations like these evolve too
canada,not_removed,hahahaha you have to be trolling sjws dont need you to make them look bad they do well enough on their own
canada,not_removed,hate speech please and whats wrong with a wall should we not keep non citizens out theres been no talk of a wall since then dipshit
canada,not_removed,i was not going to allude to the cbc sucking at all
canada,not_removed,they dont work cost a lot of money have historically had very troubling land seizure cases what do walls do exactly because they dont protect your borders in any meaningful way just another feels before reals conservative idea lol
canada,not_removed,but you think it dont you
canada,not_removed,eh nope
canada,not_removed,it does it objectively does
canada,not_removed,no its objectively average and better quality then all american tv news stations and rt
canada,not_removed,lol ratings and common sense would dictate otherwise
canada,not_removed,name news companies that are better
canada,not_removed,reuters new york times vice bloomberg cnbc cnn fox msnbc channel news san diego rebel rabble nknewsorg well christ i cant think of any new companies that are worse
canada,not_removed,hahaha haha the fucking rebel
canada,not_removed,rewatch justins first day and tell me the cbc doesnt deserve to have its funding pulled it is the worst news service on the planet
canada,not_removed,the price of everything in this country is too high
canada,not_removed,i pay a month for unlimited internet here in england i paid my cell phone plan here costs a month for data and calling text ect england it was with gigs fuck everything about the telecommunications companies here i hope they all get dick cancer
canada,not_removed,what was that board game we all used to play you know the one where you could be a shoe or the top hat and roadster what was that calledhmmcant quite remmeberstarted with an m whatever game that was theyre playing a similar game right now
canada,not_removed,jesus thats the problem
canada,not_removed,just moved to australia per month for data unlimited calling and texting and international call mins wtf canada
canada,not_removed,that was the worst article ever it didnt even talk about the headline at all it just went on about openmedia and how great they are
canada,not_removed,i would have thought it would have been all the goddamn vampires
canada,not_removed,pick one make a basic set of rules for isps to keep a free open internet and tell the crtc to fuck off and truly open our internet up to capitalism possible outcomes a they continue to collude with one another and keep fucking us b they actually start competing with price and internet speeds we nationalize internet possible outcomes a finally have fair internet pricing b we have fair pricing but the government fails to upgrade infrastructure over time c bureaucracy drives prices up anyways like we have now
canada,not_removed,im lucky enough to have a corporate plan otherwise i probably wouldnt even bother with my current one i used to pay for unlimited everything and data i pay now for the same thing with data still not to good when you think about it though
canada,not_removed,for gigabit connection with no cap hd terminals and home phone is too expensive
canada,not_removed,wages arent keeping up with rising costs
canada,not_removed,came to say this rent houses internet cellphones entertainment in general food is hit and miss just buy on sale items but its getting ridiculous
canada,not_removed,and keeps going up if it stayed the same it would be one thing but prices of everything keep going at an alarming rate
canada,not_removed,but i really need an excuse to make use of this hot and fresh meme i heard
canada,not_removed,hahahahahahaha come visit iceland and then tell me everything is too expensive admittedly the cost of internet and cell service is a lot cheaper but everything else is far more expensive people in vancouver complain about housing cost you pretty much cannot rent an apartment for less than in reykjavik although you do get unlimited instant hot water so there is that if you want to buy any kind of electronic take whatever it costs on amazon and double it fast food at least from vancouver prices used to be able to get a large sub and such from subway for about costs here pretty much everything is more expensive here i am moving back to vancouver in august and all my fiancee and i are doing right now is dreaming of the cheap prices
canada,not_removed,my cell phone plan here costs a month for data and calling text ect thats actually really good who are you with
canada,not_removed,i remember visiting my cousins in ireland and seeing the price of a similar phone plan to mine it was literally the cost for a plan that was probably better its ridiculous
canada,not_removed,rogers has a deal in my building for internet unlimited plus the extended package of cable with hbo or superstation for for months its a decent deal but my gf says she doesnt watch enough tv to get it right now we pay for down and unlimited
canada,not_removed,where are you i just signed up with teksavvy internet at a month unlimited you can still get the manitoba koodo plan almost anywhere in the country for for i think the reason shit is so expensive is that people dont care enough to look for cheaper prices
canada,not_removed,risk youre thinking risk
canada,not_removed,yeah but canada is such a big country so the cost errr httpiimgurcompafbhmepng
canada,not_removed,france if you get tv with them i get unlimited callingtext long distance to most countries too and of data that when you go over they just lower you to speeds no extra costs only thing i dont have vs my bell plan is no international texting on top of that when you travel to most countries you still get to use the plan but limited to of data for free no roaming fees etc tv is like euro same for unlimited internet and fast so around euro for all services you can even get a plan that has unlimited textcall but data its free if you got tv with them
canada,not_removed,they need a new cause to get donations from now that has dried up
canada,not_removed,glad im not the only one who thought that the author of this and the author of that leap manifesto need to get together to create something they clearly share the same taste for clunky highschoolgrade writing
canada,not_removed,had a quick laugh at openmedia being named one of canadas leading civil liberties organizations lol no youre a consumer advocacy group access to the latest high speed internet tech isnt a right its a commodity you pay for how much well thats what theyre advocating for
canada,not_removed,what about copying france
canada,not_removed,where the hell do you live where you get that deal
canada,not_removed,holy fuck my cell phone is for i have a student internet deal for for
canada,not_removed,not only that but our costs are deliberately inflated by the greed of retailers who know we have few choices
canada,not_removed,at least minimum wage is still keeping up with inflation unlike in the united states
canada,not_removed,food is hit and miss just buy on sale items in bulk and freeze what you can
canada,not_removed,except your prices are higher due to higher taxes and general unavailability where in canada a lot of these overpriced thing are synthetically inflated due to corporate greed
canada,not_removed,im not surprised iceland is expensive its an island in the north atlantic everything has to be either flown or shipped in and what is produced there is in high demand and limited supply the same isnt true of canada yet our prices are high and keep soaring
canada,not_removed,i pay per month for gb and min thru talk and save
canada,not_removed,koodo i actually just switched to a a month plan that was the same thing i had before check their site it ends today
canada,not_removed,thats good thats exactly what my rogers plan cost in for data minutes and texting with unlimited evenings and weekends
canada,not_removed,rogers doesnt even serve my area only cogeco
canada,not_removed,i was actually with and had unlimited data and calls for £ a month but the reception sucked in my flat so i went to ee for £ a month but only gigs data this was pay as you go which is cheaper than having a plan
canada,not_removed,i can only get cogeco where i am i tried teksavvy before with terrible results constant dropped connections and horrible speed i layer had a cogeco tech support person straight up tell me they mess with the lines if you use a reseller im a power user and need a good connection
canada,not_removed,is that the one where you settle that catan place hes clearly thinking of life
canada,not_removed,fuck him it was a two day sale that got pulled it would be like saying the xbox at target was regular price
canada,not_removed,ive got the same rogers in toronto occasionally offers it
canada,not_removed,my cellphone is gigs for thanks saskatchewan
canada,not_removed,i got it through rogers last month also i pay for gb of data and unlimited callstexting
canada,not_removed,yeah the price difference between gas stations in gta versus gas stations in bumfuck nowhere ontario
canada,not_removed,is there a concrete study about this
canada,not_removed,thats quite a low bar man
canada,not_removed,it sucks if youre in an apartment with limited space though
canada,not_removed,as a koodo employee please make the plan changes through your self serve account or by calling customer service at we are unable to make plan changes in store unless you are getting a new phone
canada,not_removed,i managed to get a wicked deal with koodo m for unlimited talk text plus data
canada,not_removed,and prices have gone up quite a bit since in in canada thats good
canada,not_removed,hes clearly talking about heroscape
canada,not_removed,ahhhh ok that sounds about right
canada,not_removed,youre joking right how hard is it to understand that the vast majority of canadians dont live in places where deals like this are possible but no lets just rattle off extremely rare deals and then act as if theyre the norm
canada,not_removed,does it magically jump cents every wednesday or thurday like over here
canada,not_removed,just driveevery day its at least cents more expensive in torontoits bs
canada,not_removed,check torontogaspricescom
canada,not_removed,we didnt come in worst place that means were winning right
canada,not_removed,yep i do it all online easy process
canada,not_removed,yes i know thats why i cant use them
canada,not_removed,sorry youre thinking of sorry
canada,not_removed,and its not like it was easy lol some people called times insisting to get it obviously dead but if anyone wanted to see how it played out
canada,not_removed,i think you are unaware that ontario is where the high prices exist i live in ontario the more affordable options are in quebec manitoba and saskatchewan hence why i need to have a manitoba plan while living in ontario also that gigabit internet deal is not rare its currently available through bell in ontario and quebec the real issue is that most canadians are morons and dont price shop or look for great offers
canada,not_removed,havent paid enough attention to the weekly changes i only know to get gas outside of gta when making roadtrips and getting gas before getting back to gta
canada,not_removed,last time i was in toronto the gas price was cents higher a litre than it was in the niagara region
canada,not_removed,for some stupid reason every gas station in belleville meets or exceeds the toronto prices on a regular basis
canada,not_removed,ah seems impossible with economies of scale shorter shipping distances more competition how is it possible that its more expensive in toronto
canada,not_removed,fucking hell thats canada in a nutshell if youre not last youre first
canada,not_removed,no no no that word isnt going to get you very many points im sure you can scrabble up a better one
canada,not_removed,right so fair prices should only be obtainable via rare sales i just looked up my region and gets me mbps i currently pay for a cellphone plan thats absolute trash and believe or not ive looked high and low for better deals but for my business needs its not possible most canadians simply dont have access to these sorts of deals and the fact that our telecom infrastructure was paid for using taxpayer money only makes it more insulting that the very companies that exploit this infrastructure are allowed to charge an arm and a leg without the possibility of competition
canada,not_removed,im on the fritz of the gta and the gas station in my townthere is only one deliberately sets their prices cents cheaper even comparable to nearby stations because they know how many people are driving by for work everyday into the city and the station is constantly packed literally like people live in the town but the gas station always has a line up
canada,not_removed,but in surrounding areas its lower pe county had great prices when we went a few weeks ago about cents less than ottawa
canada,not_removed,especially when we compare ourselves to america
canada,not_removed,we should totally hang man does that count im saying it counts
canada,not_removed,im just going to say popomatic trouble and abandon this joke
canada,not_removed,switch to the manitoba plan its province agnostic call in to your current internet provider and threaten to leave and negotiate a better rate pretty simple stuff here man
canada,not_removed,we get the same issue at costco theyre consistently cheaper than the other garbage out there
canada,not_removed,i usually just fuel up in tyendinaga but im a cheap bastard
canada,not_removed,im not going to risk losing a business phone number that all of my clients know and all my advertisements are linked to just to get a fair price on my cellphone plan and the point is that i along with canadians as a whole shouldnt have to jump through fucking hoops to get a decent cellphone plan as for my isp it really takes a special kind of smugness for someone to assume that canadians havent done this already
canada,not_removed,all right well dont live in the boonies and you wont have this issue sheesh the level of fucking entitlement in this country is out of control
canada,not_removed,yeah i live in a city of were way out in the sticks let me guess youre from the gta arent you newsflash most canadians dont live in major cities yet we have the infrastructure to support high speed internet were being fucked for no reason other than heavily guarded profit thanks to the crtc edit confirmed gta resident classic canada is an enormous country take your head out of your ass someday and try exploring the country
canada,not_removed,if youre specifically bitching about phone plans koodofidovirgin offer nearly identical rates in all provinces except manitoba saskatchewan and quebec for unlimited calling and gb of data is being offered in ontario are you seriously trying to tell me that is too much for you
canada,not_removed,its almost as if oh i dont know i looked into those options and they dont fit my business needs or something gigs unlimited callstexts and thats with a business discount also how stupid are you ive already said i pay and you then proceed to ask if i think is too much critical reading skills will get you far in life
canada,not_removed,im not the moron paying and then whining like an entitled bitch because the options presented to you are not to your likingits almost as if being an entitled bitch will get you no where
canada,not_removed,its quite sad that you feel as though the average canadian consumer is entitled given our countrys astronomically high telecom rates in comparison to other countries despite us being a first world country that said its amusing that youve resorted to petty insults ill bet rogersbelltelus absolutely love you please stay in the gta i dont imagine your type would fit well anywhere else
canada,not_removed,well they are right try the province
canada,not_removed,were going to make it your problem understand this is an issue millions of canadians want addressed you guys work for us
canada,not_removed,free parking at hospitals means no parking at hospitals
canada,not_removed,try emailing the province
canada,not_removed,on the surface it looks racist because it is
canada,not_removed,if you have to start you sentence with im not racist but its racist
canada,not_removed,this happens every few years with these peoplethey couldnt organise a dog fight
canada,not_removed,its a racist law but its also racist to have entire communities set aside with tax benefits for certain races too its nowin if they keep reserves native it means kicking people out if not in a few generations youll have people with white heritage living on reserves not paying taxes
canada,not_removed,natives bitch that their ancestors were booted from their land and then turn around and attempt to oust folk nowadays i guess the word hypocrite isnt big on the rez
canada,not_removed,sounds like the same sort of thing that goes on with religious cults i cant think of any small cults that survived barring outsiders
canada,not_removed,respect our mohawk laws and customs i didnt realise that eating mcdonalds for every meal is a mohawk custom
canada,not_removed,id say they should open up immigration form a union similar to what the european union did unify many of the laws promote free movement theyre going to have to if they want to remain relevant in this globalised world otherwise theyre go bankrupt each of them
canada,not_removed,natives are starting to become the new blm movement and cbc is more than happy to be there propaganda lap dog
canada,not_removed,when are we allowed to say welcome to the new tribe
canada,not_removed,this sounds like a great was to get inbred humans force them to marry band members until they are all infertile that is smart preservation
canada,not_removed,ms skydeer makes one salient point in her racist diatribe but she said enforcing the law is more about preserving land for mohawks and preventing nonnatives from benefiting from tax exemptions to which those living on the mohawk territory are entitled in other words the benefits that natives get encourages racist bullshit well theres a simple solution to that
canada,not_removed,there could be an interesting conversation about the legality of what the mohawk nation are doing there is an easy and very short discussion about their racism or xenophobia its stupidly blatant theres a math conversation about their chances of success over the very long term and a hard social discussion to be had over whether there are examples of pureblood communities theres a unique spin on this weird issue the group wishes to be wholly exclusive which im pretty sure has never worked before for any groups that wanted to claim a group identity forever almost all of these are potentially fascinating conversations anyone know anything about this sort of tribal familial isolationist ethnicitycultural sort of oddities what theyre doing must seem to make sense to them can we make sense of it should they attempt it
canada,not_removed,oh theyre natives so they cant be racists s
canada,not_removed,butbutthats racist are they identifying as white people
canada,not_removed,hows rcanada new down vote policy working
canada,not_removed,see how quickly they would change that rule if the feds decided only natives were classified as status
canada,not_removed,it is racist but it is in response to the racist policies of the canadian government
canada,not_removed,yes i agree that there is no way to spin this so that its not racism edit for clarity
canada,not_removed,but only white people can be racist everyone else its affirmative action s
canada,not_removed,cbc really reaching on this arent they natives cant be racist
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,hypocrite has too many syllables so it would be considered a big word on a rez
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,except you know theyre a race of people who had their land forcefully taken from them and not a religion edit lol
canada,not_removed,if you cant attack them for the blatant racism you can always attack them for being fat thats where all the smart minds go its fat peoples own fault s i really cant believe you attacked the fat instead of the racism where is your head at lordy
canada,not_removed,they did the haudenosaunne iroquois confederacy is the oldest union of nations in existence
canada,not_removed,they wont go bankrupt tax paying canadians ie not them pay for everything for them
canada,not_removed,otherwise theyre go bankrupt each of them especially when montrealers eventually quit smoking wait wtf am i talking about quebecois will never quit smoking at least well have electric cars and wont need gas
canada,not_removed,oh please there is so much bullsht going on with first nations they need to complain
canada,not_removed,oh if you disagree with something hit the upside down leaf if youre not sure whether or not you agree hit it anyway just to be safe also make sure you leave a really sarcastic reply underneath preferably a provoking one
canada,not_removed,they would claim prejudice if it was the other way around so how is this different is this any different from metis families
canada,not_removed,yes i agree that there is no way to spin this so that its not racism hahaha clearly youve never met a first nations person
canada,not_removed,sure there is its not about racism its about getting free money and making sure people who arent their race dont get it too but she said enforcing the law is more about preserving land for mohawks and preventing nonnatives from benefiting from tax exemptions to which those living on the mohawk territory are entitled
canada,not_removed,ive always got to wonder whether applies to you never can understand why youre always making sure to promote the behaviour or attitude that you hate the one and only person to bring up the false narrative is you you promote it makes no sense its like youre desperately trying to make it true edit i see charlie minimum echoes you or vice versa well done lads the only people to say are the people who dont want to hear people say it s
canada,not_removed,savage
canada,not_removed,fair enough
canada,not_removed,no
canada,not_removed,and what makes them special when it comes to pureblood groups how many family cults survive the long term whats going to sustain their growth faster than extinction i dont think this decision works out mathematically for them not without involving some pretty frightening cultlike behaviour purity aint a cheap choice
canada,not_removed,so did québécois after stealing portions of it through war from natives the english stole portions of it that was then this is now build society today not years in the past
canada,not_removed,actually the mohawk were given the land where they are now and are originally from an area that is currently on the nyontario border the church offered them the land if they converted to catholicism
canada,not_removed,thats where all the smart minds go its fat peoples own fault s yeah those horrible kahnawake leaders force force force if theyre not forcing people out of their property theyre forcing food into the mouths of their tribal members do i need the s because you had the s
canada,not_removed,that doesnt cover all aboriginal nations though
canada,not_removed,do they act as a nation to negotiate trade agreements c with other nations
canada,not_removed,my friend is native he thanks the taxpayers everyday with his education tuition paid for credit at the book store and etc he graduated this year debt free with a bonus not to mention the bursaries and grants he collected on the way just for being first nations im talking to him on skype he says keep working he might go for another year or two lol
canada,not_removed,but if the police crack down on illegal smoke business will get really thin real quick
canada,not_removed,im triggered
canada,not_removed,canada was zionist a kind of fascism from its very early stages and set out a document of genocide called the indian act it is one of canadas founding documents without it we would not have been able to steal and cheat for all the land our cities are built on anyway the idea is to get rid of the indians they dont like that idea and want to live as they do now
canada,not_removed,im agreeing with you
canada,not_removed,yes i have many
canada,not_removed,he walks the perfect line offensive to some hilarious to others
canada,not_removed,exactly can the offspring of the mixed couples move back since theyre status indians
canada,not_removed,i just think that the comparison to cults does not stand they are an ethnic group that is centuries old
canada,not_removed,good point quebec has tried to do what the mohawk are trying to do or on more or less analogous terms the exclusivity thing is a real kick in the nads to the whole plan
canada,not_removed,part of their decision today is supposed to be based on contemporary politics they do not want nonnatives benefiting from government resources allocated to natives
canada,not_removed,no you are right just their tribes
canada,not_removed,they have the great law of peace which binds them all together and gives them their rights and responsibilities its older than most modern european nations the confederacy negotiated with the british to help win the war of and received land in payment for their war effort they also continually negotiate with canada they can also pass freely though the canadianamerican borders via the jay treaty
canada,not_removed,ya because bringing that up wont make people loath the free loading or anything
canada,not_removed,what are you talking about zionism isnt a form of fascism and the early canadian government certainly wasnt zionist heres a quick definition from wikipedia zionism hebrew צִיּוֹנוּת tsiyyonut ipa after zion is a nationalist and political movement of jews and jewish culture that supports the reestablishment of a jewish homeland in the territory defined as the historic land of israel roughly corresponding to palestine canaan or the holy land
canada,not_removed,sorry i saw i was downvoted and you had the only reply my bad and apologies
canada,not_removed,troll accounts win if they get lots of upvotes or dowvotes
canada,not_removed,okeydokey i think youre focused on the wrong thing
canada,not_removed,you misunderstand québec wants immigrants to integrate and adopt the language and culture anyone can live here you just have to make an effort its not about bloodlines its about cultural transmission and preservation through time the mohawk approach is about bloodlines bloodline preservation does not equal cultural and linguistic preservation its just racism first nations should adopt the québec model fuck bloodlines a culture is composed language history stories knowledge traditions art architecture etc embrace everyone willing to learn the language and the history the problem is their culture is so diluted and many dont speak the language anymore why well thats another issue entirely
canada,not_removed,what even if quebec separated they wouldnt force anglos not to settle in quebec just to protect the property for the future use of québécois
canada,not_removed,what about the children not native enough
canada,not_removed,i can kind of see their point from a tribal view diluting the resource canadas treaty with them isnt good for the tribe as an entity superior to the individuals maybe being mohawk means making a sacrifice you dont get to marry out of the tribal bloodline racist as hell and doomed to failure i think inbreeding isnt the way to go
canada,not_removed,and if i didnt want nonwhites benefiting from resources allocated to whites what would you call that because that r word would apply to both
canada,not_removed,yes but is there anything going on in the modern era do the mohawk have businesses that engage in trade with other nations do they have treaties with anyone other than canada or the us or is their great law of peace and all that stuff just history
canada,not_removed,im just saying canadas zionist influence propagated the idea of cultural superiority that is part of native genocide we have actual policies designed to eradicate aboriginal populations these people know how these policies work and are trying to counteract them
canada,not_removed,np
canada,not_removed,no i just think your comment was really patronising
canada,not_removed,what its the mohawk that are engaged in exclusivity yknow like the headline says
canada,not_removed,im not a part of their committee so im not in the place to answer that i was just pointing to relevant information in the article
canada,not_removed,so they planned to be inbred instead of integrating maybe they should be informed on the massive health ramifications both physically and mentally that would cause canada would be paying for caretakers not native tribes after a while
canada,not_removed,why cant we be canadians all of us i know the québec guy is saying this
canada,not_removed,im living in their territory right now and i can say that they still live by their great law which is hundreds of years old certainly older than canadas and americas constitutions it has held to the test of time too lgbt rights voting for women equality rights of children they all come together every year to recite it and it takes them a full days to do so they are bound like all other nations by their treaties and agreements today they have trade and commerce with canada they have treaties with the british as well but you dont need to treat with a million nations to be considered one
canada,not_removed,
canada,not_removed,whatever im more interested in the mathematical likelihood that such a small group can maintain purity over the long term i dont think it can but i dont have the mathematical chops to prove it i am aware of other exclusive small groups that went kaput i tend to believe it by and large doesnt succeed
canada,not_removed,what you basically said quebec has been trying to do what they mohawk are doing and thats false
canada,not_removed,uponoki
canada,not_removed,im willing to bet this supposedly wonderful thing has its fair share of flaws and snags to it
canada,not_removed,trying to establish a separate nation isnt the same they way theyre going about it is different but both are committed to making their language their culture their laws what do you think the mohawk are trying to do
canada,not_removed,perhaps it is leagues ahead of any western constitution actually benjamin franklin went to the iroquois confederacy to model his democracy after it in any case i have been invited to its recite this summer so ill be able to see for myself
canada,not_removed,they could probably sustain their culture and heritage if they actually invited people into the community as well as not shunning members of their community who leave to get higher education quebec takes in immigrants if quebec was banning non quebecers from living here and banning quebecers from marrying anyone who wasnt from quebec then yes your comment would have merit but thats not the case
canada,not_removed,see im still not buying that the people of stone and stick are so wonderful
canada,not_removed,i wrote quebec has tried to do what the mohawk are trying to do or on more or less analogous terms i wrote both are committed to making their language their culture their laws more alike than different but like thats just my opinion man dont get too bent out of shape
canada,not_removed,im going to completely ignore the ignorance and bigotry you can google that benjamin franklin drew inspiration from the confederacy or not the fact that he modeled his own government after it shows the complexity and greatness of it not only that but the haudenosaunee confederacy is the longest lasting union of nations women were treated as equals long before their europeanwestern counterparts maybe stone and morter dont make greatness in any case i dont think the haudenosaunee care what you refuse to believe
canada,not_removed,so were is the tribe now on given land taking handouts still mishandling and just now getting to the pure blood stage socially there is a reason european settlers had such great effect over north and south america with so few numbers and it was hundreds of years more advanced development
canada,not_removed,so were is the tribe now on given land taking handouts still mishandling and just now getting to the pure blood stage socially six nations of the grand river earned that land with blood they fought and won decisive victories with the british in the war of without their support canada wouldnt be the same today or even existant there is a reason european settlers had such great effect over north and south america with so few numbers and it was hundreds of years more advanced development that reason is disease spread by pigs and humans they had devastating affect pioneer weapons and boats were inferior in so many ways muskets that took forever to load were in accurate and hardly lethal like guns are today canoes out paced and out maneuver cumbersome boats in river systems it must be hard growing up on revisionist history
canada,not_removed,before you fly off the handle bars theyre just discussing before the bill is brought up in the spring there wont be any extra special directives on the matter
canada,not_removed,im suprised the senate can meet on it before the house of commons debates it then again ive never even really bothered to pay attention to the senate they could have a bowling alley in there and i wouldnt know
canada,not_removed,he already answered his own question he sees pot shops all over the place does he see impaired driving going up everywhere
canada,not_removed,are they gonna smoke up first would make for the best ratings cpac ever had
canada,not_removed,yep its just some pc blowhard trying to pretend legalization will lead to children injecting marihuanas while they speed down the road in a stolen car
canada,not_removed,meanwhile the state of maine legalized recreational pot a few days ago
canada,not_removed,and in an ideal utopian society that would be fine but the goal of this bill is harm reductionnot perfection if you bump the age up to you just enable the illegal market to keep selling
canada,not_removed,alcohol has a much more negative effect on youth than marijuana does yet the drinking age is
canada,not_removed,if a study came out asking for that than it was a reefer madness study because it has not been proven that canabis is anymore harmful than alcohol in any study to date furthermore we havnt proven that the neurological changes observed are objectivly damaging at best we have evidence of a weak correlation between prior standardized testing results and self reported cannabis use which can be explained a number of ways and therefore jumping to conclusions like you have is disrespectful in the face of science
canada,not_removed,the same is true of alcohol and to a more extreme degree in reality this isnt practical nor reasonable people are adults at age and they should be treated that way the black market is also a very serious concern
canada,not_removed,the issue with this argument is that the specific age that the brain stops growing is really unknown and highly variable per individual i do support regulating teens since the majority of children are not fully developed until
canada,not_removed,and lets be honest even with a limit of you will still get some smoking younger than that or eating it however they may use it
canada,not_removed,hell in many parts of the country
canada,not_removed,getting it off the streets and into stores is the best way to keep it away from kids our current system makes it far easier for kids to ger drugs than alcohol
canada,not_removed,the latest studies show no correlation between thc use after age and cognitive ability although that doesnt make any conclusions more studies will need to be done
canada,not_removed,there should have been no surprise at prime minister justin trudeaus colossally disingenuous statement on the death of fidel castro so if his statement was disingenuous what seems to be the problem
canada,not_removed,sigh this is just desperate np
canada,not_removed,he also shares his fathers love of destroying the country with noncompatible mass immigration so why not
canada,not_removed,this article is almost entirely about his dad also what did justin say that was so bad i only read that he called him a giant of the century which is a true statement what is so bad about that
canada,not_removed,hes a monsterous dictater justin is a commie benharper thanks for the input ben now clean up your room
canada,not_removed,trudeau is trying very hard to further his fathers legacy
canada,not_removed,trudeau was born into wealth and status so when he sees a leader like castro living a similar life in the lap of luxury he just views it as how the world works for justin trudeau there is nothing untoward about being born into wealth and power regardless at whos expense that comes
canada,not_removed,ops got issues
canada,not_removed,hey its not the rebel we thought that it would be okay s
canada,not_removed,if you think this article is inaccurate youve made a mistake voting for trudeau
canada,not_removed,mass immigration
canada,not_removed,rightists triggered thats all
canada,not_removed,pretty much anyone outside the sphere of corporate americanowned media looks at figures like castro as role models of liberation and selfdetermination i doubt that considering the shit that castro did to his people and how much he retarded its growth
canada,not_removed,this ones falling flatter than elbowgate fwiw
canada,not_removed,nice try
canada,not_removed,canada takes in the highest level of immigrants per capita of any western country
canada,not_removed,it was international news so its noteworthy but its past its best before date now
canada,not_removed,cubans in cuba are mourning mourning under threat of violence i dont imagine the people who suffered in his death camps or were jailed for being dissidents will mourn his death prove that shit cubans in america are celebrating his death the cubans who left to escape the shit of cuba if cuba was a glorious haven you wouldnt have people crowding onto dinghies into dangerous water to escape
canada,not_removed,so when people in canada or the us cry over elected politicians jack layton for example i guess its because they are being forced to at gunpoint its funny how you call me daft yet you dont seem to recognize the difference between the democratic and free nation of canada and the dictatorship of cuba which is under extreme political repression
canada,not_removed,like theres not thousands of dead mexicans lying in the desert who tried to escape that capitalist shithole mexico is hardly a shithole they leave mexico because america is much wealthier cuba has been under an embargo since the because of americas imperialist bullshit you mean when castro allowed imperialist ussr to host nuclear weapons on cuban soil the fact that cubans arent dying in droves of malnutrition or disease unless you live in africa almost no nation has its people dying in droves from either
canada,not_removed,every organization monitoring freedom of speech and freedom of association puts cuba near the bottom of their lists every year countless cubans make dangerous trips to escape the repression in cuba you have done no intellectual inquiry of your own and just parrot what u hear in the corporate media or maybe i havent been brainwashed by some shitty communist website thats been filling your head with lies in how perfect cuba is
canada,not_removed,a narcofascist stat shitty buzzwords its also the fastest growing economy in north america and guess of nations in africa areyou guessed itcapitalist and guess what theyre experiencing the fastest drop in malnutrition and poverty in history ever since they dropped the communist bullshit that retarded their growth
canada,not_removed,lol there were no real communist states in africa thats what they all say if no nation can even begin to transition to communism without being a piece of shit failed state angola zimbabwe ussr or a capitalist playground china vietnam then why bother mexicos poverty rate has increased two million since pains of a growing state once the ridiculous drug war is over they will skyrocket
canada,not_removed,guess your sympathy for executed innocent people in cuba is genuine s said like a typical murderous commumist
canada,not_removed,thinking that the bastita dictatorship were nazis amazing
canada,not_removed,honestly pk is great but so is webber could be fun to watch
canada,not_removed,you dont
canada,not_removed,our postie made sure to tell us that theyre not on strike they are going to be locked out
canada,not_removed,mail basically stops where ever it currently is until the strike ends online retailers that normally use canada post may offer alternative shipping options
canada,not_removed,if you use amazon theyre likely switching entirely to the ups from canada and upsdhl combo from the states so youll be fine if you order from there amazon isnt about to lose countless millions in sales just because of this
canada,not_removed,lockout not strike two very different things postie here if you have any other questions
canada,not_removed,lockout not strike
canada,not_removed,i am so worried about the online purchases i have in transit at the moment one is a non expensive thing and one is an expensive thing what the bloody hell are we going to do
canada,not_removed,only order things that can be delivered by companies other than canada post until their negotiations are over because yes you will not get any that are stuck in building and trucks until then
canada,not_removed,ah crap i ordered stuff from amazon did not even think of checking how they will mail it i think its usually china post which eventually goes through canada post package might end up stuck at a harbor somewhere for a while p
canada,not_removed,so are these price gaugers still on strike
canada,not_removed,does anyone know if purolator will deliver this weekend since theyre so backed up heard theyd be working saturday but cant find anything on the net saying so want my damn mobo lol
canada,not_removed,amazon has already switched to using ups i have received several packages this week that i have bought before that came canada post and have now come ups i wrote amazon hoping that they continue using ups since it is a far superior experience vs canada post best advice switch everything you can to electronic versions if you havent already after the last strike pretty much all companies offer ebilling interact etrasfer is cheaper than sending a cheque etc and start using ups or fedex when given the option at checkout dont forget to enjoy not having any junk mail delivered
canada,not_removed,really hope this is the nail in the coffin for canada post they strike far too often to be reliable httpnewsnationalpostcomfullcommentandrewcoyneendingcanadapostsmonopolywouldbenefittaxpayersandconsumers get them some competition keep it honest our postal system is about as effective as countries which barely have infrastructure like hell they dont even bring things to our houses anymore edit many of you are pretty dumb and need to do research at the fact this is getting downvoted this is not the union striking this is most likely an already profitable corporation causing another lockout on top of that go do some research you buffons and see when the last time canada post was not profitable was this time with the mighty communists in power they will not get legislated back to work so well canada post and their union have another fight we have no service and cover the bill to support this utility edit just to show how stupid some of you people are week later july canada post has declared a lock out on the union ie this company is shutting down heres another tidbit of information purolator public package company is owned by canada post someone really has to explain to me why this company deserves the exclusive right to deliver our mail
canada,not_removed,think its funny esp when you consider that mail is covered by federal law and must be delivered then again unions and unionized workers seem to be exempt when they skirt the law
canada,not_removed,this person is correct their union also covers parcel delivery services edited for formatting and broken link because im three sheets to the wind
canada,not_removed,here is a recap of what has happened so far there was a lockout and back to work legisltation with imposed wages and changes to benefits wage increases were limited to if i remember correctly the and might be transposed initial starting pay for most positions was reduced to from pension plan was changed for new employees to be defined contribution from defined benefit sick time was removed and converted to a stdltd plan with personal days initial negations for began october feb this contract ended in april canada post requested a conciliation which is a mediation by an appointed officer of the court to move negotiations forward and prevent potential legal issues with offers in may the supreme court of canada ruled the contract was invalid and sections of the contract imposed by labour minister lisa raitt under the harper government violated the charter of rights and freedoms starting at the end of may cupw postal union engaged in a strike vote at this time there was no contract offer proposed by canada post corporation strike vote ended mid june with a in favor of strike action canada post restricted all future benefits at the end of the cooling off period from the end of conciliation on july including drugs dental vision maternity extended coverage disability insurance and on going disability claims all leave which was not approved prior to this day is also denied unless it conflicts with the federal labour standards act canada post issued its first complete offer to the union also labelled its final offer on june cupw requested an extension of the time limit of the offer from july to july today canada post issued a statement denying any extension in negotiations this puts the union leadership in an uncomfortable position the time in which the offer was release to the time in which it expires is too short to hold another vote if they deny the offer they might get a worse one or a lock out if they accept the offer they are technically violating there legal duties to serve the best interests of the union members since they would be going against the strike vote consensus the ethic of this move by the corporation is questionable however to my knowledge there is technically nothing illegal about it the new contract issues a wage increase of with a increase to technical trade in and a to signing bonus depending on ftptterm status some operational changes and housekeeping as well as removal of internal training for trades switching to a scholarship system it is also possible that the contract which is now invalid or partially invalid will need to be renegotiated and retroactively enforced
canada,not_removed,this is an important distinction
canada,not_removed,well both sides have the ability to act on july from what i gather however given what happened in it seems far more likely that theyre going to just lock out the workers than the workers will strike or go to rotating strikes frankly a lot of what theyre looking for in their contract doesnt look all that unreasonable a lot of people like to complain how cushy their job is but frankly if it was so great dont you think they wouldnt have this problem where theres not enough workers in some places
canada,not_removed,damn i was literally just about to hit place your order on amazonca but now im not sure maybe id be better off waiting until next week to be on the safe side since the strike hasnt actually happened yet if they begin shipping today who knows where itll end up
canada,not_removed,not op but would you mind summarizing the motivation behind the lockout please ive heard many people complain the past couple of days about the post stopping but no one seems to know the nitty gritty of why also how would lockout action differ from strike action
canada,not_removed,can cp hire scab workers i figured there would be some obligation for them not to but a coworker at my seasonal job fills in for carriers when needed and said a local union head was paying him under the table to rough up anyone that tries to work as a scab im a prettyskeptical but am in a pretty fucked up rural area and stranger things have happened
canada,not_removed,does the corporation have to give notice for a lockout as well and also until the lockoutstrike is decided do postal workers go back to work this coming monday and tuesday like normal
canada,not_removed,the union has voted overwhelmingly for a strike mandate though
canada,not_removed,wait youre going to wait and when the strike is resolved youll get your packages you probably arent going to die because of any of it
canada,not_removed,ups is great until you have to order something from outside the country and the seller ships with them then you get hit in the face with an ungodly high customs fee fuck them and fuck dhl as well
canada,not_removed,ups is terrible where i live there isnt a depot in my city and the closest depot is hour away getting a package you need to sign for is a nightmare as the feature to switch delivery addresses never works i literally had to get my retired dad to sit around my house all day last week to accept a package because i was at work and it wouldnt let me change the address
canada,not_removed,canada post delivers parcels that canadians order and ship they do it cheaper than all their competition they have major competitors and i dont know how many small ones id hardly say theyre anywhere near irrelevant mail sure who cares parcels different story
canada,not_removed,i mean it will eventually get delivered its not as if theyre throwing it out
canada,not_removed,so my mail and parcels just stay in some warehouse indefinitely
canada,not_removed,jesus christwhat a shit show
canada,not_removed,initial starting pay for most positions was reduced to from for sorting and delivering mail wow to signing bonus a signing bonus for getting a job sorting and delivering mail the more details that come out about these benefits the more impressed i am about union power
canada,not_removed,for those that are wondering i actually just found out via the amazon live chat that they are already sending out packages via couriers in the event that the strike does go through
canada,not_removed,uquestionablechoice summarized it quite well in addition to what he said this article is a good and quick i promise lol read as well the difference between a lockout and a strike to you the end user is zero however if choosing sides in the debate a lockout is imposed by management whereas a strike is done by the workers in the current case management is basically saying accept our cutbacks or we lock the door and starve it out of you we had a strike vote that was in favour basically saying fuck you and your cutbacks and your bonuses the union has given no indication of a strike theyre trying to negotiate the terrible deal we were offered a week ago while we continue to go to work and deliver your sex toys
canada,not_removed,a strike in canada post or rotation strike is basically a section of the canada post refuse to work lets say alberta but every province continue to work so every where continue to get paid except alberta worker and they take turn probably to prolong as the union does not have the money to pay all of there members this halts the mail from by to what ever province and mail coming in so the government says nah if you want to strike go strike im going to shut all the place down to stop wasting money its not like you would want to ship things with canada post anyways piece of shit tracking keep losing thing and just leave the shit in the front door when it required signature
canada,not_removed,they can and have not recently but at least as recent as the the rest of that i dunno havent heard of that kind of thing going on since about the lol
canada,not_removed,i believe they do they didnt last time but the union had begun rotating strikes when we were locked out i think that makes it fair game for them to not give notice and yes ill show up to work at my normal time tomorrow
canada,not_removed,canada post makes lots of money they are not fading into obscurity as some believe they have actually adapted quite well to online shopping needs delivering two out of every three parcels in canada and doing it cheaper than anyone else thats a huge market share when there are major competitors transitioning from mail delivery to parcel delivery has actually resulted in an increase in total volume shipping more items now than in the early when apparently everything was done by mail and the internet was about to destroy that the point of all this is simply that given the record profits and consistent bonuses being handed out to upper management worker cutbacks shouldnt be necessary in canada post locked out its workers over pension dispute and a new delivery method that every single ergonomic study has deemed a disaster the harper government deemed the lockout a threat to the economy and legislated workers back this was deemed a violation of workers rights by ontario superior court and never challenged by canada post corporation which parts of the contract that invalidates is still in the courts canada post got what they wanted though any employee hired after would be put on an inferior pension plan the workers and the union had no control over this in this round of negotiations canada post began by saying it would be placing all employees on the inferior pension plan among other cutbacks the union voted in favour of a strike in response that doesnt mean we go on strike right now it just means we reject their first offer and give the union authority to use job action as a bargaining chip if a deal cant be reached canada post counter offered that it would keep everyones pension the same but would be making other cuts and eliminating full time jobs in favour of on call casual and part time positions workers are asking three things same pension for everyone the good one the one everyone should have continued to get if not for harper legislation a raise barely higher than cost of living seems fair since we got dick under the last two agreements with harper in power and pay equality between urban and rural carriers today canada post said that its earlier offer of same pension other cuts was the final offer which means they may lock the doors and attempt to starve their workers into agreeing to cuts all while collecting huge bonuses and lying to the canadian public about the long term health of the public service
canada,not_removed,mostly as a negotiating tactic it shows that the union isnt divided
canada,not_removed,i think its sarcasm
canada,not_removed,blame the government for that one that exemption limit is bullshit in i have bought things from the us and had it shipped to canada using all the companies and every time i get hit with huge customs fees
canada,not_removed,yeah and each time they halt service they help their competitors
canada,not_removed,i do t want mail delivery to my house its all junk mail unless it is named to a specific person ill save it up a few weeks and toss it back into the canada post mail box and let them deal with it or you know get on with the time and email me it takes less than minutes to send anything using email and a week to send things though canada post and that is if they dont fuck up and somehow manage to delivered and lost it at the same time
canada,not_removed,yes wherever they are in the postal system no one will be there to move it
canada,not_removed,until theyre off strike then they sort the back log of mail and everything is delayed by a couple of weeks for a couple of months
canada,not_removed,yup there was a brief that went out in the news around the of june listing the final dates to have stuff shipped to have it arrive by today unfortunately if it doesnt arrive today youre most likely going to be waiting awhile apparently the negotiations werent going great so strike action should be expected
canada,not_removed,these are just some of the highlights there are also serious issues imo regarding cpc operating structure and its validity in regards to bill in which the technical foremen are not in a position to enforce discipline or training of staff but are criminally culpable in the event of an accident or incident however that is a discussion for another time
canada,not_removed,compared to average non skilled labour in ontario its nothing special the rate is there wages are below average for all trade skills which are hired httpwwwesdcgccaenjobsworkplaceemploymentstandardsgovernmentcontractswageratesontarionorthpage it is hours a week outside in all weather condition carry a bag which fills to lbs every couple blocks its not exactly glamorous
canada,not_removed,its a unionized govt job of course its better pay than most of us in private sector would get for same work
canada,not_removed,not really its complicated but ill do my best to explain it first mail service in canada is a constitutional right not a privilege to understand what this means consider the following telecommunications is not a right its a privilege the government can outlaw cell phones email skype calls etc they cant outlaw mail the government can regulate how you receive it based on geographic area but it cant restrict your access a judge can rule that you cant use a computer for years they cant restrict your access to mail for example it is a regulated industry much like railroads air travel atomic energy etc which is different than a government funded industry like hospitals or schools canada post is also different from crown corporation like sasktel or air canada was or via rail currently is sasktel can be sold without changing the constitution and is merely a business owned by the government canada post operates separate from the government and is not owned by the government however it is not an independent corporation like ibm or microsoft canada post pays taxes like any other corporation but when it makes a profit it provides a dividend in addition to the government canada post however does not receive tax funding when its in deficit it goes into debt the board of directors are appointed by the governor general via the recommendations of the prime minister however this is where the connection to the government ends the canada post corporation proposing to cut benefits and wages not the government postal workers are negotiating with canada post because the contract expired the current contract is effectively offering the increase to be for unskilled and for the highest skilled workers for the next years after offering for the past and this year postal workers didnt get raises when the company was unprofitable and now that it is profitable again they still dont want to pay wages the strike action or lock out action is part of union bargaining these are common tactics by both sides to dictate negotiations when a consensuses cant be reached canada post the cupw union are negotiating the government doesnt have much say in the matter either way however since it is a regulated industry and a constitutional right they can end worker action by either side and enforce rules in some situation in the past they over stepped there bounds and resulted in this mess
canada,not_removed,thank you up until i came on reddit i had only ever heard it referred to as a strike so thank you for educating me hahahahaha good to know the only thing in the mail im waiting for the arrival of is the package i mailed to my arbitrary day giftee
canada,not_removed,seriously if you think canada post is shit you clearly havent tried our lesser known carrier like canpar they left a shotgun i had ordered online with a neighbor a fucking firearm but they dont give a shit probably because their delivery guys dont get paid enough to care
canada,not_removed,i work for a company where a good portion of our sales are online we do have nearly brick and mortar store across canada as well i love canpost over our other shipping options they are very good at finding customers and their trucks dont blow up ups sends packages back all the time for not being able to find address but its the same place we have sent the customer upteen packages already and i can find them in minute on google maps and ups calls us periodically to let us know a truck caught fireblew up and that we need to send the customer out a new order canada post is easier to deal with if a package goes missing this also sucks for people who live in more remote areas and only have po boxes
canada,not_removed,the government doesnt mandate the extra fee that ups adds on top of the duties charge though ive had them charge almost the value of the item for the convenience of having them do that fedex is bad but not as bad and uspscanada post quite often doesnt even charge duty and if they do they dont tack on ridiculous charges
canada,not_removed,a few years ago i bought a chemise shipping included once it arrived at my door the ups guy wanted me to pay him biggest joke i dont believe for a second that any other company would have charged that much and no other company ever has so far
canada,not_removed,again we are far cheaper by about i aint worried
canada,not_removed,well that sucks hard i have several packages in transit from overseas that wont make it in time
canada,not_removed,id rather have a well paid labor job than a badly paid glamorous job
canada,not_removed,thats a little disingenuous to post that as a source considering the fair wages and hours of labour act which designated those amounts has been ie no longer validenforceable going forward and replaced by the which does not establish its own fair wages and hours the fair wages and hours of labour act also only applied to contractors working on federal contracts afaik and was not meant as a minimum wage guideline for federally regulated employees even then unless there is something that i have overlooked that has taken its place in enforcing fair wages for specific tradeslabourers which i cannot find urackemup you should forget about the special minimum wage for labourers sure the federal average might be somewhere around an hour but the mandated minimum remains the provincial level while cpc falls under federal jurisdiction the since ontario was given as the example ill stick with it as we can see on the httpswwwlabourgovoncaenglishespubsguideminwagephp there is no special minimum wage for tradespeople or labourers there are only the following categories categorycurrent ratenew rate as of oct general ie basically liquor hunting and fishing or or so skilled or unskilled labour all falls under the same minimum whether provincially or federally regulated from what i can tell one of the big sticking points in the current negotiations was the pension issue changing from defined benefit to defined contribution the change is essentially moving towards an rrsp that will fluctuate based on the market as opposed to a guaranteed pension amount upon retirement which depending on market conditions has the potential to be more favourable for the employees sure it has the potential to be less favourable as well but the rrsp path is the way that most employers go anyway as far as i know and there are also a great deal of employers that do not provide pensionsi dont know many employers outside of public sector that have a defined benefit pension plan however based on the june offer it appears theyre not going to change the type of pension plan so itll stay defined benefit but they may simply readjust the amounts though i dont have those details so this entire point becomes moot anyway the second biggest issue is a wage increase i have always had a problem with this i have never worked in a unionized environment nor do i want to but the idea that you get a raise just because and that people demand this makes no sense to me cost of living increases aside which in theory could be mandated by the mol anyway i have always done well with yearly increases which have always been based on my performance i am not so entitled to feel that i deserve an increase in my salary simply because someone negotiated a collective agreement that said im going to get oneit almost creates a complacency because whether below average average or exceptional performance you know youre getting that sweet ca raise anyway this is one of the reasons that i do not agree with unions aside from the fact that i have personally witnessed them do more harm than good for the employees or more than one occasion from personal experiences they also seem to create a certain sense of entitlement and complacency in employees i hate to be the bearer of bad news but employers owe nothing to their employees above and beyond minimums set out through legislation which i do agree are currently insufficient but thats a discussion for another time anything they do above and beyond that should be at their own discretion the employers that continually follow only the minimum will get what they pay for compared to those that are willing to step up to the plate and provide better compensation and benefits packages as the saying goes you get what you pay for conditions apply
canada,not_removed,my initial reaction was because ontario min wage is so seeing complaints about lowering the starting wage to seemed unjustified but if labourers are paid a min of i guess its not that much different still im not sure why general labour is higher than minimum wage since its not exactly a skilled trade edit lots of downvotes for continuing a legit conversation awesome to clarify i understand offering more money to offset the unattractive quality of physical labour but there should be a big supply of people for a job where the only requirement is pick up this shovel therefore supplydemand says lowest cost wins which should be min wage i was surprised to learn that there is a different minimum wage for labourer jobs
canada,not_removed,the distinction is between union and nonunion unionized private sector labourers make similar wages and have similar compensation packages
canada,not_removed,i think three times in the last years ive had ups send a package back to sender claiming my address didnt existwas wrong when it was perfectly fine meanwhile i actually entered the wrong postal code for a parcel that was coming by canada post and it still arrived on time ive always found cp package delivery to be pretty reliable and efficient barring things sometimes sitting in customs for weeks on end but thats probably not their fault
canada,not_removed,exactly this i have had dhl fedex and ups all notify me a couple of times about not being able to find my address after many successful deliveries at the same location i know its naive to think its always the same guy but still with current gps technology and such theres no excuse
canada,not_removed,thank you i was very confused as to why everyone i saw was writing about how itd be great to not have canada post anymore and how it wasnt important i dont live in a big city at all population hours north of toronto so canada post is pretty much the best usual shipping option we have something minor to get shipped here for via cp will be with other shipping options like ups i never knew how it was for the more populated areas though id have to guess the difference in price is less extreme than it is here
canada,not_removed,unfortunately that appears to be the case for a lot of people
canada,not_removed,thank you its no wonder the for general labour didnt make sense with yearly increases which have always been based on my performance and thats also my point that others had a problem with minimum wage should only apply until you build up more skills if you work hard to improve yourself your pay should go up
canada,not_removed,a positions lack of skill does not make it easy i think paying for wear and tear on ones body isnt a bad idea i know my back couldnt handle a physical job anymore
canada,not_removed,why does it have to be a race to the bottom if a job doesnt require any skill it should automatically be at minimum wage what a great way to promote income inequality and make sure poor people stay poor
canada,not_removed,except no one can live a decent life off an hour even working full time which minimum wage jobs generally never offer due to not wanting to pay benefits
canada,not_removed,like to know where in my last job noone earned and that ranged from psw to dining room staff to cleaners
canada,not_removed,wait how the fuck is that a feature if you enter the wrong postal code it should return to sender not delivery to the which ever address
canada,not_removed,im not disagreeing with you and clearly the ontario government isnt either if they have a special scale with other minimum wages that lists labourer but general labour isnt supposed to be a job that you do for years and then retire from nor is it a job that requires much training hence my surprise to see the pay over minimum wage edit apparently this min wage for labourers is based on a law that has since been repealed
canada,not_removed,who said it was a race to the bottom if a job doesnt require any skill it should automatically be at minimum wage isnt that what minimum wage is for if you have no skills you start at the bottom if there are a bunch of people with no skills competing for the same job then its supply and demand as you work and learn you gain skills and you become more valuable which should increase your pay thats why we do training and education thats the basics of a free market you should always be trying to better yourself and learn new skills i can see a general labour job paying above minimum wage to offset the demands of physical labour and health risks that you wouldnt see in a retail clerk environment but those jobs are not supposed to be a lifetime career that you retire from
canada,not_removed,compared to average non skilled labourer in ontario these wages are nothing special the rate is there wages are below average for all trade skills which are hired httpwwwesdcgccaenjobsworkplaceemploymentstandardsgovernmentcontractswageratesontarionorthpage it is hours a week outside in all weather condition carry a bag which fills to lbs every couple blocks its not exactly glamorous
canada,not_removed,a decent life that depends if youre just starting out live at home work hours a week you can earn a bit of money from a job even at minimum wage if youre and stuck in a hours a week minimum wage job trying to pay a mortgage then yes youre going to have a tough time thats why i said its the minimum but as you learn and train you should be able to get better jobs that pay more
canada,not_removed,the table above was for ontario maybe your province doesnt specify a min for those jobs
canada,not_removed,because we letter carriers are not dumb parcel gets sorted by postal code until the very last set of hands touch it me i look at the street address and dont care at all what the postal code says chances are the code is only slightly wrong and wherever its supposed to be is close to where it actually is i look at the address see its not mine but recognize that its on toms route walk over to tom hand him parcel go about my day if i personally dont recognize the street it goes back in to be resorted with my postal code crossed off and might be one day late
canada,not_removed,minimum is what employer can legally pay and the union accepts which is per hour ontario
canada,not_removed,its fraser institute so take it with a grain of salt most people dont realize it but the average canadian household now pays more in taxes than they spend on the basic necessities of life combined said charles lammam director of fiscal studies at the fraser institute to paraphrase for immediate release employee of right wing nonprofit for tax avoidance thinktank for hire organization has declared his opinion in keeping with his rightwing agenda per cent of income went to taxes while per cent went to basic necessities the average family spent per cent on taxes and per cent on housing food and clothing yes taxes went up since remind me when did we started our national healthcare program oh thats right httpsenwikipediaorgwikihealthcareincanadahistory what a coincidence since the average canadian familys total tax bill has increased by per cent dwarfing increases in annual food costs per cent clothing per cent and housing per cent even accounting for inflation over the last years the tax bill has still increased per cent uh how do you figure that to is an increase of over an increase of over would mean the number has doubled also where are they getting this data housing costs arent included in the official boc inflation rate some things like food and some manufacturing goods actually have gotten cheaper housing certainly hasnt nor had education or telecommunication taxes help fund important government services indeed they do canada has far fewer tollroads than the us we also have fewer medicalrelated bankruptcies and lower incarceration and murder ratesin part due to services we pay for through tax dollars this is another shallowlyresearched piece from the frasier institute trying to stir up sensational bs without ever asking why
canada,not_removed,this has got to be one of the more surreal instances ever
canada,not_removed,no thunder lightning or hail storm buttock bc wtf how stoned are you to post a regional minor weather event to rcanada tragedy of the commons man tragedy of the commons
canada,not_removed,increase consular services for kidnapped or abducted citizens involve international experts in the creation of a permanent canadian cadre dedicated to this specialized arena these are the international experts previously successful in dealing with organizations engaged in kidnapping around the world they know who to talk with and how to talk with them to get action and keep the families of the kidnapped victim informed about government actions to rescue citizens because families who feel that little effective government action is being taken may feel the need to raise the ransom to free their family member a few things they already have access to consular services just like any canadian overseas the consulate does keep the family informed with information they are given they cant tell families what they themselves dont know the canadian government already works with experts in hostage release thats how they come to the conclusion that paying ransom is not a good idea setting up a permanent office that deals with kidnappings sets a precedent that i dont think we want to set its not okay to travel to dangerous areas where travel advisories are in place people are going to respect theses warnings even less if we accommodate daredevils by having a permanent kidnapping office in foreign affairs families who are going to go rogue and try to pay ransom are going to do it no matter what the government officials tell them its their right to do that but theyre on their own its understandably hard to accept that a family member who has been kidnapped will be killed no matter what you do whether you pay ransom or not accepting this goes a long way and should be even more of an incentive to respect travel warnings
canada,not_removed,did you draw this yourself
canada,not_removed,you betcha this was my first time rotoscoping anything
canada,not_removed,i think you have a typo the new price is written as but also as almost
canada,not_removed,i somehow got tickets looks like i was a lucky one
canada,not_removed,these are pre sales calm down
canada,not_removed,how is this the fault of stubhub they are not selling the tickets they are a place for buyers and sellers to meet stubhub does not own the tickets to sell
canada,not_removed,youre part of the problem canadians are gouged everywhere this bullshit has to stop sometime and people with attitudes like yours are the reason its just generally accepted
canada,not_removed,i dont disagree with your statement but come on this concert was going to be sold out in seconds anyway given its nature and this is only the first round
canada,not_removed,are you honestly completely overlooking the issue here people including myself arent mad that the show sold out i am mad that a portion of the tickets went to companies that are scalping them tickets were sold electronically to assholes who will sell them electronically for a higher price
canada,not_removed,it wont come down to trudeau vs oleary no matter how hard the liberals wish it to be
canada,not_removed,trudeau hands down full stop no question oleary has no fucking clue what hes talking about refuses to take part in the french debates other things that arent coming to mind right now people may not like trudeau for various reasons although disliking him because of who his father is is really a stupid reason but im sure nobody in their right mind would thing kol would be a better leader than trudeau
canada,not_removed,trudeau oleary has zero experience with politics policy making or anything of that sort he doesnt really have a platform other than some rant about taxes hes a narcissist and opportunist trudeau while not perfect and seems to be more into selfies than actually following through on all of his promises actually has some experience as a politician
canada,not_removed,its not that trudeau is that great its just that oleary is a real idiot
canada,not_removed,trudeau and it isnt even close
canada,not_removed,none of the above
canada,not_removed,id take trudeau any day oleary is unabashed shit we dont need trumplite at least trudeaus pretty enough to get fucked by
canada,not_removed,voted for trudeau he seems to be really cozy with soros lately though so ill probably vote for another party next election
canada,not_removed,nathan cullen
canada,not_removed,i think trudeau would win to be honest i would still vote for oleary in that nightmare scenario though but dear god i hope i dont have to edit as for why i would vote for oleary over trudeau i just simply cant stand trudeau his effeminate mannerisms and literally crying about some dumb issue every month is not a good look for a leader and its fucking embarrassing i know its superficial to vote that way but i truly believe oleary and trudeau stand for the same core principles when you boil them down theyre globalists i just happen to find trudeaus method more distasteful and obnoxious who am i kidding though ill probably vote party again if push comes to shove
canada,not_removed,oleary has some good policies energy independence promarijuana legalization progay marriage proassisted suicide not hysterically antirussian he has some bad ones like profree trade and pronato but those are trudeaus positions too also hes not a lying fuckface like prettyboy trudeau
canada,not_removed,kol is good for tv in sittingdown roles he plays a smart businessman on tv jt is good for smiling and saying friendly things his last name is trudeau
canada,not_removed,if theyre the choice abstain
canada,not_removed,thats a pretty terrible choice heres hoping the conservatives settle on a better leader than oleary i certainly wouldnt mind if the liberals found a better leader too realistically thats not going to happen when the liberals are the incumbent party while were at it mulcair needs to be given the boot too tldr fire everyone
canada,not_removed,literally anyone but trudeau
canada,not_removed,kevin olearly he could very well just be blowing hot air he could very well just be a fraud i understand that but as far as the general direction of his campaign goes i like it its not as easy for young people to transition into adulthood as it used to be things like buying a home and trying to get a legitimate job are all harder now even though im i have daughters the oldest of which is so its still a big problem for me too hes structuring his campaign under the notion of making the transition into adulthood easier while trudeau is busy tweeting about all the wonders of having a brown neighbor oleary can convince young people that hes going to save them from their parents basements regardless of how credible it is that hell follow up on the angle which can also be discussed the angle that hes taking is something thats much more appealing than the trudeau angle can we stop talking about the housing market and just get back to self pleasuring ourselves over our vibrant diversity oleary is trying to appeal to kids who want to be adults trudeau is appealing to kids who want to stay kids
canada,not_removed,hey guys no seriously who do you think would be better trudeau or celine dion please only provide facts and no less than half a page also please consider john candy from the vs and explain which one would be better for the economy and who would create the most jobs and say why in detail
canada,not_removed,i think a board with a smiley face on it would be a better leader than trudeau at least the board cant do any more damage
canada,not_removed,yes and what experience did trudeau have in anything
canada,not_removed,oleary has plenty of httpsenwikipediaorgwikikevinolearypoliticalpositions idk what you are talking about
canada,not_removed,lol
canada,not_removed,so youll vote for the guy who you just dont like over the guy with zero government experience who doesnt even like to live in canada who doesnt even understand how our system of government and constitution work trudeau is a bit of an airhead but frankly so was mulroney and we all lived fine through that ill take the vapid idiot over the incompetent one any day
canada,not_removed,doesnt seem to be applying to the conservative convention though
canada,not_removed,no they dont they just have to dislike you less than they dislike everyone else
canada,not_removed,wheres the nepotism next youll tell me william lyon mackenzie king got to be pm because of his grandfather
canada,not_removed,he was an mp for several years before becoming the leader of the liberals oleary has never held any position in politics or policy making we can argue about politics as a vocation for hours the options were trudeau or oleary im not saying jt is the perfect leader but in this instance he is a way better than oleary
canada,not_removed,next election trudeau will have been mp for years and pm for years more
canada,not_removed,drama
canada,not_removed,must have recently been added because at the time i was looking it up i found very little its also very vague
canada,not_removed,zero government experience you say that like it means anything also trudeaus government experience was minimal before being elected its not like politicians are practicing some esoteric unknowable art at their jobs its just people skills something kevin would have to practice in the business world the incompetent one dude made a lot of money i wouldnt consider him incompetent theres only one way to know for sure if he would be an incompetent pm
canada,not_removed,when oleary breaks multiple large promises to the electorate that voted for him hes as bad as trudeau until then hes way more honest
canada,not_removed,im personally of the mind that being a career politician with experience does not a great leader make most great leaders in history were not policy nerds political leadership is a game of personality and vision im not saying oleary would make a great leader just saying that political experience doesnt mean half as much as people think
canada,not_removed,trudeau won two terms as mp before running for party leader oleary wants to skip straight to leadership without any real understanding of how government works or ever holding elected office if you want to see how a businessman with no political experience might struggle look south
canada,not_removed,olearys personality is enough for plenty of people to never vote for him people already regret electing the guy down south that pandered to them and told them a bunch of unrealistic things
canada,not_removed,never said experience made one a perfect leader but experience sure helps in what ways is oleary fit to run a country politics isnt about personality its about the ability to be a leader for your people at least in a democratic context max weber said something along the lines first year polisci come thru that a leader makes decisions with their head not their heart
canada,not_removed,im a trump supporter so bad analogy i love what trump is doing terms isnt some amazing feat where is the proof that kevin doesnt know how government works saying you need to be a political insider to be pm is pretty elitist in my opinion
canada,not_removed,trudeau was coronated there was no election
canada,not_removed,n what ways is oleary fit to run a country im sure he had a ton of leadership skills in the business world politics isnt about personality its about the ability to be a leader for your people but the ability to be a leader largely hinges on personality traits
canada,not_removed,im not commenting on trumps policies im talking about the fact that from a governance and organizational standpoint he hasnt really been able to get anything done or even seem to understand how legislation works for example his executive orders regardless of the content arent vetted and rolled out without proper consultation his obamacare repeal which should have been a slam dunk with total control of congress was scuttled because his administration didnt understand that it couldnt just force congressmen to vote for whatever it wanted terms isnt an amazing feat yes what im saying is that trudeau had governmental experience before become leader of a party stephen harper had a ton of it which is why his government was incredibly effective and efficient at realizing its goals you dont need to be a political insider to be pm but you at least need to understand how government works beyond shitting on it and giving vague platitudes leading a parliamentary party also depends on the cooperation of your mps and if you have no clue what youre doing youre going to struggle getting their buyin
canada,not_removed,that doesnt answer my question what traits does he possess that would make him a better leader
canada,not_removed,i just said he probably has some leadership skills from the business world the successful businessman thing is probably the only thing going for him as far as i can tell hes also kind of a dick which could be an asset if youre looking for a shrewd no nonsense kind of guy to just get the job done to be fair though i think just about anybody would be a better leader than trudeau
canada,not_removed,for somebody who calls themselves a political expert youre not too good at this whole political analysis thing oleary would not make a better leader than trudeau and thats a fact his platform is vague he shows very little leadership skills and quite frankly he does not have the average canadian in mind just the
canada,not_removed,sure in canada expelled a pair of russian diplomats under similar circumstances it wasnt until more than a year later that the evidence became public when a canadian navy member was charged with espionage on behalf of russia disaccrediting consular staff is a commonly used diplomatic tool as for sanctions canada already has sanctions against russia that date back to the illegal seizure of crimea
canada,not_removed,american state apparatus is so overwhelmingly large and all encompassing any comparison to canada is meaningless as for evidence since when do americans care for evidence
canada,not_removed,you know the real question is do we have a choice even when we have more trust in our government what is this supposed to mean
canada,not_removed,yes i hate using the term since its cliché but canadians are rather sheepish when it comes to our government they make drastic changes to society and little public outcry or opinion is heard we just shrug our shoulders
canada,not_removed,its clearly sleazy even if they get away with it itll come back to haunt them
canada,not_removed,wonder what they would say if the federal conservatives or ndp received similar donations in a similar fashion guess its a case of do what we say not as we do typical for the liberals
canada,not_removed,do they get to be judge and jury
canada,not_removed,see we didnt break the rules we write ourselves
canada,not_removed,we are completely and utterly fd in this country this is not about donation rules but about willing to associate with a man who clearly has a pretty shady past the amount of influence the chinese are allowed to have in our country is completely mind blowing
canada,not_removed,of course they say it can we get a second opinion
canada,not_removed,seems like it was but a year ago that people were gushing about what an amazing campaign trudeau ran and how good the lpc was about message discipline what the fuck happened its looking more and more like the majority of centreleft voters in canada simply decided that the liberals were the best notharper on offer
canada,not_removed,time to change the rules then didnt trudeau say he was going to do that
canada,not_removed,this is right out of orwells animal farm
canada,not_removed,all political parties do shady things unfortunately i didnt expect much to be different than it was under harper its basically just malibu stacey with a new hat
canada,not_removed,bullshit lies lies corruption in this case is clear
canada,not_removed,you cant break the rules if you are in control of them
canada,not_removed,breaking news special interest groups pay politicians a great deal of money in exchange for a favor later down the line this is completely new and unprecedented
canada,not_removed,well my dear vancouver sun the last time we lost our shit over liberal corruption pointed out by conservatives we ended up with a lost decade under harper where everyone but youth especially got fucked up the ass your party doesnt get power automatically when the liberals screw up you have to earn it you have to do better im not gonna switch my vote just cause of this moral panic bullshit harper stole ei money to pretendbalance the budget thats way worse offer a better alternative or shut the fuck up because reading articles like this in the sun is like hearing hitler complain about stalin put up or shut up you losers you had years and you only managed to shit the bed your provincial counterparts in ontario sold a publicly funded highway to a foreign company that charges you dollars to go kilometres fuck you you have to offer something better stop crying about justin and tell us what good youll do for canadians
canada,not_removed,there was a case of this the liberals accused shelly glover of attending an inappropriate fundraiser because as heritage minister the people she was at the fundraiser with would directly benefit from the donations who were the people at the fundraiser actors and artists the average donation amount was about and the total amount raised from the party was to avoid embarrassment the conservatives returned every single penny from the fundraiser the liberal party fundraiser was a head and its likely they would have raised over a hundred thousand from it they might think returning just one donation amount from the fundraiser would be appropriate but really they gotta return all of it they also have to cut ties with people holding fundraisers that actually profit off of them
canada,not_removed,of course liberal party has found the liberal party innocent thanks for the money though
canada,not_removed,we are completely and utterly fd in this country the united states would laugh itself into a fit if they saw how worked up we got over such trivial amounts of access and money to say nothing of brazil south africa or as recently exemplified south korea on top of that anyone putting absolute faith in chinas justice system to tell us that this guy is a criminal might want to take a few moments to look a little deeper into the shoddy state of independent rule of law in china nevertheless these things are something to be concerned about and a bad governance practice but lets not get all bent out of shape here ideally we should return to some variation of the pervote subsidy so no politician needs to also be a fundraiser the ndp bloc and greens are on board so it should be a pretty simple matter to fix should the liberals decide its a priority shame on them that it doesnt seem to be at the moment lets keep our head on our shoulders in the meantime
canada,not_removed,its literally every other day some alarmist posts something about the chinese taking over canada too me it seems like some misplaced anxiety canada having one problem but expressing consistently that the chinese are the problem the solution to the actual problem is a lot more complex than youd like it you want your job your home and your security to instantly gratified and long lasting however the more you keep thinking its a whole race of people thats the problem the more you keep singling them out the more of an us against them mentality you spread the more hate and racism to come keep it up well eat ourselves out from the inside and years from now we might be riled up enough to have our trump
canada,not_removed,obviously not but for delusional trudeau supporters this has to hurt pretty bad this is much worse than anything harper ever did and were only a year in so what does that say about the golden boy
canada,not_removed,politics is not a team sport pointing out scummy behaviour by the government does not mean you support the opposition
canada,not_removed,it is true and even if this guy didnt commit an egregious act of fraud in the process it would still be an example of how easy it is to buy into our political system
canada,not_removed,the eu trade deal went through so it may have not been pretty but to discount someone for succeeding does not make a good argument logically speaking
canada,not_removed,the united states would laugh itself into a fit if they saw how worked up we got over such trivial amounts of access and money dont try to normalize corruption what the fuck are you doing just because its worse elsewhere doesnt mean this isnt really bad
canada,not_removed,years from now we might be riled up enough to have our trump and what a beautiful thing that will be indeed
canada,not_removed,rather have trumplite than jt and his turds
canada,not_removed,we wont have our own trump because our conservatives are religious fanatics unfortunately if the conservatives want to gain traction in this country they need to adopt libertarian approaches to abortion drug laws etc which trump believes is a state issue our conservatives think it is a national issue its a problem of branding for now but its going to be a matter of demographics if trudeau is allowed another several years of importing future voters from foreign countries it is not misplaced anxiety it is justified anger at our politicians accepting what amounts to bribes from a chinese multimillionaire real estate developer you are free to go find other instances of lpc corruption and post them on here if you feel the chinese infusion of money into our political system is getting too much attention if this kind of stuff is not illuminated and criticized when we catch it what do you think is going to be happening behind the scenes
canada,not_removed,you could easily switch out chinese with american here and i dont think the ultimate message would change very much point being its just another form of legitimized but decidedly odious political manipulation its not democratic but plutocratic thats the root cause and thats what ought to be addressed
canada,not_removed,a stab wound is a stab wound and a politician is a politician at the end of the day does it really matter that someone is more corrupt than the other its corruption either way never forget these people claim to serve in our names and proceed to do shit like this every single time
canada,not_removed,yes but that wasnt a fundraiser was it
canada,not_removed,wasnt a fundraiser but was equally slimy cons and libs are just mirror images of each other people are just too stupid to realize and wave the redblue flag in a religious zealot like fashion
canada,not_removed,because its holy shit i remember the facebook reactions to that from the women on my facebook none of whom understand the importance of experience in politics the lpc is good at marketing to those people
canada,not_removed,its a liberal party thing none of the party liberals i know ever seem concerned with corruption they think it is part and parcel of the political process i know many people who sometimes vote liberal but only a couple of party liberals the latter being the ones who go to the fundraisers etc they would see nothing wrong with this because it helps the bottom line these are the people who in fifty years will be cheerleading for liberal leader mohammad abdars campaign to force women to wear shawls well they will insist you should see how bad women have it in saudi arabia they would laugh at your protest
canada,not_removed,dont try to normalize corruption what the fuck are you doing just because its worse elsewhere doesnt mean this isnt really bad corruption seriously someone accused but not convicted by a country without rule of law gives a piddling amount of money to a political party and this is corruption the amount of faith you have in chinas is absurd i dont care what political party this impacts this kind of hyperbolic accusations of corruption without evidence breeds nothing but unfounded cynicism
canada,not_removed,you draw parallels to a time when another whole group of people was blamed for disparity if you want to go full circle make sure you say how chinese the chinese are at being chinese never let the people forget that chinese are the source of their problems if you want to be a better person though separate the race from the issue theres many more that arent buying up homes and giving bribes living rural lives really this is just a problem with financially stable people whats new about the rich not pulling a fair share it happens in every culture you want to be mad good you should be not at the chinese but at any person who is keeping you me and all the other canadians in the dark because businessmen come in all colours if however you choose to not find it strange how everyday someone is trying to tell you that about the chinese problem then you will find that animosity to call your own
canada,not_removed,harper was hated by half the country and still worked his ass off to appease them in some instances trudeau comes in and puts up his middle finger to the half of the country that didnt vote for him i cant believe we were naive enough as a nation to elect pierre ii in a landslide
canada,not_removed,i have a very low opinion of politicians so that isnt an issue for me but that doesnt change the fact that a large percentage of really naive canadians got played
canada,not_removed,someone accused but not convicted by a country without rule of law gives a piddling amount of money to a political party and this is corruption he admitted it and yes cash for access corruption the amount of faith you have in chinas statemanipulated justice system is absurd we dont live in china you spectacular tard
canada,not_removed,the problem with chinese millionaires is that there are a lot of them and their economy is uniquely noncompetitive for its size and strength so when we have a particular country and economy that is outcompeting our citizenry because we refuse to acknowledge that the country of origin is a part of the problem we are taking halfmeasures im not worried about taiwanese millionaires they are the same race whatever that means as the chinese in fact they consider themselves to be the republic of china we arent seeing the kind of influx of money and corruption from that country so we dont talk about them though they are ethnically the same country of origin is not race and the policies and practices of that country can and should be discussed when they cause problems for us
canada,not_removed,thats fair but its also the case every election cycle so eh
canada,not_removed,no it wasnt
canada,not_removed,proof bud
canada,not_removed,he admitted it denies all allegations sure doesnt sound like much of an admission of guilt to me and yes cash for access corruption are you serious well then every political party in canada is corrupt right back to the beginning of the country as is a huge chunk of the globe its a bad policy that provides the opportunity for corruption but it in and of itself isnt corruption the amount of faith you have in chinas statemanipulated justice system is absurd we dont live in china you spectacular tard you dont have two clues what youre talking about anymore go read the article first
canada,not_removed,the problem with saying things like cash for access is corruption is that you actually remove the line for real corruption thats when a politician is given money to do a specific act that is contrary to their position or only founded in their position because of the money canada is a one trade partner country a resource based country china is an obvious target for a federal government to make ties with what a big lumber deal with china would do would be to create jobs chinese are not as open for business if you arent well connected so from a pragmatic view point the liberals are expanding trade opportunities you need to read the childrens book the boy who cried wolf your rhetoric speaks of such extremes no one will takes you seriously when something serious happens
canada,not_removed,his proof is that the liberals found the liberals innocent thats good enough
canada,not_removed,denies all allegations sure doesnt sound like much of an admission of guilt to me wrong again are you serious well then every political party in canada is corrupt right back to the beginning of the country as is a huge chunk of the globe what part of its not okay just because other people do it do you not understand are you being paid
canada,not_removed,all you have to do is find a source that shows this was a fundraising activity for the cpc and perhaps find another source that indicates the cpc refunded monies from this event i doubt you will find them this was a private dinner event a table is the standard price
canada,not_removed,wrong again yeah you didnt read the article did you your response is entirely nonsensical go read it before jumping off on your agenda dont just pounce on headlines are you being paid now youre just embarrassing yourself
canada,not_removed,the loss of mirvish village is the real sad story
canada,not_removed,oh man ive been hearing about this kitschy and lowbrow icon for years now and it still does not make it iconic other than contributing to dilution of the term iconic
canada,not_removed,the kitschiness was a part of the charm and ed mirvish gave back to his community in ways most businessmen dont that is why people in the community have such respect for him and a connection to the building where are you from i wonder
canada,not_removed,i have been following michael chong and what hes said on a number of diff policies and i really like him he could have me considering the conservative party
canada,not_removed,michael chong has been the map for my parents riding for as long as i can remember he does not get the attention he deserves he has solid thoughtful positions and is willing to stand up to anyone
canada,not_removed,i have a question what in the flying fuck did the dragnet surveillance achieve in stopping this attack from happening in the first place
canada,not_removed,as a card carrying member of the conservative party my vote will go to chong in the upcoming leadership race a man who has integrity and is willing to bring proper reform to our nations legislature
canada,not_removed,as an ex conservative party member who switched to trudeau this is a conservative that can bring me back
canada,not_removed,hes not wrong glad someone in that party had the actual balls to call it out
canada,not_removed,hes probably right but theres no way to prove that legally i would love to see trump charged with inciting racial violence
canada,not_removed,there may be a correlation but he cant say it definitively at all
canada,not_removed,and video games cause violence same sort of thinking and its wholly flawed mr bissonnette is to blame no one else
canada,not_removed,whatever we do i hope we learn how to ignore peoples fears lets make sure we shut down discussion and keep everyone thinking the same thing that way well all be safe
canada,not_removed,i assume he is doing it in reference to trumps latest ban except most people in us support it and its politicians job to uphold the will of the majority a new rasmussen reports national telephone and online survey finds that of likely us voters favor a temporary ban on refugees from syria iraq iran libya somalia sudan and yemen until the federal government approves its ability to screen out potential terrorists from coming here
canada,not_removed,says the guy that refused to recognize quebec as a nation make no mistake hes as full of shit as anyone else
canada,not_removed,ive been a liberal my whole life due to having mainly centric values but i wholeheartedly agree from what i have seen of him so far i can say that i really like him he seems to be taking the strong economic approach that is typically the flagship conservative platform but he has also stressed the importance of generally more left wing topics such as immigration and climate change hopefully well be able to see more of him in the future and potentially have him as a candidate
canada,not_removed,this is the first ive actually heard of chong but i went and did some reading up on him and im extremely impressed this guy can be huge for the conservative party
canada,not_removed,anyone but trost
canada,not_removed,ive donated to him and will continue to do so he seems to have the courage of his convictions
canada,not_removed,hes no conservative ahahahah
canada,not_removed,police said the shooter wasnt on their radar at all
canada,not_removed,i say skip the part where we all pick a side and just vote for whoever makes the most sense blind party politics is destroying the us right now people will excuse anything their guy does and demonize the other guy regardless of his actions it leads to antiintellectualism and dishonesty the things that makes canada works so well is that we hold our leaders accountable it would be even easier to do if none of us wore brands
canada,not_removed,psst hes talking about kellie leitch
canada,not_removed,trump is a symptom of the problem not the cause we need to remember this dont be afraid to speak up when you hear someone spewing hate even though they will guilt you into respecting the right to free speech remember that right applies to you as well you have every right to call out an asshole when you see one and that doesnt make you oppressive or a hypocrite we out number them so lets keep it that way
canada,not_removed,hes not talking about trump
canada,not_removed,i dont think trump himself is responsible for this but certainly in my mind he is some sort of a catalyst once you give people permission to act deplorable by example it somehow becomes ok in some peoples minds i mean really if the president of the us can be such a racist and talk about building a wall and people who voted him in are so vocal about their support how bad does it seem to leave a pigs head on a mosque doorstep
canada,not_removed,i would love to see trump charged with inciting racial violence thats pretty pathetic considering he has done nothing of the such
canada,not_removed,what precisely has trump done that you think qualifies as inciting racial violence i know blaming him for everything bad that happens ever is super en vogue on the left these days but you do know inciting racial violence requires you know incitement go shoot those guys these guys are bad and should be attacked not these countries are dangerous and were not going to let anyone from them in for days besides if anything it was le pen who seems to have set this guy off
canada,not_removed,he is calling out politics for endorsing divisive and hateful rhetoric that is quite appropriate more should do it
canada,not_removed,i hope you recognize one day you are promoting fascists the writing is on the wall trump ignored federal courts yesterday that is a constitutional crisis people in the us and this country should be worried we are in step of the fascist play book and it is scary as hell the entire world must unite and resist
canada,not_removed,they can and do express their feelings openly have you been on the internet at the same time chong isnt wrong unfortunate part of reality
canada,not_removed,i dont want to live in a country where people do not share their opinion out of fear of being associated with acts of terrorism people are free to express their opinions but they are not free from the consequences of doing so no one persons opinion directly causes any of these acts of terrorism but it has to be acknowledged that antiimmigrant and antimuslim sentiment are on the rise caused in part by people in public office voicing their antimuslim antiimmigrant opinions
canada,not_removed,you shouldnt equate freely expressing your dissatisfaction with immigration with slaughtering innocent muslims if the only way you can express yourself is with a gun then you dont deserve to express yourself
canada,not_removed,and the classic conservative party member defends hate speech after a massacre
canada,not_removed,quebec isnt a nation though its a province
canada,not_removed,been waiting for a climate change accepting con for so long
canada,not_removed,strong economic approach this mans another typical tpploving oilpipeline building neoliberal in conservative clothing when will you learn that they use this flowery language in order to execute their real plans of economic pillaging has justin not done enough damage in that regard read his economic policy and tell me the part that you agree with
canada,not_removed,ive been a liberal my whole life due to having mainly centric values no if youve been lpc your whole life those are not centric values but somewhere between left andfull out socialism this includes provincially also no thank you we dont your input on the leader sure we might try and get your vote by trying to bribe you with something we dont care about during the election trudeau used electoral reform will that work but stay the hell away michael chong will not be the leader of the cpc
canada,not_removed,as a conservative i dont want him as the leader no thanks why does every canadian seem to value the politicians who believe in big government solutions to achieve their certain set of values this is why i dont like chong i want a candidate who will stick to conservative principles of smaller government fiscal responsibility free market solutions and promotion of personal responsibility every candidate seems to promote ways in which to use the levers of big government to achieve values that can be achieved without massive government intervention
canada,not_removed,well he successfully brought votetheleaderout legislation while harper was still in more productive imo than quitting the party though even that is much better than simply keeping ones head down and waiting it out
canada,not_removed,so the countless officials ive never known or met and who might themselves be so fallible didnt manage to stop this from happening even as you all gave your money and energy to them to fix things for you well thats bad news all around i have to wonder what it all means
canada,not_removed,probably because he wasnt muslim if you talk to the average muslim they will tell you that csis profiles muslims and mosques very aggressively the same is not done to any other demographic
canada,not_removed,that may be but its become acceptable to be extreme before trump that behaviour wouldnt be acceptable now the world is more abusive and hateful and increased violence is the only way it can go the shooter was a trump fan i think canadian politicians give themselves more credit that they deserve
canada,not_removed,aka twiggy of the north
canada,not_removed,this can be difficult especially if its a family member but it can pay off immensely to see the look on their face when someone finally calls them out on their bullshit
canada,not_removed,if it were only trump it could be easily contained
canada,not_removed,what has le pen said that would qualify as inciting racial violence
canada,not_removed,no what he is doing is stopping to follow sjws and globalists that are ruining us with their globalist agendas
canada,not_removed,and what consequences are those
canada,not_removed,and your the lefty using tragedy to curtail rights like speech
canada,not_removed,the only bigot i see here is you
canada,not_removed,nation state
canada,not_removed,its a cultural nation
canada,not_removed,its pretty interesting at the moment the leader is going to determine what kind of election were having in whether it will be calm or an uproar
canada,not_removed,i thought the reformers hunted all them red tories down years ago
canada,not_removed,the cpcs need to take back the party from the reformers that merger was the worst thing they ever did as they effectively gave up their fiscally conservative centrist role over to a much farther right socially regressive group
canada,not_removed,red toryneo con right
canada,not_removed,just my opinion man i like him but you dont have to everyone is going to have a different opinion and i respect that as for his economic policy so far all i have really heard about his his carbon tax which i like climate change is a very big issue for me personally canada and the world but i don understand that in order to overhaul canadas current resource based economy we a strong economic base and the funds to invest in green technologies and renewable energy im a fan of the idea of cutting income and business taxes while implementing a carbon tax which in simple terms will essential shift money away from a general pool of tax funds and have it more focused on environmental issues although this may end up taking away tax dollars potentially being spent on other sectors i believe canada needs to be spending more on reducing our carbon emissions and saving our environment heres a link to a couple articles outline his proposal in case you havent heard about it or dont know the details httpwwwmacleanscapoliticscpcleadershipcandidatemichaelchongpitchestaxoverhaulcarbontax httpwwwcleanprosperitycamichaelchongscarbontaxplananotsomodestproposal honest question what is it that you dont like about the proposal i enjoy hearing other peoples opinions so that i can be more objective on the subject
canada,not_removed,read his economic policy and tell me the part that you agree with httpswwwchongcaeconomicopportunity for others like me who wanted to check it out ill be honest i like what chong says and id be tempted to vote for him but that platform is pretty barebones to say the least of his main points actually have the same action item smbs struggling and housing affordability his answer privatize cmhc and the rest is lowering taxes basically across the board its suitably conservative i guess but pretty lackluster how far along the leadership race are we maybe itll get fleshed out later on his environmental platform is even more barebones institute a carbon tax though ill admit i do like his idea of using the carbon tax revenues to reduce income tax the idea being that heavier users of carbon should pay more if the goal is reducing emissions that seems like a good way to go about it the last part of his platform democratic reform is pretty much hot air and inconsequential imo i dont see anything about freetrade or pipelines or oil in general foreign policy domestic security personally im completely for a federal carbon tax and he might still get my vote just for that im really not sure how i feel about privatizing cmhc to be honest this is the first time ive even heard of that being suggested id love to see the imf research he references in general im not for privatizing crown corps though so id take some convincing finally im strongly against eliminating of the income tax brackets like he suggests im in favor of a more aggressive income tax system even if overall rates are lowered by the introduction of a carbon tax so i cant support that all in all i dont know if theres enough meat in there to really label him a neoliberal but of course since basically all our federal politicians are neoliberals in the end i dont think its an outrageous statement
canada,not_removed,everyone thinks theyre centrist and that anyone left of them is far left and anyone right of them is far right its all relative its good to look at the full scope of the political spectrum from pure communism which is even further left than full out socialism on the extreme left to pure fascism on the extreme right the canadian liberal party is actually right of center just not as far right as the conservative party the green bloc and ndp parties are all rather centrist none of the five largest canadian parties are very far left of center to call the liberals left one would have to ignore any party outside of the five largest political parties in canada eg communism socialism fascism but even then they would really only be merely centrist a onedimensional political spectrum is actually quite limiting as it is possible to be left socially which is probably what you meant when you said the liberals are left while being right economically like michael chong or the opposite right socially and left economically i dont know any canadian party which is here is an example of a twodimensional political spectrum for the canadian federal election here is a description of the axes used in the previous link which shows how much further left economically gandhi and stalin are compared to the canadian liberal party
canada,not_removed,i love how random anonymous people on the internet that i have never meat in my life know exactly what my values are im not saying that i agree with everything the liberals are doing im saying that due to my values i tend to vote liberal as for the the conservative leadership what person doesnt want a leader that they would potentially vote for as a leader for a political party having options to vote is a good thing for myself it would make the next election less about party loyalty and more about actually seeing what each candidate will do as a prime minister im simply saying that micheal chong is who i would like to see as the leader but im not discrediting the other candidates everybody has a certain person that they would like as the leader this is just my opinion screw me for having a political opinion right
canada,not_removed,electoral reform will mean the cpc never win an election again its been a very long time since the cpc had enough votes to outnumber both the lpc and ndp
canada,not_removed,i think there are somethings that can only be solved with big govtbig spending things that the free market doesnt want to touch because publicly traded companies are when working for shareholders on a quarterbyquarter basis forbidden from working towards long term reigning in our telecom industry to be more consumerfriendly harper did this making sure our new immigrants are desegregated and included in society expensive and requires lots of handholding but pays huge dividends tax breaks to encourage longterm growth that would be normally be ignored for short term profits rd for new technologies theres just some things that are expensive and involved and when any of them fall under a key voting point for someone they instantly become less concerned and more comfortable with the concept of big govt im not for things like basic income but if all these selfpiloting vehicles become a thing we have a lot of outofwork canadians thats going to require a lot of people going back to school andor relying on social services we need to make sure canadians can get back on their feet when that happens wont be done without governmentsponsored involvement and our tax dollars i totally get the creeping bloated hand of government however shit can get out of control pretty fast which is why its important for you to vote for small govt people if you feel its needed if everyones on board for spend spend spend it will simply be done without care thats when we get over our heads in debt
canada,not_removed,i want a candidate who will stick to conservative principles of smaller government fiscal responsibility free market solutions and promotion of personal responsibility my guess because a thats unelectable in canada b that just doesnt work in our current world
canada,not_removed,in that case you are free to support the other cpc leadership candidates who are all either halfwits or total assholes
canada,not_removed,but you know if the guy wasnt on the police radar we can follow the money sure i guess however what about his friends family groups on the internet he might be involved in we all have some responsibility here and i just find it hard to believe that he just up and decided one day to go kill people based on sudden racial hate no one should be a tattle tale and people are allowed their own opinions but someone had to have had an inkling that this asshole was unhinged sorry refuse to say the name of murderers or terrorists i just call them all asshole
canada,not_removed,if you watch bissonnettes youtube videos he was a completely normal kid up until at least a year ago i have no idea what happened since then but its a pretty short time frame to radicalized imo
canada,not_removed,score one for the folks with their hands out making all the money that goes for both the private sector and the public sector follow the money always
canada,not_removed,except perhaps indigenous environmental leaders or cindy blackstock who is doing the truly terrifying work of trying to get better funding and treatment for indigenous children
canada,not_removed,by targeting specific religions fascist
canada,not_removed,radicalized idiots who kill people do you not watch the news
canada,not_removed,thats not why trump won trump won because hillary was awful
canada,not_removed,who argued that people cant share their views on immigration it should be pretty easy to do that without descending into hate speech yet apparently for some people it isnt
canada,not_removed,including hate speech right professor
canada,not_removed,it was part of order
canada,not_removed,my interpretation is red tory economically conservative socially liberal
canada,not_removed,just wanted to say that it looks like chong has more detailed background documents for each of those areas for example the one for housing affordibility including links to the imf papers
canada,not_removed,im really not sure how i feel about privatizing cmhc agreed im not turned away by what hes saying but im going to need some more details before he could secure my vote
canada,not_removed,this is awesome thanks for sharing
canada,not_removed,spare me the poli sci lecture the full political spectrum is not relevant to domestic politics here unless you think fascism and communism are relevant to the discussion which they arent baby blue isnt that blue when you look at the full spectrum of colours no we arent talking about the full spectrum in all of existence this is a key problem with comparative politics that will be covered next year in poli sci the lpc is not centre right in any meaningful sense and i dont want any selfproclaimed centrists let me guess i consider myself socially liberal fiscally conservative trying to think their input on the cpc leadership is relevant you have your candidate stick with him
canada,not_removed,you know when i said that i meant we will put it in the platform and not go through with it just to get your votes on election day just like justin trudeau it was also a hypothetical unrelated to my actual point
canada,not_removed,on the other hand there are lots of halfwits and total assholes that support stephen harper and his kind
canada,not_removed,or bernier
canada,not_removed,i know a guy who went to cegep with him aparently is always been very wierd but not enough to warrant a mass shooting
canada,not_removed,no one should be a tattle tale and people are allowed their own opinions but someone had to have had an inkling that this asshole was unhinged probably because throwing him in a prison or otherwise filing charges against him or putting him through the justice system for holding extremist viewpoints would further degrade his chances of leading a healthy and happy existence pol hates normies or something as hard as it is to say it and so much the easier that i get to stand from the sidelines and look in on this thing from the outside even this murderer who committed this terrorist atrocity was at the end of the day a human being
canada,not_removed,im reading news articles here that say he was bullied in school was something of a meanspirited kid and held a lot of nationalist sentiments i know im going to get skewered by the usual suspects just for pointing out that last one i have to stop and wonder if this guy was hopped up on psychoactive drugs that led him to do what he did but im curious to see what the investigations turn up i wouldnt be surprised if he was if he wasnt though id honestly be shocked its one thing to be a smarmy little chickenshit on raltright or whatever and try to accomplish your lifedestroying vision through politics but its really something else to literally and overtly commit a terrorist act completely soberminded especially because i keep being told that no westernerchristian does these sorts of things i guess on some level i actually expected better
canada,not_removed,youre delusional and a bigot the guy wrote in english most of the time on his facebook page was in the cadets usually not the place where you learn the basics of separatism and had pictures of canadian military medals won by his grandfather but of course its separatism its always the scapegoat remember when the separatists were also in favor of islamic terrorists
canada,not_removed,i agree with all that what has changed is that trump has made the xenophobia mainstream and acceptable that has enabled people like kelly leitch and this nut job to feel justified in what they do it must be ok trump does it
canada,not_removed,religions that are profoundly abusive and discriminatory to everyone but themselves he is not imposing anything on the by the way they just cant come anymore for a while nothing fascist about protecting borders
canada,not_removed,so i take you hold the same sentiment over
canada,not_removed,no one should be held accountable for his acts other than himself
canada,not_removed,it will be done my lord
canada,not_removed,i thought they all died out when the conservative party coalition was formed and then absorbed the rest i guess you can say a red tory is essentially a centralist of the political spectrum something which would fit the politics climate today very well in the past people use to be scared of them because they didnt know where they drew the line but identity politics are such a blur nowadays you could be called whatever and do the exact opposite ex bc liberals are actually extremely conservative with their policies and economics
canada,not_removed,did i piss in your corn flakes lol
canada,not_removed,sorry to burst your bubble but even though i probably wouldnt vote cpc in a federal election ill still vote in the leadership race and ive encouraged everyone i know to do the same is a small price to pay to have a chance at keeping our country sane
canada,not_removed,better start reporting any and all incidences of uncanadian activity to justin for safety
canada,not_removed,trump did nothing if our society wasnt already that way there would never have been enough people to get him elected like it or not trump is simply the voice of what a large number a near majority of people in the us believe
canada,not_removed,oh im shook by the way i hope you know mr chong has the same income tax plan as bernier the selfdescribed libertarian even if low energy progressives got their man be careful what you wish for his vision of government is much closer to mine than yours and like ron swanson were going to be chanting slash it slash it
canada,not_removed,youre right except that trump gave credibility to what went unsaid and should have stayed unsaid society is sick but that doesnt mean that the sickness should be made to seem ok
canada,not_removed,why not blame shootings on video games violent movies double standards much are you really blaming discrimination and racism on separatism you should blame yourself for being that ignorant
canada,not_removed,you cant hold anyone directly accountable but that doesnt mean that you shouldnt try people have in the past blamed video games and movies they werent successful im not going to suggest that they are good or bad however trump has legitimized fear and hate and that is unacceptable canada needs to take the high road and not stoop to that level it never has in the past until harper and now the conservatives need to rise above that
canada,not_removed,thats fine thats why i say i probably wouldnt for the cpc in the federal election but id still rather have this guy or bernier running in instead of oleary or leitch or whatever other batshit insane nutcase the extremist portion of the conservative base decides to deify who the leader is will shape the tone and content of the election i want someone who will be able to challenge trudeau without being an egoistical psychopath i havent decided yet if ill vote for chong or bernier i agree both are rather close in terms of policy the knock on bernier for me is his completely retarded plan for cbc
canada,not_removed,but it shouldnt be unsaid the left has spent nearly a decade shouting down anyone who disagrees with them telling people that you cant say that and labeling people who do as racist sexist or some other ist clearly that hasnt worked it allowed everyone who felt that way to think they all were on the same page with those who for one reason or another found themselves on the same side on a particular issue simply because there was no conversation about it for example person is a racist but living in a world where he commits career and social suicide by expressing his opinions he keeps them to himself person is slightly right of center in his beliefs he feels strongly about the value equality and antiracism brings but believes we take in too many immigrants which he feels is bad for the economy and unemployment regardless of their country of origin a discussion between a number of people including person and takes place around the immigration issue its a good discussion and everyone comes away feeling good about it but now person thinks that because person was on his side about reducing immigration they share a common belief which bolsters his belief that he is right in his racist beliefs but his racist beliefs went unsaid so he doesnt really know but he might easily assume that person feels as he does but like him cannot speak about it openly had he lived in a world where he could actually express these opinions without being branded a deplorable he might have learned that most people do not agree with him those people could have had the opportunity to explain why they dont agree and best case he may have actually changed his mind but worst case he still walks away knowing that he is in the minority what trump is saying and doing reflects the beliefs of a good number of people in the us and canada but i think what well find over the next four years is that the people who elected trump are not all of one belief and when those who are more moderate hear how the more radical folks think they will very quickly distance themselves from those people and even speak out against them
canada,not_removed,but it shouldnt be unsaid you can have a civil conversation about right wing stuff without stirring up fear and hate yes he uncovered many issues that needed to be uncovered and brought into the light but he did it in a way that seemed to give legitimacy to violence acts like were talking about
canada,not_removed,my point is precisely that you are quite the hypocrite for making separatism a scapegoat for racism and discrimination in quebec far from proving your point first link you posted is very ironic the news comes after a petition calling for the creation of a consultation commission on systemic racism was tabled by last thursday
canada,not_removed,you can have a civil conversation about right wing stuff without stirring up fear and hate perhaps you can but many liberals ive met cannot it has created an environment where people who disagree with the liberal idea de jour are afraid to speak up seemed to give legitimacy to violence acts like were talking about i cant agree whatever you may think of his policies i can find no instance where he has suggested this sort of act against minorities or any other group is acceptable trump and his followers have a different view of the world than what were used to hearing but we need to hear it because many of these people are hurting economically socially and otherwise if we continue not to listen or fail to have meaningful conversations about what we hear these sorts of incidents will continue personally ill be interested to see how much more attentive the liberal faction gets now that theyre not in power and no longer have the ability to tell these folks to just shut up
canada,not_removed,please no my program is competitive enough as it is
canada,not_removed,what types of people are expecting to cross is it just certain ethnic minorities like post
canada,not_removed,because they fell for the fear mongering ludicrous what some people will believe without proper evidence
canada,not_removed,i am comforted in knowing that my tax dollars are hard at work paying for garbage like this
canada,not_removed,meaning you will have more incentive to get your homework done
canada,not_removed,more like importing their more right wing culture
canada,not_removed,not fair to put all chinese immigrants in the same boat most are very kind thoughtful people obviously it is best to have a healthy balance so one group doesnt dominate the rest
canada,not_removed,funny because most of my chinese student neighbours are the quietest and cleanest residents in my building they are also friendly sociable and ive seen them assisting the elderly with carrying their things on multiple occasions
canada,not_removed,yeah but wont you please consider the universitys bottom line administrations gotta make bank somehow
canada,not_removed,right but rcanada fully drank the trumpomgliterallyhitler koolaid too liberalsprogressives today are like a bunch of bush supporters in the buildup to the iraq war aka not very smart
canada,not_removed,if they are coming to canada im guessing theyll be somewhat on the left or maybe youre right heh and theyre here for the discount
canada,not_removed,plz come to vancouver theres a reason were now home to a tax for foreign home ownership owned by ferrari driving students and housewives as well as a empty home tax
canada,not_removed,rack up them student loans the dean has to pay for his trophy wifes boob job somehow
canada,not_removed,the fear is pretty legitimate in many cases many american scientists are rightly afraid that their funding will be reduced by a trump presidency in fact one of trumps administration has questioned whether the us should fund research at all if any of these students want to continue in academia canada could be a much more stable situation in years
canada,not_removed,well i am trying to think here most university programs in canada have a very specific set number of international applications they accept and the rest of the applications they accept are always canadian so international students coming to study wont effect you trying to get into a program so some really clever students from the usa come in and bust their ass just like the chinese kids do and get good marks meanwhile you also have to bust your ass to secure good grades as well or dont and see where that gets you i fail to feel pity for you because frankly nothing is really going to change you succeed on your own merit you dont fail due to the merits of others you are the sole individual responsible fo your academic success or failure
canada,not_removed,considering americans aversion to single payer healthcare i find it hard to place any of them on the left
canada,not_removed,i think your particular example holds weight though the jury is still very much out and it isnt as if all these schools dont get any income in other ways but still yes for sure for some people anytime theres a new government certain prospects could be better elsewhere and to those people i say hell yeah come give us your money to the rest i mean sure they can come here and pay us too but it doesnt mean they didnt fall for fear mongering
canada,not_removed,oh im done my degree its graduate school that im concerned about
canada,not_removed,true even vermont voted down the single payer option because it would slightly raise their taxes
canada,not_removed,even vermont voted down the single payer option because it would slightly raise their taxes but i thought bernie sanders had it right about healthcare
canada,not_removed,i mean if ultraprogressive places like california and vermont want sph you would think that at a statelevel they would vote yes but it just doesnt happen
canada,not_removed,why not though i thought the will of the people want it
canada,not_removed,no clue as a die hard progressive myself my only guesses are people are more right wing then they say progressives are not voting or the amount of progressives are much lower than most would believe
canada,not_removed,ive never claimed children on my taxes so if someone could explain to me why this couple needs letters from their daycare provider and all the other stuff they outlined is a copy of a birth certificate not sufficient
canada,not_removed,i just throw another toonie into the bin and get another
canada,not_removed,i always use a small canadian flag pin for mine
canada,not_removed,rare earth magnets and crazy glue also means you dont have to stick a pin through technical jacket fabric
canada,not_removed,pin it on as normal to the inside of your jacket use a pair of pliers to slowly bend the end around into a hook it wont come out you can also stick a pencil eraser on it if you dont wanna bend the shit out of it
canada,not_removed,wrap a peasized amount of sticky tack around the needle behind the fabric so it doesnt slide out
canada,not_removed,tape the end of it with clear tape once it is one it will never fall off then
canada,not_removed,put a silicone earring back on the end
canada,not_removed,i use one of the backs to my earrings you can get a little box of them super cheap anywhere you go it works of the time
canada,not_removed,i stick a canadian flag pin through the centre
canada,not_removed,i made a black metal centre and used a rare earth magnet under my shirtcoat to attach
canada,not_removed,not sure if this is all poppies being produced this year or if my local legion has decided to do this on their own but the poppy i bought off of a cadet the other day had a tiny clear rubber stopper on the end seems to be working quite well
canada,not_removed,push the pin back through the fabric and have it then go through the poppy right at the edge it wont fall off and you can put it on another piece of clothing
canada,not_removed,i bought a poppy online that has a proper clip that closes from a site called etsy i think a lot of homemade items i lose the traditional poppies with their open pins at a rate of approximately one per day edit i am remembering now that it took me two tries to get right the widely distributed poppies are wide many of the permanent poppies sold online are much larger and stand out if you go the route of buying one online carefully check the advertised size
canada,not_removed,to those who do not know the poppy is to be worn on the left side of the chest over the heart its a token of remembrance not a fashion statement if you are wearing full military uniform it may be worn on your issue head gear jim b
canada,not_removed,i like this comment
canada,not_removed,that stirs up other controversy since the poppy is supposed to have a black center not a canada flag center but whatever im happy youre wearing one
canada,not_removed,me too i love those pins theyre basically all purpose
canada,not_removed,frowned upon by the legion and not allowed for cf members
canada,not_removed,i dont think those are common to all poppy boxes and i havent seen any around here i do remember the daffodil campaign last year that provided a small white rubber stopper for the end it worked really well to keep the pin on
canada,not_removed,the whole point of buying and wearing a poppy is to support the legion buying a poppy on etsy gives money to an individual not the legion
canada,not_removed,as long as you make an online donation every year this is cool
canada,not_removed,if you are wearing full military uniform it may be worn on your issue head gear no you may not there are clear instructions for placement of the poppy and none show it being on your headgear
canada,not_removed,just like urackemup said you never ever wear the poppy on your head dress in canada dress regs for the caf below positioning of the poppy is illustrated in figure thru figure
canada,not_removed,if you are wearing full military uniform it may be worn on your issue head gear no thatll get you a one way conversation from the rsmadjt depending on your uniform it could go in any number of spots
canada,not_removed,i lose halfadozen of em or so every year which means i put at least into the donation bin im fine with that
canada,not_removed,legion guide says it is acceptable
canada,not_removed,the whole point of buying and wearing a poppy is to support the legion that is one of the reasons but to me its not the primary reason the primary reason to show outward appreciation to those who went to war in the name of democracy i will drop a twonie into a bin in early november but i dont need to keep going back several times in early november to replace lost ones or just give up wearing a poppy out of frustration
canada,not_removed,we go to the legion to get our poppies cause they have the safety pins on them
canada,not_removed,im okay with it too i just hate when i lose it at work and then i dont have one for the rest of my shift
canada,not_removed,thats fair but the legion gets pretty hopped up over fake poppies if youre still making a donation i personally think youre on solid ground but you might get a comment from a legion volunteer
canada,not_removed,i cried a little when i read twonie its toonie please
canada,not_removed,yeah disrespecting the legion is one thing but dont also disrespect the mint
canada,not_removed,so about down in both cases so the long and short of it is that if you cant afford it this year you still cant afford it next year
canada,not_removed,the national average price is now projected to rise by to in with a slightly smaller gain in british columbia of to and a larger gain in in ontario taking the average to
canada,not_removed,not while theres rich chinese and our government on their knees
canada,not_removed,not for toronto and the gtha
canada,not_removed,wow a linegraph will show a periodic dip in only for it to resume skyrocketing soon after that i wonder if this analyst borrowed data from our forex rate they said in that pc sales were going to die and theyve maxed transistor technology its up year over year since
canada,not_removed,aint gonna happen been hearing this for decades
canada,not_removed,watch the sales increase in
canada,not_removed,naw their models vastly underestimate what the massive debt loads massive mortgages combined with massive financial speculation will have when people panic and start to unwind their positions and they will the top of the market has been counting on ever skyrocketing property prices to fund their retirement that necessitates liquidating their positions there are a huge chunk of them right there guess what they all do when they realize prices are going through multi year eeflines interest rates have been the air fueling bubbles world wide mortgages are going up they already are and will continue and the bank of canada cant stop them all we need is china to blow up and wed be in perfect storm territory hell the us may blow up for a real black swan under trump
canada,not_removed,honestly i would love to see a bubble burst just so younger buyers have a chance and fuck over the clowns who inflated the bubble in the first place it would be worth it
canada,not_removed,id move far out of the city if i could keep my internet but because rural areas have shit for service i have to stay in the confines of a city id love to live in one of the areas where i could own several acres of land and pay less than i do now in property taxes but everything comes with a trade
canada,not_removed,for every person who pretends to have a crystal ball ill simply say black swan
canada,not_removed,the problem with homes is that they are expensive in places people want to live but are damn near free in places people do not you would think this would give an incentive for more people to populate cheaper suburbs where properties will be more affordable but everyone wants to stick to city life in my area a house goes for about a million you can get a town house for about a million and a condo for about half a million outside of my city about minutes from the outskirts of the city an average house goes for a townhouse goes for and a condo runs around you would think the price incentive would be enough to bring people out of the cities into the surrounding areas just not the case
canada,not_removed,it is a trend though and probably better than any sudden movements my hope is that everything will eventually balance out a decrease in home prices over five years small enough that nobody will be under water matched by a increase in wages over the same period will do a lot for housing affordability
canada,not_removed,how were you allowed a mortgage did no one at the bank say gee you cannot afford this house
canada,not_removed,who thinks thats a smart move
canada,not_removed,at least you have a house in one of the worlds major cities while of redditors remain in with their parents well into their
canada,not_removed,majority of people i encounter dont believe prices will ever fall at least you can rent it out to save a bit of money
canada,not_removed,anyone who thinks that is wise is mentally ill why did you do it
canada,not_removed,swallowing their economic nourishment to the
canada,not_removed,the continually rising areas are fueled primarily by demand the gta has a annual growth rate of people the city center and all surrounding municipalities are now out of land so the total volume of detached homes must be reduced to build townhouses and towers
canada,not_removed,i dunno pc sales seem to me
