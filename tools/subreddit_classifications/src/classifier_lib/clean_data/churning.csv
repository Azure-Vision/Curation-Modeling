churning,removed,as doctorofcredit mentioned it does vary a bit i could not describe everything in too great detail in my post but here is a bit more of the details for chase cards the quotas were early on with month to month being expected from then on premium cards like the csp would get in the neighborhood of per successful app but that could vary based on the affiliate blogger as well chase was pretty down the line but there could be better payouts for bloggers who were turning out bigger numbers cards like the sw cards were much smaller think less than per app for amex the big ones were business cards in general and the delta and prgbgr cards more specifically the spg cards did not use to be that big but when i had these links the prg could be over with the plat being over amex floated more with the actual payouts based on the numbers than chase did with amex you could not link directly to the american express website on a card offer that was not in the affiliate channel that is sometimes why you will see amex affiliates linking to here or flyertalk for offers that are really big because they are not in the affiliate channel cards like the hilton card did not use to be in the affiliate channel which meant you were never supposed to link to it unless you linked to it on the hiltoncom pages those are just some additional details if you have other questions i may be able to answer ask away
churning,removed,thanks for using my link starpoints after spend within months
churning,removed,i got approved for a chase sapphire preferred yay and just got it today i noticed some things in my approval letter that i was wondering about this is my second credit card ever the other one is my amazon prime store card and i have a below average student loan amount for having just graduated in the key factors that adversely affected your score section of my approval letter number of general purpose credit cards i dont have enough cards or special purpose card is too many number of accounts over the credit line dont know what this means at all balances on accounts compared to credit extended i guess my amazon card was at about utilization when i applied which maybe was a little too high
churning,removed,very wise choices on your first cards im assuming scp means csp best hotel card still out there for you imo is the chase hyatt card free any time nights anywhere statement credit which hopefully you can still get since rule isnt yet applied for chase cobranded cards theyve got some really expensive hyatts in both dc and nyc maybe pair it with a hilton or marriott credit card although their devalued long ago points wont get you very far in dc and nyc

churning,removed,anyone know by chance how quickly the sign up bonus posts from amex delta business gold card statement closes feb and wonder if ill get it by then looking at booking a weekend trip to kansas city
churning,removed,anybody have an idea when sign up bonus points post for the chase marriott am i looking at shortly after meeting the spend or after the statement
churning,removed,i had read reports that min spend bonus for the csr would show up in earning on next statement after the transactions posted however mine have not showed up days after transactions posted to my account any cause for alarm
churning,removed,my serve card is finally here if i load a month to pay rent with the remainder going to ms to start how long until i see a shutdown also is loading serve then promptly paying off a cc a flag
churning,removed,i think i know the answer to my question i just want to follow up with you guys i just was approved for the amex simply cash plus card and it comes with an introductory apr for like months i want to buy a camera lens for and then use the months to pay it off there is no reason not to do this correct just as a disclaimer i can afford the lens now but why not put that money elsewhere as long as it is paid off before the introductory period i shouldnt have any issues correct
churning,removed,quick question im about to spend on a computer and im wondering if i should apply for a card first to put it on that i have the money to pay it back right away im just looking for some type of benefit i heard a radio ad the other day saying something about chase offering double cash back for the first year for new members ive never had a credit card so it seems like a decent idea i know very little about this so i really appreciate you putting up with me if my income and student loan balance are things youd need to know to help me with this i can pm you just looking to see what you would do in my situation from what ive read here the most lucrative reward for me would likely be points on some card that i can spend on plane tickets for domestic us flights

churning,removed,each have the opportunity to fund the a checking with via credit card and fund an savings account with an additional via credit card each of us did the exact same thing however my so received a notice of account closureservice termination after reaching out to a consultant most likely from the fraud department we were essentially told that they didnt have to give us a reason and that the bank made a business decision however they then went on to say that the reason that they shut hers down was because shortly after the funds became available we attempted to to an ach transfer from regions to my other institution within hours her account went from locked to permanently frozenshut down i had not yet attempted a transfer so to test the theory i set up an ach link for the account that i opened myself the one that wasnt frozenshut down but instead of asking regions to do an ach push from regions to the other bank i asked my primary bank to facilitate the transfer i intentionally only removed via ach and left the rest spread across both accounts at regions and there have been no issues for several days also early termination if closed within days this bank is weird wells fargo doesnt even have that
churning,removed,planning to cxl spg amex as i recently received the csr and have an upcoming annual fee on the spg will try to call and ask for loyalty retention first but given the starpoint vs ur points isnt the csr now the better card for spend at spg properties anyways

churning,removed,im not an attorney or legal expert so dont take this as any legal advice but heres why i think amex is in the wrong in my opinion amex created an estoppel by awarding the points upon people completing the spending requirement whether by ms or organic i would assume that most of the individuals who were awarded these points assumed they had fulfilled the requirements of the point bonus and altered their spending accordingly i feel that amex gave the customers who achieved the requirement by ms a false confidence by awarding to their mr accounts regardless of whether the points were frozen or not if amex had just waited several months before awarding the bonus i dont believe they would have been wrong by not filling bonuses to the msers i just feel that by awarding the the bonuses it gave their customers a false impression that the spending requirements were met hopefully some legal experts can weigh in regarding their thoughts on this situation again im not an attorney and im basing my information on the datapoints provided on this site so take my opinion with a grain of salt

churning,removed,boa cr as au csp as au united mpe as au discoverit not in report yet cashback or points which can be converted to cash mostly miles as a backup option united chase ur bos inside us or hawaii or europe was denied freedom and merryl due to low number of revolving accounts aiming for amex bce to get more accounts but missed recent windows with good signup bonus does it makes sense to try citi ty premier or aa platinum
churning,removed,no way would i give up my precious miles so some migrant can come and stab a bunch of people or drive thru a crowd those people need to stay in their own countries with their own radical religions

churning,removed,the csp is by far the best card you can get with the af waived for the first year it comes with the best bonus of a no af for first year card also ms is very easy if you look through my post history you can see i just a couple hours ago posted a pretty simple step by step guide to ms at a cost so even with the csp you will come out ahead and meet the min spend also please if you do apply for the csp use a referral link form the referral link thread from someone who has helped you or deserves it or just ask me and i would be more than happy to provide my own any questions at all feel free to pm me anytime i am also happy to help you figure out ms its really a lot easier than you think

churning,removed,in december i believe or around there walmart added to their policy concerning money orders that if a customer wants to buy multiple money orders they must all be purchased in the same transaction now i am aware that most walmarts are not aware of this rule or do not enforce it but it actually is a part of their policy i just got denied buying two money orders in separate transactions a few days ago with the employee stating he had just watched a video on structuring and money laundering followed up with management and it is indeed in the policy

churning,removed,theres a bank i use called simple httpswwwsimplecom and theyre pretty much solely online as well they actually tell you in order to deposit cash to get a money order from usps because they have no atms i use them as my personal bank but it could be a good ms bank since they are mo friendly let me know if you end up going to join as we can both get a free wallet out of it

churning,removed,back in august i ordered three pairs of shoes from nordstrom online and finally got around to returning two of the three pairs this week i had applied two gift cards to my order total and paid the rest with my chase fu and i ended up getting the full returned balance back onto my card instead of on another gift card the sales associate helping me with the return actually said its easier to put it all on the card this is apparently their store policy and i am curious to try buying a nordstrom gift card with my credit card to earn points make a purchase with my debit card and then get the full balance on my debit when i make the return in this case my return went back on my chase fu but i dont see why it wouldnt work on my debit card could be a nice ms option

churning,removed,hey there as usual ill talk more about how i use the card than what the benefits are everyone else has half a screen worth of the signup bonuses etc i have rotating cashback cards but neither will cover everything this quarter for instance my discover card and chase freedom dont cover groceries or gas i dont shop at costco or amazon pantry so the blue cash is my go to card for groceries and gas in the next months the blue cash is a pretty solid card just to have as backup my only warning would be that if you plan to hit amex credit cards pretty hard you may want to hold off because of the or rumored credit card limit just a tip in case you get as deeply into churning as i did thanks back after in purchases in months yada yada supermarket and gas and other stuff blah blah

churning,removed,to be honest i dont know why you wouldnt get amazon gcs instead you can even get ebay gcs honestly i think thats more valuable personal suggestion from me buy ebay gift cards via mpx use ebay gift cards to buy gift cards on sale on ebay you can buy aa gcs ebay offers ebay bucks so you can get between of your purchase back in ebay bucks there are often sales on gift cards like for a bp gas gift card combine gift card sale ebay bucks shopping portal like wwwsplendercom to get gift cards really cheap ive gotten gas gift cards for off this way use the gift cards or sell them if you want for profit on a website like wwwraisecom or wwwsaveyacom i guess the drawback is you have to select united as your carrier that means you cant get the bonus when paying with points i think thats for platinum only please pm me if you want to sign up for a shopping portal or raise i have a referral link many do but id appreciate it

churning,removed,i think my post was taken down so here
churning,removed,just applied online for the sapphire reserve via the link posted in churning instant approval link below i was at just closed on a refinance other open cards i have are the chase freedom chase sapphire preferred which i will close shortly citi prestige ill close this prior to paying the yearly fee capital one quicksilver used for ubers only citi aadvantage need to close this one amex blue cash preferred need to close this one as well combined income with my wife credit score is approved for a limit with variable
churning,removed,this is the only one i have seen
churning,removed,would be nice to have applicants dp replies only my dp ink was my back on income instant approval online with cl gl to all
churning,removed,has anybody used the old original link over
churning,removed,from this morning
churning,removed,
churning,removed,first ever post on reddit lurked past few weeks hope i do this right dp csp freedom united income rent fico instant approval online
churning,removed,fico so far plus chase cards with balance round due to apr months income what are the chances of getting approval
churning,removed,so if days what should you do next how long to wait do you need to call recon at all should i request expedited card or keep calling back in until i get approved notification at that id like to get the card within the next weeks
churning,removed,another interesting observation from applying today branch manager said application interface was new and she had some issues with filling it out any one else hear his from the chase reps they sat with
churning,removed,went into store to ask about expedite guy told me hed already called once in the am and was told they werent as its brand new he reckoned id get it this week anyway
churning,removed,loan opened chase amex and one citi card in last months chase was months ago also opened one store card i did recently open a new student loan account but o dont think they consider those with the rule only ccs although that would only put me at exactly income credit score low due to multiple recent apps and hp cli initially got day language called to check app status got the week language that i have read on here was favorable called recon line and gave up after minute wait got called by chase about minutes later to verify some information and was approved while on the phone limit whole process took about hours from when i applied to when i got off the phone with the approval
churning,removed,
churning,removed,so youre saying having both the csr and csp is a good idea also pm me your referral link please
churning,removed,tu eq chase csp limit other bofa travel rewards platinum limit i went into the branch and got a pending but was told it would be expedited it as soon as it was approved i was suspect of the pending so i wanted to call to verify but by the time i got home and logged into my account the csr was there with a number and a limit im assuming this means it was approved i never received a call or email or anything since leaving the branch and was not pre approved as far as i know
churning,removed,are both you and your wife getting a card my wife as approved for and idk if i should get my own
churning,removed,i agree with you this sub is either full of liars or full of kids using their parents income even though that is not the income chase is asking for i said it before im sure every one on this sub has a dick too except for the woman because then that would be unusual ummm maybe a deep vagidk if thats a braggable thing i digress as far as intelligent thats a non sequitur

churning,removed,
churning,removed,these referrals dont give the user the credit use this instead
churning,removed,so im assumingguessing you are over if not my advice below would be different based on the info you provided me i would recommend getting the spg credit card the spg card is a better daily card than the aa plat since it offers aa miles spent vs aa mile spent but you could also transfer the miles to any of the other airline partners or use the points for hotel redemptions also spg hotels have a policy of offering base rooms for redemption if there are rooms available to sell which means award availability is greater than other hotel chains the downside to the spg card is the signup bonus is only points vs the all time high this past march but who knows how the signup bonus will go up and down pm me if you want a referral the hyatt card is great since you get free nights good at any property including all inclusive resorts for coachella i personally recommend looking into airbnb options i did that with some friends in and it was a way better option than paying for a hotel room award availability will be tough in general since hotel rooms tend to sell out for coachella
churning,removed,yes lets please sure and use each other so we dont raise any flags here is my referral link

churning,removed,why the fee for an authorized user i realize we dont have all the details yet but it doesnt seem like the au will get any perks if the only benefit is having the additional potential spend the au would have to spend just to offset the fee

churning,removed,seems interesting and worth signing up its free so i guess theres nothing to lose here is my referral link the question is if you start with graphite do you need to spend another or to get to the level i would assume this is like airline elite status if aa matches you to platinum level you still have to fly miles to get to executive platinum level its also not clear how the cash back works if i spend in a year do i get back on what i spent for the year or do i get obviously a pretty big difference and the latter would result in a net return which is fine but not earthshattering i realize if you hit the highest level this year your status carries over to the next year so in year i guess youd earn the straight

churning,removed,hi i am relatively new to milepoints and just got the cpr today had to call recon line to verify address and used the tip to call amazon to expedite as i we are travelling this weekend i wanted to get an opinion if i could get this card for my wife i am here on a visa so i have a ssn but my wife has whats called an itin she is not allowed to work but we use this number instead of a ssn when doing our taxes she is an au on my existing chase ua which i have had over two years paid in full every month since the beginning i asked one of the chase reps if she would qualify to apply for a credit card given she only has an itin and they seemed to think they would he mentioned to use our household income since she is a stay at home mom when i checked for prequalified cards online nothing came up for her i had three cards of which one was csp i am thinking if i can get her cpr i should and if i cant then does it make sense for me to get a csp and downgrade that to a freedom next year with the cpr i am now at i have three cards one with chase all obtained over two years ago she would be au on chase ua but over two years ago we are canadians and have established credit history in canada if that makes a difference we have a chase branch a couple blocks form our house is it better if she goes to the branch or ok to apply online cu on my current chase ua card is but we pay in full with the new cl on cpr the total cu on botht he chase cards would be under and even lower if we add the other two cards we have she is an ua any help is appreciated

churning,removed,credit scores are according to credit karma at least until my amex cards hit my report discover it csp cancelled arrival freedom bank of america travel rewards citi aa chase ink mb plat delta business gold amex i am targeting miles that i can use around the world i will be traveling from september until june next year i have the miles from the cards listed plus a little bit from my frequent flyer account i fly from pdx delta hub i am doing a lot of flights out of europe and pdx i was thinking about hitting amex angtrying to get the spg and the pgr i do not want to get the fr call from amex though my income is only so they may get suspicious if i am meeting all these minimum spends i would also like to nab a few more before i leave so and cards with a lot of miles for signup would be great i was also hoping to get a flyer for aa plat so that i could use the loophole let me know if you guys have any suggestions just try for the mpe
churning,removed,dude reading your post history you obviously love giving legal advice and shitty statutory interpretation even though you are clearly not a lawyer im not going to argue with you on the internet but you are a fucking idiot and your advice sucks
churning,removed,im looking to sell chase bonus miles im not sure if this is the right place theres a off discount on the transfer fee going right now so it would cost to transfer the miles to your account please message me if interested

churning,removed,total newbie question how exactly churning works with mos is it as simple as buying visa gcs with fees and then using those gcs to get mos and then depositing them in bank so you guys are making credit card points with this whole cycle right is it really worth it can someone give an example of how much can one actually make going through this whole series would appreciate some insights and guidance from al you pros here tia

churning,removed,can mr points be transferred the company i work for a small family owned company uses amex for everything and has a ton of mr probably earn half a million at least every year the owner told me they always redeem them for home depot gift cards because thats the best point ratio i just looked online and it looks like its per point im willing to bet he would basically sell them to me for the same price maybe even a bit less if i asked he told me they usually use the home depot gift cards as christmas gifts because our business has nothing to do with anything home depot would offer what value would you guys buy mr at is cent per point too much thanks

churning,removed,havent msd before but ive signed up for the csr csp and amex bcp i dont think ill need to ms but can you all clarify something for me i thought the purpose of ms was to not actually spend the money however if i buy vgc using my checking account mo that back into checking and then pay off my cc im still down its less certain but wouldnt it make sense to buy something like a laptop not open it and then hock it on cl or ebay for close to the purchase price that way ive got that looks like natural spend and im down a few hundred from the resale
churning,removed,
churning,removed,
churning,removed,hope this helps someone applied for for csp and fu on got the day message for both after submitting the application i remembered i had received an invitation in the mail for the csp so i looked for the letter and saw that it had an invitation number on i called to check the status of my applications and was told both were denied csp reasoning was due to too little credit historyrevolving accounts and high utilization of available credit and fu was due to too many requests for credit while on the line i tried to get the analyst to reconsider the csp application but the analyst said she could not do anything about it so i figured i would call again a few days later to speak to another analyst called again on and asked the analyst if having an invitation code for the csp wouldve made a difference and he said that he was unsure and that i could give it a shot after failing to get him to approve the csp app i figured i would try to get him to reverse the decision on the fu and he was able to get it approved after ending the call with the analyst i submitted another application for the csp with the invitation code and was instantly approved so despite failing to have a credit analyst approve my csp application twice i was able to get the csp by submitting an app with the invitation number tldr use the invitation number when submitting csp applications

churning,removed,since you need a referral link to get started here is mine hopefully we can all piggyback on each other rather than the links on the blogs
churning,removed,please help each other heres my link for points
churning,removed,normally i wouldnt so sorry if this is still a bad move but as you apparently need a referral link to started in order to get the max points yourself here is a referral link that helps both of us out thanks in advance

churning,removed,my first csr billing statement closed last week after just weeks of using it and the annual fee hasnt posted yet not even on my current statement when did you guys see your annual fee post
churning,removed,does anyone have experience cashing balance transfers from chase online it only takes a credit card number will a csr accept a bank address and a checking account number also does anyone have any tips to get around the rule imposed by chase note the total balance transfer requests made online andor with a customer service specialist cannot exceed within any day period

churning,removed,called about my csp that is reaching its year anniversary late next month they said that they can only downgrade it to a cs not an fcu but if i waited until just after the year they would be able to make the jump directly and refund the annual fee has anybody had issues w that plan
churning,removed,looking for card to strengthen my credit currently have discover card for year cl im a college student so income and aaoa arent good enough for the premium cards so ive been thinking of getting a better balance from boa or a fu im at so i wont be getting into the premium cards until im able to get higher cls

churning,removed,the adventures of mr magoo a friend who tries to churn continue friend just got the csr and told him to not use plastiq because it would have a high chance of being considered a cash advance with chase fast forward beyond the pointer im informed he is on his way to meet spend because he used plastiq for his upcoming rent also plans on buying xmas gifts on another card despite needing to meet spend on his new csr which also was a lucky grab to begin with why because the csr has interest youaredoingitwrong

churning,not_removed,care to explain if i have a flight at and i go to airport at then i expect to have to pay for my bag at that time that would still be i dont understand why this question was asked as it seems obvious it would be im not being a pain im genuinely wondering what im missing
churning,not_removed,dont be so confident its true ive read that while its not advisable to count on this that the credit counts based on the transaction date not the date posted nor the date the credit would post but hey you can report back with a strong dp to verify what their exact policy is
churning,not_removed,the charge wont post for a day or two and wont get credited for another day or two your last chance to use amex credit was probably yesterday
churning,not_removed,charges usually take a couple of days to post to your account
churning,not_removed,its when the transaction posts with the weekend and holiday will be tuesday at the earliest
churning,not_removed,care to share where you have read this
churning,not_removed,oh ok thanks that makes sense
churning,not_removed,the user mia who seems to be a pro
churning,not_removed,if this is the case then being wrong is a good thing thank you for the information
churning,not_removed,sure thing i hope its true too
churning,not_removed,if you are approved the new card will show up in your online account automatically if it is not showing up within days of approval then better call n confirm
churning,not_removed,check your online account is it there
churning,not_removed,when did you call in relation to when you applied it is likely the letter was sent before you called with a decision based on the info they had at that time
churning,not_removed,i work in credit underwriting and it easy to happen it the wrong button and then correct it or maybe a glitch and multiple applications were submitted and only approved one card call them to make sure
churning,not_removed,i applied for chase cards before set in and they both went pending on recon a csr said i was approved for both and even gave me credit line numbers a week later i get a rejection letter because the decision was overturned upon review by another analyst maybe something similar happened to you check the app status phone number and your online account for the real decision i got of the cards approved on recon so if it was denied huca
churning,not_removed,this has happened to me every time ive had to call recon they normally warn you though the denial triggered a letter but you should still receive the card
churning,not_removed,for chase cards in general do they ever do instant approval for online apps or do they always give the customary youll hear from us boilerplate message
churning,not_removed,yep youll get a second letter with approval i had the same thing happen to me last week for csp but both letters arrived on the same day i called up and they said it was definitely approved
churning,not_removed,and the nice thing about this is you can request a free credit report from the cra within days because there was a record of deny of credit
churning,not_removed,they will do instant approval on nonink cards in my experience pending means denied and you should call in
churning,not_removed,yeah but who pays for credit reports anymore anyway
churning,not_removed,can anyone else attest to this statement as true i believe ive seen some that have gone to pending that have been approved after review
churning,not_removed,being able to pull the current report is still useful all the free services give you free report periodically rather than on demand
churning,not_removed,xpost from rfunny
churning,not_removed,spg points also transfer to amtrak guest rewards which are valued at cents per point
churning,not_removed,nice to see your posts again you were missed
churning,not_removed,might be worth adding that the amex biz cards dont report on personal so those under can still get in on the spg points before the offer ends
churning,not_removed,this may not be worth adding to the post but one of my favorite postmerger redemption options is highlevel marriott hotels particularly category marriott cat is all of their nicest hotels other than the ritz carlton brand and is the equivalent of spg points per night especially compared to spg categories and there are some real winners here examples stay at the algonquin times square for points per night or the much worse in my opinion w times square for points per night like skiing you can stay at the westin near vail co at or at any number of marriott resorts for going to london there are multiple topnotch marriotts in the per night range the best you can do with spg if you actually want to be downtown is
churning,not_removed,on a roll lumpy on a roll
churning,not_removed,great post i definitely saved it i would add as a big music fan the amex front of the line access to presales have been awesome yes any amex works for this but its hard to put a price on always knowing you can get tickets to your favourite shows i stayed at a marriot recently and the merged service gave me elite status with them meaning i could use the free food and drinks lounge there too cool bonus
churning,not_removed,im super lame in that i use spg points only for hotel stays but i get so many of them its kinda nuts after a couple of sheraton work stays then i can stay for days at a four points anyway my point being you can get big value from the spg program even if youre super lazy it inherently is the easiest one to get value from marriott will probably reduce the value at some point in the future or at least thats the fear but thats the future for now for today get the card use it youll get value from it if the program changes later dump the card if you no longer see the value
churning,not_removed,with respect to sharing points between accounts there hasnt been much attention paid to how spgs limit ie accounts must be registered to the same address for days before you can transfer has effectively been lifted due to the marriott merger with marriott you can transfer to literally any other account without any time restrictions you can transfer from spg self marriott self marriott other spg other this helped my so and i when we were booking our last trip and she needed a boost to her aa acct
churning,not_removed,often overlooked in the calculation of value of hotel rewards is the savings in sale and occupancy taxes which can easily reach or more
churning,not_removed,ill back watching spg moments i was in australia for awhile and woke up one morning to an email offer for two tickets to the traveling cirque du soleil show in melbourne dead center stage including meet greet with performers beforehand with drinks gift bag with random stuff including soundtrack cd intermission drinks snacks and free parking it was only starpoints such a great deal theres really some gems if you watch out for them
churning,not_removed,got my wife this cardafter i hit my on chase will be using her referral link to get myself an amex spg
churning,not_removed,i am finding that the ability to transfer to marriott is a huge help for hotel redemptions for example using awardmapper for point costs in various citys around italy where my next big trip will be i can use less total points by transferring and staying at a marriott than i would if i stayed at an spg property sure the marriott may not be as nice but i care most about stretching my points when the properties are both in similar locations for me this perk is really valuable
churning,not_removed,awesome post just want to remind everyone that tpgs point values are approximations do some digging to find the best redemption options for you air france is a spg amex transfer partner and runs monthly award promotions at off normal redemption rates combined with the transfer bonus this can be a great deal if you live near one of their promo destinations poke around spg categories centspoint isnt uncommon have seen category as high as centspoint its hard to beat marriott nights and southwest flights right now example itinerary feb at marriott category mauna kea resort southwest points companion pass through dec works out to about companion pass for spg points thats centspoint not including the companion pass
churning,not_removed,how much longer can we expect spg points to continue as a separate program im thinking what to do with a remaining stash of k spg me and so have already used k for a nightflight marriott package
churning,not_removed,my understanding is that with the nights and flights packages for marriott you can stay at a higher category property than the package you purchased by paying the points difference this lets you redeem a package without having an exact redemption in mind is that also the case for spg or so you need to have more foresight with spg packages thanks
churning,not_removed,included in the sidebar
churning,not_removed,i love my spg points i go for quantity over luxury in my free stays unlike hilton where there are very few properties is the cheapest couple of tiers there are plenty of properties with starwood and considering that turns into on weekends its not unreasonable to get free nights from this one card bonus theoretically possible to get more of course but even im not the type to schedule my whole vacation to squeeze out every penny of value
churning,not_removed,this card has already paid the annual fee for itself plenty of referrals and amex offers a few months ago i had the sams club amex offer for cash back i bought a gift so i only got back minus money orders fees but you were able to get up to cash back definitely keeping this at least for a second year
churning,not_removed,great post thanks for the breakdown
churning,not_removed,this is extraordinarily helpful as i just signed up for this card as my first amex
churning,not_removed,if you pay the points cash with the spg card cash portion do you get double points for that charge
churning,not_removed,if a family member applies for a spg biz with their ssn and address can i add my spg number to it or is that a nono or should i use the suggestion as provided by uhmsbugles you can transfer from spg self marriott self marriott other spg other this helped my so and i when we were booking our last trip and she needed a boost to her aa acct
churning,not_removed,is there more information anywhere on using the spg mariott sw to meet the additional points i need on the sw companion pass
churning,not_removed,how soon after being approved for the spg cards are you able to generate a referral link i plan to get the business and personal for both me and the wife if i get each version first will i be able to refer her before the bonus expires
churning,not_removed,does someone know if flights booked directly with starpoints earn ff miles this can be an extra value to redeeming for the flights instead of transferring to a ff program

churning,not_removed,ive read the horror stories about mr points being frozenclawed back for any msing on mrearning cards are there any risks to your mr portfolio if you ms on a cobranded card
churning,not_removed,great write up are you positive the business spg doesnt affect my personal credit score im looking to get a mortgage soon and dont want to risk my score hurting
churning,not_removed,if someone applied for the spg card and they are being assigned a membership number how do they obtain that
churning,not_removed,looking for a dp on how long to wait in between applying for spg business and then personal auto approved for spg business earlier today
churning,not_removed,if i have a freelance business and i apply for the spg biz with my own ssn will that affect my regular credit
churning,not_removed,its also probably worth noting that the boingo wifi does not apply to inflight the axp plan only provides access to landbased wifi services and does not include inflight wifi
churning,not_removed,youll have to update for the lower spg bonuses be sure to include the marriottchase ur cards about how they can transfer over
churning,not_removed,current offer is up to bonus for spend one of those mystical weeks during the year
churning,not_removed,is plat spg is a bad transfer
churning,not_removed,great call out
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,good idea
churning,not_removed,this is good info thanks for sharing
churning,not_removed,yes but marriott does have restrictions httpswwwmarriottcommarriottrewardsusebuydonatemi per transaction unless gold and up up to points per year so only under spg points
churning,not_removed,great call out
churning,not_removed,but marriot nights are not count towards cp are they
churning,not_removed,thats a nice example itinerary i live in new york have never used southwest before travel a couple of times a year to austin and florida we are a family of still deciding if i should transfer my spg points to marriot and get companion pass doesnt have any specific travel plans in usa or caribbean this year
churning,not_removed,everything is just speculation i would just keep an eye on major program change notice from amex as the spg card itself will likely be the most complex issue to unwind if marriott can work out the it stuff
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,its my personal opinion that the most underrated sweet spot with starpoints are category properties getting a weekend room for starpoints when the cheapest room around is selling for is a very good feeling
churning,not_removed,yeah i definitely regret only getting one on that deal
churning,not_removed,if you need only southwest httpwwwmarriottcomrewardsusepointsmorerewmi
churning,not_removed,got a biz last week and i am already able to generate referral links for it so its pretty quick
churning,not_removed,there really havent been any high visibility clawback outside the leaked mr cards so folks feel this is safe for now
churning,not_removed,that is the current report by multiple people if your score is above by quite a bit it doesnt really matter for the mortgage anyways
churning,not_removed,you can probably get that from amex i would always recommend that you create an spg account first though
churning,not_removed,i would not purchase points at that price unless you have an immediate use for them that is worth more applying for the card sure potentially buy them at about a penny per via expenses paid sure over cents each no
churning,not_removed,there will be a hard inquiry on your ssn if that is what you are asking
churning,not_removed,done
churning,not_removed,sure thing
churning,not_removed,mr to spg in the us is not a good ratio
churning,not_removed,this is tyranny
churning,not_removed,i believe there are dps that if you have a specific redemption in mind they will let you transfer more
churning,not_removed,about the fee i made two transfers and was never charged a fee it might be ymmv but i asked explicitly about the fee both times and was told no
churning,not_removed,they do count for one more month only after the will no longer count so act quick if youre going to transfer for a cp
churning,not_removed,they are until
churning,not_removed,swa flies out of lga and islip worth seeing where they fly cheaplydirectly btw the companion pass is good for the remainder of this year and all of
churning,not_removed,thanks for the detailed response
churning,not_removed,awesome thanks for the info and the great post
churning,not_removed,but does it has
churning,not_removed,its in canada but ive never heard of a canadian plat
churning,not_removed,seems to be the new trend in general
churning,not_removed,i wish i knew this i coulda saved a flight by getting companion pass earlier
churning,not_removed,its waived if you have gold status or better
churning,not_removed,i was actually able to generate referral links immediately after being autoapproved for the card and adding it to an online account so its possible to get the card and immediately refer someone in that case did this last year with the personal
churning,not_removed,if the question is would an amex biz spg count against as one of the five the general consensus is no i personally did not pull a report to confirm
churning,not_removed,highest canadian offer is but the real value comes from referrals amex canada still allows cross card referrals within the same family
churning,not_removed,my father had a dormant account with zero status and soon to expire points wasnt charged anything to transfer points to a silver account ie neither account had status this was just over a week ago
churning,not_removed,i and so had no status at the time either
churning,not_removed,hmm okay everyone seems to say it doesnt but i dont know if thats true or not
churning,not_removed,huh thats interesting the terms state its only waived for gold or better but good dp
churning,not_removed,removed for being breaking rule offtopic to answer your question this has a small margin for error limited net gains and assumes that you have enough in an emergency fund to float the difference should your cash get tied up not worth it
churning,not_removed,first balance transfers almost always incur a fee the main problem with your idea is that many people would fuck up most people dont have the discipline to not buy that fancy new iphone for with their newfound money might as well get the iwatch too and a ipad to complete the set you get the idea relevant dad is a personal injury attorney he constantly tells stories of winning settlements for his clients after they got their settlement check his clients would frequently go out buy lots of shit and be broke within a year
churning,not_removed,ive entertained a similar concept except i wouldnt bother with any balance transfers id ms the money i want to float use it to pay the debt that has interest and use next months ms to pay the previous months balance alternatively you can float the balance between different cards with differing due dates this is extremely risky behavior as your depending on ms avenues staying open and banks not shutting you down i dont do it personally and dont recommend you try but i know of others who have done with great success like floating an auto loan for years while paying no interest and making ms profits
churning,not_removed,there is a huge downside if there is even some uncertainty on your future cashflow also terrible idea for people who are mediocrebad with managing money
churning,not_removed,im confused why wouldnt you just use the balance transfer card to payoff the loan directly and then put natural spend on your other cards what benefit is there to paying for all those gift cards
churning,not_removed,absolutely nothing is stopping you from doing that thats how i got through months of unemployment by buying vgcs using paypal credit and let me tell you its a very good thing paypal doesnt report to credit agencies because they did not get paid back for a very long time they dont give me credit anymore
churning,not_removed,as long as you always have the cash reserve to pay off the balance and you are getting a balance transfer fee there is nothing wrong with this idea except for the potential loss of signup bonuses due to various rules such as chases heres the key inflation means that it is always in your interest to take a loan as long as you can pay it off by the time it ends this is the reverse of the adage never give the government a loan with respect to getting your withholding right which is not to say you should do something stupid and invest the money from your balance transfer – youre one flash crash away from wiping out any gains ive used multiple balance transfers to an alliant cu card even though i could pay the balance in full and im also not paying my freedom unlimited in full even though i could amortizing your spending over time is smart many other comments have gone further into the potential pitfalls of this strategy and they are very real it is important to keep a cash reserve capable of paying off the balance at all times the other thing to keep in mind is that you can moot the activation fee by buying vgc at the right place for example with the bcp you can get cash back on up to a year in purchases at a grocery store the activation fee on variable load cards at is just a little over usually you net quite a bit especially if you arent cashing out for mos in fact you can think of this just like the manufactured spending strategy of converting vgc mo except vgc balance transfer where balance transfer makes sense if the fee is less than the fee for an mo with the additional bonus of paying down higherinterest loans faster which requires a whole separate calculation
churning,not_removed,if someone has a car loan at they will not be capable of pulling this off there is a reason high interest rates are charged usually the borrower has had a less than stellar past with money
churning,not_removed,why would you need vgcs just balance transfer your student loans onto your apr card
churning,not_removed,aside from getting a whole mess of points at once theres not much point having cards with high utilization even at could prevent you from getting approved for new cards the other downside i see is missing out on bonus point categories and other card benefits like extended warranty since youre actually doing purchases with the vgcs and depending on the merchant getting a refund to a vgc can be a pain
churning,not_removed,whats stopping you from opening up a new card buying a whooooole bunch of vgcs with it and then immediately transferring that balance to a apr for months type of card then just using the vgcs for your regular expenses while you use the extra relative cash flow to pay down the balance on your loans huh there are extra steps in here that cost money but dont seem to have any benefit open new card buy vgc fees transfer balance to different card fees unless slate use vgc for regular expenses use free cash flow to pay off loan faster how is that better than open new interestfree card use that card for all regular expenses use free cash flow to pay off loan faster this achieves the goal of shifting more money towards the interestpaying loan and the debt temporarily towards an interestfree loan
churning,not_removed,theres no point in moving fast youre also dangerously ignoring the need for float you have to have cash set aside to cover any action especially if you ms and the method is delayed for a variety of reasons toying with balances and interest is bad policy youre always assuming a theoretical best case scenario which doesnt hold up to real life conditions one delay or emergency event and suddenly you end up paying a lot more than you had planned banks love it when you attempt to transfer balances because they have the analytics to know one little slip up and they own you
churning,not_removed,dont tell people to use common sense when it comes to apple products i need my aapl stock to continue to go up i usually recommend the ideal setup to include a imac macbook pro ipad mini ipad pro iphone and the iwatch that way you always have a device for any what if scenario the most important part is to upgrade every year theres nothing more wrong than using a year old apple device btw while i have and iphone and ipad my main device is a pc and pro
churning,not_removed,you almost can never pay off loans with credit cards
churning,not_removed,if youve got high interest debt you shouldnt be worried about these things anyways
churning,not_removed,no fee balance transfers used to be common but now theyre kinda rare but it looks like chase slate still has no fee balance transfer when done within days of opening the account it also used to be possible for some cards to get a check sent directly to you as the balance transfer which might simplify your situation but that might not be possible anymore
churning,not_removed,you might be able to cut out the vgc part some companies let you pay by card directly toward a loan this way you could pay with a card that gets your points and them maybe transfer to the chase slate card for interest and no transfer fees
churning,not_removed,dont forget apple tv
churning,not_removed,rpfjerk
churning,not_removed,if theyre financially responsible theyre not likely to have a lot of debt at high interest rates to begin with
churning,not_removed,then what is a balance transfer
churning,not_removed,once its charged off on a credit card its not the loan companys problem anymore the student loan is paid off why would they care they dont need to come after you because theyve been paid you absolutely can pay off a student loan using a balance transfer check and turn it into credit card debt
churning,not_removed,nothing stopping you but if you are paying off a car my guess is that will put you at high utilization on the card and ding our credit for a while guess you could spread it around to lessen the blow like have and few cards as to getting vgc for everyday use thats fine but i wouldnt want too much sitting around for too long more chance of a problem some scam that drains them stolen whatever
churning,not_removed,got a mailer for the discover it card advertising balance transfer fee and for i think mos but yeah thats rare capital one keeps sending me stuff saying they would send a check directly to me for a balance transfer so these two things are out there but probably best to avoid in most circumstances
churning,not_removed,my fidelity credit card sent me a zero percent balance transfer zero percent apr offer a few days ago it included a balance transfer check right with the offer
churning,not_removed,lets say you have debt on one card with an apr of you get a mailer from capital one or chase or whatever and they say for months you will get apr if you do a balance transfer to us so they charge you of the so now your total balance is the balance is no longer on your old card and you have months of no apr to deal with your new balance you still owe now but you cannot use a credit card to pay off the loan directly cash must be applied some how some way
churning,not_removed,yeah my comment was only half serious though for my first car loan i had a rate through an offer from the manufacturer it could be argued that if you dont qualify for a good rate yet you could buy a cheap used car for which you dont need a loan
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,lets say you have a student loan you open a chase slate get a balance transfer limit interest fee you pay off that loan now you have no student loan no interest for months and a balance on your slate card the only downside is if you cant pay it off in months but if you cant then dont do it this is obviously a way better deal than purchasing in gift cards
churning,not_removed,a purchase is not a balance transfer
churning,not_removed,most people are getting totals i just wanted to make sure people knew this was out there
churning,not_removed,now someone needs to find a way to reliably trigger it
churning,not_removed,my wife has the same mailer were probably going to let it expire
churning,not_removed,if you receive one of these use it before i considered churning i received and for more than one business i have since opened a single amex biz card simply cash and now never receive these mailings
churning,not_removed,now we just need a link lol
churning,not_removed,i want this so bad
churning,not_removed,my gf got offert for spending and for extra
churning,not_removed,my wife just got the offer w spend in months i just got mine via the reddit link a few months ago and she got the csr dont know if i can stomach another in af
churning,not_removed,i saw a offer at a restaurant first week of this month laying on the floor and handed it to the lady and she goes oh no we can not use these here it did not have some huge spend requirement either or split bonus like i should have kept the mfer and just analyzed it
churning,not_removed,damn my targeted mailer was for
churning,not_removed,i can do the spend no problem so its less valuable to me im still in the middle of letting my hp heal a little before adding fresh ones so ill wait before pulling the trigger in
churning,not_removed,hope for those who missed the signup
churning,not_removed,i want one
churning,not_removed,damn i could meet that min right meow
churning,not_removed,data point never had an amex entered in my addressssn on their offers page and got the personal platinum card with bonus for spend in months no brainer
churning,not_removed,i did not know most were i just got a for mailer i guess i should be more excited about it
churning,not_removed,where did you get this to you in the mail have you had the card before
churning,not_removed,someone else can use it it isnt tied to a social security number
churning,not_removed,if i dont use it by the middle of the month waiting on word on my ink app still ill be making christmas happen for someone here lol
churning,not_removed,would gladly appreciate it just dont let it expire
churning,not_removed,if youre not gonna use id happily take it off your hands for you i can paypal you a small finders fee if you like
churning,not_removed,i have a plat too i feel like i should do both at once
churning,not_removed,im no unatelundquist
churning,not_removed,thats the one that everyone says i must be referring to xd
churning,not_removed,i know that feeling i have the plat offer sitting here too i am ok with it for the churn factor but i cant just sit here and keep af cards around i had another discussion thread that was questioning what to keep do you keep either when the csr is around or is it worth it to keep the business with the back how about the personal plat for airfare
churning,not_removed,i figured that even if i cash out all the points for amazon and buy mpx amazon giftcards its worth for the points in giftcards minus af meh not that great of churning but we buy enough on amazon that i figure itll pay for itself pretty easily
churning,not_removed,handed it to what lady
churning,not_removed,the restaurant manager it was laying on the floor addressed to them
churning,not_removed,thats the question with the once in a lifetime bonuses is more mr worth it or the efficiency of the mr the limited factor being the fact you cant ms
churning,not_removed,im worried about how hard i hit chase this year and the increased hp that i have i did the ink before the preferred came out so i have recent inquiries csr csr for real and ink but this expires in december
churning,not_removed,straight cash transfer partners pretty much whatever your heart desires lol book with points business
churning,not_removed,is the standard for the personal plat offer for the business version
churning,not_removed,for is the absolute best offer ive ever seen for that card
churning,not_removed,mail ive had it a while just getting to it i dont have any amex cards
churning,not_removed,just did some quick searching and it seems that business arent tied tied to a name but personal are for amex did not realize it was different between them
churning,not_removed,rchurning white elephant
churning,not_removed,hopefully i get the same offer min spend is way too much and i dont ms
churning,not_removed,if you can meet the spend organically for the personal and biz at the same time do it those are the best offers you will get especially if theyre targeted to you specifically
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,i know i like the spend categories better on the csr and im still lugging around a csp in addition to my amex plat wife got the csr this year and now this just arrived in the mail we already have global entry for the next years so that cost savings cant be used to cut into the af were taking a trip to see hamilton thanks amex in july and the points could be used while there but i was planning on getting the chase hyatt card for free nights which come with their own sometimes i wonder if im actually saving money ok not really i just few my family of to florida and back for free
churning,not_removed,yeah the amex plat and csr are real easy to whittle down the af when you look at the travel credits and the value of the points i think im going to take the plunge i just needed a gentle shove from the rchurning community after the holidays
churning,not_removed,the lady
churning,not_removed,ya cant ms but have a plethora of options of cards to get and lots of ways to spend money with little fee so that certainly has some added weight of course once all chase and other superior cards are exhausted go for it luckily amex takes months at least to report so that helps
churning,not_removed,how is it isnt it back so
churning,not_removed,have to go check my offer not sure if mine is business or not either way ill be sure to sign up
churning,not_removed,if ujavacooldude gives me the code ill try it and report back
churning,not_removed,not the and i dont have a targeted offer for that i cant do that organically i was going to do an aor with the plats and one of the delta cards too not sure i could get more than those all at once if that so thats right there itll be difficult to say the least
churning,not_removed,i mean the afs are forced expenditures so in a way youre not however theres a line of travel expenses that you nominally take so if youre getting those things paid for cheaper than otherwise everything over the top of that is just icing
churning,not_removed,and is here the restaurant why would anyone think they could use a credit card offer at a restaurant but good to know she clarified they can not
churning,not_removed,i thought the same thing but if you think about it flight means you get back so net what you would have paid at so however you have to already have enough for the flight at full price
churning,not_removed,remember no ms
churning,not_removed,this is my situation im new to this just out of college in credit is well over though i got the csp in may and the csr right when it came out sign up bonuses reached so i desperately need an everyday card and was liking the everyday preferred then of course i am targeted with that amex spending deal the same week should i be looking at this as i cant pass up this deal or that i need to chill on opening so many cards and just get an everyday one newbie
churning,not_removed,i know right obvious fear clearly independent but doing well must have ccphobia even tried explaining how valuable it was got the response that charge cards are pointless they have to be paid off every month i said thats the point you still have a decent grace period and for personal cards amex is going nuts offering for months making them credit cards basically anyway so lame
churning,not_removed,ah youre right hmm that makes it a very viable option for revenue tickets
churning,not_removed,remember no russian
churning,not_removed,im out of the loop on this one they discriminate against simon vgc
churning,not_removed,you just have to make sure that you space out you your hard pulls their effects are weakened after days and gone after a year some banks are sensitive to hps others are just concerned about applications with them when good deals come up its good to jump on them the plat is usually the only thing that is worth taking place of however if you get targeted offers now they should still come around again as long as you dont open amex cards targeted offers basically disappear if you get an amex card
churning,not_removed,thats my thought i was thinking both plats then i can drop the personal one and bleed down the points slowly with that xd
churning,not_removed,cool i appreciate the tips
churning,not_removed,have other things being reimbursed from my understanding nothing has really been reimbursed from nov onwards not just mpx transactions i wouldnt worry too much about it yet this has happened before and in the end everything was fine
churning,not_removed,it isnt even yet i can tell you it worked for me on though
churning,not_removed,no one has gotten anything on ft past nov i believe i purchased on but no reimbursement yet
churning,not_removed,i purchased one on nov and it was reimbursed on the i bought another gc the next day on the and it has yet to be reimbursed on my biz plat
churning,not_removed,purchased on nov no reimbursement yet
churning,not_removed,and my triple dip plan for plat just went into the sinkhole
churning,not_removed,everyone panicked last time there was a leaked plat link and mpx reimbursements slowed down does anyone seriously think amex isnt aware of this loophole they are well aware people are cashing out the airline credit through mpx and have not taken action yet its anyones guess as to if or when theyll shut it down
churning,not_removed,i was reimbursed last week for amazon gift card on amex plat
churning,not_removed,just as a side note for people saying no reimbursements are being issued in general purchased southwest gift card reimbursed yesterday
churning,not_removed,dp i bought gift cards from mpx on nov but i havent got any reimbursement yet
churning,not_removed,im about to cover worth so im eager to see what the situation is
churning,not_removed,purchased no reimbursement
churning,not_removed,theres only dp but looks like aa isnt working either
churning,not_removed,my latest dp is that i was reimbursed on my biz platinum card on october sorry i dont have any november data points
churning,not_removed,ive got a couple flights coming up before the end of the year looks like anyone in my row is drinking on me really though there are a few weeks to go here
churning,not_removed,i bought on nov and still no reimbursement so i changed to aa to buy gc
churning,not_removed,amazon on on neither has been reimbursed yet on prg
churning,not_removed,does anyone know if this first dip ends by the end of dec calendar year or is it by the end of your dec statement close date
churning,not_removed,what does ft mean sorry to ask i am new here
churning,not_removed,i hope it isnt taken down i literally just applied for the plat and prg
churning,not_removed,last successful purchased the credited the last purchase the no reimbursement yet this would have been the last to redeem for this year
churning,not_removed,well hell who chose united at their airline of choice tonight this guy those at ft seem to say the if you can switch to delta those gcs are getting reimbursed now how is it going to look when a couple thousand people ask to suddenly switch their airline of choice rats off a sinking ship or this is just another overreaction about the mpx app
churning,not_removed,yes it is
churning,not_removed,dude i dont know why the hell i put im off my rocker going to edit it now thanks
churning,not_removed,oh shit i was hoping this would still be around on jan but once the on airfare benefit was announced i was afraid this was coming
churning,not_removed,sumbitch i purchased on the i was hoping it was still working since the additional information indicates it as a special service ticket oh well lesson learned for the plat which i wasnt planning to bank on mpx for anyway
churning,not_removed,i believe all of mpx
churning,not_removed,same here i was planning on applying next week i may hold off now
churning,not_removed,triple dip on something else
churning,not_removed,what date
churning,not_removed,thanks thats good to know makes me a little sad though lol i was going to apply for ameriprise platinum card next week to tripledip but if reports dont start coming in with united mpx credits happening then ill probably pass
churning,not_removed,can you change airline after selecting for the calendar year
churning,not_removed,if you choose american and buy a gift card that will trigger the credit
churning,not_removed,weird i did through mpx on on prg reimbursed
churning,not_removed,calendar year unlike the csr
churning,not_removed,flyertalk its the big boy forum version of rchurning and rawardtravel
churning,not_removed,flyer talk
churning,not_removed,my money is on overreaction remindme one week
churning,not_removed,i selected delta upon approval and then called back to switch to united because i figured amazon cards would be better than delta gift cards if they are no longer reimbursing united ill feel like a dumbass
churning,not_removed,whats the plan for plat aa gift cards
churning,not_removed,is there a list somewhere of working reimbursement methods
churning,not_removed,transaction posted on nov and was reimbursed on nov
churning,not_removed,you can change once per year
churning,not_removed,i said i choose the wrong airline they changed it
churning,not_removed,you can change once per year
churning,not_removed,i havent used any of the credit so i said that i accidentally choose the wrong airline
churning,not_removed,it should
churning,not_removed,yeah ive tried navigatingsearching ft and failed but i am tech retardedand also regular retarded
churning,not_removed,hope youre right
churning,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of one week to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dallyvq dont forget to add the time options after the of
churning,not_removed,maybe you misunderstood i added united tonight i should have been more clear and used smaller words it would be bad if i am not able to use the mpx app to get amazon gift cards however this topic does seem to crop up often around here time will tell if its legit i think that my contribution was that if you can call and change your airline to delta then maybe you buy delta gift cards dont be an asshole
churning,not_removed,delta though i suppose ill need to check ft and whether that still works first which was my plan before i learned about this
churning,not_removed,amex subform of ft
churning,not_removed,looks like you managed to sneak in before as well
churning,not_removed,it seemed like you were trying to be misunderstood my bad
churning,not_removed,no recent dps for delta
churning,not_removed,ugh delta was going to be my fallback if mpx died
churning,not_removed,my roommate got this in the mail yesterday hes out of town so i dont know the details of the offer yet but will post them once i can take a look i havent seen any mention online of this card offering status
churning,not_removed,second shipment is way more than
churning,not_removed,data point i did this for two shipments through a different rewards program maybe months ago they didnt give me any crap when i wanted to cancel looking at you wsj and deposited the points promptly wine wasnt great but it was better than people usually give it credit for and it was at least good enough to give to hosts at parties that were big enough for them to not remember who gave them each bottle maybe a out of i valued the bottles around so it comes to about on top of that not too bad
churning,not_removed,having had my fair share of online wine subscriptions for points and cashback this wine is truly the bottom of the barrel however cancellation was a short painless phone call unexpectedly also its cpp with the first shipment
churning,not_removed,really not a horrendous deal if you drink crappy wine anyway
churning,not_removed,does anyone know if it codes as grocery
churning,not_removed,chase rep asking me to prove there was an offer given to me no hopes
churning,not_removed,edit miles for first shipment for second shipment
churning,not_removed,so the wine is good enough to give away with the caveat that the receiver does not know it came from you haha
churning,not_removed,what are your favorite wine subscriptions for both wine quality and cpp value
churning,not_removed,pay the promo price with a temp boaciti virtual card preset to decline anything above a certain amount and deactivate the temp card after the purchase posts you wont have to deal with any hard to cancel issues
churning,not_removed,theyre not really a subscription but im a big fan of nakedwines they work with independent wineries around the world and the quality and value are great they dont usually have points or cashback offers but they often include introductory vouchers in other retailers packages staples etc as far as subscriptions for points and cashback laithwaites and wsj wines have good offers pop up from time to time they both use the same wine merchant and the qualitys not terrible for the price right now southwest has an offer for rr points with your first laithwaites shipment bottles for around depending on your state taxes id say theyre at least as good as bottles so its a great deal even without the points
churning,not_removed,even more than that because the second shipment will not be the same price as this current first order promo
churning,not_removed,no we dont know what the second order costs
churning,not_removed,this is my experience only please do not take as gospel from my experience chase citi and discover are pretty unforgiving barclay amex and boa seem to be slightly more lenient and capital one just doesnt care
churning,not_removed,capital one is so fucking true they dont give a shit
churning,not_removed,loan is now on my southwest cards hello companion pass when the statement posts next month
churning,not_removed,on one hand im really upset that theyre stopping cc payments on the other hand i will be done with my loan next month because of all of the extra money i put in this month before the deadline and on the other hand im now pretty broke but hey i got them sweet sweet ur points
churning,not_removed,im definitely gonna start to use prepaid gc to pay them then there is no sense to waste an opportunity to get a lot of points
churning,not_removed,just dropped a payment on mgl today for a brand new csr can you say down to the wire
churning,not_removed,wait this whole time i could have been using my cc for my great lakes student loans and now i cant i swear ive never been given the option to on their website
churning,not_removed,im still waiting for my card i got the numbers through secure message on chase website do great lakes ask for cvv numbers and expiration date
churning,not_removed,does this affect private loans or just public student loans reading the information it seems like its just public loans but wanted to make sure
churning,not_removed,didnt see this and didnt call in till friday
churning,not_removed,will plastiq still work i know they changed the mailing location and the last plastiq check i sent was refunded
churning,not_removed,there was a megathread for this from days ago this will probably be removed
churning,not_removed,not sure i wouldve risked cashflow going broke just to get some extra ur points hope no emergencies happen in the short term for you congrats and good luck though
churning,not_removed,im in the same positioni made a larger than usual payment yesterday to knock out a minimum spend one more payment next month and my unsubsidized loans will be behind me
churning,not_removed,is it definitive that they will allow prepaid gift cards will they have to be vgc and not amex edit found the dp thread
churning,not_removed,you gotta call you will probably be able to buy some prepaid cards and use those
churning,not_removed,the website actually said you cant
churning,not_removed,nelnet ask for my cvv every time
churning,not_removed,to my knowledge checks are unaffected
churning,not_removed,nah that was just a normal post this is still relevant because it points out today is the last opportunity not tomorrow or saturday as some might have expected
churning,not_removed,but pretty broke for a short period to be debtfree after some added motivation aok in my book
churning,not_removed,haha thanks man i was exaggerating a little bit though i have enough to get by i just spent more than i normally would
churning,not_removed,cheers mate its an amazing feeling
churning,not_removed,yeah i spoke with the rep and directly asked about visa gift cards and how they should work id appreciate if others could ask i would be happy to add more data points
churning,not_removed,is correct if you plan to call and pay today just tell then you would like to do a one time credit card payment
churning,not_removed,seriouslyi would have made a bundle in cash back because i believed the website when i checked it all that time ago
churning,not_removed,whoa many places say nelnet flat out refuses any cc for student loan payments are you saying youre able to make payments to nelnet via cc i have a large student loan that im hoping to use cc on here in next few months
churning,not_removed,thanks and same to you ive still got a long road ahead before ive paid off my education but its nice to watch these higher interest rates fall off of my spreadsheets
churning,not_removed,very dumb mentioning vgc to the rep imo always say debit cards
churning,not_removed,nah just let them know your international find a nice international address and save it i used australia and they will push back but you let them know that your international and thats why its allowed they will confirm with manager since none of the reps really are not aware of it now i dont know if they completely stopped because i paid off all my loans by but if they do just say its a debit card
churning,not_removed,why is it dumb i get not mentioning it where it is distinctly not allowed in this situation its a prepaid debit card
churning,not_removed,yeah as of us treasury is directing all fed loan servicers to stop taking cc payments altogether but looks like telling them its a debit card may still worki have the csr so hopefully that should work so no way nelnet can tell if its a debit or cc on their end when they process the paymentcard then
churning,not_removed,looking at other dp they shouldnt know i know people are still able to use their cc even after the
churning,not_removed,i found a restaurant recently that participated in rewards network groupon cashback and mogl triple dipping is nice
churning,not_removed,yup this and many others were briefly covered in httpwwwdoctorofcreditcomcompletelistcardlinkedstorerewardprograms its far from the only dining program that isnt processed by the rewards network though
churning,not_removed,ive never heard of groupon cashback does someone have a link is it only in some areas because i looked through groupon and googled and couldnt find a link googling just gives me places that talk about it but dont link to it
churning,not_removed,i think groupon still has this in limited release do the offers look different from their usual for a voucher listings
churning,not_removed,im wondering if a quadruple dip is possible rewards network groupon cashback mogl thanksagain anyone had the timeluck to try it
churning,not_removed,that groupon dining is great super convenient and fast credit
churning,not_removed,ive never heard of any of these rewards do i just need to sign up and link my credit card after i make the purchases at the restaurants ill get the cash back
churning,not_removed,i think its a pilot in austin maybe other cities all of the offers i see are for flat amount vouchers so i dont think its live in philly theres a my card linked offers option under my stuff in the app edit looks like offers show up in chicago too
churning,not_removed,heres an example of one in austin
churning,not_removed,you can search for it by going to local deals food and drink filter
churning,not_removed,yes its a set percentage heres an example
churning,not_removed,they are cashback from your bill it shows up as a statement credit
churning,not_removed,yes but dont get your hopes up too much rewards network advertises over restaurants in the entire country mogl has far fewer groupon seems to only do it in two cities so far part of the reason this kind of stacking is notable is because its rare
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,interesting yeah it appears we dont have it where i live
churning,not_removed,i found some offers in chicago they say free to claim and the cashback instead of the usual struck through value and voucher price
churning,not_removed,some places are in my area not the most amazing places but nice discount
churning,not_removed,i was able to find some restaurants in my area looks like they range from to back even without doubling dipping every bit helps thanks
churning,not_removed,yeah i had to look for it i didnt find it by accident it was a fairly cheap place so i think i saved like food was good though
churning,not_removed,i use this wallet it was l somewhat of an expensive impulse purchase ive had it about years and it is still in great shape httpsboscacomsmallbifoldwalletnappahtml
churning,not_removed,httpswwwallettcomproductrfidslimidwallet
churning,not_removed,you may find this useful from a bit ago that has some good wallets listed

churning,not_removed,im a girl so i opt out of those super fancy high end designer wallets and go for the travelon rfid ones will not leave home without it
churning,not_removed,i remember most people saying they use the rubber bands from the produce section of the grocery store
churning,not_removed,a bellroy wallet any of them
churning,not_removed,i use httpscraftwalletcom i am still new to churning so this one does it for me only holds cards but also has a money clip were i have some money for emergencies and extra cards
churning,not_removed,most churners should have thin card holder type wallets because we only carry our min spend cards on us what everyone needs is one of those card holder books to store all the other crap at home once were done with min spends
churning,not_removed,porsche design slot wallet

churning,not_removed,a normal leather one i dont carry more than ccs at a time front pocket since im in a big city
churning,not_removed,a card holder who carries cash anyway
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,i use a hollowed out dildo get some strange looks at work but its very efficient my wife prefers the magnum sized ones so i dont have to pick and choose which cards to keep with me they just all fit
churning,not_removed,may be we should put some of these links or wallet products in the basic reading section or quick links or any other appropriate section in the right hand pane
churning,not_removed,you know thats a womans wallet right
churning,not_removed,looks like we had the same thought at almost the exact same time
churning,not_removed,yup i buy a new leather wallet every decade or so i have no idea what brand it is they all look the same
churning,not_removed,you realize it says mens breast pocket wallet
churning,not_removed,putting a mens label on it doesnt doesnt make it mens
churning,not_removed,what makes it a womens wallet
churning,not_removed,based on your awesome post in the hsbc thread i was going through and upvoting a bunch of your other previous commentsand i came across this i just want to say the automod is so crazylike why the heck would a post like this be removed
churning,not_removed,wayfair does not code as furniture in previous and recent experiences of mine codes as internet purchase just a heads up
churning,not_removed,thank the churning gods for sams club
churning,not_removed,for discovers cats bjs is currently offering free trial membership good till end of june might be useful for some
churning,not_removed,i am looking to pay my gym membership annual fee end of aprilearly may would the us bank cash card be my best bet at rewards for paying the whole year in full or is there another card i should consider i see the citi dividend signups are over if i sign up for it now will i be able to set gymsfitness as the first category or would i have to wait for the following quarter
churning,not_removed,can anyone confirmdeny that tractor supply company codes as home improvement for discover i read somewhere that it does and it made me very happy just got a discover last week and eager to press it into action
churning,not_removed,can someone confirm ikea coded as furniture store for us bank they say it does but im looking for someone else to concur need to buy a kitchen and splitting it between this week and next to maximize return thanks
churning,not_removed,my brother labeler was busy yesterday printing the new labels for the cards
churning,not_removed,why do cc companies make people activate just trying to fuck them out of some points
churning,not_removed,armed with freedom and dividend lots of wg stops for vvgc to mo are in the near future
churning,not_removed,does ikea count as home improvement store for discover
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,same with ikea you can call them up and ask
churning,not_removed,how is sams club for ms do they offer variable load vgcs like walmart does ymmv on buying w ccs
churning,not_removed,also thank mr skeltal for good bones and
churning,not_removed,some sams dont allow visa mc gc to be purchased with ccs
churning,not_removed,never dipped on the wholesale side of churning does bjs sell vgcs
churning,not_removed,ive never seen a bjs in socal
churning,not_removed,it does
churning,not_removed,i dont have personal experience but id say that this would pretty much guarantee it
churning,not_removed,yes it count as furniture store but restaurant inside ikea does not
churning,not_removed,i make my sister do all the labeling sorry ill see myself out
churning,not_removed,now that sallie mae is dead i had to start using labels again too for my wifes wallet
churning,not_removed,is that like uncle father oscar
churning,not_removed,sounds about right
churning,not_removed,most likely to get you thinking about the card and putting spend on it if youre an average person with a credit card and a debit card you might just put all your spend on a card after seeing the reminder emails from chase why you have to physically login to click activate is beyond me
churning,not_removed,confirmed it is not counted as home improvement store
churning,not_removed,purchased from ikea on dividend and cash last fews weeks all counted as furniture store
churning,not_removed,yes up to per card fee
churning,not_removed,i havent had a problem buying variable vmcgcs just make sure its card per transaction
churning,not_removed,keep in mind theres some issues with some metabank ovmcs you can sometimes find there some people have lots of trouble unloading them
churning,not_removed,its not hard to find membership deals around i think thats what mine cost when i got in on a deal around november theres also a student membership somewhere i found on their website if youre in school membership was worth it for me for my freedoms chase usually has them as a category at least once sometimes twice a year i dont bother msing for discover back category on it though not worth it to me
churning,not_removed,technically if youre just going there once you can get a trial day pass type of thing im unsure of the specific name but if you tell the greeter that you would like to shop around and see if you like the store to possibly get the membership they will typically let you and will let you check out once that day without the membership ive done it a couple times when there is a certain item i can only get at sams club
churning,not_removed,theres a groupon expiring shortly that makes it an effective for the year
churning,not_removed,sign up with bonus link ms and then cancel once youre done they will refund at least
churning,not_removed,nope bjs good for real purchases only basically
churning,not_removed,they do but only ones
churning,not_removed,ive seen them available at my local bjs here on long island
churning,not_removed,thats what im banking on thanks
churning,not_removed,mrs origwirehead what you mean im not supposed to use the blue cash everyday preferred for regular purchases i mean it says everyday and preferred origwirehead no facepalm let me add some labels for you
churning,not_removed,i actually meant that ikea is not home improvement
churning,not_removed,if using discover be ready to click the link in your fraud alert email after the first purchase if you are buying more than one also you cant get gift cards at selfcheckout at sams club you need to go through a regular line so you might want to try to go early in the day when its less crowded
churning,not_removed,why one card per transaction
churning,not_removed,doot
churning,not_removed,you can get that coupon through the discover portal
churning,not_removed,why not just use the wm gc at sams do people not buy more than of groceries in a reasonable amount of time
churning,not_removed,yo dawg i still have a drawer from years that is still sturdy
churning,not_removed,dem tha rools
churning,not_removed,i didnt know about that and also didnt notice it on my purchase but if i were you i would go in person for a ymmv type of thing to see if it works or not good luck thanks for the info as well d
churning,not_removed,httpswwwsamsclubcomsamshtmlmobilelpwinwithmomhtmlmobiledetectfalse forgot to mention its a gift card but surely that can be liquidated with a few things everyone needs
churning,not_removed,woops glazed right over that heh
churning,not_removed,how is it cash back isnt the limited to in purchases
churning,not_removed,the fake booking will get you the offer everyone should be able to see that the points only comes if your particular account is targeted by chase marketing everyone not targeted will see
churning,not_removed,went through and all i got was a spend with credit cleared history and same
churning,not_removed,i and others have been able to get this to appear by logging in to our mp account and making a few fake bookings eg go all the way through to the payment page and cancel after a week or so i got a mailer with this offer be aware that usually the credit will appear only when making a booking either on the summary or payment page chase would not match me to the credit via sm
churning,not_removed,looked at my dads account and saw the but on my account i only saw a it seems very ymmv
churning,not_removed,does apply to this
churning,not_removed,with i would recommend waiting until the offer comes back we have also seen evidence that chase is starting to offer bigger bonuses especially in branch so waiting isnt the worst
churning,not_removed,statement credit was the best for this card last appeared in aug i regret not getting it then
churning,not_removed,i really want to cancel this card and reopen to get the bonus again but i just fell down to so i now need the csr dammit
churning,not_removed,looks at card hmm im only closes tab in sadness
churning,not_removed,also went to offer
churning,not_removed,will chase match this offer like they do ink
churning,not_removed,i got a mailer for a offer but when i make a dummy booking while logged in i only get a offer
churning,not_removed,if i downgrade my mpx to the plain mileageplus version can i reapply for the mpx and get the bonus if its been months or do i have to close the mpx completely
churning,not_removed,was able to get the offer by going through like i was going to book a flight
churning,not_removed,maybe a silly question but i have see this offer a few times regarding the statement credit and does it actually let you use the card if you are instantly approved to get a dollar statement credit on the flight you are booking or is that just an advertising trick
churning,not_removed,was higher offer last year and hopefully it would come back soon in the meantime i would suggest to get the business version which potentially wont count towards for auto approval it is the same and no af first year
churning,not_removed,that damn rule so many missed opportunities
churning,not_removed,almost definitely
churning,not_removed,yes was denied recently for this offer because of the rule
churning,not_removed,thats the offer ive got this year it was actually with fake au annual fee wasnt waived though
churning,not_removed,i got that offer last year but i was ineligible because of both and receiving the bonus in the past months its chases version of tormenting me
churning,not_removed,app right after you app for csr there have been dps of people getting approved for chase cards in a row while at just make sure to do csr first since you really want that one
churning,not_removed,you should still try if you want to i know people who have been at and still able to open a card or two no harm in trying other than a hard pull i guess
churning,not_removed,nope people had a hard time with this one
churning,not_removed,i tried asking for a match on this one last year but they didnt allow it perhaps because its a partner card
churning,not_removed,its months since you last received the bonus you can have two cards
churning,not_removed,you have to receive and activate the card first credit posts after any store or online purchase it doesnt have to be from united this is different than delta statement credit when the purchase has to be made with delta
churning,not_removed,statement credit yep it was a statement credit offer
churning,not_removed,ah ok thank you
churning,not_removed,ya i got a mailer and thought it was a preapproval but it was just a mailer and i got declined because of
churning,not_removed,i got the same deal back in aug such an awesome deal are you going to keep your card
churning,not_removed,thanks i used that once to get around a hard pull but didnt know it would get around now just need to make sure i can hit the minimum spend for both
churning,not_removed,that is what i was thinking partner card less control
churning,not_removed,bummer but thats what i figured thanks for confirming would have been nice to work on minimum spend the instant you get approved lol
churning,not_removed,how do you distinguish between a mailer and a pre approval ive been sitting on an offer from united that expires on january but im not sure if its a pre approval or not
churning,not_removed,glad i read this i got this a couple days ago and also thought it was a preapproval upon further inspection its just a mailer thanks for the heads up
churning,not_removed,only for year then cancel and apply year later again you can get bonus every months
churning,not_removed,i also got in on this one too but like most others ill kill the card when the af comes around in a few months im a with united so this card doesnt really offer anything above what csr gives me except the ever so slight chance that i might get upgraded on an award ticket this is a useless benefit to me since i rarely fly united on award tickets and the times i do i have a partner with me unfortunately this benefit only works for my ticket and not my partners
churning,not_removed,just as an fyi most of the dps i have seen that successfully employed this workaround had an ink card taking up one spot on their
churning,not_removed,its probably the same as mine preapprovals will say preapproved and usually you get like a code i got sent the mailer because i set up a gift registry with them i did get an online preapproval for the csp through the chase website when i was at and was instantly approved so i would just keep checking there
churning,not_removed,safest way is to go inbranch and have a rep tell you youre preapproved mailers dont offer that much guarantee to get around
churning,not_removed,ya i got too excited and just applied sad but true happy i could help
churning,not_removed,get upgraded on an award ticket thank you for pointing this out i didnt know about this benefit the chances of cpu are pretty slim though as youve mentioned because of the lowers priority in the upgrade list
churning,not_removed,i dont think it shows branded cards tho
churning,not_removed,got approved for the plat and my mr already got frozen didnt even receive the card yet did this happen to anyone else
churning,not_removed,i wake up early enough every day to put the first comment in the daily thread but not quite early enough to get the staples deal
churning,not_removed,reload in starbucks card get a credit when you use visa checkout httpswwwstarbuckscompromovisacheckout
churning,not_removed,amex prepaid gift cards from cvs take exactly hour and minutes from the time the receipt prints to activate in case anyone else is running into decline mayhem as i have been
churning,not_removed,so yesterday i finally get my wife to ride with me to the nearest chase branch to check preapprovals for csr when i get there the guy sits us down and tells us he can only see preapprovals for people with checking accounts so he couldnt check mine my wife has one but i canceled mine early this year then after he pulls up my wifes account he reads off all of her cards which included multiple aus on my cards then he tells us that if she is preapproved all he would see is preapproved but it wouldnt tell him which cards were preapproved wed have to just apply and see i was picturing his computer screen just lighting up with preapproved in big letters and thats it lol i didnt want to argue with him since it was close to closing time and we were both hungry just so weird that they can be so unaware of their own systems let along the fact that he basically poopooed a potential credit card app right out the door they usually fall all over themselves when you willingly walk up and ask to apply for a card just wanted to share to see if anyone else has dealt with incompetent csrs while hunting chases white whale
churning,not_removed,finally got my paper benefits guide for the merrill and after perusing it i was reminded of something i vaguely saw online the crazy high common carrier travel insurance i havent done comprehensive research but i am pretty sure that the merrill card gives the highest benefits or is at worst tied with a lesser heralded or high af card for common carrier travel accident insurance with up to for death loss of two hands or feet other stuff the benefits on this card are really good in conclusion definitely use the merrill if you think youre going to die on a trip
churning,not_removed,tweet membersgetit mrpoints using your linked twitter account for free marriott points today only

churning,not_removed,dp i am sitting in the iah centurion lounge now i applied for the amex platinum with the leaked link and have not received my card in the mail yet all they needed was my id and last four of my ssn
churning,not_removed,im going to italy in april and will be trying to secure a reservation at osteria francescana the only way to do this is to get up at am on december and then try to book it online is this something i can entrust to the amex platinum concierge or should i just try and do it myself ive read conflicting reports about their effectiveness and dont wanna miss out on this
churning,not_removed,ok stupid question time i was in thailand last week and logged into amex now whenever i go to the site it defaults to the thai site how do i set the default site back to the us
churning,not_removed,ive been seeing people having their mr points frozen due to applying for the recent offer i currently have mr from the other cards and i applied for the platinum i never did any ms on my other accounts can they still claw them back
churning,not_removed,dp fwiw applied approved amex plat points frozen this action will not be completed at this time because your account is currently being reviewed to make sure all eligible purchases meet qualifying criteria i am not even doing min spend on any of the current amex cards right now
churning,not_removed,sweet amex plat arrived nonexpedited usps mail my day email was sent early saturday morning
churning,not_removed,so im strongly considering cancelling the platinum card because i ms on my other amex cards and this shit show doesnt seem worth it advice
churning,not_removed,looks like amex doubled the blue cash referral bonus to also the referral has amazon attached still better to check in incognito to see a better offer
churning,not_removed,am i good to ms on my amex spg has anyone ever had their spg bonus clawed back

churning,not_removed,global entry definitely requires your kids to sign up too right any dp of tsa or customs letting them slide mine are both under so not really national security threats just yet
churning,not_removed,trying to meet ms on my csr by ordering amex gift cards last night for christmas presents using the promo and an extra one to try out venmo liquidation and it wouldnt go through the message popping up gave me a number to call that ended up being chase and i was on hold for minutes going through rounds of verification finally answered all the verification questions and was approved to try the order again tried last night and tried this morning and it still wont work any ideas on why that might be im thinking either human error and the chase rep didnt submit the approval or the purchase may be coding as cash advance which is lower than my order total ps the chase rep said my csr wasnt activated i didnt see the normal sticker to activate my card and figured all was ok since i put spend on it already kinda odd
churning,not_removed,question for all of you international travelers i have my first international trip coming up in about weeks already have tickets and i am applying for my passport today i was wondering if it would be worth the to expedite it reason being obviously time due to holiday season and a chance to get global entry my gf has already submitted her global entry so i was hoping to piggy back off of her appointment if she can schedule before our trip would it be worth it i realize im a little scrunched for time
churning,not_removed,is anyone else worried about your bank catching on to msing obviously i dont ms any cards where i have my banks but ive been getting pretty heavily into msing coming up on over multiple cards over the month part of me is worried my bank is going to put a hold on my funds as i only make a year and i guess they have access to that i know im not doing anything illegal but still just worried they will freak out
churning,not_removed,im trying to use the mpx app but my transaction keeps getting declined i sent a message to customer services yesterday is there a physical number i can contact i tried searching on google and found nothing has anyone experience this i need to buy a few items at nordstrom just realized someone asked the same question below ive been using mpx for the last months but yesterday was the first time i added amex biz cc to my account

churning,not_removed,was checking creditkarma today and was shocked to see that my equifax score dropped points i took a closer look and apparently my discover it card which i opened in as my first card was removed completely from my report naturally this has drastically reduced my average age of account my other reports still have the card listed as far as i can tell i called discover to ask what happened and they told me that a vendor i had shopped with in the past was apparently compromised so they sent out a new card to me and changed my account as a proactive security measure they told me that eventually the account would be reported correctly again now this is an issue for me because i was planning on applying for the chase united card in a couple days and i know chase generally pulls equifax im in tn what should i do to increase my odds of approval given this would freezing my equifax report me the way to go if i still want to apply in a couple days
churning,not_removed,would this work for getting csr travel credit reimbursement buy a virgin america flight with csr cancel within twenty four hours so no cancellation fee have the refund credited to your travel bank instead of original payment spend the travel bank credit in instead i imagine it would still be categorized as a flight purchase by chase

churning,not_removed,i just checked my experian report for the first time and noticed a huge irregularity i have a rating way higher than my other reports and its due to the fact theres a mysterious chase account with a limit and really low utilization that has been in good standing for over years without ever missing a payment i have no idea who this account belongs to or why its on my credit report but im apparently im mistakenly being labeled as an authorized user on his account and its been helping my credit bigtime my question is should i do something about it if i contact experian to get it removed my utilization will go up my average age of accounts will go drastically down and my credit score will probably take a hit most of my cards have limits and i was really surprised when my csr application received a limit im beginning to think it was because of this guy so should i just let it be and wait until this guy fucks up a payment to get it removed or should i call and get it removed now can i get in trouble for not reporting it
churning,not_removed,has anyone successfully purchased a visa gift card with a staples gift card when i pretended to do it online it seemed like it would work but the staples website says its not allowed

churning,not_removed,just got denied for ink preferred for being relatively new to credit years new business years new to chase and already having two cards from chase cf aug csp tried recon times it was a no go they kept coming back to wanting to see how id perform with the csp before extending me any more lines of credit i offered to reduce existing credit lines it didnt matter im or excluding store cards and au accounts do i simply need to take a break for a while or do you think i couldshould go for the ink cash do you imagine ill be declined for the same reasons or is it a much easier card to get wife and i are currently meeting spend on her csr but perhaps itll be better if i keep some activity on csp for relationship building purposes that and a tax year showing decent business profits should put me in better stead but i still dont know how long to wait before trying again i want to stay with chase due to ur and my wife having urs and dont really want to get deeper into by going elsewhere
churning,not_removed,i have generated referral links for the amex delta gold to use but if i cancel the card now will i still earn miles if someone uses them or does the card have to remain open in order to earn the referrals
churning,not_removed,can i buy a giftcard at gamestop with a gamestop giftcard
churning,not_removed,just got an email saying my amex card can get x purchases at amazon i just wish it was on a card that i need to meet minimum spend on
churning,not_removed,really deciding whether to go on an app spree or not i am considering getting the csr although i have a amex plat and a chase freedom or getting the delta point offer for the delta amex i am currently almost finished with the bonus for the blue cash preferred which way should i go next
churning,not_removed,i purchased an item thursday and found same item cheaper elsewhere i took a pdf photo of the page and item in cart with price i was going to submit the claim tonight and see the price on the website has now changed as of today it was cheaper but must have changed tonight will chase still honor the price in the add i saved
churning,not_removed,my wife applied for csp and today received a denial letter citing too many accounts last years they pulled equifax btw which is somewhat surprising spent a few hours trying to get a free eq report talking to amex and chase to remove her as an au and make sure they remove stop reporting her from the credit bureaus with amex i just chatted and i dont have a confidence they follow up on the credit reports but chase sent the case to the credit department so i feel a lot more confident now do we wait until her credit reports reflect these changes effectively making her or she can try to recon with this data
churning,not_removed,have two questions request a dp that if someone tranfers amex costco to citi costco are them the same account on credit report i ask this because im considering about amex spg card is it worth paying annual fee for amex green amex delta gold or amex apg just to make my credit report looks better thanks
churning,not_removed,had my csp card arrive last night didnt realize it would be so thick and have some weight to it its awesome i feel like i gotta just drop it on the table whenever i use it at a restaurant to be a true baller
churning,not_removed,if i were to get an extra plastic csr card not authorized user and give it to my parents to spend with in another state new york and virginia will the card be flagged for fraud if it is would i be able to get around it by saying i travel back and forth a lot even if the transactions are minutes apart
churning,not_removed,does have any dps on earning american miles with avis rentals im not having any success could be because i have to use a corporate code when booking
churning,not_removed,i have the chase sapphire preferred still replaced with csr i want to get the cfu should i just change the card confirmed that im eligible or should i apply for that to gain the promo credit im at but plan on using the rest of the spots for other cards
churning,not_removed,friends should i bite on the spg or wait for a chance of the offer anyone know if the prg is going back to
churning,not_removed,amex got one bois
churning,not_removed,oh gosh its starting
churning,not_removed,do you mean mr you had previously
churning,not_removed,as a dp mine have been frozen as well i wonder if they are checking all my mr cards or just the new plat like you i havent even received the plat yet and have no ms on any of my other mr cards but its still annoying
churning,not_removed,what was the best strategy to resolve this last time other then dont ms etc just wait it out send a letter was kind of expecting this so im going to play it super safe i plan to meet spend by paying my brothers tuition christmas gifts not gift cards restaurant spend i also plan to overshoot the minimum spend to cover the mpx credit never had any type of amex platinum and not going to close for at least year
churning,not_removed,wtf should i just cancel the plat before it arrives in the mail
churning,not_removed,sigh of course right when i wanted to use them edit perhaps this was a honeypot to trap churners
churning,not_removed,how do you know its frozen did they send an email
churning,not_removed,dont feel too bad it started around midnight est and ended a little before the west coast clearly had an advantage over everyone else
churning,not_removed,how do you guys track deals i mainly use reddit and slickdeals
churning,not_removed,i was able to order it and later staples canceled
churning,not_removed,awesome thanks for posting
churning,not_removed,thank you
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,i am able to add a card through visa checkout but once the card is there it just says amex is this all it takes i noticed a number of comments on dds post saying they didnt get confirmation whereas others received notice in less than an hour
churning,not_removed,had a boa offer for back on starbucks too fyi
churning,not_removed,yes i did on saturday really fun being declined after waiting in line for vgcs calling the number hearing the cards are active then restanding in line for vgcs being declined registering my cards so i could use them on gccom being declined calling the number being told about the min rule then going back to buy vgcs in store 🙃
churning,not_removed,how did you figure that out trial and error
churning,not_removed,still waiting on a strong dp from someone getting preapproved for csr without a chase checking acct
churning,not_removed,yeah i had a similar thing happen where instead of checking my preapproval status they made me apply for the card which was declined for and dinged my credit score with a hard pull thanks alot jp morgan
churning,not_removed,were you approved immediately for the merrill ive been waiting on a decision for about days on that card i dont want to call until theyve decided but ive been stuck in review forever it feels
churning,not_removed,id probably split the payment between multiple cards
churning,not_removed,nice pretty instant tweeted and min later got the message
churning,not_removed,thanks quick and easy
churning,not_removed,shit fucking sucks i had my points frozen for almost months during the last leaked link even with natural spend
churning,not_removed,now this is the worst dp anyone who got the amex plat with the recent link could get if this is widespread its going to suck
churning,not_removed,have you done any msing on your other amex card i wonder if they start looking closely at the accounts that got the card via the link
churning,not_removed,sorry to hear that i really dont understand how amex can legally get away with freezing points for all of those apps even without any ms what did the people who applied do here that is against the tc dont see how amex has a leg to stand on unless they are saying it was an unauthorized link or something but if thats the case they shouldve just refused to approvecanceled the apps
churning,not_removed,will this affect any nonmr cards with amex ive got both personal delta cards and an spg
churning,not_removed,youll have to put on if you want a statement
churning,not_removed,enjoy chap planning to use one in seattle in a few weeks
churning,not_removed,nice how easy is it to get to the houston one is it possible to visit even if your flight is in a different terminal
churning,not_removed,its even easier if you have another amex card with you if you give them another amex they can look up your account and see if you have a platinum card
churning,not_removed,yesterday i was able to have amex buy tickets to a festival that sells out pretty quickly with no issues they also had to start looking at noon so there is a possibility they can get it done for you
churning,not_removed,why not go both routes do it yourself and ask the concierge to attempt
churning,not_removed,to be honest i would try both never hurts to have a backup plan
churning,not_removed,since the reservation has to be booked at a specific time i would do it myself
churning,not_removed,did you try turning it off and turning it back on hahaha
churning,not_removed,does changing this not work
churning,not_removed,clear your cookies and cache
churning,not_removed,i would bet it picks up your browser settings
churning,not_removed,ouch did you have a lot of mo deposits
churning,not_removed,had you even used the account yet
churning,not_removed,do you have an actual business
churning,not_removed,they wont claw back if you did nothing wrong but obviously they may temporarily freeze your points for investigation like last time
churning,not_removed,if you didnt do any ms you are fine
churning,not_removed,your existing points were frozen or you insta met spend and the posted points were frozen
churning,not_removed,is this the amex plat link from last week
churning,not_removed,same i can only guess they are extending reviews to all other mr cards as well considering they have nothing to review since i dont even have my plat yet have no ms on any other amex cards but i do hope im wrong
churning,not_removed,same here
churning,not_removed,rub it in jk but seriously i better get mine tomorrow
churning,not_removed,check your points probably frozen as everyone else that applied and have some mr points mine are
churning,not_removed,i have heard that once you sign up for the card you cant get the welcome bonus offer again regardless of whether you actually receive a bonus check on this before you do and imo just prepay some bills if youre really worried
churning,not_removed,a given the reports about mr being frozen its already too late just ride it out b it depends on whether mr is worth it to you if you cancel youre never getting an mr bonus on the unbranded personal plat at least not for years
churning,not_removed,sure cancel but youll never be able to receive the bonus again since you hold the card on amex its not based in whether you got the bonus or not
churning,not_removed,try and transfer some mr points and see what happens
churning,not_removed,i guess you mean bceveryday it has gone to
churning,not_removed,should be good to go
churning,not_removed,i recently did it on both spg cards
churning,not_removed,my so hasnt even gotten the plat shipping email yet but just received the ed today wtf
churning,not_removed,this part youll have days to use your bonus to make a loan suggests to me that it will go directly in your account but only for days edit i wonder if you can withdraw it in that timeframe
churning,not_removed,be careful i had the same issue a few months back with airbnb cards i attempted over and over every single attempt turned into a charge on my card which posted to my statement no mpx customer service i had to file disputes with chase to reverse the charges it was a terrible experience
churning,not_removed,im getting the same thing i just added the platinum amex yesterday and my transaction was declined declined for every other card this is not my first time using mpx it must be an app issue i sent a message to customer support i used my iphone
churning,not_removed,lots of dps of issues with the mpx app in the last few days appears to be nothing you can do but keep trying customer support is virtually nonexistent
churning,not_removed,just did in a row last night with zero issues
churning,not_removed,double check your address on mpx app sometimes something gets flipped around
churning,not_removed,i ordered two amazon gift cards through mpx late last night both went through without any issues using my platinum amex that was my first time using mpx and im on ios
churning,not_removed,i bought one last night with no problem it was my first time and i didnt even have my physical platinum until today
churning,not_removed,have you used mpx before i know that when first setting it up it gave me problems after a week it fixed itself
churning,not_removed,i just did last night with no issues on my android charges are pending still but the gcs came out fine
churning,not_removed,to use global entry line to reenter us kids need global entry if you have tsa precheck for security kids can come with
churning,not_removed,i am in the same exact situation both your kids will be required to sign up too as well make it easy on yourself and sign up all at the same time so that you can schedule the interviews one right after the other in one whole hour time slot minutes each
churning,not_removed,amex has an agreement with chase to verify purchases of amex gift cards using the verify visa program i had to call in and they sent a text to my phone to verify that it was me making the purchase i was then set
churning,not_removed,interesting did you go through chasecomverifycard to activate it
churning,not_removed,strange mine didnt have a sticker either but i called in anyways thinking that it was necessary to activate it the rep told me that there was no need to call in it was activated already
churning,not_removed,your chase rep probably doesnt know what heshe is talking about i called when i got my csr to try to activate and was told that csrs are active and ready to use when they arrive since you were able to use yours immediately thats probably right id call again
churning,not_removed,peace of mind about passport ge etc is pretty valuable especially for a first international trip when you have a lot of other things to do for passport processing time alone i wouldnt expedite but for the ge application timing it seems worth it to me good luck
churning,not_removed,might be possible not sure if it would be worth it i wouldnt pay the expedite fee just for a chance to get ge piggy backing off her appointment may or may not work depending on how busy the office is
churning,not_removed,if you werent planning on applying for global entry the answer would be easy nine weeks is plenty of time to receive a passport however if you need to get the passport and then get a ge appt i would most certainly expedite it while you would probably be okay why subject yourself to the added stress
churning,not_removed,i sent them my passport renewal the first part of november and got it back over the weekend if you want a dp on time for processing though i understand first passports may take longer best advice is to just bite the bullet and pay up though youd hate to encounter an issue that keeps you from your trip
churning,not_removed,just as a global entry dp when i applied online it took about weeks for them to process the initial application to conditional status which means you are finally able to schedule an interview you cannot see what interview slots are available until your account has reached conditional status when that time comes depending on where you live you may be shocked to see that many interview sites are booked well over months in advance you may get lucky with an interview slot opening up on short notice but that requires alot of checking which imo is not worth it especially since you need interview slots it would be very difficult to pull off
churning,not_removed,if your airport supports it use the new us customs phone app lets you go in ge lane and almost as fast
churning,not_removed,i applied for a passport for my son a few weeks ago and have already recieved it it was not expedited and took less than weeks
churning,not_removed,it would be wise to keep your msing away from your primary bank or anywhere you have funds that you cant afford to lose access to dont shit where you eat
churning,not_removed,thats one of the main reasons i really havent gotten into msing you could probably open a second or third account at a different bank to kind of break things up so if something did happen you still have access to your money at a different back
churning,not_removed,i believe the recommendation is not to use your main bank or anywhere that you want to keep a relationship with
churning,not_removed,ive read people had success by removing the card and adding it back
churning,not_removed,im trying to use the mpx app but my transaction keeps getting declined double check your address on the app
churning,not_removed,dont worry happened to me a couple times when i first added my plat eventually after a couple days was able to purchase gc then it would happen again where i had to wait few more days to purchase the gc
churning,not_removed,just delete your card and add it again the next day worked for me
churning,not_removed,free vacation feels good eh d
churning,not_removed,have any spg swan and dolphin is right in the heart of the wdw complex and has access to the disney transportation system you can also im told book the disneyowned resorts via the chase ur portal if you have ur if you havent been to wdw in a while swing by rwaltdisneyword a disney trip any more has a lot of things one needs to know to maximize your roi oh and have a great trip
churning,not_removed,from what ive read and from personal experience i would say yes in most cases it is this might differ if you get a targeted mailer though
churning,not_removed,do you have a ton of these transactions or just the one i put a bunch of stuff on my cc for my mom and when she paid me back i put it in a different account
churning,not_removed,i would just be honest with them about what you are doing and why if you try to hide it they might think you are doing something illegal and they still might think you are going something illegal even with the explanation you might not get approved i hope it all works out good luck
churning,not_removed,chase will very likely approve you are you above
churning,not_removed,why not just buy an airline or hotel gift card youre assuming the transaction will post and trigger the credit in a day which is unlikely to be the case
churning,not_removed,httpwwwdoctorofcreditcomkrogerhardcodessystemnotallowgiftcardmoneyorders
churning,not_removed,i did vgcs from cvs on nov with no issues edit location hampton roads va
churning,not_removed,httpwwwdoctorofcreditcomkrogerhardcodessystemnotallowgiftcardmoneyorders contrary dps exist
churning,not_removed,are you sure its not your parents grandparents or another close family member of yours account
churning,not_removed,if you still have time you might consider adding organic spend to meet the minimum spend just in case
churning,not_removed,if you can afford to transfer out ie have a reasonable place to transfer points to away from amex clawback then might as well is my logic
churning,not_removed,i dont think you can buy any kind of gift card with a staples gift card iirc last time i had a staples gc i searched high and low for a way to buy a different gc with it but i wound up selling the staples gc to giftcardzen at of face value
churning,not_removed,yes me too i messaged the mods but no response its been a week
churning,not_removed,for chase it is probably opening a business checking for amex just apply for one and you should get more offers
churning,not_removed,they shouldnt
churning,not_removed,i had the back on and used it on cards last time around without a problem and just did it again yesterday
churning,not_removed,plat is the only one i would be cautious with any other card is fine
churning,not_removed,i havent but i was told it was shipped when i called in i guess somehow i forgot to opt in for shipping notifications even though i got one on the prg you can try calling amex customer service at
churning,not_removed,once you start taking advantage of good offers all the targeted amex offers start drying up quickly you will never again get the good offers when you are logged into your account in order to recreate some of offers later on many suggest browsing offers through incognitovpntor
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,why not share the trip in the trip report thread
churning,not_removed,the language in the mailer is referring to deltas httpwwwdeltacomcontentwwwenusskymilesusemilespaywithmileshtml program which is only available to delta skymiles credit cardholders it provides a floor of cpp essentially allowing you to offset in flight costs for skymiles for all the bad mouthing delta gets in the hobby its an often overlooked perk thats actually pretty nice as it provides some protection from deltas infamous devaluations im not defending their zeronotice devals but at least theyre providing some consolation to frequent fliers
churning,not_removed,so the smallest amount you would spend on a one way domestic would be so the increments of makes sense the card will earn you skymiles info here httpswwwuscreditcardguidecomamexgolddeltaskymilescreditcard and for how much a flight would cost look at this post from days ago hope this helps you should be able to get better returns than that for your points depending on who you book award flights to and where you are flying to
churning,not_removed,my wife got the same mailer but i did not see the af waivedgotta check back thx for the heads up
churning,not_removed,i believe there have been threads here discussing the rental insurance may try a search i would be very interested to hear about your experience once its all wrapped up good luck
churning,not_removed,check flyertalk probably more dp there
churning,not_removed,wow thats close make sure there are no autopays set up on that card and then do not touch it
churning,not_removed,i would seriously consider changing payment for some purchase you put on there im a little ocd but better safe than sorry
churning,not_removed,holy shit the churning gods have their fingers on the trigger ready to strike you down do not spend another dime until next year
churning,not_removed,ive heard people get the bonus early sometimes if theyre close in min spend its a courtesy but in this case you might be screwed
churning,not_removed,yes no one counts fees sadly
churning,not_removed,wowi thought i was cutting it close running mine up to or so sock drawer that thing and early congrats on the cp
churning,not_removed,fees dont count but for the sake of all that is holy please stay away from the card
churning,not_removed,maybe theyll make an exception in your case
churning,not_removed,that is correct the rebate is only on the personal aa card not the business card
churning,not_removed,send referral to yourself click the link then copy the url on the apply page should be in the same format as the others if it is auto mod doesnt like you
churning,not_removed,also no extra spaces or returns
churning,not_removed,login here cards eligible will show up
churning,not_removed,so when i do this the links i receive have the word email in them instead of and eventually get removed as well is that whats happening to you too
churning,not_removed,i am in the same boat about inquiries on experian two or less on tu and eq
churning,not_removed,i got the one but not the other hmm
churning,not_removed,so a much of amazon gift cards
churning,not_removed,if the status line only mentions one application then your second application did not go through its as if you have not applied recommend resubmitting your plus application this is related to submitting multiple applications in short order from the same browser it is a wellknown thing
churning,not_removed,i had that happen to me over the weekend just resubmit the plus application and you should get a response i take it you had both tabs open at the same time i think thats what caused it to give me that message
churning,not_removed,doesnt hurt to try you can always try and transfer credit line if needed be ready to answer questions though sometimes the second southwest app goes pending because the system flags it for review in case its a duplicate app
churning,not_removed,business gold is a charge card not a credit card so doest apply
churning,not_removed,i have both biz gold and biz plat also personal gold and plat all were approved instantly i think you are going to be fine
churning,not_removed,about a month ago i called in and mentioned that i was thinking of cancelling due to having another travel card csr the customer service rep said i was a valued customer blah blah and offered me a statement credit to not cancel so net after premier hits in jan
churning,not_removed,there is not a noaf card available for downgrade
churning,not_removed,they dont waive either
churning,not_removed,i did no offers plus premier
churning,not_removed,unfortunately you cant downgrade the sw cards to anything without an af i havent seen any dp of people getting their fees waived but its always worth a shot
churning,not_removed,i have never gotten mine waived but i have gotten them to offer me bonus spend incentives to keep the card another year if you dont hear what you want to hear huca hang up call again and talk to a different rep
churning,not_removed,probably takes a couple days
churning,not_removed,for me it was not automatic but it did eventually sync up maybe took days
churning,not_removed,where do you go to link it thanks edit you log in and go to benefits easy
churning,not_removed,eataly opened today in boston am i using the amex obc for grocery or my csr for restaurant restaurant dinning source been to one in chicago back in september using csr
churning,not_removed,you will get a bunch of questions re your most recent hps but if you have a reasonable explanation i doubt it would affect your rate on the other note do you think the rates will keep climbing stabilize or go down i just wonder why months unless you somehow lock the rate for such a long time
churning,not_removed,something to consider a biz card will still put an inquiry on your report lots of recent inquiries even without new credit lines is regarded as bad whether it will affect you is another story given you are well above the threshold for the lowest rates i would listen to someone with experience search the sub for such dps too bad reddits search feature is so terrible i would never pay to get my fico score given the plethora of free options heck a simple experiancom signup wo a fico would be sufficient for you you worry too much
churning,not_removed,what number did you call ive gotten the run around twice with no definitive answer
churning,not_removed,is that from the targeted mailer email or paper mail i realllyyyy want that bonus
churning,not_removed,totally depends on who is working in the lounge and if they want to check
churning,not_removed,ive been in a similar situation a few times ive never had any trouble with my friends going in with me no one with the hotel ever checked anything or asked any questions you could always have a different experience with it being a different hotel however
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,it is under
churning,not_removed,no if you are denied that would not be the reason for your denial
churning,not_removed,amex likely knows that you have a hard credit pull from chase but they dont know what you applied for or the status because your new csr account is not yet on your credit report
churning,not_removed,i had applied for two chase cards two weeks before i applied for the amex plat and was approved on all three cards so that card in particular shouldnt matter
churning,not_removed,no if you get denied from amex youre probably doing something seriously wrong they hand out cards like candiesyou should be fine
churning,not_removed,i dont have any issues finding hilton availability i was even able to find availability to use my free weekend night certs during mardi gras this year you looking only around high occupancy events
churning,not_removed,have noticed the same thing unfortunately especially when searching out down the calendar i have notice availability pop back up from time to time
churning,not_removed,hilton has a thing where it doesnt show availability if you dont have the points for it try it again in incognitonot logged in and the available days should show up
churning,not_removed,call again right now and tell them you want a product change i promise you it has a likelier chance of succeeding than saying downgrade
churning,not_removed,just sm and theyll do it for you
churning,not_removed,huca
churning,not_removed,how long have you had the ink
churning,not_removed,yes but not until they lower the sign up bonus
churning,not_removed,maybe when the bonus drops from they probably think the bonus is sufficient incentive now
churning,not_removed,im sure they eventually will when that will be is a whole other question
churning,not_removed,iirc you can transfer as little as mr to avios
churning,not_removed,good luck ive seen dps where chase refuses to match
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,id reach out to plastiq and ask them
churning,not_removed,has the recipient cashed the check
churning,not_removed,i had an days in process that finally cashed yesterday i contacted plastiq on monday and they said it was because of some one day holiday called thanksgiving
churning,not_removed,might want to wait for a bit and see how things play out i was able to buy amazon gcs on mpx last night with no problem but many dps are suggesting that the reimbursements have not been credited since november and after
churning,not_removed,known issue if you recently made the mpx account gotta wait about a week before it will let you make a purchase support will probably tell you to wait days if you already had the account not sure whats going on
churning,not_removed,just another dp i got my platinum card today and used mpx to buy a amazon gc without issue note that my united mileageplus account is about months old
churning,not_removed,yep with baconreader
churning,not_removed,whoops 🙃
churning,not_removed,i have an app where i need to swipe to bring up any interactions so for me i dont mistakenly up or down vote
churning,not_removed,your first statement needs to end in december in order to get the travel credit sm chase to find out the exact date in terms of meeting the travel spend paying for any of your upcoming travels hotelstrainsflights etc in advance would be the easiest way
churning,not_removed,i feel your pain im still waiting as well though not like i should be in a rush because im assuming my mr are frozen like the others but i havent checked for sure
churning,not_removed,i dont think they charge your card until it ships so it might not appear until its actually with the courier
churning,not_removed,have you checked your pending transactions
churning,not_removed,as long as you can easily reach the minimum spend requirement for both id say by all means go for it i would suggest applying for the citi hilton first as citibank is more inquiry sensitive than amex amex is super easy to get approved for
churning,not_removed,yup
churning,not_removed,why dont you go try it and be the dp
churning,not_removed,be the dp you want to see in the world
churning,not_removed,the dps that i have seen but not personally done are as follows office max gcs work vanillas do not work
churning,not_removed,i believe you can only load serve cards with other amex cards now
churning,not_removed,yes honda financial services is one of the few that i use with plastiq no problems on their end accepting and depositing the check
churning,not_removed,use plastiq for all my hfs payments no issues usually very quick as well
churning,not_removed,no probably not unless needed to top off or something pointscom probably no bonuses like travelairfarerestaurants
churning,not_removed,buying the points can be worth it if youre going to stay at some of the highend hotels i just bought some earlier in nov to use at intercon amsterdam while this does make the stay cheaper it was extra useful as it allowed me to basically get free nights buy purchasing roughly points as i had points already they do not code as travel or anything special
churning,not_removed,try the automated status line
churning,not_removed,days on the website is pretty standard do not worry there is no online application status tool call an automated line google it
churning,not_removed,i dont think any citi cards have referrals
churning,not_removed,if youve had your csp for more than a year theyll let you downgrade
churning,not_removed,you can pc csp after one year
churning,not_removed,yes you can definitely do this if youve had the csp for at least a year you can pc directly into cfu if youve had the csp for less than a year then you have to go through the csp cs cfu route
churning,not_removed,to my knowledge there are constantly codes circulating to waive the shipping or purchase fees i get one of these codes with every order
churning,not_removed,yep i got one of these codes
churning,not_removed,yes credit karma reports au accounts
churning,not_removed,even better option is to use free experian appwebsite i find its score and info more realistic and uptodate
churning,not_removed,set to release through june on december annoying i know
churning,not_removed,amex bce
churning,not_removed,httpswwwnerdwalletcomblogtheofficialnerdwalletguideyourcreditcardsextendedwarrantypolicy looks like amex cards win out so no af amex cards like the blue cash everyday
churning,not_removed,lots of options i cant name them all and wont try but here are some highlights my favorite is discover it which has very good and friendly side benefits price protection extended warranty return protection most citi cards including double cash and dividend also offer those benefits with no af chase freedom does too a few nofee amex cards including the blue cash everyday have the extended warranty side but dont offer the price protection side
churning,not_removed,why doesnt dell cover hinge failure under their year warranty
churning,not_removed,how could you possibly commit fraud with this
churning,not_removed,it was definitely they never talk about the rule specifically but its pretty clear telling you that they do not want to extend you more credit but still rejecting to split your existing credit shows that their excuse was bullshit
churning,not_removed,they kept coming back to wanting to see how id perform with the csp your answer is right here apply back in months wife and i are currently meeting spend on her csr but perhaps itll be better if i keep some activity on csp for relationship building purposes it wont hurt your case but i personally dont think it is a big deal
churning,not_removed,wont work as lenny said referral points go to your amex cards first then only to your partner account tagging unoahmateen since he seems curious as well sauce tried with spg
churning,not_removed,if you do not have any delta card open on your amex account i doubt you will receive points because those points show up in your delta skymiles account as comeing through american express and if there is no amex account then there is nowhere for the points to come from also the terms say the account must be open at the time of the referral bonus coming through in order for you to receive points i am going to experiment with this i am optimistic that it may work because i have a delta platinum account open set up with the same skymiles number i will let you know what happensif am able to confirm a referral got approved for gold
churning,not_removed,i believe that is long dead
churning,not_removed,fyi i got that offer on all of my mr cards eventually
churning,not_removed,if youre still under pass on the crazy app sprees and load up now on chase cards csrcspinksouthwest for companion passunited etc fill up on chase until then go nuts dont try for more then in a month though if youre at or you can just get the chase stuff and hit up amex if needed after you have approval i was considering the delta plat but decided to hold until next year because the mqm bonus would be wasted
churning,not_removed,not positive about this but i think most of the purchase protections do not apply for black friday related sales
churning,not_removed,chase might but dont count on it discover is probably your best bet for price protection
churning,not_removed,i vote for recon otherwise chase will have to pull her report again to see the changes
churning,not_removed,many dps stated that recon is best route the csr will see the au and any store cards and then reconsider
churning,not_removed,even after years the novelty of hearing oh wow thats a thick card hasnt worn off almost makes up for totally stretching out the card slot in my wallet
churning,not_removed,until someone with a black card comes along and shakes their head
churning,not_removed,you can check which offer you get when you apply in branch cant you if he wasnt getting the getting the match should have walked out
churning,not_removed,you can also try sm to chase
churning,not_removed,i did something similar to this with a csp two years ago dad was taking clients out to a dinner that ended up being and took one of my csp i did get fraud alerts and they shut down the cards once i called and verified everything was fine and both cards worked again that being said i dont know if the tier person was looking at location of charges the large amount that was charged or had a reason to escalate after talking to me we never attempted it again because we dont churn ur cards because theyre our main program we find the most value in and have the entire suite edit words
churning,not_removed,i dont think it would get flagged i have aus on my chase cards in foreign countries never informed chase and all charges go through with no issues ever
churning,not_removed,just as dp i gave my parents an au card on my chase ba to get through the minimum spend they spent in one day in a location miles away from my home address and chase didnt even call me to verify anything transactions just went through
churning,not_removed,not sure what you mean do you mean one of those earn aa miles offers if thats what you mean then yes if you dont use the code in the email which will generally cost more then you dont get the miles
churning,not_removed,if you have other cards planned for skip the cfu and pc unless you can get the in branch offer which is ridiculously solid
churning,not_removed,as long as u bought the item before the sale ad and it has been less than days since the day you are good
churning,not_removed,yes had mr previously no ms
churning,not_removed,i went through this back in may and just waited it out never contacted amex i didnt ms at all and made sure to spend a bit over to be safe i had also gotten the prg at the same time bonus so all those were frozen too my points were unfrozen weeks from when i originally received the bonus no issues since then
churning,not_removed,as far as i know theres no way to tell unless you try to submit a transfer and get the error message saying your account is under review
churning,not_removed,ouch
churning,not_removed,did you get a confirmation email prior to them cancelling im worried now i order two different nameaddress but same card and received the confirmation email
churning,not_removed,thats all it takes worked for me and the app had a confirmation in a few minutes
churning,not_removed,dont think they will stack as the boa is on auto reload as fyi
churning,not_removed,amex gift cards are feefree again at cvs this week
churning,not_removed,my wife doesnt have an account but was preapproved and accepted instantly i have an account and was not
churning,not_removed,interesting hadnt looked enough at those dps to know if that was a prerequisite or not guess its up to my wife then i thought about reapplying for a checking account since you can churn that banking bonus but i dont really want to do anything that could piss chase off and damage my relationship
churning,not_removed,i dont have a chase checking account only credit card accounts was preapproved in branch for csr a few months ago while at
churning,not_removed,i was preapproved for csr without a chase account of any kind i had only ever banked with bank of america and had investment accounts at vanguard i had my first credit card for years before i check to see if i was preapproved for the csr and i was so i got it i asked churning and they said to go for the csr first
churning,not_removed,i was preapproved for csr without a chase checking account in august
churning,not_removed,sucks guess its ymmv with bankers too
churning,not_removed,i never got notified that i got approved until the card came in the mail took about weeks couldnt hurt to call and check your application status
churning,not_removed,i was approved the first business day after i applied httpswwwbankofamericacomcreditcardsapplicationstatusappstatusformgo if its been days and youre still pending i would call in
churning,not_removed,i called minutes after i applied and they pushed it through over the phone immediately i then applied for alaska right after and called with the same outcome barely any questions asked at all
churning,not_removed,one card for each limb you plan to lose
churning,not_removed,was months the upper bound last time i have no plans to use mr in the next months so im hoping that ill be able to safely ride out a freeze if there is one
churning,not_removed,its not the first dp someone already reported this yesterday i have cards with amex and i have never msed on them so i hope everything is fine because i have close to mr without counting the new amex plat card bonus
churning,not_removed,no ms at all
churning,not_removed,their tc states that they can take points back for any reason or no reason at all most rewards programs have this language
churning,not_removed,dont think amex can freeze points from another rewards program but they could always withhold them
churning,not_removed,load up all inactive ccs with cent charges times a year and twice a year rshittychurning thanks ill generate a statement with this month
churning,not_removed,seattle studio is small but very nice
churning,not_removed,very easy its near gate i walked there from c terminal i believe all of the domestic terminals are connected
churning,not_removed,i end up trying to set up mediumlong layovers whenever i fly through iah just to sit there and get some work done a hour connection is already pushing it but hours is usually my norm
churning,not_removed,nope defaults back to thai every time
churning,not_removed,account wasnt even funded yet
churning,not_removed,sole prop im supposed to send in docs after openingwhich the welcome letter explained but they didnt even give me the chance
churning,not_removed,still wouldnt call that a smart move my amex id say the majority of people that applied this time around are either smart enough to not ms at all on this plat or are somewhat clueless and dont have previous ms on amex cards anyways even at the potential of clawing back points for ms done by users with other amex mr cards there is a very high chance they will have to end up paying out the points offered for this card since most everyone knows not to mess around with ms whatsoever this time around
churning,not_removed,yeah but this time around the link was not exactly leaked it was on a legit website
churning,not_removed,my existing points mostly earned from my second brg i have not even received my plat yet
churning,not_removed,not op but for me existing points were frozen dont even have plat card yet
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,i had some ms on my brg i guess well have to wait it out
churning,not_removed,good luck
churning,not_removed,its my first amex card i see the big fat zero but nothing about being frozen
churning,not_removed,i never got a shipping email and mine came in the mail yesterday have her call customer service they can tell her if its on the way
churning,not_removed,did they post immediately or sometime later ive been trying a handful of times in the last hours but none have translated to any activity on my card so far
churning,not_removed,good to know you got the same behavior with multiple cards i didnt want to get another gc that wouldnt be reimbursed just to test my observations were on an iphone too but tested on my wifes android and got the same error will wait a few days and trying again
churning,not_removed,question have you used mpx before
churning,not_removed,same here
churning,not_removed,first time ill try again in a week or so
churning,not_removed,time using mpx
churning,not_removed,depends on the she but usually same pnr kids get pre anyway
churning,not_removed,they tried that with me too i called in with my verizon phone so texts couldnt get through at that point id been on hold for minutes and figured answering verification questions was the easiest route instead of huca
churning,not_removed,nope just started using it and everything went through except for a walmart purchase and even then a bigger purchase at walmart the next day did go through
churning,not_removed,yeah its basically a gamble thanks for the input
churning,not_removed,thanks for the info yes it would be awful i should have applied sooner in hindsight but i wasnt thinking
churning,not_removed,thanks yeah the only hope i have is the my gf gets approved soon i think she is around the week mark not sure though luckily or maybe not we are at a smaller airport that has ge appointments so im hoping scheduling is easier ive read multiple of dps on here where one so scheduled an appointment and the other went with and were able to get a walk in so thats basically what i would be banking on worse case with going expedited is im out and have my passport a little sooner
churning,not_removed,do you know of any banks that would be completely fee free
churning,not_removed,will try this thanks edit didnt work
churning,not_removed,my address is correct
churning,not_removed,according to credit karma my equifax score is now about with the discover removed tu and experian are about
churning,not_removed,this sucks heading to visit family this week out of town where a couple of krogers exist purchased a couple of thousand gfs a couple of weeks ago in anticipation of cashing out with some mos used to love my local frys but we moved to a state with none will just have to load to my serve or try the po this is a total bummer
churning,not_removed,used to live at chx beach and loved my little kroger across the street dont have them where i live now but was going to check out a couple of krogers this weekend in auburn al thanks for the dpenjoy the beach super jealous
churning,not_removed,seems if you cant get lucky and find a store by dec that has not yet gotten the update you are sol if only it had been pushed another weekspoiled my plans
churning,not_removed,im positive nobody has a chase account theyre all from puerto rico im the only one in the states i have a really common name and id venture to guess it must be some guy with a similar one
churning,not_removed,it was possible on the staples website to buy other gift cards with a staples gift card until sometime last year originally the page was rendered with the gift card entry present on the screen but greyed out and you could just hack it to turn it on but they fixed that maybe months ago
churning,not_removed,ahh thanks very helpful just to be clear with this card and points earned i could use miles for off a delta ticket or a round trip domestic saver economy ticket if available
churning,not_removed,thanks for the links just wanted to make sure i knew what i was getting into seems like a decent deal especially with only spend
churning,not_removed,i put it in a safe and buried the key close one definitely will pay closer attention going forward
churning,not_removed,really that seems like i could fight it through the tcs
churning,not_removed,holy crap dont use that card for anything af definitely dont count and that would be horrible to accidentally hit it before
churning,not_removed,this did it thanks
churning,not_removed,it was so once you click that link and the application page loads the url will change use that instead
churning,not_removed,okay thank you i submitted both from google chrome however it was in incognito mode does that make a difference and do you recommend waiting for days before applying for the plus thanks a lot for your help
churning,not_removed,yep same thing happened to me resubmit
churning,not_removed,i had to answer the why do you need two southwest cards question over the weekend i fly southwest for both personal and business and im tired of redacting my statements to get reimbursed worked just fine i honestly think any halfway intelligent answer will work
churning,not_removed,nice im not sure how i got targeted for a business card but ill take it havent sold a thing on ebay for years now
churning,not_removed,no offers means they did not waive it
churning,not_removed,do you mind sharing what the bonus spend incentive was that you got offered
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,i have credit karma and a cc with from every bureau and i have the experian account with fico im more getting at if i should be worried about getting it to obtain my mortgage scores the fico mortgage model is different from the model and yields a different score this is not available freely anywhere im aware of
churning,not_removed,i called and was able to get through fairly quickly that way
churning,not_removed,i got a mailer and an email for it as well as when i logged into my delta account it showed up on the homepage i feel like they want me to apply for this card
churning,not_removed,thx
churning,not_removed,not really i have tried different dates that i am actually traveling in japan a couple places in europe and i have also looked mid week for one night to see if i could get an idea of the rate i will take a look at nola though since i have family around there maybe ill book a year in advance for halloween
churning,not_removed,agreed i recently did that for an fu to f quick response and card changed overnight
churning,not_removed,thanks looks like i got frozen though
churning,not_removed,hes talking about the mr he already had from other cards prior to applying
churning,not_removed,yep i got the leaked plat and my points are frozen i have mr left from getting the amex gold card and i wasnt allowed to transfer them because my account is under review i just activated my plat card today and havent bought anything on it yet
churning,not_removed,cool thanks im paranoid after my amex plat debacle in may ha
churning,not_removed,not that i know of plastiq usually informs me by email when the transaction is completed
churning,not_removed,as another datapoint i have a seasoned mpx account opened over a year ago and used as recently as days ago today i attempted an amazon purchase and got the error message for the first time
churning,not_removed,same here got my everyday card yesterday the letter telling me im approved for the ed today still no amex plat
churning,not_removed,thanks for the response hypothetically speaking if i get rejected from citi is it a good idea to apply for amex hilton straightaway i am new to churning credit cards thanks in advance
churning,not_removed,the post was actually meant to be more of a psa and sharing info because if all krogers hardcoded against vgc mo as they were rumored to have as of yesterday then it would have a dramatic effect on a lot of people i dont have any vgcs at the moment and i rarely liquidate at harris teeter so if there was a change it wont really effect my strategy it probably doesnt matter at this point this post is buried
churning,not_removed,sorry needed to be more clear in my post i tried to load my serve at walmart with a vgc that i bought at walmart the pin last digits didnt work with this one particular card i used a different vgc that i purchased at the same time as the other that didnt work that loaded up just fine i just need to find a way to change the pin since the website on the back of the card doesnt seem to have that option
churning,not_removed,forgive my ignorance but plastiq charges you a fee of to send the payment to hfs right
churning,not_removed,how do they know what account youre paying off using plastiq i didnt see a way to add my account number
churning,not_removed,i have an fu already can i go csp cs fu and end up with fus edit csp is less than a year
churning,not_removed,thanks yeah a bit annoying but at least their redemptions dont require availability or this would be a huge pain
churning,not_removed,if i buy with my plat but end up changing amex cards will the warranty remain
churning,not_removed,what happens if i put it on one card and then cancel it i have play now but wont be keeping it but will be getting other amex cards
churning,not_removed,thats a good question apparently its wear and tear and not an actual failure i tweeted at them to change their username from dellcares to delldoesntcare
churning,not_removed,i could lie and resubmit an insurance claim stating my motherboard or something failed and the computer wont turn on i could purposely damage the motherboard or fan or something in order to file a valid claim
churning,not_removed,wow i always assumed theyd just come out and say it i suppose ill wait and try again in february when ill have business figures for this year and be solidly back under even including store cards and au thanks for chiming in
churning,not_removed,i have the delta gold platinum cards i want to cancel my gold but my roommate is going to sign up for the gold in january i plan on keeping my platinum open for now please do let me know though as we are in the same boat
churning,not_removed,yes i just bought uber gift cards this month with a gamestop gift card edit meant to reply to op anyway its not dead
churning,not_removed,so they let buy a xbox live gift card credit for buying stuff on xbox live with a gamestop gift card i bought at office max maybe its only certain gift cards you cant use a gamestop gift card for
churning,not_removed,it is not dead the pos terminal still allows for it some of the employees refuse to allow you to perform the transaction so it is a matter of finding one that looks weak
churning,not_removed,not dead just very ymmv at the gamestop near me they said no ebayamazonetc but let me buy gas gift cards with a gamestop one
churning,not_removed,sweet thank you
churning,not_removed,i havent opened a new card in years credit score i have the delta gold offer thats been talked about on this sub which is really tempting since i fly delta i already use amex for most of my spending but i use a chase freedom for the at costco
churning,not_removed,it was that price until yesterday
churning,not_removed,it was still that price as of yesterday after thanksgiving sale is there a reason you say chase might are they notorious for denying any claims
churning,not_removed,thank you and yeah she has a fing nordstrom card last week she was about to open a banana republic card good thing i was there d
churning,not_removed,almost
churning,not_removed,that is definitely one of my favorite things itll never get old
churning,not_removed,ive been an au with my parents for years even though i live miles away occasionally theyll get a text asking if a charge was legit but nothing ever more than that i bet youd be fine
churning,not_removed,ah but my parents would not be aus just using a card with the same name and number
churning,not_removed,so doing a pc product change counts towards the i need something to earn points for gc spends
churning,not_removed,ill prob do the same i havent ever msd a sign up bonus so i should be good there and i think i can wait until jan before i need the points not really sure even what im going to do with them still getting through my sw pointsur hopefully they unfreeze if they are frozen by the end of jan thanks
churning,not_removed,yes got an order confirmation email i got my cancellation email a few hours later though its been a while now so im sure youre fine
churning,not_removed,has she had one previously and cancelled
churning,not_removed,and theres the dp i was looking for thanks
churning,not_removed,thanks looks like having a banking relationship with chase is not a prerequisite but may improve your chances since theres no chase branches in my state ill continue my strategy of checking for preapprovals when i travel to cities with branches
churning,not_removed,was your first cc also from chase
churning,not_removed,sounds good the wait is the worst part
churning,not_removed,thanks yeah ive been checking that site like a mad man lol this is the first card that has gone to pending for me so im still new to the actually calling and talking to someone haha
churning,not_removed,cool do you have a banking relationship with boa
churning,not_removed,did exactly the same time not less than minutes after applying called in the lady was super nice asked a few standard verification questions and then put me on hold approved applied for the alaska card immediately afterwards approved applied for the amtrak card immediately after that approved applied for the bbr immediately after that approved then i made a chicken pot pie and poured myself a glass of wine dinner was delicious
churning,not_removed,im sure you should be fine then
churning,not_removed,great to hear thanks for the info
churning,not_removed,i usually just go through security in the international terminal d because the lines are shorter and then stop at the lounges before making it to my actual terminal havent gone for amex yet so i have just been to the pp lounges i know centurion is quite a step up edit if you have precheck go through terminal c as suggested
churning,not_removed,well youre thai now
churning,not_removed,this is important wow all my other amex cards are cobranded and this plat is my first mr card i havent seen anything yet but ill be on the lookout now
churning,not_removed,nice starting out big this gives me hope that my card will show up in time to pay rent with it i got the shipped email late sunday
churning,not_removed,yes it wasnt the first time using it ive used it with about different credit cards with no issues
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,what kind of phone do you have texts went through fine for me on a verizon smartphone
churning,not_removed,thats weird that being said i always activate my cards through that site before using them none of my chase cards ever came with a sticker hope that helps
churning,not_removed,id recomment credit unions local or otherwise like alliant as theyre are often free or online banks like discover ally etc some allow mobile mo deposit via apps which is nice flyertalk would be the place to look for more uptodate dps on that
churning,not_removed,could you please report if it did or didnt help i am sure tons of people will be experiencing this issue very soon
churning,not_removed,whats your aaoa
churning,not_removed,thats the one i use on shore drive small world
churning,not_removed,war eagle
churning,not_removed,clear it before something happen a missed payment on his end will hurt more in the long run for you
churning,not_removed,that is exactly correct essentially it gives you the option to either redeem using their mystery award chart at hopefully cpp and if you cant find a good redemption you can fall back on pwm
churning,not_removed,you can also use the statement to get a gust card through delta of that is who you decide to fly through to offset any other costs and yeah its a good deal but just remember there is a targeted deal as well
churning,not_removed,you can try good luck with that though look on doc i think there are accounts of people in the same situation and werent able to get the points moved
churning,not_removed,you can wait if you want if the premier is your only chase app in the last days you can resubmit your plus app now if you want whatever you are comfortable with unfortunately you will get a second hard pull for the plus app since it will be submitted on a different day from the premier app im a little light on the details of how the second app fails to go through but it is reported quite often maybe others can explain
churning,not_removed,with some explanation there are many more dps but im terrible at searching reddit
churning,not_removed,yeah i said i wanted to separate expenses and the combined anniversary bonus pts pts should be enough to visit my mother a few times a year bit of a stretch since shes a minute drive away
churning,not_removed,just make sure you understand the benefits of biz gold it does not have airline incidental fee benefits if you wanted to double dip but for is pretty good
churning,not_removed,most recently back in january i called to cancel my southwest premier and was offered points for spending just to keep it open funny thing is that i never put the on it and the bonus was added in addition to the annual points
churning,not_removed,yes they use fico or but this is not something you should be nearly worried about you have your fico from every bureau and it solidly puts you in the best rate category—what are you going to do with your fico that you cant with your even if you didnt have your the only thing youd be doing is making sure your utilization is down before applying no what else could you do you worry too much
churning,not_removed,interesting did you have any amex delta cards priorcurrently and is your ahem ahem mailer code still available
churning,not_removed,are you looking at weekend dates in the spring for japan by any chance thats high season due to cherry blossom time and hilton points per night for japan sounds pretty reasonable some places like the tokyo conrad go upwards of pointsnight
churning,not_removed,if you hadnt already checked idve said that to plenti would be the best the best option since at worst you have you have to redeem at exxon
churning,not_removed,if you are new to churning i strongly recommend that you reconsider whether there are any chase cards you want before you apply for the citi hilton
churning,not_removed,not sure how new you are to churning credit cards i was assuming that you were over actually before you start applying for hilton cards please read the entire churning wiki at httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiindex with special attention to the section in short you should target chase cards first if you havent already
churning,not_removed,unless on a promo
churning,not_removed,when creating a payment on desktop plastiq asks for the account number and i also put it in the memo field
churning,not_removed,downgrade to a regular freedom if you already have a fu even if you already have the regular freedom it is better to have a second one of those as you can double dip on the categories increasing from to across the two cards theres no benefit to you for having two fus
churning,not_removed,i know people with two chase freedoms but not fus if you want to avoid having fus simultaneously then you could pc the fu cf first then once thats complete pc the csp cs cfu
churning,not_removed,no you have to keep the card in good standing to have them pay a claim edit actually im not sure if you could change cards i would assume if it becomes a different account number youd lose out on the extended warranty
churning,not_removed,no idea ive never used the extended warranty i would assume they wouldnt allow it once the card is closed though
churning,not_removed,just a friendly reminder that theyll refund the af up to days after the statement which the af is posted on is closed hopefully that can give you the flexibility to close after the referral goes through also its worth noting that the amex delta referral points posts within days unlike chase sometimes
churning,not_removed,buying gift cards for amazon itunes etcetera with gamestop gift cards
churning,not_removed,out of curiosity what was the bonus for on the blue cash preferred and if you really dont have any new cards in the past years i feel like the most recommended applications would be csr csp ink and either the sw cards for the companion pass or out of marriott united freedom unlimited personally even if i lived in a delta hub i would go after the ur first just because how strong hyatt is as a transfer partner that and since ur can be transferred to quite a few different airlines it tends to be more immune to devaluations it doesnt hurt though that i live in a sw hub
churning,not_removed,see from a few days ago for price protection info searching and sorting by new can be useful in this sub
churning,not_removed,expensive wine is expensive
churning,not_removed,au cards have the same number up to the digit cvc but im pretty sure this would get flagged given the different locations are you trying to hit ms
churning,not_removed,dont do it any charge they make probably wont go through and then how will you explain it to the chase fraud dept
churning,not_removed,no sorry i meant skip applying for it a pc yes shouldnt count as a new account ie impact since it is the same line of credit
churning,not_removed,a bank account with chase never
churning,not_removed,no it was a bank of america cash rewards i had negative marks on my count and the only history i had was the cash rewards card
churning,not_removed,its okay—everyone is at some point its actually very easy just be polite and try something along the lines of i applied for x card recently and havent received a response so i wanted to see if there was any more information you needed from me
churning,not_removed,i have had a checking account with for about a year and a half but that is it
churning,not_removed,i usually just go through security in the international terminal d because the lines are shorter huh ive never seen a short or efficient line at d also there is no precheck at d unless theyve added it since i last flew through there i always go through the pre check line at c
churning,not_removed,cool thanks
churning,not_removed,nice this is the dp i wanted to see thanks
churning,not_removed,iphone which afaik doesnt allow for simultaneous talk and text on verizon maybe im wrong though and made the whole process needlessly complicated
churning,not_removed,down to about month on equifax now ive opened accounts in the last two months that discover was the only older one
churning,not_removed,ill take a huge hit though i only got into the credit card game last year so all my accounts are fairly new my aaoa and my utilization are going to take a huge hit tanking my score shouldnt i at least apply to as many cards whose issuers use experian as i can before removing this account
churning,not_removed,yeah i saw the thread awhile back do you know if theyll match to that ill be trying to meet ms for the swcp and amex plat the next couple of months so i figured the spend would be an easy way to snag a couple round trips to msp to see family
churning,not_removed,but worrying too much is what im good at p really though thanks for the assurance my utilization is down pretty low overall with all cards but one reporting
churning,not_removed,i had not had a delta card previously the mailer was tied to my skymiles number
churning,not_removed,hmmm may use my chase freedom then
churning,not_removed,i was offered the upgrade from the blue cash everyday to the preferred for i net sure but i didnt get a hard pull and can downgrade next year until then i will enjoy the back on groceries i dont live in any big hub but i fly delta or jetblue usually when i travel occasionally american airlines but i dont like them nearly as much i am leaning towards just getting the csr and going from there since its a signup bonus and i can pair it with the freedom categories i just wasnt sure i wanted to invest in another card right nowive been with amex for a long time and will keep my platinum card for now
churning,not_removed,i feel like the most recommended applications would be csr csp ink and either the sw cards for the companion pass or out of marriott united freedom unlimited this is it but i would throw marriott in the mix of your pick apparently i am incapable of reading and the fu bonus is really only good if you be sure to get the in branch offer and really need ur for a planned redemption
churning,not_removed,yeah my parents spend a lot more money than i do currently paying off student loans so combining spend with them would be ideal but doesnt seem very plausible
churning,not_removed,yeah seems unwise ill probably just hand off the card entirely for christmas and take it back when needed ill mostly be making online purchases anyway
churning,not_removed,awesome so ill do the pc to cfu since id get it anyways and use my remaining spots for the sw cp and ink preferred thanks sir
churning,not_removed,hmm i wonder what data they had on you that made them preapprove you does chase do a soft pull when checking for preapprovals
churning,not_removed,i havent received my global entryprecheck yet so it works for me also i travelled during thanksgiving there were very few people leaving the country as compared to traveling around the us for this american holiday this actually may be the only time that this is beneficial
churning,not_removed,my transaction was declined yesterday and this is not my first time using mpx it occurred after adding my amex platinum to my account
churning,not_removed,read up on it and am pretty flabbergasted at such an obvious design flaw wow that said sms should work fine just nothing that uses data you probably wouldve been fine
churning,not_removed,that sounds like a good plan to me
churning,not_removed,oh man thats very ymmv the one is after spend and after another spend i doubt they would match i have yet to get matched for any of my cards
churning,not_removed,as a general rule amex does not match theres always isolated exceptions though
churning,not_removed,amazon and ebay no longer work at my local store register refused to accept gc as payment
churning,not_removed,csr is def the smart pick esp right now not only do you get ur but if you get it soon you can triple dip on the travel credit this year next year and then in before the window for annual fee refund closes completely negates the fee imo also makes all your freedom points more valuable since you can transfer them to partners or get the increased travel credit for cents a pointcents i
churning,not_removed,i dont live in a state with chase banks and bank with bofa so i wont get any in branch offers ive never used ur before just mr points have over mr points saved up now so this will be new to me but i think i am leaning towards getting the csr i may way until after new years though since i just bought my last plane ticket for the year and will have trouble using the credit unless i can buy a gift card to any airline i wish
churning,not_removed,yeah i was thinking top and it was the afterthought for people who dont need companion pass and has issues with either marriott or united
churning,not_removed,the alternative is just to sockdraw that card and let your parents hit ms for you
churning,not_removed,you could also pick up a visa gc to spend down while they have your card i think you can say online if you are traveling if not just sm them so they wont flag the initial charges for location
churning,not_removed,ink preferred technically doesnt occupy a spot in since it doesnt count on your personal report if youre now after southwest youll be at and even after ink youll be still able to get one more card after not before though as ink still checks for and if you get your card before ink youll be declined for ink
churning,not_removed,i could be misunderstanding what a preapproval is so i apologize if i am being a noob is a preapproval when you apply and it instaaccepts after i got the csr i checked prequalified offers from chase and i was prequalified for the csp and cfu i got both of them one a month later and now im no longer prequalified for anything
churning,not_removed,interesting thanks
churning,not_removed,it would but ive seen data points from the last couple months of people getting approved despite being over by using a targeted mailer ive received two of these in the last month so i figured id take my chances
churning,not_removed,minor correction its after spend additional after another spend total so the is actually a pretty good deal if hitting the spend will be tough so youre getting of the value for only spend depends how you value delta points obviously with that said i grabbed the offer
churning,not_removed,and potentially cards at if you apply on the same day
churning,not_removed,just did a pc from csp to cfu same number same credit line etc thanks so much
churning,not_removed,preapproval in this context refers to going into a chase branch and being told specifically by a banker that you are preapproved to apply for the chase sapphire reserve which appears to allow applicants to bypass chases ominous rule what you are referring to is likely instant approval which is something very different
churning,not_removed,very true would place the count at but yeah i forgot to mention this its actually my plan personally
churning,not_removed,not a problem enjoy
churning,not_removed,my bad i wasnt preapproved then afaik
churning,not_removed,perfect thank you so much guys
churning,not_removed,thanks for the clarification
churning,not_removed,thats fun if you have to travel for work
churning,not_removed,checked my account and i was not targeted for those that got this offer what do your a flying habits look like do you already have anything booked with then during this time period
churning,not_removed,bah not targeted
churning,not_removed,i received this offer im flying tomorrow and called to have alist added to my boarding pass and after about twenty minutes of hold time she said i think it might take hours to work so hopefully the offer ends up working
churning,not_removed,damnit this would be perfect right about now
churning,not_removed,not targeted literally sitting on a southwest flight right now and another one next week poo
churning,not_removed,took me a while to understand all the acronyms in this title
churning,not_removed,heh send a screenshot
churning,not_removed,i had a oneway on points in december and have a round trip booked in feb and a oneway booked in april i fly them maybe a few times per year
churning,not_removed,i successfully redeemed a similar offer last year for rt flights and flew another points flights that year
churning,not_removed,i flew one rt this month i dont fly sw all that often either
churning,not_removed,soon youll be one of us and even know who kate is
churning,not_removed,was your paid or points ive flown × on points with my companion
churning,not_removed,i was targeted too and flew separate revenue flights to my destination and back two weekends ago
churning,not_removed,paid
churning,not_removed,girlfriendss dad didnt have my number and refused to pickup my phone calls he thought i was a telemarketer after calling his cell and home phone for weeks i booked a ua saver flight using the work around to avoid the close in booking fee for a flight hours later and flew out to ask his permission to marry her then flew back hours later
churning,not_removed,had a true fuck it moment and booked a trip last night to hnl for a week with aa points from my citi aadvantage bonus i leave today had to pay the short notice fee for award flights but it should be worth it
churning,not_removed,parents were buying a new set of recliners i have a new citi aa card with a minimum spend so i ask my dad to put the chairs on my card checking my activity a few days later and see he charged exactly so i ask how much the chairs were oh they were i only paid because they have no interest for months i dont think much of it a couple days later i see a laz boy credit card on the kitchen counter yes my dad opened a laz boy credit card to get months of no interest on a balance of less than while he has plenty of money anyways i tried to persuade him to get the csr multiple times over the past months and he wasnt interested at all it hurts i say this to him and oh i didnt know they would open a card for me and you never tell me about these deals of yours
churning,not_removed,i just was approved for both sw personal cards and am now past before i found this sub i was passively churning without knowing it so i opened a freedom csp personal marriott personal united bcp and a prg from in the past months ive picked up a aa plat prestige a csp after pcing the first one csr ink amex biz plat and now both sw personal cards theres no way in hell i wouldve been able to navigate all of this without the wealth of information in this sub and all the extremely helpful information from everyone here i hope the extra milespoints that everyone got from me using your referral links gets used for enjoyable redemptions happy churning
churning,not_removed,i attempted to get the citigold bonus last december failed and gave myself a hard time had to deposit into the account in the first days and didnt have it on hand immediately so i waited until was days left to transfer into citi from chase chase limited me to per day so i did the first day and the next ive never seen a bank transfer take so long before anyhow the made it the night before the deadline and the made it the day after i screwed up and didnt make the requirements i also didnt activate the debit card citi gave me for that bank account because i had no intentions of using it without warning citi closed my bank account for failing to activate my debit card when i tried to sign in to online banking it said i needed to activate my debit card for security reasons when i called in to activate by debit card they said it was already activated got pulled through a few cs reps and eventually they closed my online banking account and told me to make a new account was offered ty points as a courtesy for the trouble and eventually received a check in the mail a few days ago i tried to transfer my ty points to flyingblue and it said something about a system error when trying to do the transfer online after calling in and talking to a confused rep i learned that courtesy ty points cannot be transferred
churning,not_removed,i had to put in a ticket to get my back on my last set of that i ran through cvs they manually added the promo and i got back on each card instead of bank error in your favor
churning,not_removed,finally got the welcome package for sos citi aa plat with bonus language so of them between the of us also two citigold accounts now we have enough to fly the of us roundtrip in j to japankorea provided we can find availability i never flew anywhere as a kid now my year old daughter is possibly going to be flying business class around the world
churning,not_removed,still feeling bummed about no csr preapprovals so i tried to console myself with some other apps this week me citi aa would be my active card with them currently and my active aa and my personal aa in the past years i think applied app status said to call in unsurprisingly and i was approved with no fuss though my cls on all my citi cards are starting to be a touch on the low side since theyre spread across active cards id cancel some but i want them all except for my oldest line of credit with citi which i dont want to cancel for just that reason applied for the amex simplycash right after the aa application instant approval combined the amex hp with an ameriprise gold app for an additional mrs just because another instant approval wife citi aa would be my wifes active aa card with them and active citi card applied had to call in approved boom applied for amex simplycash system denial due to too many ccs cancelled a hilton and called recon recon said theyd send it up for review currently waiting for the hp to hit so we can hopefully combine that hp with a brg app and ameriprise gold app in awesome travel news i was able to reschedule to include a hour stopover in amman i didnt think a full hours was possible on an aa award itinerary but the aa agent made the change for me without any problem or comment so that we can make a quick day trip to see petra which my mom really wanted to see but that shed given up hope of seeing thanks tons kind aa agent
churning,not_removed,ive booked trips within the last week all on pointsfreebies mexico city flights on ua for nights at intercontinental presidente for ihg from priceless surprises value and nights cash at the hilton reforma where im hoping for an upgrade thanks to diamond status edit i also was able to get a reservation at pujol using plat concierge vegas bought flights using gift cards purchased with airline credits from plat and prg hawaii rt to koa on as using ba avios transferred most of the mr during the last promo ended up using mr giving a total of is gonna be a good year
churning,not_removed,been bad about keeping up with my sw travel funds just spend an hour going through email reservations and checking confirmation numbers i have a total of in funds i knew i had from voluntarily bumping myself on a flight in november but i had mostly forgotten how much i had leftover from a failed june trip i guess i will be booking my portland spring break trip with cash now heres to another great trip with the cp
churning,not_removed,michigan sucks i was so happy to find out that i can use my free hyatt nights at the mgm grand so i called to make a reservation and the csr said its for vegas mlife hotels only there are hyatt properties in the whole state
churning,not_removed,ive started to learn that churning is incredibly valuable when you tend to travel over holiday weekends which is something i try to do in order to save my vacation time my girlfriend and i just booked a trip to asheville nc over labor day weekend and it worked out great flights philly to charlotte roundtrip for two people came to about and we had in aa gift cards thanks to the amex plat airline reimbursements hotels this is where the big money savings came in we are spending one night in charlotte and nights in asheville we were able to book a cat hyatt in charlotte for ur points while the hotel was coming up per night thanks to holiday pricing in asheville we are staying nights at a cat hyatt using points cash which was points per night this hotel was running for over per night as well i had hyatt points so transferred the remaining over from ur overall we paid total for nights and two round trip flights which would have been without points additionally im hoping that when the year anniversary on our hyatt cards hit around april we can swap out of the points cash nights with the free anniversary night effectively getting back hyatt points the yearly fee costs the same as the cash portion of the points cash rate for night
churning,not_removed,wanted to get out of frigid nyc for a last min valentines day trip so and i booked jfk to mco for points and bought park tickets for discovery cove and universal studios with our csr credit excited to swim with the dolphins and drink some butter beer in degree weather just as excited to hit up the walmarts down there to load my serves heh
churning,not_removed,i made the decision to not pursue the sw companion pass via the marriott loophole i would have had to use ur points to fill the void of spgmarriott points i am just banking on the fact that the companion pass will be easy to get in the future my decision was componded by the fact that i have a month old
churning,not_removed,i have finally decided that i want to get bonuses faster even if it means doing nonorganic spend so this week a friend and i both signed up for the in free processing with square and each charged each other a day over days square deposits the money in your linked checking account the next day i couldnt believe how smoothly this went easy peasy then yesterday i did a kroger vgc us bank purchase for and then went to walmart to try to load my bluebird to pay mortgage with kate the kate had an out of order sign covering the screen and since i had never done this before being a bluebird virgin i panicked at the thought of having to go to the money center and deal with a human there was only one person in front of me in line at the money center so i took out my vgc and bluebird and held them in my hand with the bluebird covering the vgc i stole a glance at the vgc pin when the walmart employee stepped away when it was my turn i said id like to load my bluebird the money center employee a lady said okay swipe it and after i swiped asked how much i told her and she said okay and then i swiped my vgc entered my pin when prompted and then got a receipt and said thank you i was surprised how smoothly it went given how much anxiety people claim to have about doing anything other than using kate maybe i just dont have a suspicious look maybe its because i only did one vgc maybe this walmart employee just doesnt care who knows
churning,not_removed,i was prepared to meet the minimum spend of the biz plat doing ms at a moderate pace along with normal spend over the next three months but i just talked to my father and he he said i could use it for his upcoming tax bill his flight to vegas and paying to fix my sisters car which hell reimburse me for everything minus the surcharge on using a credit card for the tax bill so thats purchases thatll knock off my minimum spend in the first week my dad doesnt understand this hobby completely but hes still a huge help for my minimum spends when they come up
churning,not_removed,heres a weird story for yall had a dream last night amex came out with a new card looks like the blue cash everyday but was much stiffer like csr and very polished it had nfc coils around the amex logo in the center of the card and some leds in the middle lower left that would do stuff when you plugged it in a chip reader blue leds of course it was definitely a premium card the clear parts were like glass clear and the designs were all very crisp and sharp im really bummed its not real
churning,not_removed,i get really annoyed when the weather doesnt cooperate for a beach vacation hello fort lauderdale i cant imagine how id feel if it wasnt paid for with points hopefully barbados tomorrow cooperates
churning,not_removed,after of frustration i have a csr now d im now starting to get peoples frustrations about not having time to take off to use their pointsmiles still have a hyatt free night that expires in june but looking at my work schedule i cant quite figure out a feasible use for it that isnt a phnyc staycation having my credit report and cc application address and my mailing address on opposite sides of the country is slowing down how often i apply for cards probably due time for me to make some redemptions to get the excitement back
churning,not_removed,a bit late to the party this week but just boarded my flight back from las my flight back home was delayed an hour and a half so i was able to spend hours in the centurion lounge instead of minutes it was also my first lounge experience ever and man that was the best ive ever felt about a delayed flight what a wonderful way to pass the time also while in vegas for the weekend i found out that the forum shopping mall at caesars palace is a simon mall coming from someplace with absolutely no simon malls this was a pleasant surprise i was able to knock out the last of my min spend on the merrill card in minutes stupid form and waiting for approval from a manager all in all it was a good hours in vegas mainly to see ka at the mgm grand for half price thanks to a promo for mlife gold from hyatt platinum
churning,not_removed,citi blowing my mind each day new aa frozen for days received letters asking me to call in and verify the transactions called but they could not verify my account complained and got a senior specialist who froze all my accounts with no intimation only found out about that when i logged in online i am told to wait for a letter to tell me what to do letter arrives asking me to call in call in and get told to wait for letter no one has any idea what is going on or how to fix it i am appalled by citi

churning,not_removed,another day another shiti story i have my aa plat and trying to meet spend its been linked to my online account and ive been putting spend on it when attempting to pay it down the online pay feature doesnt work double cash is fine it keeps saying the feature doesnt work temporarily but multiple days and its still like this the same when i try it on chrome or firefox so i guess i should call in and use their automated line to pay the system doesnt recognize my credit card or social i input okay shiti so now the only recourse is to find a human being and have them pay my card manually while i wait on the line damn what a joke of a bank glad i just churn their cards
churning,not_removed,my super short notice trip to honolulu seems like it would have cost approximately rt from east coast got it for aa points after rebate rt for aa points seems pretty great especially with how hard some people claim they are to use

churning,not_removed,bought in gift cards today i got the same cashier who had given me a really hard time a few weeks back today she was much more relaxed and didnt warn me about what i was doing and the paperwork she would have to file i was more surprised than anything that a cashier at the only simon mall desk in my area wasnt familiar with transactions over
churning,not_removed,booked a last minute trip for the phoenix open golf tournament in scottsdale next weekend hubby just got the csr so i was able to knock out the ms and his travel credit by booking the airbnb for the flight i bought aa gift cards with my platinum and put the aa reservation on hold for free while i waited out the hour hold on the gcs the best part is its a hour hold but every day i called in to extend it i got the sweetest reps who cheerfully extended the hold another hours so i could book with the gc

churning,not_removed,sigh wow a store credit cardthere really needs to be a massive cfpb complaint or classaction suit about the upselling that clerks are pushed to do for store ccs its often very vague that its a credit card being applied for
churning,not_removed,my parents opened a sleep number credit for the same reason but fo a much larger balance
churning,not_removed,dad plz
churning,not_removed,my parents let me do the same thing when they bought furniture with my spg card easy min spend
churning,not_removed,passively churning without knowing it i was doing that for like years before i found this sub i think there are a ton of people passively churning without knowing it out there
churning,not_removed,chase cards in monthsnice
churning,not_removed,shittibank being shitty have a pity upvote
churning,not_removed,what a good parent thats going to be a heck of a trip definitely a memory your daughter will cherish
churning,not_removed,what do the citi gold accounts have to do with aa points
churning,not_removed,i continue to be amazed at the number of cards that you guys get approved for whats your how do you get past the months issue with citi is there a link to the ameriprise gold application regarding the combined amex hps you wait until you are notified of the first hp by your experian app and then submit more amex apps the same day i never thought of doing it that way
churning,not_removed,hampton inn in mexico city is a steal for per night rooms are a bit meh but the interior actually looks pretty nice and historic and youll probably get upgraded to a bigger room good location too never have i gotten a better value for hilton points
churning,not_removed,this is one of the only things that i dislike about southwest i wish there was a place under your sw login that showed how much you have in voucher funds the confirmation numbers and the expiration dates that would be a real service to their customers instead of making them sift through a years emails
churning,not_removed,that reminds me i have the from my prg to use n southwest
churning,not_removed,there arent any hotels worth spending points on imo
churning,not_removed,mgm is an mlife hotel though so what is the problem this is of course ignoring that points redemptions in vegas are awful
churning,not_removed,im confused your hyatt nights can be used at hyatts or mlife hotels i was going to lose my hyatt nights due to expiration so i used them both at the bellagio mlifenot the greatest use of them but at least they didnt expire mgm grand is part of mlife as are these httpswwwmlifecomenresortshtml
churning,not_removed,we had in aa gift cards thanks to the amex plat airline reimbursements this originally came out of your pocket too when you paid the annual fees that said you are making good use of it
churning,not_removed,you renting a car too i presume gonna use ur for that
churning,not_removed,just curious what do new yorkers consider frigid please tell me its nothing above degrees otherwise ill laugh at you
churning,not_removed,offtopic and dont want to rain on your trip but swimwiththedolphins is not a pleasant encounter for the dolphins
churning,not_removed,how did the park tickets on the csr code
churning,not_removed,i made this decision in the last few days as well my wife and i are currently still under and were planning on signing up for spg biz cards and one spg personal but in the end decided that keeping the spg points would probably be worth more to us than the cp plus waiting for a higher spg signup bonus we never fly southwest anyway we live in la and while my father lives in chicago we hate flying to midway her family lives near san jose so we could book tickets there but we usually just rent a car and drive the hertzunited partnership usually gets us mp miles and off the rental the amount we save in gas renting a prius from lax usually pays for the rental my car is a guzzler and her is a fiat
churning,not_removed,people do a lot more than at once usually once you pull out vgcs walmart money center employees may get suspicious
churning,not_removed,be careful with square you can get shutdown very quickly by swiping the same card also if the owner of the card u swiped has a square account he can get shutdown as well this just happened to me this past week
churning,not_removed,if you pay the tax bill through you will only pay
churning,not_removed,having a dad sounds wonderful
churning,not_removed,i am bummed too
churning,not_removed,how long have you been here weather tends to come and go here maybe hit up a beach further north like delray beach edit didnt realize it was rainy and cold maybe head north to avoid the rain
churning,not_removed,hey fellow cleveland churner here enjoy the warm weather
churning,not_removed,if you ask nicely the cert will convert to points
churning,not_removed,why are simon malls so well revered for getting vgc i mean you can get vgc at any grocery store with a category bonus usually
churning,not_removed,sounds like a normal day with citi
churning,not_removed,i had the same issue with them for another card after eventually calling and spending a month with them i found out that all they wanted to do was verify that it was me that opened it and not someone else took them a month to ask me if i opened it how i opened it and basic quesions about myself i wish you luck dealing with them
churning,not_removed,is that per person or altogether what was cash price of tickets
churning,not_removed,you can do it via the citi mobile app had same issue
churning,not_removed,how do you get the rebate
churning,not_removed,nice which cards did you use to purchase amounts
churning,not_removed,how did you get a aa plat considering rule
churning,not_removed,louisville aruba and houston in one trip just curious but why
churning,not_removed,it was a good visit and at the end he said i didnt need to even ask but he appreciated it
churning,not_removed,google it you will find step by step instructions from several blogs
churning,not_removed,i did leave messages and text her mom has passed and he has a unique schedulelifestyle that can make it hard to get in touch
churning,not_removed,on aa metal both ways got the roundtrip for total
churning,not_removed,i believe its days
churning,not_removed,days waived for aa exec plat plat and gold members
churning,not_removed,i was looking at that unfortunately ba didnt have flights available when i tried to book it days out would it have allowed me to avoid the fee
churning,not_removed,unfortunately its the managers that push them to sell the card many stores have quotas they need to fulfill and when it comes to retail the young are always the easy ones to get im sure the clerks dont want to upsell the cards neither but they get in trouble if managers do not hear the script
churning,not_removed,yes i opened a southwest card in college to cover some flights to grad school interviews mightve gotten an email or mail offer closed it after a couple years and here i am seven years later seriously churning
churning,not_removed,indeed this dp is just good reinforcement of a few theories regarding that ink doesnt count against your total while you are still under and that getting two cards same day while at is possible
churning,not_removed,i had to recon both sw cards but this was mainly because i have a large credit line spanning across my existing chase cards the calls were painless i just had to verify some information and shuffle existing credit to the new cards i did this one card at a time and was successful able to get both cards expedited to me as well
churning,not_removed,thank you she will be by the time we plan on going i want to give her the experiences i never had as a child my wife and i went to japan on our honeymoon and she wants to go now so why not
churning,not_removed,there used to be a promo to get aa when opening a citigold account it was a major headache as they werent honoring it
churning,not_removed,whats your at least most banks other than chase and barclays dont really care about new accounts from other banks at least in my experience how do you get past the months issue with citi im currently under inquiries in months because ive been taking it a little easier trying to get a csr preapproval bah and by combining hps with amex and boa which has netted me cards with only hps in the past months is there a link to the ameriprise gold application yeah via the ameriprise website just google it you wait until you are notified of the first hp by your experian app and then submit more amex apps the same day usually i just submit amex apps one after the other because were always autoapproved the only reason im doing it this way this time is because of the recon of the simplycash recon just said i should hear back in the next days so we dont know when the hp is going to hit hence were monitoring my wifes ex and going to hope we get enough notice to combine apps when the hp for the simplycash comes through
churning,not_removed,any suggestions on things to see or do im going with my wife for a long weekend over easter and havent planned anything yet for hilton points total and sw points round trip with companion pass it was kind of a book first plan later and we still havent looked into it too much
churning,not_removed,agree ive stayed there before though my best hilton value is probably a night for a hilton pyramids golf resort in egypt
churning,not_removed,i keep forgetting about that one thanks for the reminder
churning,not_removed,we looked really closely at that one but since we were paying cash and reforma wasnt that much more ended up picking that one thanks for the suggestion
churning,not_removed,i think it depends on your situation i think its unlikely for families to be able to redeem for premium cabins due to availability and the sheer cost of jf flightsin points its also not a great redemption to redeem for economy flights unless youre using csr portal or the typ portal with prestige so for us i get more value out of hotels obviously we can stay in airbnbs for less but sometimes we want that added luxury and comfort we did two airbnbs in japan and i wish we opted for hotels that said if i was a single guygirl i wouldnt redeem for hotels and strictly premium cabin flights haha
churning,not_removed,yeah its annoying i havent been able to use my free hyatt nights and hyatt wont extend their availability so im going to be forced to use them basically
churning,not_removed,i didnt ask ill try again though because it really doesnt make sense
churning,not_removed,yeah the csr said it can only be used at the vegas properties but im going to call and get more details tomorrow edit hyatt gold passport members will be able to earn and redeem hyatt gold passport points at iconic participating mgm resorts destinations in las vegas and m life members will be able to earn m life tier credits when staying at hyatt hotels and resorts around the world
churning,not_removed,probably will just use cash not gonna get great value from the points on a car rental it only comes out to around anyway
churning,not_removed,i think we are staying at the hyatt place we really could not decide which one to pick they are practically next to each other with similar reviews
churning,not_removed,this jan has been warm so not really sure what frigid weather op is referring to
churning,not_removed,its been a absurdly warm winter this year havent even worn stockings yet but id say with skyscraper wind tunnels is usually when we start getting seriously cold
churning,not_removed,but thats cold when you dont have a car whine
churning,not_removed,not a nyer but anything below f is too cold and anyone who disagrees ids just lying to themselves to justify living in some god forsaken place
churning,not_removed,im guessing your winters must drive you to the brink of insanity if thats something that makes you laugh
churning,not_removed,thats actually super sad to hear
churning,not_removed,travel when purchased through httpswwwundercovertouristcom
churning,not_removed,i loaded another now at the customer service desk at a different walmart and it was equally easy other than the guy not understanding at first what i wanted to do any dps on how many vgcs you have to try to use before you raise suspicion is going to be relatively under the radar still is the magic number
churning,not_removed,not when he abuses you
churning,not_removed,were only here for a day flying early to bgi in the am wanted to get to barbados early so not to waste a fairmont cert by arriving late in the evening
churning,not_removed,ive tried twice to do this so far you need to have platinum or higher status to convert them to points at least thats what theyve told me
churning,not_removed,thats not true most groceries are freaked out about fraud and take cash only you have to find the ones who are cool simon malls are loved because they are pretty consistent about allowing purchases with cc
churning,not_removed,simon malls have activation fees of card whereas the only vgcmcgcs with that low of an activation fee have a balance of around instead of like you get from simon
churning,not_removed,needing to hit min spend on a non category bonus card the cheapest activation fee no hassle as to the purchase amount within reason quickly freeing me up to move on to the next min spend those are the reasons im sad i dont have a simon mall near me on a semi regular basis
churning,not_removed,simon also sells cards which can get you an extra back if you can find a way to use them at certain stores
churning,not_removed,that was for all the tickets i was surprised they were so cheap the flight hour before ours was per ticket the cash price were and
churning,not_removed,okay thanks will try that
churning,not_removed,mostly spg trying for a lastditch companion pass through marriott vacation package via spg not sure if it will work out or if i will cry through an amex financial review either way nothing ventured nothing gained
churning,not_removed,since november
churning,not_removed,family domestically vacation in aruba
churning,not_removed,wow thats great have fun man
churning,not_removed,yes ba does not have close in booking fees for awards
churning,not_removed,yes i understand not saying its the clerks faults but im just waiting for the classaction that some attorney is going to try to cook up
churning,not_removed,im more into cash back so for like two years i was opening cards with a minimum spend of say in months which was about my natural spend once the bonus posted i would open another card and repeat
churning,not_removed,yes and yes not only did my ink not count against but other nonchase biz cards didnt count either i applied for the amex biz plat in between the ink and the sw cards i was technically when i applied for the sw cards
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,yeah via the ameriprise website just google it dang i should have figured that out on my own i assumed that it must be special since the amex gold bonus only seems to show via incognito thanks for sharing your experiences very helpful
churning,not_removed,somehow part of my post didnt make it that should say there arent any hotels in michigan worth spending your points for youd be better suited just spending cash
churning,not_removed,you can also use them at the aria and bellagio both again though vegas redemptions are awful i stayed at the aria for four nights over mexican independence weekend and earned points on spend couple this with a citi premier night free and you will come out ahead
churning,not_removed,your free hyatt nights from the chase hyatt credit card can be used at any hyatt in the world any category hotel my wife used hers to stay at the httpsbuenosairesparkhyattcomenhotelhomehtml a converted palace which goes for thats the type of hotel you should go for with these two award certs theyre not just for las vegas mlife hotels or nevada hotels or just huca on the hyatt line and get a different rep to talk to
churning,not_removed,gotcha my sister just moved to south carolina closest airport is charlotte so i might combine a visit to her with asheville for breweries of course
churning,not_removed,yup about days a winter average below for overnight lows at least
churning,not_removed,to each their own but i would recommend doing some reading about it before you do it it is something i would never do along with riding elephants
churning,not_removed,ymmv some people do of thousands others do a couple thousand others do less youll have to feel out your walmart post office and grocery store attendants to see how much theyll allow before theyll stop you
churning,not_removed,ive never had much trouble using bluebird the problem is when i want to do money orders and split it on four cards lots of problems there from idiot employees making up their own rules
churning,not_removed,ive done which is the max per transaction but seems a lot less suspicious
churning,not_removed,ah enjoy it
churning,not_removed,doesnt having the credit card give you platinum status or did you cancel it already
churning,not_removed,yes that true and also the certificates need to be in expired state for them to process the request i am a diamond member and converted two certificates to points on dec the day after they got expired
churning,not_removed,oh i know about those but the cvs thing died so unless youre trying to put natural spend on a im not necessarily sold on the value
churning,not_removed,thats almost cents per points very unusual for southwest points interesting
churning,not_removed,ouch good luck if amex fr you but i suppose if its all under personal it should be no problem
churning,not_removed,stupid question but can you book ba with aa miles and does ba even service the east coast to hawaii
churning,not_removed,seriously kids dont know any better if uneducated about debt and credit it could lead to some serious consequences down the road almost every name brand store out there has their own credit card
churning,not_removed,then you found out your addiction had a name
churning,not_removed,the latter
churning,not_removed,haha that makes my point useless
churning,not_removed,theyre expiring too soon for me use them at a valuable property im going to try to get points or extend them somehow
churning,not_removed,yeah i am really excited about wicked weed down there
churning,not_removed,you can certainly book ba with aa miles but ba is not going to serve east coast to hawaii directly
churning,not_removed,almost every name brand store out there has their own credit card that mostly are private label and can only be used at that particular store
churning,not_removed,seeing as that i just used points to book a hotel my original post would be useless even coming from me lol
churning,not_removed,its one of my favorites youll love it
churning,not_removed,wife and i went to asheville for anniversary weekend a couple years back id definitely recommend checking out the brews cruise a dude drives your group around in a van to different breweries for aycd beer we did the sunday tour and got to go to a couple places that were closed for the day to try a shit ton of local beers and have a dd was one of the best parts of our trip
churning,not_removed,get a room you two
churning,not_removed,damn that sounds awesome will have to look into that thanks
churning,not_removed,can we book it with hyatt points cuz i have a bunch of those
churning,not_removed,bofa tr i think the bonus is points
churning,not_removed,this is a frequently asked and answered question over in the what card should i get weekly threads which are linked on the sidebar good luck
churning,not_removed,chase is choosier but why dont you think you will get it anything chase is great start with the wiki and read about the after that you can choose how you want to strategize is your goal points airline miles hotel miles status etc
churning,not_removed,chase sapphire preferred until you get your credit score a bit higher also check out the what card wednesday thread or the newbie questions as this doesnt warrant its own thread
churning,not_removed,if you have a banking relationship any with chase a should potentially get you the sapphire preferred card which you want especially before you hit thats usually the best card uskippers is right about bofa travel rewards with no fee not difficult to get check the sidebar like usowusupb suggested for a better idea on developing a strategy apply for chase cards first though
churning,not_removed,just no nope read the sidebar
churning,not_removed,ive already hit chase cards already i applied for united mileage last week and got the days notice guess i was denied immediately
churning,not_removed,psa on the scorebigclub carlson opportunity they appear to be collapsing so i would be extraordinarily careful in spending any money there httpampthemagcomtherealinsidelastdaysscorebigdeaththreatscomplaintsmassfiring
churning,not_removed,worth noting that air algerie is currently in the process of aligning its programs to join skyteam which could expand the usefulness of its program from looking briefly at their zonebased chart it looks like they have some decent rates from n africa to europe and their montreal flight is f this may be a program to keep your eyes on ditto royal air maroc given the rumors of joining the avios program and oneworld already a partner of qr and ey as well only dodgy thing here is you need to send in a copy of your passport to sign up for family plan if i recall edit not sure if qr globetrotter still works just logged into my privilege club account and theres no register button under that section of my offers only view details
churning,not_removed,anything for southwest i have some points expiring soon and need something to keep them active
churning,not_removed,on a somewhat related note has anyone ever used httppointspostcom they supposedly sell points at what appears to be very inflated prices i was mostly curious to find out if this site is a scam and if they ever have sales to make the prices reasonable
churning,not_removed,thanks for the easy breakdown
churning,not_removed,psa make sure you keep track of what youre owed i have had problems with sponsors actually holding up their end of the deal and awarding miles for example i was stiffed on the prosper united miles bonus i never got any miles from my legitimate signup united blamed prosper and prosper told me to ask united
churning,not_removed,the flexpoints doc shared were targeted and ymmv by cardholder i got the olympic flexperks card in that promotion when i checked as suggested i got a different promo but not that one see the doc member comments
churning,not_removed,i need i just edit more marriott points to hit the next tier must spam twitter
churning,not_removed,couple other minor freebies points each for email optin and taking a survey through the national emerald club also various other offers for renting in certain location europe or south america opting for sirius referring a friend or renting through their app on the dashboard

churning,not_removed,yes make sure your jewels are off grid so the banks dont get a sniff of it withdraw it from your banks vaultsafe deposit box and hide it in your basement
churning,not_removed,not sure if serious but will play along read your cardmember agreement to see what the banks policy is if you do not pay in time pretty sure you will not find a mention of family jewels in it

churning,not_removed,i just went to buy some mos with gift cards and i asked the cashier can i buy some gift cards instead of mos lol
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,ive got a few amex gc that i was cashing out via venmo i sent less than a little over a week ago and they coded as a debit card but now theyre being listed as credit did venmo just change their policy on agc in the last few days or did i do something to screw this up do i only get one shot to cash these out and am i stuck paying now edit there was something wrong with the card on the original account as far as i know venmo will label your card american express credit but it will still code as debit if it thinks its a credit card it will warn you about the fee i removed the card and readded it and cashed out with no problem tldr amex gc venmo still seems to work fine just make sure youre aware of venmos limits and dont go crazy or youll get shut down
churning,not_removed,had mixed results splitting payments at usps one took easilyin and out minutes tops the other was a two split disaster called his supervisor and had me step aside and wait the latter po was utter chaos and i eventually left like serious mayhem with a ton of elderly and complex requests and workers on the verge of breakdown i will never go back there i want those minutes back this hobby is very much trial and error
churning,not_removed,the only bad thing about getting your ms done early in the day is that empty feeling you have for the rest of your idle hours wondering if you perhaps should be out buying gcs or mos
churning,not_removed,anyone bought a corporate order of like starbucks gift cards in california and walked into stores to cash them out theoretically you could buy a thousand cards no
churning,not_removed,ive checked every gas station in town and nearby towns i work at and not a single one sells gifts cards that will let me pay with a cc not even store branded ones this q will be really hard to max out my freedom limit any other ideas on how to make this happen
churning,not_removed,anybody keep track of net profit from ms as a percentage of total ms i just ran my january numbers and realized over roi after all fees cash profit plus in points on of ms that includes rebatescash back as well as valuing points at about average cents for hilton cents for ur and cents for flexpoints
churning,not_removed,i just got the wells fargo card that has unlimited cash back at drug stores once it arrives im planning on making daily runs to all the walgreens stores in my area and then liquidating the post office since its the only place that isnt a tossup as to whether or not ill be able to liquidate im assuming ill get shut down at some point but thats not the big concern other than trying to get friendly with the manager at my local walgreens to let me buy more than one card per day are there any tips or things to watch out for

churning,not_removed,ink preferred cardholders checking today if a local usps accepts cc for gift cards for the shipping noticed the rack of vgc but neglected to ask yesterday
churning,not_removed,after calling and asking if i could use the debit card to deposit cash at an atm schwab actually recommended i buy a mo and use the app to deposit because they dont accept cash deposits at atms thought i would try and deposit a mo through schwabs mobile app after making a staples run today well lo and behold the app across three devices said the pictures cant be accepted even when i use a black tshirt as a background has anyone else run into issues with their mobile app and moneygram mos
churning,not_removed,just wanted to share a small victory cashier at staples somehow managed to charge me for a vgc one of my but not the activation fee i even brought the receipt back in to make sure the card was activated they brought up the tech support manager and he confirmed that all the cards were activated and the other one probably didnt activate because of the rebate sure ok they werent even aware the rebate was happening this week until i pulled out the rebate receipt
churning,not_removed,are pdx wms friendly for mos
churning,not_removed,any dps of buying money orders with metabanks at shoprite acme fairway food emporium or any other nyc grocers
churning,not_removed,how long does it take for agc to be approveddeclined i ordered my agc on fri night got order received email but no emailcall since then today the amex charge dropped from cfu edit amex must be monitoring this thread mins after posting this i got a verification call and they approved it
churning,not_removed,i tried to get more info on this process a month or so ago but honestly i couldnt find much of anything especially revolving around my main question which is the risk of overpaying taxes using one of the irs pay services like i said i couldnt find a lot of reference points so i decided to just go ahead with the idea and see what happened in short i took a new rewards credit card with sign up bonus that required a minimum spend of i used to charge that amount to the card earlier this month the bill for that card is due next month ive already filed my taxes to included the extra tax payment you could make payments on the tax year up to the its been process and accepted and ill get the refund this friday being able to apply the refunded amount to pay off my card in short i cleared the entire signup spend requirement on one credit card without actually spending a cent funds went from card to irs from irs to my bank account then from my bank account back to card now this is the part where everyone else more experienced than me explains if what i did was illegal in any way shape or form not only could i find nothing to say it is barely anyone seems to talk about this strategy at all
churning,not_removed,anyone have any datapoints on whether agc count towards min spend when purchased with an amex cc i have not seen a definitive answer
churning,not_removed,in the other thread i saw the best ms for me is microfinance ie lowrisk loans that will come back in a reasonable period of time while helping people who need the liquidity funding and getting card benefits is there a company that will allow me to fund with a cc and actually see returns i know kiva does but they only pay back at
churning,not_removed,i have a few questions about getting serve cards can you get onevip or do they need to be different flavors do they all have separate load limits if you do cards at a time then get banned are the other cards automatically banned as well can they be managed under online account or do you need to make separate accounts for each one is it possible to billpay credit cards not amex directly or is it better to ach to a bank account then pay card is closing your account every few months to avoid shutdown actually effective i has just been doing a bunch of mos but serve seems a lot easier other than needing to go to family dollar more often than usps
churning,not_removed,big thanks to all on this thread just completed my first ms via visa metabankwm mo absolutely love it guysgirls is there a limit a should be concerned about when depositing mos into a wf account as to when this could be flagged thanks
churning,not_removed,i want to ms any tips read the sidebar metabank doesnt work at usps usps ov or v wm metabank grocery ymmv i want to purchase xxx with xxx at xxx location any dps be your own dp venmo agc no fee cards in months vgc fee might get shutdown anything else i missed edit suggested i was denied at the powmgrocery store what do i do say thank you and try again the next day at a different location at a different time with a different person
churning,not_removed,dp newbie so making myself useful bought vgc at different staples locations total used csr and ink pref at both location im trying to meet min have friends addresses to get rebates these are metabank successfully purchased mos at local wm locations heartrate at walmart local bashas did not work for mo declined message cashier told me that it needs to be debit this is a lot of frickin fun im in the phoenix area btw
churning,not_removed,previously friendly wally started taking ids for just of mos cashier indicated that it was because there were so many people coming in every day splitting payment form came out of a big binder labeled patriot act i hope this isnt the start of a crack down
churning,not_removed,found a that let me buy gift cards with my credit cards you guys said most wont but it was the first one i tried the cashier was not happy about it though it took him like mins and two cards to actually load it
churning,not_removed,just noticed you can get a machine to print names to a pvc card for under on ebay curious if anyone has considered printing their name on visa gift cards to get around employees looking for a personalized debit card i highly doubt most cashiers would give it a second look if they are just trained to look for a name thoughts
churning,not_removed,has anyone actually tried rewriting the magnetic strip of an existing or expired debit card using and overwriting whatever was there with the information from your gift card this topic has come up a few times that ive found in this sub and every time the conversation revolves around either that guy who got arrested for doing this with stolen cards in the back seat of his car or the fact that if you get caught doing this it is going to be hard to explain yourself you might get arrested and the risk is probably not worth the reward so lets get that out of the way if you are considering doing this this is the same kind of behavior criminals use you might get arrested for doing it and the risk is not worth the reward anyone actually tried
churning,not_removed,tried to buy worth of vgc from gcm i am doing it for my spouse for msing on her card they called to confirm and everything was good but she gave them the wrong phone number of which i ordered with the order was declined any chance of trying again or is her account done for with gcm
churning,not_removed,just bought a agc how long does it take to process or be manually reviewed usually
churning,not_removed,psa looks like received a circular from corporate head quarters to make purchases of one vanilla cards as cashonly but it isnt hard coded into the registers if you sweet talk them into trying it it will go thru d good luck
churning,not_removed,is there a consensus on amex being sensitive to ms to meet min spend on mr cards ie giftcardscom specifically in relation to normalnonleaked offers
churning,not_removed,dp ive had onevip serves and bb today it seems like my accounts were shadowbanned says the account details you have entered dont match our records when i know that theyre right amex might be catching on to people opening multiple one vip
churning,not_removed,dp for folks still trying to get rid of leftover fbs i checked on these orders today to find that they have all been cancelled looks like staples is able to figure out if youve tried to skirt the limit i havent decided if i should try again but this time space the orders out over a couple days or if i should just suck it up and pay higher fees instore
churning,not_removed,does anyone know if the new wm atm accept bluebird reload it doesnt look like the original kate pictures that i have found google search doesnt seem to lead to anything helpful
churning,not_removed,why does cvs check id when purchasing ovgc for is it to limit daily spend or verify cc identity for cc fraud
churning,not_removed,anyone have any experience buying vgcs at kum and go i saw that the one by me has some i plan on checking myself once my new card comes in
churning,not_removed,i recently purchased an amex gc online it was delivered today several hours ago when trying to input the info into venmo i get the message there seems to be a problem with the security code and it will not let me add the card so far the answer has been it takes a couple hours to activate but i purchased this card over four days ago has anyone else had experiences like this
churning,not_removed,my wife and i are fine with paying the fee from venmo to send with her spg to meet minimum spend i used to use serve religiously but something about money orders makes me nervous i understand paying to send is high for ms and only worth it for meeting minimum spend is this a pretty safe move to venmo and amex shes had her venmo account for over a year but never sent anything really large maybe a few hundred at a time thanks
churning,not_removed,has anybody used cruise lines for ms to meet minimums i dont think i would but deposits for cruises are typically refundable months from sailing you could make a deposit on a cruise thats two years away and cancel it months later and get your money back
churning,not_removed,getting pretty tired of having to go to walmart and deal with reps to try and load serve however ive figured out i can easily liquidate us bank vgcs with google wallet as i understand it im bound to get shut down on google wallet eventually as i increase volume but the same can be said for all methods my immediate problem is that i can buy usbank vgcs at my local krogers but the activation fee is vs of simons and you dont get any sort of fuel points to offset it does anyone know of any other methods for obtaining cheaper usbank vgcs i dont have any branches near me
churning,not_removed,just to be clear vanilla vgcs from cvs is also by bancorp but people prefer onevanilla because it doesnt say gift on it correct
churning,not_removed,i realize venmoing on a newish account is going to get both parties shut down fast and draw more negative attention anyone with newish venmo accounts have success with just siphoning money out of their agc slowly
churning,not_removed,psa samsung pay discount gift cards are back

churning,not_removed,hey so i am thinking of using serve for the bill pay feature but looking at the regular serve blue and serve one vip why would one ever choose the regular serve over the onevip given onevips no cash reload fees and every other feature being exactly the same

churning,not_removed,maybe this is a dumb question but im used to buying regular meta vgcs and have been wondering why is everyone so excited about the vgcs how are you using them to ms are you getting mos or loading serve at a location that you actually get the back onto the card after you do this im not seeing on their list of locations for back how i could do that
churning,not_removed,i msd vgc from a grocery store about days ago and i got a call from chase today about suspected fraud should i be concerned once i confirmed the charges they told me to have a good day and ended the call
churning,not_removed,been doing a lot of reading about about to do my first try at ms i dont have any walmarts nearby and from what im reading usps wont take meta which is what id like to buy on my ink from staples what about purchasing western union money orders from locations that offer them is the trick finding one that will accept them
churning,not_removed,has anyone tried using charles schwab investor checking for depositing mos searched around and couldnt find any dps i have this account already as a feefree atm account bonus is i already have a history of depositing only selfwritten checks to this account
churning,not_removed,first time msing via staplescom any dp on how long it takes them to ship a vgc theyve shipped as of yesterday and the my orders page says theyll arrive by but im curious about how accurate that is would be nice to get them earlier so i can get started liquidating
churning,not_removed,kmart exited program is totally dead for me
churning,not_removed,is there any info of netspend gcs from working to reload serve at walmart im looking to max out my freedom and id prefer to use my serve rather than onevanilla to mo
churning,not_removed,anyone know of any limitless vanilla gc or postal mo liquidation methods even if they have a cost obviously i can deposit mos in the bank but is there a method that doesnt have even that small risk for seriously ramping it up
churning,not_removed,currently using a california only ms strategy gift cards valued at less then can be redeemed for cash so i buy gift cards for a particular company online in a large enough quantity to get free shipping then go to stores and redeem interested in discussing strategy on this with other california ms people as not fully satisfied with current store im using works their their online store but they ship every card in a separate envelope could probably get discount with a business tax id but havent

churning,not_removed,data point because ive stumbled across some central indiana people here speedway on south side of kokomo vgcs were only up to though they had vanillas and i think green dots for higher i dont trifle with them i normally save the gcs for the end of the quarter so my natural spend gets the benefits but my amazon balance was getting a little thin so i decided to do an amazon gc their variable load ones were only up to but they took it without batting an eye okay they did make me sign and checked the last of the card big whoop probably not the best avenue for big ballin but perhaps itll help someone edit to add the speedway further south on before you start hitting civilization again coded an oj as gas i fully expect this to do the same
churning,not_removed,i bought a laptop from my campus bookstore and returned it a couple days later for reasons unrelated to churning they gave me the option of refunding the money to a card other than the one with which i paid for the laptop and so i gave them my debit card through a different institution both of the cards i used are visas will my credit card bank find out about the refund and take away the points
churning,not_removed,walmart wont sell us gift cards with credit anymore cash register prints a slip saying that must pay with cash or debit another one bites the dust

churning,not_removed,i havent been able to load serve at family dollar yet yesterday the cashier just couldnt figure it out and told me to come back today another cashier insisted on examining my debit card closely wasnt smart or fast enough to substitute my real debit card so she politely turned me away the struggles of the ms life
churning,not_removed,can someone confirm that they are able to purchase x gift cards in one transaction at cvs in nyc with duane reade im limited to per day

churning,not_removed,anybody know if you have to specifically buy the amex personal gift card or the business gift card for it to work via venmo
churning,not_removed,wm serv load dp asked to load of gebit at the money center cashier asked her manager if it was ok then asked for my id and began copying my info onto a sar form which she looked at like shed never seen it before after a few moments i asked if a smaller load of would be less of a hassle which seemed to make her more relieved and hence she stopped filling out the form i thought for wm typically amounts under are given the pass anyone else confronted by lower limits
churning,not_removed,local gas station caseys sells variable load mastercard gift cards backed by us bank are these as easily liquidated as the us bank vgcs
churning,not_removed,i made a purchase on my card at a cvs on before they pulled from the program but i didnt receive my cash back should i submit a ticket or is it just hopeless
churning,not_removed,i still have days to spend on my csr i attempted to open a pnc virtual wallet and fund but it would not go through online because the system could not verify my identity i have never msd before but it looks like i am gonna have to for this bonus should i open up a pnc account in person and then use it to deposit money orders into instead of my current credit union

churning,not_removed,lol i always almost ask for the gc pin amount when asked how much i want for a serve reload or mo
churning,not_removed,son of a bitch
churning,not_removed,yup there goes a oneway ticket in j to asia
churning,not_removed,someone mind explaining
churning,not_removed,ur shopathome werent clawed back yet my puny as was clawed back though i figured this was gonna happen though
churning,not_removed,sad panda
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,there was a dp yesterday in the daily thread about someone getting an email from venmo about suspicious activity they may have closed this avenue probably going to need to see more dp in the next few days
churning,not_removed,i just did on a amex gc last night with no fees and no problems
churning,not_removed,you dont need to do it all at once i did half last week half this week both were debit
churning,not_removed,the agcs ive added are losted as american express credit and none incurred fees when i drained them
churning,not_removed,mine have always listed as credit and had no fee next to it
churning,not_removed,yay or nay on buying an amex gc with an amex card
churning,not_removed,my last visit to the po the lady asked to see my id then after i told her i wanted to do debit card payments of she asked to see my debit card and asked why it doesnt have my name i told her its just a prepaid visa card and she said ok then at the end she asked me again if my debit card had my signature at the back i just told her that its verified by a pin number because ive never thought of signing all my ovgcs although technically its required ive never had such an interrogative experience at a po so it was just a bit strange
churning,not_removed,havent had this kind of luck yet and im not sure if this happened during the week but i always avoid the po on weekends its always a shit show since there are so many fewer open last time i tried to go for a mo there was a woman crying with a large stack of cash in front of her because she didnt have enough for the mo she needed or something like that yeah id rather stop by my quiet neighborhood one right before they close
churning,not_removed,only been called out once at the po the lady must have had eagle eyes because i obviously didnt use the phrase gift card and thought i put the backs of the cards towards her but she asked why i was using gcs said i was the person in there with the same mo request after about seconds of deliberation i told her it was for cc points luckily she was super chill and we proceeded to have a conversation about points for travel and getting mos rather than spending them elsewhere hoping shes there every time i go back
churning,not_removed,what do you tell them the reason for multiple cards is i say im liquidating my prepaid visa debit cards so far so good up to in one day using cards in one transaction
churning,not_removed,sounds like very exceptionally bad luck at a poive never had that kind of trouble and have been hitting around the los angeles area for a while now the worst luck ive had is a bad mo printer that put ink all over the first mo but the cashier just voided it and reprinted me a second one
churning,not_removed,im pretty new to churning can you explain what this is its hard to find specifics in the side bar and the acronyms are confusing i didnt see it in the wiki httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikimanufacturedspending
churning,not_removed,only one way to solve that by doing more ms
churning,not_removed,the struggle is real
churning,not_removed,early in the morning is great cause there are never any lines gives me more time to thunk of ways too ramp up
churning,not_removed,hahaha im not sure if this is worth the effort of cashing them out one at a time
churning,not_removed,starbucks wouldnt let me cash out more than per day
churning,not_removed,you gotta find the right cashier the one i went to originally said no when i went to the same one again with a different cashier i bought worth
churning,not_removed,have you tried read some dps that people buying items inside a are still coding as gas even if that location doesnt sell gas ymmv on whether or not the store will let you pay for vgc with a cc though
churning,not_removed,just buy worth of beer and wine for the next few months at those gas stations lol
churning,not_removed,i think roi is a bad metric for ms you could have a huge roi but only net like in profit total profit is what really matters here possibly with a focus on profit per hour
churning,not_removed,i think about it differently because i always plan to get the float back my investment is my fees not other peoples money so just change perspective and make
churning,not_removed,in the last months of i had a roi that includes only rebates and cb on over of ms i received points as well
churning,not_removed,i havent analyzed my ms profitability very deeply but im concentrating more on hr and overall net profit ive got a good lineup of stores along my commute to work buy gcs stops to convert to mo deposit to bank in mins trying to figure out how to work in simon online and giftcardscom via yazing for cashback without getting banned
churning,not_removed,i actually just created a spreadsheet last night i have msed a little over points and ive paid about in activation fees this is about months of on and off ms ive got about in portalrebate money coming to me and the points total doesnt include sign up bonuses achieved with the help of ms the first few months i was strictly getting and paying all activation fees without a portal had to learn as i went i expect this year to have a much better ratio of pointsdollars
churning,not_removed,cash back earned but not redeemed will be lost at shutdown so be ready to eat some fees
churning,not_removed,what does liquidating at the post office mean
churning,not_removed,if she suspects its a gc i dont think it really matters if you try to correct her id be happy that theyre willing to help you play the game ramp it up and collect those points
churning,not_removed,congrats thanks for sharing the success slowly building up confidence here to try at some point
churning,not_removed,you can still use metabank vgc to purchase mos at wm
churning,not_removed,following any other dp on this
churning,not_removed,kroger isnt hardcoded against one vanilla liquidated there last week
churning,not_removed,i liquidated in metas at fd this week hoping this isnt widespread most recent loads were thursday
churning,not_removed,confused is it ov or meta
churning,not_removed,they give you the heads up when you are adding the card not during each payment
churning,not_removed,if theres a balance they dont get a fee
churning,not_removed,has anyone done this id suspect if one got shutdown they all would it would be a great way to burn in an extreme situation ie the hyvee deal on a related note does being banned from serve with a live bb prevent you from reopening the bb
churning,not_removed,aa portal gone purchased right when deal broke tcb still there same with chase
churning,not_removed,yes a lot of claw backs this isnt the first and wont be the last one but thats why you dont want to put everything on on portalportal backend like cartera which is used by various airlines i personally prefer loosing out in max rate on loosing out all because i only used one portal
churning,not_removed,pour one out for all those imaginary kids
churning,not_removed,waiting for another citi aa card to be my last loaddamn those cards ship slow
churning,not_removed,plot twist rep was a fellow churner who did not get their aa bonus miles after meeting spend
churning,not_removed,its nationwide cash or debit only when that changes you can bet it will be big news
churning,not_removed,everyone i have tried wont since they dont use chip yet
churning,not_removed,my local usps are cash or debit only another user said to try again once they start accepting chip cards instead of swipe only
churning,not_removed,they are metabanks and load at wm fine but you cant buy them with cc
churning,not_removed,mg mos deposit instantly and i mean literally instantly with dcu mobile app if youre doing low volume dcu is the real mvp accepts both wu and mg
churning,not_removed,i ran into mg issues when depositing into my local cu the app wasnt able to read the mo amount what solved my problem thanks to this sub was printing out the dollar value for example and placing it onto the mo works every time now
churning,not_removed,ive read about moneygram ones are tough to read western union should work
churning,not_removed,not schwab but im having difficulty depositing mg mos on wf mobile deposit gives me an error saying that the amounts dont match up are there any tips for depositing mg mos into wf ill just deposit into atm if cell phone wont work
churning,not_removed,that happened to me once
churning,not_removed,havent tried shoprite but ive called food emporium and some rite aids around the city and queens food emporium doesnt sell mos and ive only found one rite aid that does i suggest using the wu and mg store locator to call the stores to ask
churning,not_removed,same here bought mine saturday on its way to make way for aa
churning,not_removed,interesting were you going to owe the irs this year and then use this service with a credit card to cover part of what you owed or did you overpay your taxes with the credit card and have the irs refund you like you had overpaid through payroll deductions through the year
churning,not_removed,it worked with my delta gold ccnow trying to meet my min spend with my delta plat business it should work good luck
churning,not_removed,there have been a few dp of this yes but i wasnt able to get for my wife so ymmv yes that hasnt been the case yet one card get shutdown and the others are ok my bb was shutdown but my unused serve was ok this could change of course you make separate logins yes its possible and yes some claim its better to transfer to bank to avoid suspicion from cc neither will stop you from getting shutdown some people do this saw a few dp during the last shutdown that it worked but its up to you
churning,not_removed,never tried the amex venmo method but ive seen enough dps that showed account shutdownsfreezes unless youve been a frequent venmo user for a long time at least a year feel free to correct me though
churning,not_removed,i was denied at the powmgrocery store what do i do say thank you and try again the next day at a different location at a different time with a different person
churning,not_removed,welcome to the fun
churning,not_removed,try again different place time and cashier
churning,not_removed,thats fine if they just take id kind of like cvs only problem is security do they make you fill out one of those forms as if your doing large volume
churning,not_removed,yep this changed somewhere around last november
churning,not_removed,this has been known for a while
churning,not_removed,will it work for nonamex amex cards such as us bank flex perks
churning,not_removed,nice find make sure to max out the freedom category
churning,not_removed,nice find make sure to max out the brg category
churning,not_removed,nice find make sure to max out the discover category
churning,not_removed,imo not worth the i have never been asked by a cashier for a name on card i think you can probably just make note of that cashier and avoid them in the future or worst case scenario go to another location
churning,not_removed,totally works and youll be smugly getting your mos using your real debit card until the cashier asks to see the card and tries to match the last on the card to the last on the screen or receipt the odds of them calling the police in this case approach in many states the act of physically duplicating or cloning a card totally counts as credit card forgery and is a punishable offense even if you manage sort it out it could be a huge hassle and possible expense if you do choose to go down this inadvisable path be sure to copy the magstrip data onto a debit card that does not have a chip you will need a plan in place for when they ask to see your card that doesnt come across as shady af
churning,not_removed,i got one of these to rewrite the parking tickets they give you so i can park at the airport stay for days and come out looking like i just got there
churning,not_removed,havent but have been tempted i used a similar device in undergrad to make extra id cards so my friends and girlfriend could get into my building without me walking down to get them
churning,not_removed,not sure what youre asking exactly will it work technically yes someone who is definitely not me did a lot of retail purchases exactly this way back in the is the risk worth the reward probably not the cashier is unlikely to catch you although they definitely could if they compared the account number on their screen to the on the card ive had that happen plenty of times with cc but never debit the computer guys definitely can tell that youre still using a debit based on the first of the card so if youre running a ton of debit where they dont want debit and they make up their minds to catch you they definitely could and then you potentially could be in actual legal trouble and then theres the financial payback whats it going to take to pay off that investment compared to just doing your ms other ways
churning,not_removed,this will fail in an era of chip cards
churning,not_removed,yeah dont do it no reason to break the law in this hobby so many legal ways to ms
churning,not_removed,all risk no reward why would anyone bother
churning,not_removed,only one way to find out has info about when you are banned i got banned after buying about over two months so dont feel bad if it happens
churning,not_removed,usually one business day sometimes two
churning,not_removed,youll receive a phone call to verify the order probably tuesday before its approved
churning,not_removed,borderline rshittychurning but it can work out fantastically well you can also lose your shirt i met minimum spend on leaked biz plat for me and spouse with an order of gold bars on ebay for less than over spot for each of us sell them to kitco always ship usps registered mail be prepared to float the money for at least a month or two pretty volatile market to jump into though and i would never recommend it to someone who i would not trust to independently do their research and understand the risks involved ive made over on a single order but ive also lost about on one order too the big market drop last fall some shopping portals still track and pay out for bullion on ebay too
churning,not_removed,most places that sell gold only take cash at least all the places i have been too
churning,not_removed,post a pic if you can
churning,not_removed,i thought the same thing happened tooi did my first freedom about two weeks ago and had two different locations sell me ovs with a credit card but i hit up stores today and they all said cash only immediately after i told them the amount i wanted to put on them and thats immediately like corporate just reminded us of this policy and id be a fool to break it so soon not immediately like they knew the policy im going to lay low for a month or so and hopefully by then three more cashiers will have forgotten about the policy and i can get my second freedom taken care of if that doesnt work im not too proud to sweettalk my way into urs
churning,not_removed,the consensus is that it is not sensitive with the exception of the leaked platinum offer
churning,not_removed,how long did you wait between signing up for those accounts signed my wife up for serves and then was denied a bb
churning,not_removed,i know in store is a per day limit you cant do because the fees will put you over is the online limit due to the same daily limit
churning,not_removed,they replaced my kate with a little grey atm there is no where to swipe a card i poked around on it one day just in case its just a normal atm
churning,not_removed,its to limit daily spend per day rolling hours i was wondering this too recently and was told its for the daily spend
churning,not_removed,which security code did you put in the digit one on the front of the card or the digit one on the back whichever you used try the other i remember i had some issue with this too but cant remember which one was the right code
churning,not_removed,a couple of tips would be identity verify both accounts dont sendreceive on same device or same network eg do the sends from your home computer and the receives from your work computer at work dont link the same bank account to both use believable descriptions dont send back and forth just go one way
churning,not_removed,ask if they can issue a check refund rather than back to the card i doubt it but worth a shot
churning,not_removed,i think is about as good as you can do with us bank issued cards that said howd you do it ive got a kroger usb vgc sitting in front of me that google wallet wont accept
churning,not_removed,i am about into a agc in small amounts once every days or so ive done payments so far small sample for a dp but so far so good
churning,not_removed,this is sound like you went for a confession sorry ms user its has been more than yrs since my last i know you are disappointed so funny
churning,not_removed,ill be sure to avoid that lol i already get a little uncomfortable when the ask me to fill out a form with my information at the simon malls when i buy a decent amount of vgcs
churning,not_removed,id be curious to know if fred meyer or safeway work for you im cautiously about to dip my toe into this world been lurkingreading for a while
churning,not_removed,the same way you ms on any other card
churning,not_removed,its the same method as you would with regular meta vgcs with an extra step if you can use at your local stapleskmart to buy vgcs the cash back would cover all the fees of your ms session and maybe more when cvs was a merchant it was even easier since they sell a lot of vgcs it can still be useful if you can make it work based on your locale
churning,not_removed,if you buy from simon they have a low activation fee you can usually buy in bulk up to per transaction i believe and they give you potential to increase your margins if you can find a way to liquidate at one of the approved retailers as the previous comment mentioned it was much easier when cvs was a participant but its still possible
churning,not_removed,just dont deposit the mos at chase
churning,not_removed,nah its rather standard they play it safe with any large purchase and check with you to make sure that you made the purchase just an identity check
churning,not_removed,just dont deposit to chase a lot of shutdowns related to mo dont shit where you eat but for this time i dont think you need to be concerned
churning,not_removed,yep just need to find a local grocery store or the likes that will take them
churning,not_removed,yes works fine for me mostly po mos
churning,not_removed,i do theres some dp on ft first few time process is going to take a while unless your account is old enough dark mos like those you get at wm dont work well
churning,not_removed,yep i did three po mos a couple days apart from eachother in midjanuary i think they took about a day to post
churning,not_removed,takes about a week from the day i order to when i receive them
churning,not_removed,just used my first this week to test out a plan to make extra payments on my student loans utilizing kmart bill pay oh well guess ill just be in debt for another seven years instead of the next two
churning,not_removed,im not trying to be a dick but it is just a matter of time before the online store bans you buying gift cards with loaded on them probably has already risen some red flags
churning,not_removed,instead of buying that gc online can you say purchase that stores gc from a grocery store or something for some bonus category spend then go to that store and redeem for cash im thinking as an example maybe a target gc at safeway and redeem the gc at target thats assuming they have the small denomination available for purchase at safeway doesnt sound like a bad idea but would have to really scale up to be profitable however scaling up means many many trips to redeem them for cash since i assume you dont want to raise any flags but redeeming gc every time you go to the physical store
churning,not_removed,out of curiosity what part of the bay area also for my own curiosity was your cashier indianpakistani ive not once had success with them in the past so i just peek in the window and leave when theyre at the register maybe my racist ms streak needs to come to an end my old go to in the east bay is no longer accomodating to any gc with credit
churning,not_removed,nope just dont do it too often lots of refunds can look suspicious
churning,not_removed,nope i love it when placed will refund in other ways especially to debit just use the debit return to pay off your cc and enjoy the points
churning,not_removed,id do this a few more times then
churning,not_removed,location region error code can you post a pic
churning,not_removed,i try to wait for deals but soemtimes i still order from staples website
churning,not_removed,hoping for one more om deal before going to hawaii in march no staples near me my resets with statement close that month have left to do ur
churning,not_removed,yeah i usually just wait for a promotion for the and rarely buy if i have to pay fees but keep an eye out for ways to do it with other cards i dont care much about maxing cash back as i do about maxing pointsmiles amex had a staples offer xx back on xxx spend last year with amex cards i bought the lowest vgc amount i could to get the most cash back then with ink i used the extra cash back from amex purchases to pay fees on vgcs i bought with ink to max points
churning,not_removed,ramp up slowly ukevlarlover hits spg hard and has never had a problem i did around a month over two spg cards for a while without any problems also fr is just an annoying inconvenience as long as your application income and taxable income arent wildly different and even if they are they usually just adjust your limits anyway this is the dp of courage that you need
churning,not_removed,how do you plan to liquidate
churning,not_removed,i put a cool on my spg and racked up points on top of the bonus before the af hit on the anniversary dont get greedy
churning,not_removed,ive bought back to back on two ccs but ive spread mine out over a few weeks since i read that some stores have gotten warning calls from corporate or incomm or whoever when selling too many at a time no idea if this is per hour day week month i also read that only one per day per store can be activated when purchased with a non chip cc not sure how true either of those are in my area most wont sell with cc but coincidentally the one closest to me will seems like im the only one buying since they arent replenishing and barely any are gone the next time
churning,not_removed,go slow i remember that there was a restriction for the number of cards at a particular registernot sure for how long though this is a dp from last year so not sure how it is currently i couldnt buy more than at a time in a single transaction so i bought x and immediately after me my wife tried to buy but somehow one of the cards wasnt activated i think doc or someone has a post about the little quirks at and the limit
churning,not_removed,its very ymmv keep in mind these are usually poor cashiers and anything over ensures they certainly wont forget you and your face
churning,not_removed,just did a of us bank vgc yesterday
churning,not_removed,i did two metabank visa gift cards from staples this morning on one money order quick and painless and very friendly i was polite and professionally dressed
churning,not_removed,gc are generally accepted at walmarts for mo provided they are not vanilla branded you might get a csr that will say no but there is no hard coding and most people dont have problems
churning,not_removed,in my experience in oregon and washington corridor is no guarantee depends upon csr sometimes no issue sometimes they see the cards and say they cannot do it managers yellow vests always make it work
churning,not_removed,vanillaspost office metabankswalmart third time posting this today maybe it needs to be stickied to the top of the posts
churning,not_removed,a similar thing happened to me tonight one location i was told herp derp its a gift card we cant accept it second location the employee made a rule of two swipes only after i got the first mo for i said ok one more for the same amount she said no third location everything was normal
churning,not_removed,tldr wm wouldnt let me swipe unless i could produce debit cards with my name on it oh well this is completely different then what was originally people were led to believe yes this happens ms is extremely ymmv
churning,not_removed,vgcs at my staples are metabank which walmart still allows i thought bancorp vgcs were limited to at walmart also bancorp vgcs can be used at grocery stores or po to buy mos
churning,not_removed,just liquidated some staples vgcs at a wm this morning
churning,not_removed,where in the midwest are you
churning,not_removed,isnt hardcoded to to accept cc for gc purrchases
churning,not_removed,replying again so you get the notification did some quick searching and this is what i got
churning,not_removed,sorry to not answer your question but im trying to figure it out as well if i find out ill let you know
churning,not_removed,i personally did giftofcollege gc to pay plan i checked the options available for student loan and here they are httpimgurcomalkrrn i can see mohela and great lakes as available options but not aes fwiw i bought gc from toysrus store and it took about days for the amount to post hope this helps
churning,not_removed,sign up for uber and drive yourself around town all day
churning,not_removed,i was curious about this as well just got my ink today
churning,not_removed,someone hit it too hard previously it seems
churning,not_removed,if we were trying to prevent money laundering wouldnt it be no cash instead of cash only
churning,not_removed,what cards are you buying at hyvee i only have the black meta bank cards it thought those were no good at walmart for po
churning,not_removed,counter dp as of december
churning,not_removed,ive had no issues with mos on santander and lmcu in fact im keeping santander open a little longer than i should because its so convenient to do mobile deposit with mos with them
churning,not_removed,have deposited several wus without difficulty
churning,not_removed,no luck with mgs here
churning,not_removed,yes seems there is a corporate circular read my post below you need to sweet talk them into letting you buy with ccs
churning,not_removed,off in md pg county right you pull off from ovgc
churning,not_removed,no ive tried multiple and most dont have vgc over those that do also wont even take cc for anything even gift cards to that specific has station
churning,not_removed,po is very ymmv based on regioncitycashier as well as what kind of vgc youre using ie meta vs ov
churning,not_removed,youll be fine i hit my csp in like days
churning,not_removed,i ms on f fu csp csr ink
churning,not_removed,you can buy paypal my cash at cvs and some other stores
churning,not_removed,yes you can and yes it will get you shut down use ppmc for ebay spend buy closed loop cards for resale bullion close to spot for resale conventional reselling regular spend etc etc
churning,not_removed,what info is outdated
churning,not_removed,how much i bought mo tonight without any questions
churning,not_removed,i would guess its a local report for wm ive been buying mos from different wms near me and the employees dont bat an eyelash wm has at least employees that wont allow vgcs for mos so i stopped going to that one employees that file sars arent supposed to notify the customer that an sar is being filed
churning,not_removed,they are metabank cards and best to be turned into mo at wal mart that is what i do at least i have bought in increments and have had no issue i know some people have different results with the website approving or not approving transactions but again ive had no issue with them in last month or two when i began ordering from them
churning,not_removed,i recall reading on doc that doing so will not count towards your minimum spend i think you can do it if you dont mind that matter
churning,not_removed,in addition to what said about the time delay things can get lost in the mail misplaced and these cards can be used right away once activated the other thing is that simon mall online is associated with gcm which has a tendency to hand out random bans if you read thru ms threads youll find many historical dps confirming this
churning,not_removed,sounds like you put the cart before the horse you may have to travel outside the city
churning,not_removed,try places that sell wu mos httplocationswesternunioncom
churning,not_removed,can u try kroger
churning,not_removed,i had to travel outside the city to liquidate
churning,not_removed,just did it this weekend it worked just fine
churning,not_removed,it is fine for me
churning,not_removed,read httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikimanufacturedspending
churning,not_removed,i cant speak on if they are less sensitive i think that depends on the individual bankcu it seems like the thought is to use a local cu as a ms account because it doesnt matter if they shut you down since its not your main bank
churning,not_removed,try a gebit with your name on it
churning,not_removed,no problem for at cvs i always did this when it is in program
churning,not_removed,mo fees at the po is for or under for to you would pay x for orders of
churning,not_removed,ive swiped chip cards on my reader with no issues
churning,not_removed,i purchased personals but dont think it matters
churning,not_removed,personal is what ive used
churning,not_removed,both work
churning,not_removed,since cashiers can load serve too what i usually do is go to wm when it is real busy and go to one cashier and say to do a load after they hand back the serve card i say actually can i do one more load ive never been turned down then once theyve done two with that cashier i go over to the money center or just a cashier on the other end of the store and repeat
churning,not_removed,what kind of gebit was this
churning,not_removed,it depends on the store and the cashier
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,i called and got mine
churning,not_removed,you should be able to get it doesnt hurt to try
churning,not_removed,at the very least you can cash out the points for you can easily get per point using the ur portal on travel you can do research on various award travel and transfer ur points to partners for much bigger redemption values i just booked a flight at cents per point so youre points netted me in that scenario its all how you use it but bare minimum
churning,not_removed,you can go that route its a little more tedious but definitely one of the safer ways make sure you read up on which gcs can be purchased where and what types of gcs can be used to purchase mos where do you currently use venmo if you do and have a pretty solid history of using venmo and dont want to bother with the gcmobank route id suggest buying an agc on amexs website you can add agcs to venmo without incurring a fee max in a month period and send it to someone you trust and have them transfer the money to you outside venmo but you should only do this if youve used venmo before or else youd be highly prone to shut down
churning,not_removed,why not just hang onto it for your next delta redemption they dont expire or anything buying miles is almost never worth it even in this case
churning,not_removed,did you get a date
churning,not_removed,i believe you should be good when you stay below note that depositing to multiple bank accountscu at the same time might be considered structuring do it at your own risk
churning,not_removed,the black and flower ones are the same card never bought the gold ones because im not interested in vgc they work for serve at walmart never done an mo
churning,not_removed,there was a promotion where purchases from neimann marcus got you as miles apparently a lot of people are seeing the miles they earned get clawed back after they already posted
churning,not_removed,i got broooads in atlanta
churning,not_removed,i did not share this but i got an email about suspicious activity and had my account frozen was using agc sending every week for the past month
churning,not_removed,yesterdays was a little different in the fact that he was just sending straight from his cc and eating the fee agree we need more dps
churning,not_removed,so just to clarify are agcs counting toward min spends on citi chase and amex cards
churning,not_removed,i dont i say hi how are you id like one mo for please then can i split that between two cards they say yes and i tell them and done
churning,not_removed,i just swipe the first card and as im entering the pin tell them on this card they enter it then i swipe again and tell them the amount as im entering the pin i dont trust those people to remember more than one step at a time since its very hit or miss
churning,not_removed,same as you im honest about it i only had an issue once using meta vgc and being denied looked shady walking away
churning,not_removed,ah my friend you should ask in the newbie thread they will guide you manufactured spending ms is about generating activity on credit cards for a very small cost in order to hit minimum spending for bonuses the most common method is buying a gift card at a store then redeeming it for a money order then depositing them then paying off the credit card this is legal but frowned upon by some banks example judy gets a flight worth if she spends in days on her new credit card over a short time she buys worth of gift cards then buys money orders to promptly pay off the card she ends up spending roughly of her own money in gift card fees and money orders to earn a flight she normally wouldnt reach with her regular spending posters here can guide you further if you are interested
churning,not_removed,yes jcd i recognize you as a regular contributor here and on ft i know a lot of that is cuz you enjoy helping people but i also know some of it stems from your addicition lol
churning,not_removed,heres a sneak peek of rshittychurning using the httpsnpredditcomrshittychurningtopsorttoptall of all time im a bot beep boop httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot httpsnpredditcomrsneakpeekbot
churning,not_removed,just last night i found a without gas station that codes as a gas station they had vanilla gift cards for fee i was excited because it took a while to find one
churning,not_removed,out of in my hood allow ccs for vgcs all of them code as gas even ones without pumps
churning,not_removed,interesting point i would say profit per hour is the best metric for ms this compares it to a job or value of free time i think roi is best suited for passive investments
churning,not_removed,total profit is what really matters here biggest profit is the goal but the point of roi after costs is that it accounts for risk within the model when investing the rate of return should increase as risk increases with ms the roirate of return doesnt increase with volume but risk certainly increases with volume total profit doesnt consider things like chances of being shutdown by cc issuers bank closures chances of losing a gc in the mail chances of failed transactions risk of gc hacking etc also total profit doesnt consider of gcs purchased value of gcs purchases since our behavior seems to strange to banks et al it is worthwhile to consider profit per gift card purchased return on gcs is not as nice as return on gcs im not claiming i found some golden rule but it is a fun concept to think about also i am in a life situation where i have a decent amount of free time so i dont put a huge value on that for now im meandering mostly this op was just some food for thought and im a number cruncher and i dont have the ability to ms per month so i want to get a lot of bang for my buck
churning,not_removed,it is always your money and there is always a chance your gc gets hacked or you pay for it but the cashier swiped it wrong and it didnt load properly enjoy your though
churning,not_removed,thanks for the response mate i know youre highly active here and it is fun to see a valid dp this month was good for me partially cuz of the staples deal better than average for sure
churning,not_removed,yeah im not actually trying to maximize roi but it is just another fun metric to consider roi for an investment of a week or two is pretty great id say
churning,not_removed,i was afraid that would be the case if i get warned ill hang tight wait for bonuses to post cash them out and then resume i doubt ill hit the holy grail of in ms but it would still be amazing
churning,not_removed,using a gift card to buy a money order
churning,not_removed,i thought all vanillas were hardcoded against walmart regardless of bank
churning,not_removed,ive liquidated about in meta vgc at wm this month
churning,not_removed,i will give kroger a shot today thank you
churning,not_removed,not authorized
churning,not_removed,maybe its just been my area
churning,not_removed,and the confirmation email will say you added a credit card even if its coding as debit
churning,not_removed,is it still advised to get serves if ill be preemptively canceling a serve before a shutdown before opening one again
churning,not_removed,my bb got shut down and my one vip still works fine not the exact dp youre looking for its been so recent since they allowed serves so there probably arent too many good dps on this im really torn between trying the openclose method vs just opening and using then at a time
churning,not_removed,fyi i wasnt able to add any new payment methods the link is grayed out so you may be out of luck even if it gets here in time ymmv
churning,not_removed,how low is low volume
churning,not_removed,did you receive a hard pull for opening a dcu account
churning,not_removed,so you just wrote it out on a separate piece of paper or you traced the amount on the actual money order
churning,not_removed,ive been wondering the same thing wu mos a easy but it seems like every bank ive tried for mobile deposit mgs give the same error every time
churning,not_removed,id say two years and with some level of large exchanges like i was handling rents for a person campus house so it wasnt unheard of for me to receive at least every month in rents via venmo so that kind of history goes a long way
churning,not_removed,i guess it could be a ymmv deal will check out a couple more today
churning,not_removed,yeah like cvs i got the impression this was to enforce the per day limit employee filled out the form just license info no ssn
churning,not_removed,wow i just read the serve faq on the sidebar last night and it still suggests to use serve loads to help meet min spend
churning,not_removed,i could have sworn it was august or so this happened to me around then and i had to ms on a biz plat last minute
churning,not_removed,i had been getting the cards looked at frequently to the point that ive pretty much stopped trying at my local stores might be a biz opportunity send me your cards ill put your name on them for a charge per card
churning,not_removed,this is true but we arent quite there yet
churning,not_removed,this is not breaking the law it merely appears to be breaking the law
churning,not_removed,no reward youve never been declined the ability to ms because of the fact you are using a gift card good on you but almost everyone else has at some point
churning,not_removed,i met all ms with gold coins from ebay bought ounce coins in last months i then sell to apmex normally lose per a coin only buy from big dealers most run weekly sales normally week turn around unless gold drops then i hold and wait for it to go back up
churning,not_removed,pic of what of the circular i havent seen it the cashier i interacted with told me explicitly so i still requested him to try and it went thru and i walked out happy
churning,not_removed,yeah lucky for me that that purchase was my last ov i needed to max out my freedom in total i hit that same store for in a month i lucked out good luck
churning,not_removed,yeah the limit is supposedly a federal antimoney laundering regulation rather than a store policy per staplescom the website says per order rather than per day though so i figured id try my luck with several smaller orders no dice
churning,not_removed,sounds similar to the one i have except this one you can insert a card sounds like it wont work out for me without human interaction
churning,not_removed,was idd today and wondered same thing thanks for the tip
churning,not_removed,thanks i appreciate it i did bb and mo in the first half of but it was becoming a real pain between driving to simon mall then finding a friendly wm and then depositing in branch cus mt is trash
churning,not_removed,is an even redeemable would a printable one be redeemable if yes and yes raise has a lot of target cards for off some best buy as well i dont know anything about this im purely spitballing here
churning,not_removed,i have done this legitimately for employee handouts its probably not uncommon to request high volume in low denomination
churning,not_removed,i generally add a small additional purchase anyway since i dont want the ms itself to be discounted if a gift card counts as a cash equivalent havent had any issues
churning,not_removed,id love to find a place that sells physical gift cards at the counter
churning,not_removed,peninsula where not a lot of people visit and yes he was to my surprise as well
churning,not_removed,or at least do it at a bunch of different stores instead of the same one
churning,not_removed,solid
churning,not_removed,hmmm i wonder if this could be done with costco
churning,not_removed,i probably will
churning,not_removed,raleigh nc area receipt printed had a paragraph explaining that prepaid cards must be paid for in cash i dont have a pic since i threw away the receipt card was a citi mc
churning,not_removed,for about a profit per
churning,not_removed,for how many years have you been doing the full of on ink
churning,not_removed,yeah its a marathon not a sprint but i just did yesterday and it was way too easy lol
churning,not_removed,going to add a comment about corporate since this is fresh earlier in the week i went to one of the that is normally cool by me earlier in the day than usual and the clerk did the typical i think these are cash only comment from places that are not cool but then she surprised me by saying the corporate guy is in the back let me ask him to be sure too late to flee i wait it out to hear him tell her from the back if the machine allows it to go through it is fine our agreement is only with transaction went through fine like normal so take that for what it is worth
churning,not_removed,im sorry but what does this have to do with anything
churning,not_removed,thanks and do metabanks accept any pin for the first use
churning,not_removed,good good thanks
churning,not_removed,i heard this today as well but was able to get mos in one transaction so i feel this isnt policy he said two swipes per mo
churning,not_removed,i bought a ov at a with my freedom no problem went back the next morning to do it again and the cashier told me they only take cash so i cant confirm that theyre hard coded to accept but thats the way it seemed where i was and its really up to the cashiers discretion
churning,not_removed,youre correct but good luck forcing a cashier to let you swipe your card check out the ms weekly thread for dps regarding a corporate circular telling employees that gift cards are cash only
churning,not_removed,maybe if you buy a chocolate bar too they would be more likely to accept cc
churning,not_removed,yep what they usually mean is chargebacks
churning,not_removed,yeah i was surprised myself the way the guy sounded is that they wouldnt have had it at black friday already perhaps its a store issue my dp of no vgc at bbby next to staples on barbara jordan blvd in austin tx i got my deal back on bf in round rock
churning,not_removed,great did all mos work others have replied saying western union mos work but moneygram doesnt what mos do you deposit
churning,not_removed,opened a santander account again for reasons mo mobile deposit bonus easy ms on opening trash bank and i dont care if i get shut down
churning,not_removed,thanks this is the dp i was looking for
churning,not_removed,ah bummer guess i just have to try with wu then
churning,not_removed,good old pee gee
churning,not_removed,never had a problem with ov at usps
churning,not_removed,ever during min spend you do well awesome man
churning,not_removed,got it thanks
churning,not_removed,had no questions last time im not sure if i triggered something because i initially said then had them cancel and said bc i wanted to use up gc with extra change
churning,not_removed,they didnt tell me she just happened to tell her manager that she needed to fill out some form before she went on break
churning,not_removed,no walmarts by me nyc make metabanks a hassle and vanilla so easy with the amount of usps but i will have to do research about mos at grocery stores by me thanks
churning,not_removed,thanks appreciated
churning,not_removed,but the portals will work for regular gift card mall vgcs
churning,not_removed,thank you it looks like lots of riteaids and does anyone know if all have stopped accepting debit for mos or is this a ymmv situation ie should i keep trying in the hope that some will accept dcs
churning,not_removed,unfortunately no krogers in nyc
churning,not_removed,i see ok thanks for the response
churning,not_removed,gotcha so itll be smarter just to do the x that makes sense now i think thats what the clerk said also in a really low voice didnt want to try her patience though she also seems like she does these quite a bitnot care think i might have found a good po thank you for the advice d
churning,not_removed,also using your ref link because youre the only one to reply thanks again
churning,not_removed,thanks any idea about the or any tax documents
churning,not_removed,are amex gc pin enabled and do they work at walmart
churning,not_removed,i do the double load with a cashier when possible too i usually do it when there arent a ton of people behind me hit a couple different checkout lanes too never had an issue
churning,not_removed,will try out next run thanks
churning,not_removed,us bank mb however the cashiers dont even try and look at the cards at this store
churning,not_removed,i always think of it as if i bought ur points for fees when i calculate cost i look at the total money spent and total money coming back to me as an mo take the difference divide by total money spent and you have your cost
churning,not_removed,how venmo doesnt count amex gift cards as credit
churning,not_removed,good advice
churning,not_removed,just curious did the language explicitly state gcs wouldnt be points
churning,not_removed,were you sending to someone in the same house a possibility that they caught on by seeing the same ip addresses
churning,not_removed,oh youre right forgot he wasnt doing agc couldnt believe he was eating the on all those transactions but to each their own its only a matter of time before venmo tightens up
churning,not_removed,debit
churning,not_removed,okay same my clerks must just be more curious because they almost always ask but its more out of curiosity than suspicion
churning,not_removed,haha i hate that walk of shame it happens all the time at cvs
churning,not_removed,agreed for me its a combo of profithour and total profit i might not do something that takes ten seconds to get a quarter its a decent hour but crappy total profit
churning,not_removed,i would say profit per hour is the best metric for ms profit per hour is a good metric however gets slightly more difficult to measure if you spend a decent amount of time on reddit blogs other sites reading researching commenting
churning,not_removed,my biggest regret is overdoing a unique channel that was worth profit and pts a week until i was finally shut down by the manager
churning,not_removed,i actually made mine based on yours for some reason i couldnt get it to open in google sheets so i just took the columns i needed from yours thanks for doing all the leg work
churning,not_removed,i go to cinema
churning,not_removed,he said metas not vanillas those have a limit at wm
churning,not_removed,damn that is impressive who is your bank that isnt raising an eye brow about the mo ive not had any issues w my bank being wells fargo but im miles away from being that aggressive teller or atm deposit
churning,not_removed,nice ive found i can do about at bofa other balances there too
churning,not_removed,hmm well maybe i should have clarified my kroger wasnt could have changed recently maybe they updated the registers was that cashier policy or register
churning,not_removed,yes the reason to get multiple is to have those others on hand once you do get shutdown once a single card gets shutdown then you will no longer be able to get any more serves but you dont need to get if you dont want
churning,not_removed,right so you havent tried to open a new one im wondering if the ban is for the product family or for any amex prepaid
churning,not_removed,thanks it may be that way ive read a few reports it worked for me weeks ago but the end is very near either way
churning,not_removed,you need to remove one first at least i was able to add one last week but i got greedy and added to help with min spends my account was locked under review for a day but opened back up without me talking to anyone
churning,not_removed,per month
churning,not_removed,i actually used it while opening it for an auto loan so yes it was a hard pull
churning,not_removed,i tried to hand write it but couldnt get the cu app to read the mo what ended up working was using a printer to print the actual amount with some space between the dollar sign and the amount
churning,not_removed,thanks for the input ive been collecting rent utilities from my roommates thinking about bumping this up to goal is to move out of my current apartment and to a house with more friends and profit off that im starting to think going the agc venmo method is a better ms option for me than depositing mos and risking shutdown given that ive been using venmo for like years
churning,not_removed,success at another bashas mile away
churning,not_removed,please ping a mod and ask them to update
churning,not_removed,it was in august because that is when i tried as well and it didnt work
churning,not_removed,oh i see wouldnt that require sending you a giftcard with money on it
churning,not_removed,you could prove there was no intent to defraud and get off without being charged but that proof may come after handcuffs lawyer etc
churning,not_removed,maybe im biased because im in a large metropolitan area but anytime ive ever had an issue i did fine within a minute drive or by coming back the next day
churning,not_removed,youve never been declined the ability to ms because of the fact you are using a gift card personally id rather drive to the other staplescvspowmetc across town or try again the next day instead of fucking with this maybe thats just me though
churning,not_removed,never buy from an individual large company buy it now make sure its less than over spot the lowest i can usually get on gold is over spot look on kitco to see what theyre buying at and then you will have an idea of how much spot needs to rise for you to break even apmex might pay more if youre buying seminumismatic rounds but they always suck for bars registered mail is expensive too need to buy on a dip and sell on a spike crapshoot speculation bs overall and youre likely to lose a fair bit before you get it figured out
churning,not_removed,ive heard some horror stories about people getting coins that actually werent gold they might have been chocolate i cant remember off the top of my head
churning,not_removed,i never hold and wait if it drops i just sell it and take the hit there is a very real possibility with precious metals that it will simply not go back up better to take the loss and have your money available you can always rebuy at the lower price if you think its going to bump back up in the short term
churning,not_removed,in general its better to buy from apmex on ebay
churning,not_removed,apmexcom looks off hand they charge but in cash at all the stores ive been at sell at let that factor in as well also when selling they buy for spotnoz
churning,not_removed,lol you must be one persuasive mofo i hope i can convince mine too just gotmy second it and am pumped to max out since its for first year categories i also have freedoms so ive got my work cut out for me
churning,not_removed,yeah the circular im surprised that a csr told you heshe got corporate message saying do not do x you asked himher to do x and they immediately agreed thank goodness for the legions of counter jockeys who legit dgaf
churning,not_removed,wow thats impressive ive got about different within a reasonable distance so im optimistic that ill max mine out too but id love to stumble upon a unicorn as benevolent as yours
churning,not_removed,ive never had an issue loading with a cashier just sucks because you cant load all your gift cards at once well you could i just like to stay under the radar
churning,not_removed,is an even redeemable technically no the law states under bucks
churning,not_removed,i think if anything the stores that youre redeeming at would ban you first
churning,not_removed,yea i glanced at my local grocery stores gc rack today while shopping and nothing was less than
churning,not_removed,interesting i do remember always getting costco gift cards or cash whenever i returned something but this was back in the amex days i havent returned any items since the switch to accepting all visa cards i will give this a try next time but i wouldnt rely on it as an ms method costco shuts down accounts of members who return way too many items and i normally dont have reservations with returns but i dont think costco can resell anything that is returned so i wouldnt feel right doing any ms this way
churning,not_removed,roughly i dont do it very often because i try not to eat too many activation fees if possible and between odom and staples there have been rebates in the past few months
churning,not_removed,i do this to fill in the gaps of the deals my liquidation is pretty painless and its a good way to earn some ur considering i easily get with ur its dollars for worth of travel and i always have the option to cash out
churning,not_removed,this is my first year having the card hope it doesnt get converted to ink preferred anytime soon
churning,not_removed,im in the same boat with my new amex blue for biz mr on and ive got a year to do it already did at a simon hopefully i can do that at least once a month
churning,not_removed,you dont want to make them suspicious of you and going into a and buying of gcs and wanting to pay on multiple ccs is likely to make the suspicious because it is highly abnormal
churning,not_removed,dont push your luck too quickly the goal shouldnt be to buy as many as you can one time unless i guess thats what you wantbut it should be to be able to consistently keep this method open
churning,not_removed,default pin is the last digits of the card
churning,not_removed,no youre thinking of vanilla variable load up to visa gift cards and possibly more vanilla products but ive used these at the post office fresh outta the pack i recommend going online at the supplied website to change the pin
churning,not_removed,if you were using one vanillas and trying to buy a mo greater than then that explains why you were denied
churning,not_removed,same with me got so far need a for the quarter out of tries worked
churning,not_removed,only ever tried western union
churning,not_removed,any difference between ov and just vanilla or are those the same for po use
churning,not_removed,i never had a problem msing minimum spend with chase i always get the points
churning,not_removed,as soon as i get a card in the mail take it right to simon to knock out minimum spend
churning,not_removed,possibly related to a suspicious activity report i recently learned that the department that handles sars is headquartered near where i grew up
churning,not_removed,you may expect verification call from gcm after your first order use cashback site to break even fees
churning,not_removed,as far as i know i could be mistaken they are cash only
churning,not_removed,riteaids and are ymmv there are historical dps showing that you could buy mos at one time i dont think ive ever heard of anyone purchasing or advocating buying mos at either location ever since i started msing all the rite aids and that ive hit up have been cash only its up to you if this is still worth your time
churning,not_removed,is there any other supermarket around your area stop shop hannaford
churning,not_removed,thank you
churning,not_removed,im new to it too and i dont know
churning,not_removed,my wife runs about through her square reader as a hairstylist but weve never received a i just report the income summarized on the year end summary and deduct the listed processing fees
churning,not_removed,or transactions will trigger
churning,not_removed,i completely read his question wrong and thought he was talking about value amount of each gift card loading fee mo amount put back into banknumber of points accumulated cost
churning,not_removed,it counts them as debit and thus no fee you could also use square
churning,not_removed,yes it did have the exclusion clearly stated many of us decided to take a chance since the gcs could be sold for a small profit without even considering the miles when the miles posted everyone got excited when the miles got clawed back everyone got sad
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,yes but most people tried anyway
churning,not_removed,i used cell service and phone on one venmo account i used computer and wifi on the other verified with different last digits of social bday and zip code i think they just saw me sending every week precisely at the day mark and called me out they said it looked like i was sending money to myself which is against the rules and govt regulations they said if i promised to stop they would unfreeze my account i said it was business and asked if they changed anything i have not heard back been hours
churning,not_removed,was really hoping to use this to meet min on my csr we will see if any more dps roll in within the next couple of days
churning,not_removed,yeah eating in fees for ms i was considering it but damn thats steep and im a big fan of the pajama points
churning,not_removed,a fair point i was referring to dps that people were able to spend with just this card
churning,not_removed,mix of teller and drop box its my local bank small place they all know me by name they couldnt care less about the mos
churning,not_removed,have you tried more and they blocked it or just not wanting to push your luck i make sure all my transactions are electronic never pay any fees or anything in cash gives me a full audit trail if needed
churning,not_removed,register it was hardcoded
churning,not_removed,i have tried i cant open any flavor of serve
churning,not_removed,im an idiot totally forgot you have to remove one first thanks at least i can knock out another before it dies
churning,not_removed,i dont know id still be a little nervous about adding a new agc every month and then transferring to everything in this game ymmv though so its up to you what you want to do but you dont want to be stuck floating cash for everyone since youre handling the rents why are you worried about the risk of being shutdown with mos you could always open a new bank account like wells fargo and deposit your mos in there from what ive read wf is more lenient than others when it comes to mos
churning,not_removed,yeah was mostly kidding but i guess its worth floating the idea if theres real interest but if it was serious id need to think that through maybe an escrow service or something
churning,not_removed,this is true once youve been around the block or learned your local area it is easy to avoid the wrong people and go to the right places im not saying the tool is necessary but i would not go so far as to call it useless
churning,not_removed,sure it is risky and probably not worth it i tried to get that out of the way
churning,not_removed,the last time i bought a perth mint oz bar from an individual it was fake discovered by kitco after i resold it to them they cut it in half and sent it back i requested a refund and the seller refunded me without too much hassle moral if its priced below spot its too good to be true
churning,not_removed,apmex ebay is great my ms options are limited in my area so i use gold to meet all ms
churning,not_removed,i always make small talk and talk about the weather their day christmas or some jazz like that being in patriots nation helps to talk about the super bowl goat etc etc d d this hobby is actually a salesjob where in instead of convincing people to buy you have to convince them to let you buy hahaha
churning,not_removed,too often they are paid too little to gaf lets thank our stars and always treat them like the heroes they are
churning,not_removed,good luck d
churning,not_removed,it will be my first time so im just a bit nervous i know i shouldnt be though im just trying to figure out how long i want to keep my account open due to the shutdowns
churning,not_removed,yeah sadly this is the case
churning,not_removed,i know back i i would sometimes cash out my starbucks cards but it was a while ago so idk if that works anymore
churning,not_removed,as far as i know an fr would just freeze all your accounts for some period of time you should escape unscathed if you didnt like on your application income etc they might decrease your credit limit i just need to get my big spend out of the way asap engagement ring to get my bonus for biz plat then i can ms all i want
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,you cant use more than a ov
churning,not_removed,do you ever try buying more than one gc at at time or is it safer to do just one gc per visit
churning,not_removed,solid dp thanks i will try the same
churning,not_removed,does this include full ms to meet the spend like straight up just buy vgcs and youll be ok is it risky to meet it all in one week
churning,not_removed,thank you this helps
churning,not_removed,hmm so i guess only if i chance across one but no point searching and hitting them up one by one thanks
churning,not_removed,neither but i think there are stop shop up in ct do they do mos with dcs if so i can travel up there
churning,not_removed,i see thanks for the context by any chance did you buy the agcs with an amex looking toward this avenue to ms on the biz plat
churning,not_removed,report back the response after the business mention
churning,not_removed,i should clarify it went through as a debit but when i see the card in my payment methods it does say american express credit i did another payment this morning with no fee
churning,not_removed,sent a payment with amex gc minutes ago debit
churning,not_removed,he went to egypt
churning,not_removed,hmmm well that is a sweet gig wish i had such confidence in wells fargo or knowledge of a localstate only bank being cool with it
churning,not_removed,could probably scale more but i find this amount a desireable trade off of time invested and points received
churning,not_removed,which kroger brand
churning,not_removed,im in nh so no wells fargo anywhere close to me i want to start slow with msing although ive done my due diligence the nearest walmart is min away and the pos near me only accept cash for mos so agcs seem like the way to go i was thinking about buying agcs give each one to my roommates and have them venmo me small amounts each week which seems doable we send each other money all the time from eating out and stuff so i feel like its less likely to get shutdown doing it this way
churning,not_removed,fair enough
churning,not_removed,moral if its priced below spot its too good to be true they shouldnt have sold it below spot im sure there are a lot of fraudsters that will sell their junk at a premium to avoid raising eyebrows
churning,not_removed,i fight with the manager at my local target every time i try to redeem for cash and i have only done it times card each time because i legitimately end up with them just because its the law doesnt mean itll be easy theres nowhere to report them when they refuse
churning,not_removed,sry mate i was responding to the guy teddy
churning,not_removed,yeah thats why they scan your id
churning,not_removed,meant to say you cant charge more than in order to use ov
churning,not_removed,i only ever did i dont imagine it is any safer per say but probably easier to get away with since most cashiers seem leary i assume a gc from them is unusual as is haha
churning,not_removed,definitely doesnt hurt to use it for your real spending as well during that time
churning,not_removed,i personally wouldnt waste my own time methodically hitting them up one by one youre welcome best of luck my friend
churning,not_removed,mine let me buy mo with the dc but every once a while there is one associate would ask for the card and then turn me down i just say ok and leave come back another day with a diff csr to buy so now i know which csr to stay away from
churning,not_removed,yes and that was my plan as well which is now foiled originally i was using it to ms the spg card i was going to create a venmo for the biz plat but that plan has now been foiled i use venmo too much to be completely shut down i decided to pay taxes instead and eat a fee i rationalized that i will get that fee back with the airline reimbursement
churning,not_removed,this is what i was seeing it says american express credit but when i tried to cash out the remaining balance it gave me an error i then assumed it was because it thought it was a cc and trying to add which would have given insufficient balance counter dp is i had another agc to cash out via another account and that one just went through fine so either theres something wrong with that specific card or account or my math is just bad and im doing something wrong
churning,not_removed,with the httpswwwwellsfargocomcreditcardsvisasignaturehomerebate or a true httpswwwwellsfargocomcreditcardsvisasignature i suspect that the mortgage card would be easier to rack up figures on but more vulnerable to clawback
churning,not_removed,yeah im too scared of going above in mos per month at my wells fargo which is also my closest bank
churning,not_removed,open up a biz account
churning,not_removed,i do it more for cash than points i typically net between to pending on wherehow i buy i only buy online so i have almost no time in that and i can cash out about of cards in under an hour at that works out to about i just like beating the system
churning,not_removed,thats actually not a bad plan just keep the cards within months rule in mind for venmo and youre good to go
churning,not_removed,ill never buy bullion from an individual on ebay again as an individual youd have to sell well above spot just to recoup the seller fees the big market makers have super low seller fees the counterfeit itself was really convincing
churning,not_removed,i chose a book for reading
churning,not_removed,oh gotcha yeah i have no idea on that one
churning,not_removed,yep i know about the summer shutdown wave my buddy spent million on his card i am speculating that the home rebate card portfolio isnt watched as closely due to the mortgage requirement since ive never seen a dp of someone with that card being shut down
churning,not_removed,he is choosing a dvd for tonight
churning,not_removed,this is wellknown by now have seen numerous posts about it
churning,not_removed,this has been posted and can be found in the amex offers thread on the side bar
churning,not_removed,a joke as honors points are not that valuable
churning,not_removed,removed ask this in moronic monday the answer is no you get the ur points on every statement
churning,not_removed,from my live chat rep you can get another discover itmiles card and only hold up to discover cards at one time and yes you will get the pointsmiles doubled after monthly statements
churning,not_removed,yep have and did double cb on both
churning,not_removed,you can have a maximum of discover cards at one time i dont know if it matters to you or not but note there is the caveat that you must have separate discover logins for each card which is somewhat that no other bank does that i know of not the end of the world but certainly annoying
churning,not_removed,but what if you already have both if i cancel one now how long until i can sign up again and most importantly would i qualify for dbl cash back for my first year
churning,not_removed,i was denied for the second discover it card last year no luck on recon
churning,not_removed,ureelbgpunk were they both it cards or was one an it and one a miles and did you already get the doubling
churning,not_removed,yeah i find that weird they said that they were working on a fix for it but i dont know how long it will take
churning,not_removed,one it one it miles got the cb on the miles it should be coming soon
churning,not_removed,dont hold your breath it has been like that for years and will probably continue to be like that
churning,not_removed,yep pretty much the same experience except i had the card for years at that time the customer service is amazing but they are strict with the second card
churning,not_removed,that makes me sad ive been thinking about getting their miles cars but i honestly dont want to have two different logins i have my checking savings and credit card all under one login with discover makes things more simple for me
churning,not_removed,can confirm dp cashonly at my local as of august
churning,not_removed,removed ms saturday
churning,not_removed,shocking
churning,not_removed,that looks like the personal card in which case its a known offer i think there was even a link in the leaked links thread before they all stopped working
churning,not_removed,this is an existing offer that comes around fairly often
churning,not_removed,methinks chase is feeling a bit cocky knowing that it has the best rewards program of any bank and that with in place they are basically immune to the plague of us churners
churning,not_removed,incoming cash devaluation
churning,not_removed,i presume this is targeted mailer how does one get it seems like others are always getting it except me is ink cash under too
churning,not_removed,any dps on whether having a business checking account will get you targeted
churning,not_removed,i never get mailers only discover any advice on what triggers these
churning,not_removed,what criteria is chase targeting when mailing these out i want bucks
churning,not_removed,maybe lower income businesses can get approved if they otherwise cant on the ink its not a bad deal would you mind sharing your business inforelationship with chase
churning,not_removed,if you can qualify for it this card is definitely more valuable than the csp in my opinion on restaurants and gas stations on the first spent at office supply stores and on cellular phone landline internet and cable tv services no annual fee edit as urskenshin mentioned need csr or ink to allow ur transfers to travel partners
churning,not_removed,are you the elusive d barrett
churning,not_removed,i wonder if well see a targeted increase in the csp card bonus soon
churning,not_removed,why do they specify it as cash back for the ink but points for the ink
churning,not_removed,i just got approved for the cash on friday i havent gotten my card yet i had to recon to get it i wonder if i should see if theyll match it
churning,not_removed,got the mailer i have ink under my ssn do you think itll be a good idea to try to apply under my biz tax ein
churning,not_removed,whats the diff between this and ink plus if is same as points and i have a csr to increase point value
churning,not_removed,thats a nice bonus on the ink cash
churning,not_removed,think i can get a match for this
churning,not_removed,dammit i just got denied recon too for the marriott biz card too many recent inquiries exempt from my ass
churning,not_removed,can i downgrade ink to cash in one year
churning,not_removed,is ink under i thought the business cards were excluded or more accurately i thought they were tracked against the business not the person
churning,not_removed,absolutely this they nipped us in the bud
churning,not_removed,you guys think that chase is trying to cause inflation with all this cash theyre giving away
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,my employer doesnt have any business accounts neither checking nor credit with chase and we still received a targeted mailer so at the very least its not required
churning,not_removed,its ur not much better
churning,not_removed,youre no more likely to get approved for ink cash than ink plus
churning,not_removed,you would need the csr or ink to make this better than the csp this doesnt allow ur transfer on its own
churning,not_removed,not while theyre promoting csr imo
churning,not_removed,i think its for marketing the same way the f and fu are cash back the ink also has the on travel through the chase portal
churning,not_removed,more than likely no but you can try theyll ask for the code addressed to you
churning,not_removed,doesnt relate to inquiries
churning,not_removed,yes but you wont get a bonus obviously and make sure you still have the csp or csr to keep the ability to transfer points
churning,not_removed,yes but no sign up bonus
churning,not_removed,ink is affected
churning,not_removed,wtf is this comment
churning,not_removed,its probably all bad debt that is re packacked in different levels
churning,not_removed,ah thanks that helps
churning,not_removed,isnt the business cash straight cash
churning,not_removed,most would still probably argue that the ink csp
churning,not_removed,yes youre right i kind of just assumed everyone here has the csr already
churning,not_removed,fair but confusing p
churning,not_removed,i guess i can try
churning,not_removed,well it said inquiries and new accounts i dunno i threw that shit in the trash so im paraphrasing
churning,not_removed,thx
churning,not_removed,thx
churning,not_removed,botched google image search link
churning,not_removed,he said that chase got cocky this is from family guy a joke
churning,not_removed,no its ur points same as freedom which is marketed as a cash back card but is really points you just need a premium ur card to transfer
churning,not_removed,nearly everyone here is restricted by
churning,not_removed,if you find any different let me know thats what they said to me though maybe youll get lucky
churning,not_removed,theyre talking about how you just posted the full link instead of formatting it into a smaller one
churning,not_removed,gtk thanks
churning,not_removed,what is
churning,not_removed,no go ill try to match the in branch offer
churning,not_removed,thats obviously a punishable offense here sheesh
churning,not_removed,it offends my eyes
churning,not_removed,removed
churning,not_removed,removed report approvals in the megathread
churning,not_removed,this is on the sidebar
churning,not_removed,this goes in the daily discussion thread
churning,not_removed,i instant messaged a rep last week and was told the annual fee is prorated i have until jan to cancel or downgrade as well i will call and see what response i receive
churning,not_removed,it will likely take until the charge posts to get the credit and the credit may not hit immediately
churning,not_removed,how do you know they dont prorate refunds docs post on the subject seems to indicate they might
churning,not_removed,no the newbie thread the daily discussion thread is a bit beyond tired of travel credit questions
churning,not_removed,just spoke to a rep she said it was prorated she even offered bonus typ for spending in the next months since i am citigold my fee is i may keep it for the next months and then cancel
churning,not_removed,must be new because they prorated both mine and my wifes a few months ago
churning,not_removed,quick update i used the credit for a flight in early january the credit was reflected on the next cycle which just posted i called to down grade the card which they did i received a prorated credit
churning,not_removed,i just clicked on the email link and got this 😐 httpimgurcomareykf
churning,not_removed,well a step up from ihgs joke of an offer yesterday at least
churning,not_removed,i just got the message also spend on purchases with your card from april june and earn extra bonus points in world of hyatt register nowbe sure to register by june its the only way to earn your extra bonus points
churning,not_removed,i got the email but clicking thru to the mychasebonus site right now says its down for maintenance
churning,not_removed,i wish i received this one only got the ihg unfortunately
churning,not_removed,so basically a free night at a cat hyatt for spend or am i looking at this incorrecly trying to see if its worth it or just keeping that spend on the csr
churning,not_removed,on nonbonused spend up to is like a defacto back in my eyes since i personally value hyatt points at this will actually replace my fu card for nonbonused spend since id be using that card otherwise to earn ur and evidently transfer to hyatt anyways since my balance is low hyatt ur to hyatt
churning,not_removed,received this as well for me this would pretty much mean points on grocery store purchaseshmmmmaybe ill hit this up after securing my on my two freedoms on my two discovers and on my dividend got a pretty busy quarter coming up but definitely not complaining ha
churning,not_removed,my thoughts is combining it with the woh bonus points offer just in case a hyatt appeals more to me than marriott in the near future
churning,not_removed,i have closed my hyatt card starting of this month surprisingly i have received this offer for closed card
churning,not_removed,meh wish i got your offer instead all i got was this double points for being you earn double points april – june we understand being rewarded helps you be your best earn double points april – june on eligible stays worldwide starting with your second eligible stay with your new world of hyatt loyalty program points add up quickly so free nights and room upgrades are within reach
churning,not_removed,thats what i get to when i click the email link
churning,not_removed,same here it has been down all morning
churning,not_removed,assuming you spend the full and only use ur points on hyatt cat hyatt csr hyatt stays dining air car rental other travel other spendings
churning,not_removed,probably about the same honestly
churning,not_removed,indeed if i didnt already have retention offers from barclaycard to meet on aa red id probably hop on this too maybe whatever is left over i will still do
churning,not_removed,what is the woh bonus offer i only saw the pt offer
churning,not_removed,yes both dw and i got the woh offer like i said i may pair that offer with this one if i dont love the marriott options near me in my travels
churning,not_removed,im still getting the down for maintenance screen today
churning,not_removed,yep my plan is just to put everyday nonbonuscategory spendings on hyatt for the next quarter but next quarter we have on groceries on freedom so im not sure if its going to be enough for
churning,not_removed,ooh i see haha still i wish i got that targeted offer
churning,not_removed,i just was able to register via mobile
churning,not_removed,woohoo it finally works again
churning,not_removed,this is an important reminder to blow your load while its still valuable
churning,not_removed,oh sweet the crowne plaza in minsk is going down points just what i always wanted
churning,not_removed,if anyone is looking for a good redemption before the increase the is a steal at im not surprised to see it going up to after these changes
churning,not_removed,oddly they didnt touch some of my favorite values like the point intercontinental presidente cancun
churning,not_removed,i use ihg for when hotels are inflated so you get most value otherwise theyre a pittance generally i dont book any hotels with points if i get less than one cent per point im using ihg to stay at their park city holiday inn during sundance room prices are minimum per night around at this one points per night on points and cash i recognize that i was getting better value if i just spent the points per night but im happier saving the points and still getting more than cent per point
churning,not_removed,cool a percent increase on the two hotels i had been looking at for the future
churning,not_removed,ihg was gonna be my next app thanks for changing my mind
churning,not_removed,well shit i just earned points in the past months and figured that would take me a long way hopefully those properties dont go away i was able to buy my friend whos driving across country on a move a night for points its nice to be able to do favors like that for next to zero cost to me
churning,not_removed,i just use those points to upkeep my ambassador status
churning,not_removed,heres a sortable list to the changes found on doctor of credit
churning,not_removed,did some quick math point is worth if you use points to book a room that regularly costs after tax just a reminder to people who regularly overvalue their points or points in general
churning,not_removed,i find ihg points extremely littlevalue sometimes i am traveling around europe right now thanks to my mr points and the hotel usually costs € one night if i wanna use points it is gonna be or i am doing anything wrong or ihg points are indeed of little value
churning,not_removed,planning to travel in china and europe germanyfrancespain next year cities that are in the trip seeing up and downs i guess it can even
churning,not_removed,damn hitting aruba was planning on using mine and my wifes ihg points there
churning,not_removed,damn ic osaka going from to knew it was too good to last that hotel was awesome in so many ways
churning,not_removed,stayed at hotel indigo barcelona plaza catalunya last year on my trip there and its a very good hotel my feeling is hotel indigo in general or at least in the europe are all good but i dont have enough sample sets going from to is quite absurd
churning,not_removed,are there any reasonable ihg hotels in ho chi minh city heading there in february and have some points to blow
churning,not_removed,have there ever been increases in values for points personally this is why i find hoarding points doesnt pay off especially when you ms and get shutdown its twice as painful cash as usual is king
churning,not_removed,regretting get their card recently the points are really worthless now
churning,not_removed,i leave here satisfied
churning,not_removed,excellent dating advice as well
churning,not_removed,are we not doing phrasing anymore
churning,not_removed,at peak season even is a decent deal for that location
churning,not_removed,i went through the list and thought the same thing im staying at the presidente for new years which is going for about a night right now at a night im wasnt ever spending at a holiday inn anyways
churning,not_removed,ill be at the intercontinental presidente cozumel december redemption because of the the inflated new years prices
churning,not_removed,they raise cancun and cozumel by last round of increases if i remember correctly
churning,not_removed,heck ill even buy points sometimes because the cost of cash can be so inflated like when my friends and i went to the grand canyon over a holiday weekend and hotels were more than tax they had points available and at the time points were cheaper than normal i dont remember the exact number but we didnt pay more than a night by buying points other than that i might use them for splurge destinations where i wouldnt want to spend money but im getting a decent value out of them
churning,not_removed,book now to lock in the prices then cancel later if it doesnt work out i believe points bookings are refundable
churning,not_removed,thats a mistake still huge value
churning,not_removed,why would this change your mind they are raising prices at slightly more than of their properties like many devaluations people are blowing this up into a much better deal than it is it still should be fairly easy to get or more in value from the sign up bonus and the chase ihg card has always been terrible for putting spend on so not that much is really changing
churning,not_removed,you really should still consider it the plus the annual free night after year for only af is a great deal i combine free nights with my wife every year to stay at a resort
churning,not_removed,im happy with cpp for ihg i assume for ihghilton that way i end up being disappointed less
churning,not_removed,no value is pretty awful for europe im going to europe next year and just used mine on out of the way hotels that cost each in places i was going anyway and then use other hotel points in cities the value of the card is the annual free night at any ic for only
churning,not_removed,check the point breaks for european deals stayed at a hi in ghent for last year and it was awesome
churning,not_removed,it depends on when for a €night during oktoberfest is fantastic value
churning,not_removed,youre definitely right i stayed at a hotel in indianapolis for while the cost was about per night for cash however one hotel in ca that i cant remember the location of was versus off season i guess i just remember these because the same cash price for such a different point price was strange to me its not hard to imagine the same thing happening in europe
churning,not_removed,truth is the majority of hotel points are poor value in europe if you are going to the major capitals which is where american intro travelers go to understandably it doesnt really matter if its ihg hilton marriott or spg value is there to be had but usually outside the major capitals either go for nice hotels in capitals of second tier countries or for notsonice hotels even the ones that are out of the way in europe are not always a good value you have to plan your trip around the points a little bit if youve never been to paris and wanna go consider the ur portal it might save you a bundle
churning,not_removed,got two nights there next week courtesy of my card sign up bonus hoping its good
churning,not_removed,hotel indigo is always great i remember when you could find them on point breaks
churning,not_removed,awardmappercom wandrmehoteltoolshotelhustle
churning,not_removed,resort outside da nang just got rated top ihg hotel it hadnt opened when i went in please go and report back
churning,not_removed,yes last year wyndham changed their redemption structure causing their points to be more valuable for most people doesnt happen often though
churning,not_removed,youre one of the first people ive seen say this on this sub perhaps its because i dont churn a ton or ms but ive found that redeeming for cash or cash equivalents and then depositing that money into a dedicated travel fund gets me a better return than building miles
churning,not_removed,the cards value has really only ever been the free annual nightthe points have always been mostly worthless but a night at any of their properties is hard to beat
churning,not_removed,if hotel booking is worthless i guess thats true
churning,not_removed,lanaaaaaa
churning,not_removed,i believe points bookings are refundable they are
churning,not_removed,yep free night for makes it a keeper even if ihg points are totally worthless
churning,not_removed,hysteria like every other major devaluation
churning,not_removed,i think youre doing better than a lot of people here even successful churners who seem to massively overvalue points or maybe they just like inflating their achievements either way i think its smart to be as logical as possible accuracy is key
churning,not_removed,value is better for asia but now all the beijing spots are going up ugh the beijing palace one was such a steal probably going to book these in advance as well
churning,not_removed,oh dude you have no idea it was so awesome make sure to check out the bath house be careful of all the subways connecting in that area though it can get confusing navigating even with google maps one thing i remember about that area is the really nice shirt store called super good quality oxford shirts and dress shirts and cheaper than their store in nyc located right below ic osaka the bazillion different deparment stores near umeda all have really delicious basement food courts also highly recommend going to manryo minamimorimachi or tsurugyu for bbq beef such good value for wagyu would advise against going to kani doraku the restaurant with the giant crab sign because it was overpriced and didnt taste good oh also i would highly recommend ootoya and coco curry ichibanya one serves traditional japanese set meals for dirt cheap the other serves delicious japanese curry both are national chains but that doesnt mean they dont taste good lastly if you wear glasses stop by one of the jins shops around osaka they are like warby parker but even cheaper ish for a pair of good quality glasses exam included high index lens included they speak english there too
churning,not_removed,i think its situational and relies on your travel goals points are easier to accumulate with sign up bonuses and with enough points you can do some amazing things you could never do with cash that said points are very very limited and depreciate a lot faster than cash if you want to take an economy flight to cancun stay in modest accommodations and travel on certain dates then cash is most likely going to be your best bet if your vacation plans dont involve flights or hotels eg camping road trip trains etc points arent going to do anything for you on the other hand if you want to take a business class flight to the maldives stay at a a night hotel are flexible with your dates and dont mind pay of the cost out of pocket then cash isnt going to get you anywhere close to that
churning,not_removed,this is the exact reason i got the card their points redemption are crap
churning,not_removed,i would really argue strongly that the points are worthless ihg point signup bonus is nights at some very nice hotels platinum status also is nice when you book those hotels ive gotten upgraded every time including in san diego and hawaii at very busy times of the year but youre right about the free night that is the real reason to have the card
churning,not_removed,seriously use that free night in some expensive intercontinental and youve made out like a bandit
churning,not_removed,the status is also pretty nice too got upgraded to a suite in munising michigan because the hotel was full and they wanted to free up a regular room they put me on the top floor of the crowne plaza in downtown seattle because im a loyal customer those are the only times ive stayed in ihg since owning the card
churning,not_removed,i thought i heard you could still get matched to an expired offer not sure
churning,not_removed,awesome im in tokyo now and havent done any research for osaka yet so im going to take your word as gospel p also as a glasseswearer with a ton of pairs i think i might have to plan a visit to jins thanks
churning,not_removed,worthless was a bit strongyoure right that the signup bonus can snag some nice redemptions that said i wouldnt recommend putting very much spend on the card because the points will net relatively little i may have not been clear in my other response but i definitely agree that the card is worth keeping for the free night and the additional benefits that you mentioned
churning,not_removed,its still blowing my mind and my dads how we were able to use my free night at the crowne plaza anchorage for what would have been a fare awesome start to a bucketlist fishing vacation adventure
churning,not_removed,thanks appreciate it
churning,not_removed,i wont bore you to death with too much recommendations but the things i enjoyed the most in tokyo were httpwwwnnagicomenglish in shinjuku in shibuya takano fruit parlor in shinjuku i heard fuunji is good for their tsukemen but didnt have time to go if you are taking the train to osaka instead of flying stop by in the tokyo station for their variety of bentos that you can eat on the train if you are flying budget airline to kixwelp good luck i learned to not do that after my first trip in japan the flights are always delayed and the monetary and time cost of transporting to and from the airport adds up and in the end trains are just easier
churning,not_removed,thanks again took your advice on one of the food places already and will have to try the othersalso im taking the train to osaka and will keep your plane travel advice in mind im in japan til the
churning,not_removed,well good effort on the reps part but id have found it an unnecessary complication too
churning,not_removed,another dp on a csr reconsideration call yesterday i asked to move of credit from another card to the csr the rep explained that the maximum that she could move without higher level approval was i was technically already over so i didnt want to endanger my csr approval i said was fine and was happily approved
churning,not_removed,i had the same experience for the fairmont card it was a dream call congratulations youre approved if we can move some credit from one of your other cards if youd like more credit than you can apply for more credit
churning,not_removed,how much do you spend that she was thinking wouldnt be enough
churning,not_removed,makes you wonder if chase wants to increase their credit exposure to become more profitable and want to push existing card holders to increase their credit lines i wonder if every churner out here reduced their credit lines to what they need with chase maybe then chase might lessen up on
churning,not_removed,the way youre describing it doesnt sound like youd be denied for the i doubt shed suggest that if she thought youd get denied because why would she push for a denial also couldnt they have just countered with a lower limit instead of denying
churning,not_removed,by having me request a total credit increase even going as far as saying she was ready to submit it for me did she mention whether or not it would be a new hp
churning,not_removed,as far as i know having a higher credit line is a good thing i think the higher your credit is and the lower amount you put on it helps your credit score more like if you have a credit line of but only use of it its better for your score if you have but only use of it when i was preparing to take out my first mortgage one of the bankers i talked to suggested i try to increase my credit lines on some of my credit cards to help improve my credit score
churning,not_removed,i heard that with ritz it is under rule now were you over when applying
churning,not_removed,good to know
churning,not_removed,wait youre over and your application went into pending or were you denied and then you called recon line and got approved whoa can you give a little more detail did you apply at the bank after being preapproved
churning,not_removed,ive spent so far this year though pretty spread out across barclays aviator silver citi aadvantage executive and cspfreedom im not sure how much of the nonchase spend the rep could see
churning,not_removed,great question id love to know if there was any real risk in saying yes or if the most they would do is approve the card without the limit increase
churning,not_removed,great question she didnt mention it and i didnt remember to ask
churning,not_removed,theres a contradiction in here somewhere
churning,not_removed,as long as your utilization is in the range excellent i dont think the difference between and is material plus if youre paying off your cards in full like most people in this community does it really matter
churning,not_removed,generally higher is better but as mentioned there is a maximum each issuer will extend to you and if you want to apply for a new card lowering a limit may be helpful to get instant approval
churning,not_removed,i was at when i applied the reports id seen until now are that the rc card is not under the rule did that change my wife was going to apply for the card too and shes also over
churning,not_removed,my application immediately went to days on the automated status line this means likely denial which the rep confirmed was a denial for i called and explained that i was no longer an au on some additional cards that put me at i had removed myself from my wifes cards before calling my card in was a chase marriott personal it wasnt on my credit report yet but i assumed i was screwed because its a chase card and surely they could see it in whatever system they check i now get the impression that they review the application and credit report only if i had waited a few more days i suspect i would have been declined because the marriott card would have hit the report by then
churning,not_removed,hard to know unfortunately
churning,not_removed,i think it was just improperly worded the example he gave with the and was just shittily structured grammatically the its better if you have was a reference to the following part of the sentence
churning,not_removed,the entire basis of credit scores is contradictory to have a good credit score you need to be in debt and paying on it regularly theres no benefit to avoiding debt altogether which one would think would demonstrate even greater fiscal discipline no small irony in this world
churning,not_removed,for fico scoring
churning,not_removed,thanks while not what i was hoping still a valuable data point that leads to confirm that they only check credit report
churning,not_removed,not really they want certainty and less risk if you have no debt you are an unknown
churning,not_removed,you dont need to carry a balance to receive a good credit score plenty of folks never carry a balance and have excellent scores number of accounts length of history utilization and not missing payments are all more important afaik
churning,not_removed,looks like you edited it i was referring to where you were saying having a higher credit line is a good thing and you previously had like if you have a credit line of but only use of it its better for your score if you have but only use of it which was the contradiction in your post
churning,not_removed,this is false
churning,not_removed,good to know
churning,not_removed,this is true however you are still technically going into debt from the time that you buy on credit to the time you pay off the bill i clear my credit debt on a monthly basis and never carry a balance but im still going into debt for the three or four weeks that each bill is active you should never carry a balance if you can avoid it i never have and my score has always been
churning,not_removed,not my post originally but if thats what it said then absolutely slipped up i still maintain that a score measuring how good you are at staying out of debt is determined by you going into debt is at least somewhat ironic and illogical although i understand why such is the case
churning,not_removed,i never edited that post
churning,not_removed,uh except not at all your credit score is determined on the basis of your management of credit allocated to youmanagement of your capacity to go into debt if you were to never open a credit card or take out a loan there would be no basis for assessing your creditworthiness you are incentivized to open credit in order to elevate a score which is based on your debt management if you manage debt well you get a high score paying off your debt before it matures to interest is one example of good debt managementand you can squabble all you want but technically from the moment you make a purchase on credit to the moment your credit card payment clears youre in debt even if its not accruing interest
churning,not_removed,its actually
churning,not_removed,i feel like this is a very strict definition of debt you are not accruing interest you are not receiving a penalty there is no cost to you for using the credit available to you i get why you say its debt since you have to pay it eventually but by that definition you go in debt every time you eat a meal at a restaurant that feeds you first and bills you at the end
churning,not_removed,yeah good point actually using the cards may factor into the score im not sure i agree on never paying interest credit cards are really expensive loans however i do carry a balance on interest free cards from time to time to smooth out my cash flow im selfemployed
churning,not_removed,credit is not the same as debt a good credit score can be acheived by demonstrating responsible use of credit using a credit card and paying it in full every month is no different than having electric service at your house and paying the bill after you receive the electricity but before the due date if you are late that demonstrates irresponsible use if you dont have service at all there is no history for them to see that shows if you are likely to pay your bill
churning,not_removed,i wouldnt go as far as saying its illogical it does impose the causality dilemma for the incompetent
churning,not_removed,incorrect
churning,not_removed,indeed but credit is the measure of how you handle debt whether you pay off in full every month or not you are still going into debt until you have paid that bill i have never carried a balance in my life but by buying on credit i am still accumulating and clearing debt on a monthly basis and this is how your score is formulatedi said i understood why it worked the way that it did obviously they need some metric to determine your creditworthiness just that it is ironic
churning,not_removed,lol you promote and downvote the correction quite the superhero you are or maybe you just dont know how to read a chart
churning,not_removed,i did a test payment and it went through perfectly fine for me a few months ago but i am more comfortable with plastiq here is why first off tio has a very limited selection of payees and you cannot add any to the list second even if your payee is listed by name they do not tell you the address the payment will be sent to this can be especially problematic if there are multiple po box address for the same vendor depending on the product you have through them if you wanted to pay a utility bill and you type in city of and it pulls up as your city who is to say that isnt for another city in another state with the same name
churning,not_removed,does toyota not accept plastiq i was about to go through plastiq for the first time to pay tfs tfs popped up as a known merchant
churning,not_removed,yea use it to pay honda financial services when meeting minimum spend on cards never had any issues
churning,not_removed,do it all the time bit high on the fees it averages around
churning,not_removed,just another dp for using tio without issue i got myself banned from plastiq and needed an alternative works great you just have to keep an eye on the fees
churning,not_removed,too gives you the option of paying your cc where plastiq usually doesnt allow payments towards your cc i use it when im unable to offload the card properly via money order
churning,not_removed,i use tiocom as a way to liquidate small denomination visa gift cards after youve done over with them they give you a loyalty discount platiq is still cheaper even with the loyalty discount but its nice to have alternatives
churning,not_removed,i use tio and they drop the fee once you make a certain number of payments i hope this doesnt kill it but you can use it to liquidate vgcmcgc as well by paying your bank with them
churning,not_removed,this is good to know i am using plastiq for rent payment and have been happy with it like they send an email when the payment is sent when the payee deposits the check etc
churning,not_removed,yeah not sure why i didnt think of that for some reason i kept thinking of plastiq as only for rentmortgagelike radpad was
churning,not_removed,can you give me details on what caused you to get banned lots of gc
churning,not_removed,they dont like it when you continuously refer yourself with new email addresses i am back in the system with a new emailcc that isnt connected to my others but the cards i used before are flagged i think if i try to use one of those the payment will post but then plastiq will cancelrefund the transaction i dont use the ffd system anymore and i use only my newest ccs so i can keep it alive for new minimum spend requirements etc
churning,not_removed,i didnt check the tos just after a few payments it decreased for me i dont know if it was a certain number of payments or the amount it certainly isnt the best method for liquidatiom but works alright when im in a crunch
churning,not_removed,cool thanks for the heads up i wad actually going to try referring myself this week glad you replied before i did
churning,not_removed,ameriprise platinum amex but realistically prestige and csr travel credits alone pay for the first year annual fee
churning,not_removed,the american express platinum card ameriprise version actually waives your annul fee for the first year its supposed to be for ameriprise clients but they do not check if you are a client it will get you into the centurion lounges and delta skyclub when flying delta
churning,not_removed,how on earth would the issuer make any money if they didnt collect an annual fee and they were simultaneously paying for lounge access
churning,not_removed,what said the lounges want their money and the cc isnt going to pay that for you
churning,not_removed,yes but questions like these belong in the daily discussion thread or the weekly newbie thread
churning,not_removed,try rcreditcards
churning,not_removed,does this ameriprise platinum remove ability to get bonus on normal platinum card
churning,not_removed,ill check it out thanks
churning,not_removed,very helpful and informative post
churning,not_removed,doesnt seem to i had the ameriprise before the personal and biz flavors of plat and i received the bonus for both
churning,not_removed,i was just approved for the card thanks to you i will be enjoying lounge access for free this year
churning,not_removed,i was going to give a list but if youre calling names i wont there are etiquette minimums on public forums
churning,not_removed,sorry missed the part that included waived for first year and thoguht it was cards without an annual fee ever
churning,not_removed,keep in mind there is also a thats better unless you value alaska miles at more than each
churning,not_removed,anyone know if it better to cancel an existing as card and then apply or lower the cl while keeping the card open and applying
churning,not_removed,in the era we find ourselves in not sure as miles are worth the hit even more so when you consider their no notice stealth devaluation at the end of march that was awful i just dont trust as anymore
churning,not_removed,is it still possible to get two of these at the same time using incognito and hitting submit seconds apart
churning,not_removed,does boa match offers like chase
churning,not_removed,if only bofa didnt hate me i need some more as miles too for a proposed hawaii trip next year
churning,not_removed,off topic i like the new card design over the old one outside of actual bonus card aesthetics do matter to me hahaespecially if theyre going to stay in my wallet for postbonus spending
churning,not_removed,too bad the business version is still
churning,not_removed,whats the use of alaska miles
churning,not_removed,what types of points can i transfer to alaska directly spg ur typ mr
churning,not_removed,this link doesnt work any longer is this offer completely dead i liked this offer more than the current offer
churning,not_removed,im wondering the same thing have a high utilization due to reimbursements taking a while so dont think canceling and applying is the best way of approaching this for me im thinking of applying for two cards and calling reconsideration if either one gets denied if so i will ask to move some credit around my existing cc
churning,not_removed,if youre pre sure its not worth the hit otherwise its not that dramatic as miles are useful in many ways building towards huge redemptions is always risky the is generally better so this doesnt really change much
churning,not_removed,it is and you dont need to submit seconds apart just do it the same day and the hp will combine sometimes the app will be seen as duplicate in which case you should call and explain that its your intention to apply for two and have a reason ready as well
churning,not_removed,some dp say yes give it a go and let us know
churning,not_removed,they seem to be very easy to achieve so getting enough for a nice flight should be pretty effortless
churning,not_removed,in this case only diners club spg transfer to alaska
churning,not_removed,spg is to when transferring in increments
churning,not_removed,that sucks let me see if i can find another link
churning,not_removed,guessing thats what happened with mine second application went into pending what was your reasoning for applying twice
churning,not_removed,great tip thank you
churning,not_removed,called twice no go
churning,not_removed,just tried via chat and the rep told me to contact alaska airlines not even going to bother
churning,not_removed,i just got denied for it after being approved for the mlb
churning,not_removed,doc to the rescue as usual with all the right info
churning,not_removed,yeah would be great ill apply directly if you can find a working link thanks
churning,not_removed,trying to keep expenses separated seems to work well for me
churning,not_removed,how many boa cards do you have and how old are they i got my first boa card in march and was denied the alaska card because i havent had my first boa card long enough
churning,not_removed,great thanks for the tip
churning,not_removed,only have boa card about years
churning,not_removed,why did they deny you
churning,not_removed,they did not say recon is closed i will call monday
churning,not_removed,im guessing you havent received the letter yet
churning,not_removed,probably call tuesday monday is a holiday
churning,not_removed,i remember my family always telling me to open a credit card but never gave me any good reasons so i saw no benefit over debit now i open so many and they think im going over board
churning,not_removed,my son adult and i were flying aa and that was not currently a priority card for me so i had my son sign up for one of the citi aa cards we got free bags priority boarding and he got some miles i had to help him a bit with meeting the spend but it was a good process plus he got to build his credit some more
churning,not_removed,my mother put me as an au when i was like or ended up killing my score she was never good at remembering to actually pay it not a case of not having the money just oh shit credit cards are due
churning,not_removed,you need to be to signup for a credit card
churning,not_removed,i will in years or so when its legal i havent yet been able to convince my parents to start churning stubborn old people
churning,not_removed,my dad put me on as an au on his very old amex account when i was my parents put everything on a cc and brought me up in the mentality that you werent getting anything out of using cash got my first own credit card at now and since then ive had probably cards im now basically in charge of my parents churning they meet the spend obviously and each of them have had cards in the last years i apply for the card and just tell them how much they need to spend i also put myself on as an au on their new cards so i can help meet the spend
churning,not_removed,no but ive gotten my parents involved
churning,not_removed,you have to be but ive gotten my little sister involved shes though and its going towards financing my graduation present to her
churning,not_removed,in years when i have kids currently if churning is still around lol
churning,not_removed,i thought the age was all this time i have a year old so i can add the all as au to my citi chase or capital one cards would that benefit them when they are and want to get into this which issuer would be best all or chase or
churning,not_removed,i dont have kids but ive gotten my parents into moderate churning theyre taking a free trip to hawaii this year and a free trip to greece next year in j
churning,not_removed,ive used my dogs as au before dont want to mess up my kids
churning,not_removed,dont have kids of qualifying age yet but i definitely use my parents
churning,not_removed,signing up someone that isnt you for a credit card is fraud
churning,not_removed,i tried to get my family into it but they are pretty resistant they say its too complicated and too much to remember they also do not like those af even though i told them its worth it at the end i just do my own thing now and reek in the awards solo
churning,not_removed,thats one of the reasons i dont tell people how many credit cards i have i currently have credit cards and thats not considered high in this subreddit im gonna get the chase freedom within the next month to make it credit cards the thing is people outside of here would think im crazy if i tell them i have or credit cards even though my credit score is high dont rack up debt and im pretty good at saving money each month my total available credit limit is currently at which really helps with credit utilization i know people with less credit cards than i do who make dumb financial decisions blowing money on stupid shit
churning,not_removed,my friends originally thought this too until they see me taking trips that i wouldnt normally be able to afford most just do the freedomcsp combo but there are a handful with cards
churning,not_removed,if you are or were an au just have it removed from your reports
churning,not_removed,im hoping they mean convincing their adult children otherwise yeah its identity fraud to sign up under someone elses namess i remember reading a thread here like months to a year ago about people signing up under their kids ss though seems the banks dont even really check birthdays but not worth it
churning,not_removed,who said the kids werent
churning,not_removed,are parents allowed to put an au that is under on the card i remember being and having a cc
churning,not_removed,is that universally true
churning,not_removed,granted its been over years but i distinctly remember getting a cc in my own name with mom cosigning when i was not allowed anymore or was this actually an au im sure it wasnt
churning,not_removed,yeahi would have opened up some new accounts otherwise im tempted to look into opening some checkingsavings accounts for the signup bonuses though
churning,not_removed,just say that youll handle the travel plans and perhaps use an example that youve booked for yourself its worked for my parents who are the type of people who only use card irrespective of bonus categories gotten them in value or so by booking trips for them and my sister
churning,not_removed,help meet the spend how generous of you to spend their money
churning,not_removed,it isnt fraud if you have their permission my father for instance handles all of my parents finances and has used my moms info to sign her upnothing wrong there
churning,not_removed,a child can sign themselves up
churning,not_removed,over drinks last weekend friend i am thinking of applying for a chase freedom as my card it gives cashback friend i already have that but the chase banker told me i am prequalified for a csp might apply for that me to friend why freedom and discover friend i want to optimize bonus categories how many cards do you have now i know you had when we graduated last year me friend what friend so did you evolve your magikarp on pokemon go
churning,not_removed,yeah im careful of who i tell for fear of them thinking im nuts on the plus side my mom has basically learned to run all of her cc decisions past me and when a really good offer comes up ill refer her if its a card i already have
churning,not_removed,my husband and i started dating after we clicked in our first real conversation over credit cards i had just over and he had almost we werent even heavy churners at that time we just went after no af cards with sign up bonuses
churning,not_removed,yeah when i turned like or so i asked her to have them remove me went from low to almost instantly once off it no longer shows on my report shes now rebuilding her credit and the unions and banks seem really willing to work to help fix it
churning,not_removed,depends on issuer
churning,not_removed,it may depend on the issuer i started adding my younger brother as an au when he was to help him build a small credit record for when he himself started applying and all of them accepted that i think since the au is not liable for the charges it doesnt matter as much who they are
churning,not_removed,ive been an au on a target redcard visa since i was born in
churning,not_removed,technically its
churning,not_removed,as far as i know this is true to sign up on your own i was interested in credit cards before i was but i never found a bank that accepted applications as suchonly debitlike products like the buxx cards that still required a parent involved
churning,not_removed,yes see credit card act of
churning,not_removed,probably au
churning,not_removed,it was either or to get a card a decade ago i remember that was a big thing senior year of high school
churning,not_removed,for children less than
churning,not_removed,dad i bought myself a new tv with your card you should be good on minimum spend now
churning,not_removed,haha yeah im a saint nah just like if im buying groceries or gas and stuff as i still live at home
churning,not_removed,not legally unless they are so if you want to have your yo sign up by all means convince them but dont sign up for them
churning,not_removed,the freedomdiscover combo is a great combo for people who arent into this game
churning,not_removed,thats awesome i applied for the chase freedom because i always wanted it to rack up ur points to eventually use with the csr or csp when im traveling more i actually got approved despite technically my american express blue cash everyday card i recently got being my account in months because it didnt show up yet on my credit reports i just had to call recon to confirm some information because i moved recently cant wait to receive it it should be coming next week or the week after i got approved for the freedom card on wednesday i only have credit cards right now all of them have no annual fee
churning,not_removed,thats great hopefully she gets back up there too
churning,not_removed,how many of the issuers are asking for the age
churning,not_removed,no its not it depends on the issuer chase capital one and citi all have no minimum age requirement barclaycard is and amex is httpswwwnerdwalletcomblogcreditcardscreditcardissuerscosigner
churning,not_removed,my mom signed me up for my first credit card on my behalf although i was over at the time and she of course had my permission
churning,not_removed,the real challenge is getting them to use the correct card me dad dont use your amazon card your freedom is offering back on restaurants this quarter dad but i like to get amazon points so i can treat myself to stuff me but you can use the points from the freedom to get cash backits the same thing dad butamazon points this is a man who ran a research organization and had employees and he looks at me like i have heads when i tell him to use a different credit card
churning,not_removed,i have the discover card my first credit card and got approved yesterday for the chase freedom
churning,not_removed,do freedom and discover offer different categories
churning,not_removed,for the average person no af fee cards are the way to go no need to watch out for canceling before the year is up plus you just keep the cards open and strengthen your average age as you keep going
churning,not_removed,i think amex does chase does not
churning,not_removed,each card offers different categories each quarter sometimes the percent categories for discover and the chase freedom overlap and sometimes theyre completely different right now theyre different home improvement and amazon vs restaurants and warehouse clubs such as costco
churning,not_removed,another thing is if you keep opening and keeping no annual fee cards its a way to increase your available credit which decreases your credit utilization if you are spending the same amount i currently have cards with i think a combined credit line of
churning,not_removed,amex wouldnt allow me to add an au until age i added my year old son as an au on the citi doublecash card no problem
churning,not_removed,hmm thanks for info im in the process of targeting chase stuff but in general are amex cards points considered equal to ur im wondering if amex categories for instance are better than csrs dining for instance
churning,not_removed,yep mine is currently a ridiculous amount almost three times as much as my income it helps my score tremendously
churning,not_removed,i think in general theyre not considered as valuable but it depends on your specific situation the cities near me are hubs for southwest and united so i find ur points great for those airlines and havent even looked into amex yet but if your airport is a delta hub you might find amex points especially useful
churning,not_removed,a question for the weekly thread
churning,not_removed,discover will for sure not sure about citi
churning,not_removed,thanks for the help
churning,not_removed,this belongs in the newbie thread there are lots of dps saying you need to buy gift cards with delta for it to be properly credited
churning,not_removed,newbie question weekly it works similarly to the amex platinum so check out that megathread as well
churning,not_removed,aight moving it to the noob thread thanks
churning,not_removed,from a churning perspective this sucks but to anyone staying in hyatts all the time this is legit the top end perks are generally better hyatt hotels still offer some of the best value out there as well its obvious hyatt isnt going after the churning crowd thats not necessarily a bad thing it just sucks for us us churners dont make these companies money its obvious hyatt is going for the business crowd something i always felt their brand catered too the most anyway
churning,not_removed,this also means losing the automatic gold m life tier if you had the chase card
churning,not_removed,since the membership is going to be downgraded chase should lower the annual fee of hyatt card probably like ihg card
churning,not_removed,i would be okay with everything if they just kept the status match of hyatt to mlife as gold i figured that would change once the mlife mc was released and only gave you mlife pearl which is quite useless i wish there were a hyatt cc with a larger annual fee that gave you explorer hyatt and mlife gold but i know that my situation is unique as they are going for business travelers and not leisure travelers who like to gamble
churning,not_removed,someones gonna get fired for this of success is a catchy marketing and good name world of is more of warcraft and does hyatt really want to have such connotation why not just world passport also tier names seriously where did they came from some freshcollegegrad whos first task was to come up with weird titles i predict its going to be an epic fail
churning,not_removed,there use to be a way to book meetings super cheap to get status like a courtyard out in the boonies for a few hours at a time
churning,not_removed,for churners the chase hyatt card has also been devalued the new discoverist tier is a stripped down platinum and spend is now to earn elite qualifying nights unless youre able to consistently create value from the annual category award night there is little reason to keep this card beyond the sign up bonus of free nights
churning,not_removed,i see resort fees are waived for award nights which is nice
churning,not_removed,staying nights at hyatt regency in maui starting feb on two free nights award nights hopefully resort fees are waived on the first two nights before the changes take effect
churning,not_removed,i love hyatt properties i just wish there were more of them such a small footprint the bulk of my travel is for work so footprint is pretty important
churning,not_removed,it looks like youll still get automatic pearl m life status
churning,not_removed,the names are ridiculous but i think youre taking it a bit too seriously most people couldnt care less about the name of the programperks are good
churning,not_removed,i agree you can tell the execs wanted a fresh appeal to it theyre targeting this to millennials so it makes sense they go with cheesy instead of classy
churning,not_removed,cant wait for someone to figure out how to book twenty oneminute meetings at some cat but we better jump on it since meeting based qualification will disappear the next day
churning,not_removed,i couldnt disagree more there is little to no change to the card the only thing cardmembers are losing is point bonus instead of which doesnt take effect until and no more hour guaranteed availability which was never useful anyways the guaranteed availability rack rates were huge ripoffs it keeps the most useful perks being room upgrades and checkout and the annual free night is still a great deal for and now we get daily bottled water i dont think this change is hurting churners its hurting diamonds who stay at hyatt often who might not get top tier status anymore strange how a hotel with such a small footprint wants to hurt the people who stay there often
churning,not_removed,yeah no point in keeping the card since i can just ms tons of ur points transferred to hyatt points for much cheaper than and will meet requirement for discoverist already with nights in maui and in amritsar india next spring
churning,not_removed,so is there a point to applying for the card now i was looking for the two nights mainly but hoping that they dont expire within the first year of card ownership
churning,not_removed,this has always been the case
churning,not_removed,award night nights redeemed with points right
churning,not_removed,it was automod
churning,not_removed,no change to award nights as far as i can tell
churning,not_removed,award stays already get hotel fees waived
churning,not_removed,how did you get award nights i get the two free nights from the card signup but the other two
churning,not_removed,ihgs free night is far better than hyatt and it costs hyatt
churning,not_removed,ihg gets a free night too and its unrestricted
churning,not_removed,the propertys in india come to mind
churning,not_removed,upgrades are more limited though in that you can only be upgraded within the tier you book in ie if youre at an oceanfront property but book a nonoceanview room you wont be upgraded to oceanview just a larger or corner noview
churning,not_removed,they dropped the m life tier you get for holding the card from the rather good gold to the rather worthless pearl
churning,not_removed,also lose mlife gold down to pearl
churning,not_removed,i dont think this change is hurting churners as long as the ur transfers hold and the redemptions arent devalued its not the end of the world for your average churner other than spg the other programs had poor redemptions or limited availability so if youre a leisure traveler like me this isnt the end of the world especially since most of us would never qualify for the higher tiers with our employer subsidizing it
churning,not_removed,you are also losing premium internet for free that made a huge difference for me since theres a big speed difference between the free internet everybody can get and the fast internet you have to pay for
churning,not_removed,the two free nights sign up bonus has always expired one year after the nights are credited this hasnt changed so i would just sign up for the card when you have definite plans for a redemption
churning,not_removed,they are the same thing
churning,not_removed,gotcha
churning,not_removed,use the card and rack up points to redeem for additional nights is my guess
churning,not_removed,why choose just one
churning,not_removed,a night doesnt count towards status if you dont show up for it would meetings be subject to the same policy
churning,not_removed,premium internet is included for discoverists
churning,not_removed,gotcha i dont have definitely travel plans just yet so ill hold off applying worst case is i only get the two free nights vs any other bonuses down the road but id rather not apply now and have them expire if i cant get out of the country any time soon
churning,not_removed,do they need to be used by the expiration date or just booked by the expiration date
churning,not_removed,i have both just that the ihg card is a better deal now
churning,not_removed,you are correct i have no idea whose chart i saw that had discoverist getting standard thanks
churning,not_removed,they need to be used by expiration date
churning,not_removed,ihg card has always been a better deal
churning,not_removed,if you consider that you can only get the bonus once every years so you keep the card year and pay the annual fee once the hyatt was better mlife gold bonus points spend and credit gets you free nights and anniversary night at vs points for spend and anniversary night at any ihg for now the af isnt waived first year no mlife gold lower point bonus so i think the ihg is now better
churning,not_removed,i just do citi double cash mixed with chase freedom and discover it
churning,not_removed,make sure your maxing the amex blue cash grocery bonus annually i buy a vgc every month so i hit the limit dont want to pass up that percent
churning,not_removed,if youre only interested in cash back i would use the citi double cash instead of the thank you card for dining and entertainment thank you points can be worth more than cent per point but only if you redeem for travel theyre not terribly easy to cash out otherwise only via mortgage checks or gift cards which are not cash equivalents if you want to get cash back multipliers on other categories look at the us bank cash visa andor the huntington voice card those could help you cover other categories
churning,not_removed,removed for card recommendations ask in moronic monday or what card wednesday
churning,not_removed,amex plat the for transactions is solid the point refund on travel is amazing the hotel and rental statuses make travel more comfortable if employees dont get points the primary cardholder earns so many that they will never pay for a flight again fly only in biz or f and earn big airline status from those full fares employees can get no af green cards under the primary platinum
churning,not_removed,well since i live in a delta hub id go with amex plat so i could get the centurion card
churning,not_removed,at that level of spend amex has corporate cards with tailored reward structures not sure if theyre better than a normal biz plat
churning,not_removed,that spark biz cash card or spg biz to me those are the best two options one for straight cash one for transferrable travel points
churning,not_removed,if you have to use a single card the best answer is probably the card that has bonus rewards for your biggest spending categorys
churning,not_removed,if you commented before me you are shadow banned
churning,not_removed,there are online calculators that will do the math for you and tell you the best combo for points earning based on your actual expenses i would just follow that recommendation this is one example httpwwwcreditcardtuneupcom
churning,not_removed,the employees of op s business are not going to be very happy with your advice
churning,not_removed,no asking for a friend and hopefully for my future business
churning,not_removed,really care to share im on here way more than i care to admit and have never seen that
churning,not_removed,fair comment if an employee asks why they dont get points just show them your amex app with due in days and remind them you are personally on the hook for that bill all aus are on your ssn what is the ethical thing to do
churning,not_removed,at that level of spend and in a presidentceo role status becomes a significant factor over pure cpp ratio its not just math
churning,not_removed,i know this thread was deleted but this is the site i was talking about httpwwwcreditcardtuneupcom
churning,not_removed,true that in that case would it be financially better to get a card which offers a longer time to pay the bill the difference between days and days could be huge in terms of interest
churning,not_removed,well in case this thread can still be found via search i put into the disney vacation fund thing on dec on my statement it shows the charge and the travel credit both being applied on the so it looks like im in the clear
churning,not_removed,· by repeatedly opening or otherwise maintaining credit card accounts for the purpose of generating rewards that language has appeared in agreements for a long while now
churning,not_removed,its funny they have the balls to send me that for their ihg card and not the ink
churning,not_removed,got the same update to my southwest plus card
churning,not_removed,so has this always been there i dont want to believe this is a harbinger of doom
churning,not_removed,havent seen it for mine coming up on anniversary id decided to keep it for another year but i wonder if i oughta killrenew in may when the anniversary hits
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,this isnt new
churning,not_removed,i got it too on one of my sw cards it links to an agreement dated at the top so if they are telling me about updates they are about months late
churning,not_removed,chase apparently had similar language on their partner transfer page in see step
churning,not_removed,got it today for my uae the day after i closed it
churning,not_removed,didnt get this on my ihg but did on my hyatt im guessing all cobrands mustve gotten it based on these dps
churning,not_removed,how is maintaining credit card accounts for the purpose of generating rewards misuse this is the entire reason for having rewards cards instead of using a different card or cash to generate rewards for that program
churning,not_removed,this is the standard language used in ur program agreement too
churning,not_removed,this has always been there iirc
churning,not_removed,that language has appeared in agreements for a long while now true in fact that exact language has appeared in all chase cards tcs for a long while now nothing new
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,an annual free night in an intercontinental property is pretty much a nobrainer for that af
churning,not_removed,when is your anniversary date they cant change terms within the first year so if youre coming up on it theyre just letting you know youre next years terms will be different
churning,not_removed,i agree theyre pretty giving themselves any reason to take your points
churning,not_removed,whats weird is the terms to which they linked were in effect when i was approved last year so nothing has changed
churning,not_removed,suggest checking the date before posting
churning,not_removed,this is the wrong one check the other thread
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,i have made a trip somewhere just because a pointbreak was available it was within driving distance and it made for a fun quick weekend getaway they can also be good as stopping points on longer roadtrips as some of them are in the middle of nowhere if you have a companion pass it can be a great combo but ya most of them are only points for a reason
churning,not_removed,i used them once just took a short weekend trip to a place a few hours away it was not a destination hotel or anything i just brought the dog and went to a few new parks a fun weekend for only points
churning,not_removed,does anybody know if these go live on
churning,not_removed,daily thread
churning,not_removed,how does auto mod let stuff like this through
churning,not_removed,only bank bonuses that a i get a for
churning,not_removed,not all the time though banks need to issue you a for bank signup bonuses over on the other hand referral bonuses or other miscellaneous income you receive from a bank or other institution only warrant a if the income exceeds you still have to include any amount of income legally required to be reported on your tax return even if the bank is not legally obligated to issue you a
churning,not_removed,i saw this on the chinese forum moonbbscom it looks like someones prequalify offer online
churning,not_removed,i got rid of my biz platinum and shortly after that they targeted me for both the biz platinum and biz gold i got the points for both very strange but ill take it whats interesting is both offers appeared only when i pulled up my personal gold card online my husband didnt have any of these offers and now i wonder if its because he had just closed the prg
churning,not_removed,anyway to get a link for the offer
churning,not_removed,i just want to point our it isnt the brg its the bgr business gold rewards
churning,not_removed,i believe it is targeted i was just approved last friday and got the card yesterday
churning,not_removed,ive been waiting for this offer for a while now hopefully one day
churning,not_removed,where do you normally find the no bonus if previous language
churning,not_removed,just got a brg was somehow targeted again for this offer despite already having the card i cancelled it and applied immediately after and instantly approved pretty bizarre but ill take it
churning,not_removed,two weeks ago downgraded my bgr to biz green then decided i didnt want that either once i understood it didnt show on my credit report anyway and closed it i also cancelled my dormant personal gold not prg and pcd my old blue to an everyday to keep the mr points saw this on doc today and used its link applied went pending called recon approved i dont understand but im not complaining and i still have an unclaimed prg and plat bonus ive never had either im new at this for when the right offer comes along
churning,not_removed,wish i could get a keep getting
churning,not_removed,i had the same exact offer but thought to delay it from applying for few weeks now when i login i dont see that offer any more do you know exactly where to find them again it used to be at the very top after logging but none shows up now
churning,not_removed,would love to have as well
churning,not_removed,youll log in and it will let error out if you werent targeted
churning,not_removed,ive been waiting for this offer for months and havent been targeted for it and cant find it on incognito crossing my fingers for it to go public soon because i could use the especially on an account that doesnt show up on the credit report
churning,not_removed,targeted these arent open offers start a small business and wait for the mailer
churning,not_removed,sorry ill fix it
churning,not_removed,if so then im surprised theyd target me with just having gotten rid of the card
churning,not_removed,have you checked recently i have been trying for months and i finally got it today
churning,not_removed,link on doc works for me so tempted to go for another
churning,not_removed,httpiimgurcombxmdncxpng where the refer a friend bit is
churning,not_removed,i have an rsvp code i can pm you from what i recall those can be shared im currently traveling but its at my office and if you pm me on tuesday ill happily send it over to you
churning,not_removed,i was in the same boat you were trying for months and it suddenly worked today i was auto approved even after applying for a delta gold days ago try giving it s shot
churning,not_removed,id surprised too if i was in your shoes a friend of mine received prg mailer one week after he cancelled the card without lifetime restriction he was approved and received the bonus as well i guess amex has its own special way of user acquisition
churning,not_removed,i upgraded my gold to a platinum for a bonus and then i got a targeted mailer for a new gold card a week later with no lifetime language and a bonus thanks amex
churning,not_removed,yeah unfortunately checked yesterday oh well i have minimum spend on other cards to hit
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,that would be fantastic thanks so much ill shoot you a pm next week when youre back and hopefully it works out
churning,not_removed,would you mind if i tried your code as well
churning,not_removed,i have a family members mailer for the but for their business and was wondering if i could use their reservation code for my business have you yet figured out if they can be shared
churning,not_removed,damn no luck still just says were sorry our systems are currently down nice that you got it though
churning,not_removed,its weird how tight they are with once in a lifetime then so generous on biz cards not that im complaining
churning,not_removed,sure i also think i have a business plat spend if you are interested
churning,not_removed,yes they can be shared just call in and use the rsvp code dont mention that it was for another business
churning,not_removed,definitely when does it expire and thank you
churning,not_removed,why is calling recommended over an online application
churning,not_removed,im not sure it is i called when my friend used my code to be safe but im sure it would have worked just as well online i dont think its attached to any namessnein
churning,not_removed,i would caution against adding anyone who may be interested in applying for chase cards in the future or getting under amex authorized users are a pain in the ass to remove from credit reports and they will typically request a ssn so the usual trickery will not work
churning,not_removed,interesting i assume a link will become available at some stage hit me up if anybody finds it
churning,not_removed,just got offered this on live chat just asked for it outright no ssn needed to finish the request
churning,not_removed,my au is a dog
churning,not_removed,didnt get targeted for hilton but i used the chat and asked about the prg and got it
churning,not_removed,interesting offer
churning,not_removed,can confirm ive also received this offer via live chat
churning,not_removed,did you have to pay the fee for adding au
churning,not_removed,called had the offer when i asked what happens if the person no longer wants to be an authorized user she said they just have to call and say they want to cancel their card and that should take care of the credit report seems fishy compared to all the complaints on here
churning,not_removed,asked outright for offer over chat and got it no ssn required for au terms mention that spending on any au card will count
churning,not_removed,i online chatted about the offer it is not available for my account yet they did say they were rolling it out for more people soon so check again later if you dont have it now my account is quite new it was just opened this month
churning,not_removed,got the offer from live chat i had an au but cancelled about month ago csr added the account without requiring ssn
churning,not_removed,dp got the offer over live chat asked if the birthday needed to be right and even then the agent said it didnt matter also had a sky miles for spend on my gold delta card available so i figured why not and did that one too
churning,not_removed,saw some dps yesterday about successfully adding oneself as an au to amex accountswondering if that would qualify for this
churning,not_removed,chatted and wasnt offered the but i was preapproved for adding an au lol my account is less than a month old
churning,not_removed,with chase its okay if my dog got a card i imagine the same would be true with amex since they also dont ask for ssn of the au
churning,not_removed,i love this sub got this plus dl miles in min thank you op
churning,not_removed,just got this offer via chat was able to added without ssn
churning,not_removed,in addition you can ask if you are eligible for the following offers for adding au cash everyday after or spending in month everyday mr after spending in month delta gold miles after xxx i didnt register for this so i forgot the spending requirements in month
churning,not_removed,tried this twice today both times the chat rep told me he couldnt do anything and i had to call a number on the phone didnt try calling yet i find it much easier to beg for promotions in written form than on the phone
churning,not_removed,was there a similar offer for biz plat
churning,not_removed,was just told in chat that no such offer was available for me do people getting this offer and those asking for it do you currently have au on the prg
churning,not_removed,i received the offer via live chat a representative explicitly told me that if i dont know ssn i dont have to put it in the form what worked for me for aus on business cards previously is during the process of activation on phone just hang up when the robot is asking for ssn the card is activated at that points and works well
churning,not_removed,you beat me too it
churning,not_removed,i thought it doesnt matter because you can point out in recon that its only au accounts
churning,not_removed,huh i didnt experience the pita experience that you described at all a few weeks ago i removed two amex two citi and two chase aus from my reps at all three bureaus all at once and all three disputes were complete within a week even though they all officially said to expect a processing time i dont see why the bureaus would treat accounts issued by different banks differently anyway tu really surprised me by completing the request in two days not that tu gets pulled much anyway
churning,not_removed,mine is my cat im gonna try pulling his credit some day
churning,not_removed,did you just flat out ask or was there another reason why you started the chat
churning,not_removed,i was told that any aus that are already added will count towards the spend not just the one that i added in the chat
churning,not_removed,worked for a past offer but you get a brand new account added to your credit reports so most likely not worth it
churning,not_removed,same so absurd
churning,not_removed,its technically fraud but they have no way to enforce it ive been using my nickname as an au for all but one of my chase cards over the past years quite a few people in this sub have been using pets parents nicknames etc to qualify for the au bonus amex requires ssn for authorized users
churning,not_removed,how dl miles
churning,not_removed,same here
churning,not_removed,and interesting twist received today the same offer by email
churning,not_removed,interesting thanks for the dp
churning,not_removed,added my fiancée who is singaporean and not a us citizenresident and has no ssn its been a year and ive not had any calls or emails so far
churning,not_removed,ive added au on my platinum card with out ssn however i do get letters from amex stating that my authorize users are missing information
churning,not_removed,having to file disputes with three bureaus is a hassle though so relatively pita to remove a chase au all you need to send is a secure message
churning,not_removed,for something else and was offered this before ending the chat
churning,not_removed,i started the chat by asking for the bonus and im currently in the process of verifying id to receive it
churning,not_removed,oh lol didnt realize it was one of the retention offers i got when i called in today never bothered to double check
churning,not_removed,you can always remove any or all au accounts from your credit reports at any time no questions asked cb dispute processes are surprisingly fast if your dispute cart consists of only simple items like the i am no longer liable for this account reason which you would select to remove au accounts from your report
churning,not_removed,no it does not read the posts use online chat to get around the ssn
churning,not_removed,spending offer on dl gold card miles for adding auth user and they do spend
churning,not_removed,i guess its all relative then because neither method is a pita to me and id rather spend minutes filing the three disputes and having them processed within a week ymmv i guess maybe i got lucky instead of spending minutes sending a sm and waiting weeks before the au disappears from my reports probably slower because there is an additional layer of communication that has to happen of course its no contest if you wanted to remove six aus from different banks all at once like i did but yeah thats probably not relevant to this thread also youll have to go through the cb method if you want to continue using the au card while not having it show up on your credit report that can be useful in many situations edit if youre fast you can probably file all three disputes in under minutes if its just for one au account
churning,not_removed,to clarify you would have to close your au card first am i right otherwise after the dispute the cc company will just add it to your report again
churning,not_removed,hmm the only time ive ever done this was when i removed all six of my au accounts including two amex aus from all three cb reports about a month ago while none of the au accounts were closed im still using them now in fact never communicated with any cc issuer at all just checked my full tu and ex today full request not through ck or similar and they are still nowhere to be found on my reports so in lieu of other dps from my personal experience it would appear that even open au accs wont get readded after the dispute at least not in the shortterm if at some point in the future the au acc does get readded i guess one would just have to bite the bullet and contact the cc issuer directly to close the au acc i would think that this behavior is only reasonable anyway especially in light of the fcra language the reasoning being you are not financially liable for any cc debt incurred on au accounts in addition aus are not recipients of the credit that was extended to the primary cardholder by the cc issuer therefore you have the right to remove the influence of au accounts from your credit reports
churning,not_removed,well heres hoping i get lucky removing myself as my au by claiming im not responsible thanks a lot for the advice jay
churning,not_removed,well yeah if the bureau looks closely your request might seem a little strange but it is an au account after all and it is a standard procedure so i dont think you would have any problems with it

churning,not_removed,consider getting an everyday noaf card to keep your mr alive before cancelling prg there is a public incognitovpn offer that you can try to get your hands on next best is the offer
churning,not_removed,this would be a good question for the weekly moronic monday thread
churning,not_removed,yes amex everyday lets you collect and transfer mr youll keep whatever mr you have as long as you still have one mr earning card open
churning,not_removed,just want to thank the putnam county police department and my lead foot for finishing up my amex platinum minimum spend
churning,not_removed,how can i get chase to stop sending me balance transfer blank checks
churning,not_removed,for crossover rewards do i receive starpoints when i fly with delta if im a starwood preferred plus credit card member online it mentions starwood gold and platinum get them but there are some hidden benefits of being preferred plus since there isnt really any published info about that status on the starwood website
churning,not_removed,im curious how the free night certs work for hyatt and fairmont the certs have an expiration date does that mean that i have to actually stay in a hotel by that date or does it mean that i have to use the cert to book a free night by that date which could conceivably be a lot later if the latter what happens to the cert if i have to cancel the night and the cert would otherwise be expired im sure that the answers to these questions are different for each program so please specify in your answer
churning,not_removed,i am in currently in a situation where i have little to no time to travel however in years i will have a lot of flexibility to travel given the rule should i start churning now even though i wont be able to use any points for the next few years any card recommendations i have the chase freedom and discover it chrome yes im a newbie
churning,not_removed,anyone else still not able to purchase via mpx with their amex plat been over weeks and it tells me transaction declined spoke to amex and they dont see anything on their end
churning,not_removed,has the bonus for the citi aa platinum card disappeared edit found it its on the flyertalk thread for the card but not in the current offers spreadsheet
churning,not_removed,how do you put your home airport code next to your user name
churning,not_removed,is it possible to set my amex airline reimbursement different for a prg and a plat or do they both have to be set on the same airline

churning,not_removed,hi guys just started here i am looking at a hawaii vacation sometime in the next year and want to get the flight paid for with card bonuses i have also heard the sw companion pass mentioned here and was interested in that i was wondering about the best route to take for getting cards i am going on a cruise coming up with the bill being so i have some room to work with for meeting reward signups i was approved for a csp just a few minutes ago so that leaves to spend on for meeting the bonus for another card plus whatever else i normally spend new to all this with a credit score of any suggestions on card applications i did read however i was trying to get a way over there that wouldnt require staying somewhere for a couple days my work isnt as lenient as i would prefer with vacation time
churning,not_removed,i probably know the answer to this one but just wanted to make sure so im a costco member but i never got the costco amex i joined middle of last year when it was already known that amex is on the way out so i never bothered to apply when the new citi visa becomes available im planning on applying im still under though i assume the best course of action would be to wait till ive maxed out before getting the costco citi
churning,not_removed,do the ihgmarriotthyatt annual passes after paying af have expiration dates or can you accumulate before redeeming
churning,not_removed,i have a quick question ive gotten three cards in the last sixteen months only cards i have however theyre split between two different credit reports tu and eq so does my number just apply to the credit bureaus that chase checks ive been thinking im at and can only squeeze in more cards but if the cards i have are on separate credit reports would that mean my counter with chase may actually only be at or maybe depending on which one or two of the three reports chase checks i only ask because i had been thinking i would only be able to get a couple of chase cards apart from possibly some cobranded cards before going over but am now wondering if ive been misunderstanding my chase number and can actually get maybe more strictly chase cards before im over

churning,not_removed,when does amex mr bonus post i read it should be really quick after you met the requirement my last transaction that pushed me over the minimum spend posted on may according to amex website i have mr points pending i know the points from spend may take awhile but shouldnt the bonus post already
churning,not_removed,how likely is amex to throw a fit at a lot of gc purchases for a few days if it is for legitimate expenses my wife signed up for a bcp last month and we are buying a new fridge and freezer from lowes next week we already met the minimum spend on the bcp but want to use giftcards to make a dent in our grocery store category the problem is every grocery store in the area just instituted a limit of for credit card purchases of giftcards i need about so is amex going to get pissed at a bunch of purchases for a couple days
churning,not_removed,does anyone have experience using an amex referral and then matching to a higher offer i want to refer my friend to platinum but my offer is only he doesnt have any amex cards and can probably get targeted for the do you think its possible to screen shot the use my link then ask for the later using the screenshot
churning,not_removed,to people who opened the nrl fcu bank account just for the credit card funding how long did it take between the charge posting on your cc and the account actually showing funding my funding charge posted on my csp on but my nrl checking account still says i talked to them about it and all they said was they are backed up just wondering if other peoples are taking a long time also
churning,not_removed,truly moronic question here can you get a duplicate amex card reason being my husband is happy to support my churning habit and uses the cards i give him but does not want to have the cards in his name or be an au i hate losing out on points if we are both making category purchases in a day ps top notch security out there btw with him using my cards in multiple stateslocations for months now and he has never been questioned
churning,not_removed,my annual fee for my arrival is due in august and i just received an offer for bonus miles if i spend each month in june july and august has anyone else received this is this instead of waiving the annual fee since the points wont post until after the fee is due
churning,not_removed,do you guys double up on any of the plat benefits when having amex plat card besides amazon reimbursement i have both the mb plat and regular plat but im not sure if theres any point in priority passes it doesnt seem like you can bring a guest in cant think of the other benefits off the top of my head right now but are there any you guys definitely double up or definitely skip doubling up on
churning,not_removed,i got a targeted offer for a citigold checking account for typ looks like i wont be able to transfer them over to an airline with a premier whats the best way to redeem these points
churning,not_removed,just tried to apply for the ink which is my card in months according the chases check of equifax i have a couple new amex cards that have yet to post any data points in reconning to try and get around
churning,not_removed,do serve cards reset right at midnight on the first of every month i want to attempt to hit up kate right at midnight as i hate going to walmart as it is
churning,not_removed,thinking of redeeming typ for best buy gift cards to get a new digital camera i currently have ur mr spg aa and united to redeem for flights so i have other options for any future flights but i guess im just hesitant on blowing typ for gift cards and especially because i have a prestige so i can make those miles stretch even further am i losing any flexibility in using all of my typ that cant be overcome with my other points
churning,not_removed,sorry for the newb question here i have never really tried to obtain status with any hotel brand due to my infrequent business travel about trips per month and nights annually but after receiving the diamond status match with hyatt and falling in love with it i have decided try to keep it my question i have a night trip coming up if i check into one hyatt on the first night another one on the second and then back to the first one for the third night would this count as stays
churning,not_removed,ive seen it mentioned that some hotel points can be shared between different people for a fee im trying to find a blog post or someone who knows the specifics what im trying to figure out is if i can combine my marriott points with a non spouse to get one of their nights and flights packages any help is greatly appreciated
churning,not_removed,im trying to use some of the ba avios i have i want to travel to either dubai or australia using them ive looked online but i havent seen a definitive way to do it can it be done
churning,not_removed,just got my chase sw premier and plus cards and wondering if i can benefit from the free balance transfers for first days but i know nothing about balance transfers is this transferring balances from other cards to this new sw premier or the other way around i can earn point per transferred i also have chase freedom balance and sapphire balance currently just finished this sign up bonus and waiting to get my statement can i use this balance transfer promo to my advantage or am i missing something big
churning,not_removed,what credit cards can you close via sm
churning,not_removed,if you have been targeted for united mpe did you receive a letter in your mailbox with just a url to go to or did you also receive a code that should be entered somewhere too im just curious about how to distinguish between targeted and invitation for those offers
churning,not_removed,i am looking for a site i recently used that allowed you to enter two airportscities then displayed a simple chart showing the cost in milespoints with each program in three tiers of redemptions i see other links but cant find this easy one for the life of me ive been searching my history and this sub for a half hour now very frustrated lol
churning,not_removed,is there any way to check what inquiries are on your experian report ck provides me eq tu i signed up for creditcom and it shows i have experian inquiries but it doesnt show me what they are specifically
churning,not_removed,boa alaska question i just signed up for the for af i feel like a chump just did a chat and they wont give me a better deal i have not activated the card yet whats my next move
churning,not_removed,need to book a night at holiday inn wife and i both have in our accounts the room is here are my options what makes the most sense do pointscash points pay to transfer points between accounts transfer ur to ihg
churning,not_removed,ive had an arrival since the end of my only other older card is an amex blue sky i believe from earlier in i had one prior to that which i had to pay an annual fee on but offered no benefits simply to establish a credit score but i closed that when opening one of the other cards in ive been hitting the applications pretty hard since january with new cards this year in january and this month i also had two declined applications due to poor planning in january i want to close my arrival to take advantage of the bonus again but im wondering how concerned i should be about affecting my aaoa since i dont have many other older cards ive read the wiki so i know the account will continue to age does that mean it wont affect it at all until years from now edit id also like some input about whether or not ive hit the applications too hard to go after the arrival again right now since barclays can be a stickler about apps thanks
churning,not_removed,im trying to get all set up for an aor in a couple weeks and im wondering how best to prepare myself for amex apps i was denied for the spg biz back in march and a couple reasons had to do with amex issuing too much credittoo recent amex card approval etc i have way more credit than i need on my spg personal does amex work like chase where if you lower your total cl they will be more likely to auto approve another card or would i be better off closing the spg personal card altogether i havent decided which amex card i wanna app for yet but i want to give myself the best chances of approval possible btw i have amex ccs total currently
churning,not_removed,im going phl to fcorome through aa im curious to what cc i should use to book the flight or if it even matters in my case i have aa points spg points home airport is phl im currently working towards my chase ur points nowneed about more spend to get my points the flight is august to august both flights are nonstop the flight is peak season so i dont want to burn the miles for one free rt id rather use my miles for domestic fares where i get a better mile to dollar rate is there a benefit to booking the flight through aacom using my aadvantage cc should i use these tickets to reach my minimum spend on my chase sapphire preferred ill be booking the tickets at some point today most likely since im not sure ill see rt tickets to rome from philadelphia for total are there any perks to the csp or the aadvantage so that i should use one of those to book the trip i can also book the trip on my spg thanks in advance
churning,not_removed,how do you know how many hard pulls of your credit a new card requires
churning,not_removed,are we expecting a public mpe offer tomorrow
churning,not_removed,the united mileageplus x app to get amex redemption isnt letting me purchase gift cards and customer service is useless did the recent update mess the app up or is it just me
churning,not_removed,im currently coming up on my year anniversary of having a csp i have a freedom card and around ur points i also have a citibank premier card with essentially the same rewards as the csp in order to avoid the annual fee on my csp should i consolidate my credit onto the freedom card or should i keep the csp opened ive heard of people on here calling into the bank and them waiving the annual fee for another year does anyone have any advice on what i should do
churning,not_removed,i was approved for a csp on and a freedom on this puts me at no other opened accounts in last two year how long should i wait before applying for the ink that would put me at then looking to apply to the two sw cards think i could pull that off before end of year or is that hitting chase too hard
churning,not_removed,you could show them over pay by and state in error and request a check back
churning,not_removed,close your account
churning,not_removed,im pretty sure for hyatt you must book and complete your stay by the expiration date no experience with fairmont though
churning,not_removed,you must stay and complete the stay before the expiration date if the stay is cancelled or delayed and the night expires you lose that night they have changed the rules to absolutely no extensions on the hyatt nights its hard coded in the system not sure about fairmont
churning,not_removed,definitely go for cards that have transfer partners that way if you earn a million aa miles and they get devalued to nothing youre not sol go for the chase sapphire preferred see if youre targeted for any amex mr earning cards too
churning,not_removed,another perk to look out for would be a card that offers a global entry credit i highly recommend having this especially for international travel it seriously speeds up your time in immigrations when coming back to the us as a bonus you also get tsa precheck for domestic travel you may not be traveling for awhile but global entry is good for five years better to try and get an interview sooner than later as depending on your location the wait time can be quite long
churning,not_removed,in the sidebar theres a checkbox that says show my flair on this subreddit along with an edit link check that to edit your flair
churning,not_removed,separate is fine i have prg and mb plat on too different airlines
churning,not_removed,pure speculation but the will probably be one of the better offers considering how new the product is in any case if you live near a jetblue hub it is a great card to get since barclay did a great job improving the product over the amex version
churning,not_removed,for ongoing airbnb stays i always use citi ty premier because it codes as travel so points
churning,not_removed,for signup bonuses probably cards that reimburse any travel expenses arrival capital one venture etc for ongoing expenses id see if any of the travel cards csp citi ty premier etc code airbnb as travel
churning,not_removed,most rooms for least conventional spending ongoing not signup bonus are probably either the spg amex or the chase hyatt as spg points and hyatt points are both worth far more than other hotel currencies ie it takes fewer points for a room redemption if you sign up for the spg amex be sure to use someones referral link httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiccreferrals
churning,not_removed,chase will let you get the bonus if you havent had it in the past months so you can downgrade your csp to a regular sapphire a regular freedom or a freedom unlimited then just reapply for a csp and get the card and the bonus
churning,not_removed,no dont cancel here is what you should do have your wife refer you for the csp and get the referral bonus i believe wife gets freedom and transfers csp points to it cancel wifes csp or better yet just downgrade it to the free chase sapphire since that will keep her credit history alive refer your wife for the csp and get the bonus for referral profit basically just keep the csp until you get one so that you can get referral bonuses
churning,not_removed,i recently did my first stay since i was matched to hilton diamond i didnt say a word about upgrades and they automatically upgraded me as i was checking in if they dont do it automatically i would just politely ask whether there is any upgrade available when youre checking in i have no idea if theres a way to request an upgrade beforehand
churning,not_removed,seems to be based on availability on the day of check in i tried in the app to see if an upgrade was available and there was nothing when i checked in they simply asked would you like us to see if there is an upgrade available i said sure and got a serious upgrade
churning,not_removed,you can call in amex is easy to speak to and a lot of times at least for me it was just identity confirmation however amex csrs will give you wildly different information about what they can do for example i had one tell me he couldnt do anything for my application because it was being handled by the fraud department and it was locked huca and the next approved me right away
churning,not_removed,typically around august theres a offer but then amex had offer earlier this year as the biggest bonus ever
churning,not_removed,another factor is the coming merger between starwood and marriott its not clear to me how this will affect the spg signup bonuses any thoughts
churning,not_removed,its most useful for amex cards as amex usually gives higher offers to those who dont already have one of their cards if youre using your regular browser and are not in incognito then amex would know that you already have some of their cards and not show you the higher offer
churning,not_removed,i always pull up apps in incognito bc some of them track you so every freaking ad will be the united whatever card for the next weeks if youre doing the method as i recently did its best to use different computers or browsers ideally or incognito mode on the same browser if you dont have multiple browsers so the server doesnt get confused if any of the apps errors out and requires resubmission you will have defeated the whole purpose of
churning,not_removed,first of all always call with amex you will never get them to match but you can ask for courtesy points i got from to spg that way and so have others not sure they will offer you delta miles but you should be able to get them to offer some delta miles
churning,not_removed,amex is known for not matching offers
churning,not_removed,i called a few times because a week after i appliedapproved for the delta gold amex at i got a targeted mailer for i had an rsvp code and everything but they kept telling me the mystical marketing department would get back to me never heard from them each time i called they told me i had no earlier open cases hate to say it but i think youre out of luck
churning,not_removed,platinum card® from american express says yes i dont know where youre looking
churning,not_removed,the platinum credit card is a discontinued cashback card the uk still has it just do a google search for amex uk platinum cashback not to be confused with the platinum charge card probably why they discontinued it
churning,not_removed,what youre seeing is the platinum credit card not the platinum charge card
churning,not_removed,citi prestige for the annual fee you get air travel credit per calendar year so in the first months plus points on travel
churning,not_removed,the citi prestige does or af but well worth it if youll be using all the benefits
churning,not_removed,citi prestige but keep in mind the af is
churning,not_removed,using mr for cash is considered a poor redemption by a lot of people but cash in hand can be more useful than points for a lot of people i would recommend not doubling up on plats get one and use the benefits for a year before canceling it and getting the next variant
churning,not_removed,delta miles get a bad rap but can have a great redemption for the right trip i found an award flight for miles that would have been
churning,not_removed,i wouldnt upgrade apply for a new card so you get the signup bonus if needed cancel other cards amex is known to be very lax with approvals
churning,not_removed,up to you that spend will net you avios i would probably do it but if you value spg points more or other pointsmiles more thats fine too
churning,not_removed,depends on how you value those miles instead of using the ba card you could ms the same amount on a card or a card with milespoints worth more than
churning,not_removed,as long as you dont recycle your credit line over and over within a month or few months it should be fine
churning,not_removed,naw ive hit every ms by the first statement date just space it out a bit and if its with chase you can notify their automated line of any big spends to avoid any hassel with them
churning,not_removed,you check in once for both legs of the flight remember to do it right at hours before the flight time so you get the best possible boarding if your second leg is close in time to your first leg dont be surprised if you get crappy boarding for that second leg because people who had earlier first legs got to check in before you example this morning i checked in for burphx and got but my second leg from phx got google how southwest boards so you know what to expect before you get to the airport since its different than other carriers
churning,not_removed,no you check in once but you need to check in for your return flight as you did your outbound
churning,not_removed,i think so since technically the vgc functions as a debit card its not like apple credit gift card for example the vgc has an actual digit number the issue youll run in to is venmo only allows you to link one card at a time and if what people have said here is accurate only allows you to change per month period burning that with one time use vgcs is probably best avoided
churning,not_removed,pros and cons charts usually it depends on the card benefits transferability af amount
churning,not_removed,you dont always wait until the annual fee to post before cancelling unless you really want to piss of a bank
churning,not_removed,it effectively boils down to what benefits do you lose if you canceldowngrade the card and are they worth more than the annual fee everyone has different priorities so youll have to do the calculation yourself
churning,not_removed,there is no set rule i have more than credit cards with chase and more than a dozen with other banks i dont think chase will care if you get a new citi credit card
churning,not_removed,yup capital one makes it easy to cash out points
churning,not_removed,how long did it take for citi to give you the credit its been about two weeks for me and nothing yet the statement hasnt closed yet though
churning,not_removed,im convinced that the venture is a better card than arrival barclay basically holds your points hostage until you have enough to redeem while capital one will let you redeem all your points on the same purchase of you want
churning,not_removed,the arrival used to be better it had a lower minimum redemption at better rate at and only pulled one hard inquiry after the nerf the venture is much better with the lower annual fee and no minimum redemption however after using the bonus there is no point keeping them longterm since theyre both glorified cash back cards
churning,not_removed,perhaps because capital one pulls all three credit bureaus some might wish to avoid the triple pull
churning,not_removed,i just spent days in europe since they all use pin credit cards instead of signature cards i got asked three times for the card so that they could compare the signatures since i havent signed the back of any of my credit cards they then just asked to see my id and compared it to that so no even when it matters it doesnt really matter
churning,not_removed,i havent signed my cards in years either never had a problem once i was required to sign it during a purchase the clerk then compared the card to the receipt i signed seconds earlier brilliant
churning,not_removed,just remember to sign it with an if you do thanks for pointing that out utheplaj
churning,not_removed,same sometimes they ask for id ive never had someone refuse to take it though
churning,not_removed,no not normal ive had issues and ive bought over a few different transactions pretty sure its on gyfts end
churning,not_removed,big red flag in fact many cards say this isnt allowed in the tc i wouldnt risk it it is a little more complicated to manage but opening a new hhonors program for your wife is the best way to stay out of trouble and while you are at it might as well open memberships in her name for all the other programs awardwallet will let you keep track of both yours and hers in one place
churning,not_removed,i dont think theyd allow two accounts to share a rewards program they might unlink your card if she applies with your membership number
churning,not_removed,some people like having reward accounts for hotel cards that give a free night each card anniversary you can usually stack them if you talk to the hotel
churning,not_removed,you simply cant ffns are always matched to the persons name both for flight activity and partner activity afaik this is one of the ways airlines make it difficult to use miles in general you cannot pool them between accounts
churning,not_removed,on top of what others have said also probably start with chase cards
churning,not_removed,months from what ive seen
churning,not_removed,for my amex the day after the statement posts like clockwork others have said between statements but i dont think anyone has seen statement
churning,not_removed,the second or third statement cycle
churning,not_removed,i filed an occ complaint and ended up getting my points my letter to the occ which was then forwarded to citi about a week later i got a phone call from a citi exec profusely apologizing and promising my points let me know how it works out for you
churning,not_removed,theres a whole thread of people who have gone through this here it seems like people are getting their bonuses but they require escalation and possibly a cfpb complaint
churning,not_removed,with amex make sure you are applying for their best offer they will not match check incognito mode and your preapprovals often
churning,not_removed,start with this green and gold dont have highvalue point offers like the prg or plat cards so they dont get as much love
churning,not_removed,i believe i saw yesterday using the tor browser
churning,not_removed,is live try private browsing or different computer i think is targeted my friend got an offer a few days ago
churning,not_removed,it can take statement cycles for money to show up so you spend in month statement closes spend in month statement closes and shows the amount of cash earned in month cashback earned in month posts a few days after statement closes so the cashback lags the spend by a month plus a few days usually
churning,not_removed,the first billing cycle lags and shows up about months later
churning,not_removed,my dp is that my local kate is seldom working period havent tried a serve load in a while but last time it was up i didnt see any option for mo purchase was just trying to avoid the line at the money center
churning,not_removed,mine isnt but my friends is hit or miss but i think they will soon all not work
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,it will be very difficult to get an ink right after an ink cash i would think the cspfreedom would be much easier the only chance i see on ink is if you have a large cl on your ink cash that you can transfer to a new ink
churning,not_removed,the general consensus is that it is hard to get chase to offer a second business card if youre already holding an existing one
churning,not_removed,dont know where you are and your intended travel goals but if you are under chases and are debating between the csp and spgmarriott card id go for the csp first
churning,not_removed,the assumption for spg is to wait for a offer that usually shows up once a year the conversion isnt immediately pending so people dont think there is a rush right now to get
churning,not_removed,we got spg and marriott if in the future the spg points can be converted to marriott points at a good rate then these cards combined with my wifes existing stash of marriott points will allow us to get another sw companion pass in a couple of years if not then there are lots of good things to do with spg amex points use them transfer them and we might still accumulate enough marriott points an outstanding offer on another card would be icing on the cake your situation may be different but i dont think its crazy at all
churning,not_removed,for only months i wouldnt pay the annual fee call them up and tell them that you want to close the card if they wont graduate it to an unsecured card with no annual fee and then close it if they dont
churning,not_removed,i could be wrong about this but at months the cards not that old even after you close it it will stay on your report for a while i wouldnt keep it open if youre getting other cards
churning,not_removed,i dont know about wf but for a capital one secured they will never graduate it i think it varies by company so you should call to ask and definitely close it if they wont switch it
churning,not_removed,you can close and the history will stay on your report for years
churning,not_removed,months ago i opened the regular amex plat how bad would i look to amex if i closed the regular plat and applied for the mb plat to amex that might be a red flag typically banks see this as somebody who signs up for the signup bonus which is typically true for us but generally dont make it so obvious do you need the extra from the mb plat if not id just either wait until the reg plat has aged a bit before canceling or dont cancel the reg plat and apply for the mb plat youll pay a hefty price for the afs for both cards though
churning,not_removed,why not cancel and sign up for premier and get the typ
churning,not_removed,youd miss out on the sign up bonus which is nothing to sneeze at plus you lose the prestiges on aa and on other flights through the citi travel portal which imo is gold for domestic flights if you really dont want to pay the high af downgrade to the preferred and sign up for the premier bonus
churning,not_removed,i like the premier and dont disagree with your plan but i have a different understanding of the cards structure it does earn better than the prestige with travel being a much more inclusive categories than just air and hotel plus a gas category but it does not have better airline redemption it offers versus the prestiges rate
churning,not_removed,u would be fine amex card doesnt hit ur credit report for at least statements amex always uses experian
churning,not_removed,you should be fine i was when i applied for a prg then a week later i applied for csp freedom and both instantly approved seems amex cards take a while till they appear on report some say around a month
churning,not_removed,so you have more months or they said months since account opening
churning,not_removed,if i recall that card is issued by barclays they are pretty sensitive to inq and new accounts
churning,not_removed,someone told me that barclay likes to see spend on their product which can help mitigate the impact of an active credit history
churning,not_removed,combine the chase hard pull with another chase card under the limit the prestige can wait imo
churning,not_removed,paying off the card is always a good thing
churning,not_removed,i have both amex hilton surpass and amex hilton
churning,not_removed,i have heard of this happening before but there have also been people who claimed to hold both at once i also heard of someone who had the no fee card replaced by the surpass when they opened the surpass
churning,not_removed,chase ur is generally a better program with the csp you have access to all the major us airlines via united aa through british airways and delta through flyingblue and hyatt being one of the best value hotel programs although i still stand by that the citi prestige is the best card on the market for domestic flights and the myriad other benefits you probably have a decent stash of ur points with your freedom card and the csp customer service is the best by far
churning,not_removed,the rule is why you get chase cards first if you have new credit cards in the past months there are several chase cards you cant get at all including the csp thats why most of us would recommend to newbies that you start with chase cards because if you keep churning ccs youll never get chase cards again after the first cards
churning,not_removed,they normally dont send the offer information the best way to verify is through sm or by calling chase
churning,not_removed,what i like to do when i get a new card is to send a messagechat and confirm the offer is linked to my account confirm the date the spend has to happen by and move the statement close date i like them all to be the same to make life easier i also set up autopay at this time to cover all my bases
churning,not_removed,nope no need unless she is above
churning,not_removed,yes you should she can still use the card even if you remove her from your au and it will help her with her future credit card applications unless she really needs to age of credit of the csp on her account
churning,not_removed,ive always had easy and positive experiences calling chase with a pending app generally its only the business apps that people are suggested to not call for most likely theyll just have you move some credit around be sure to have a few good reasons why you like the card other than the bonus
churning,not_removed,i wouldnt call if i couldnt think straight id rather take my chances waiting than risk shooting myself in the foot get some rest and feel better soon
churning,not_removed,what do you have to lose calling recon the worst theyll do is say no id call today
churning,not_removed,unless you have the ink it is not worth downgrading since you will lose the ability to transfer to travel partners
churning,not_removed,id keep the csp but if youre intent on downgrading i would say that choosing between freedom and fu depends on your spending habits with total monthly spend it would be challenging to reach the quarterly freedom cap in a category if you tend to spend more on groceries gas and restaurants then id lean towards freedom else fu conversely i plan on keeping my csp and adding the freedom to max my ur potential but different strokes for different folks
churning,not_removed,youre out of luck im afraid
churning,not_removed,every airline has a different policy
churning,not_removed,not a dumb question i couldnt find anything when i took a good search myself so i dont know the answer for sure but if i could take a wild guess itll most likely be set as any flights taken after insert date will earn miles based on the new earning rates regardless of when you bought the ticket
churning,not_removed,the credit card limit might be gone there are datapoints of people getting a card the limit is credit cards every days charge cards are not included you can apply for as many charge cards as you want
churning,not_removed,no chase does not allow product conversions from one product line to another you can likely downgrade to a no annual fee version of the card if the annual fee isnt worth it eg united mileageplus explorer united mileageplus often the no af version isnt publicly offered but still available for downgrades
churning,not_removed,cobranded cards cant be pcd
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,you cant apply directly on barclays website but you can through links on some of the travelchurning blogs i believe they are still working
churning,not_removed,have you thought about how much timetravel this will cost you lets say you purchase those worth of debit cards with activation on each thats right there in cost getting there and back might cost another not to mention the time and effort if will take to not only get the prepaid cards but to also liquidate them all this for points which is approx after all those initial costs youll have spent have your day for worth of points not sure what youre really going for but msing only really works if its convenient and not really time consuming good luck but definitely think twice about what youre actually getting out of this before going that far out of your way
churning,not_removed,good on you i have had no problems in the south with kroger buying variable vgcs the north may be different but it is definitely worth a shot and a google search to see if there are any data points for this store ebay cards would not be worth it for me there are often off deals for the virtual ebay gift cards from ebay themselves btw i do not think rite aid codes as grocery
churning,not_removed,business platinum
churning,not_removed,platinum has the highest bonus offers if you can manage to get the or however the business gold rewards has an easiertoget points on spend offer and if you actually plan to put a significant amount of business spending on it its a better mr earner starwood business is worth a look before it goes away but its a slow earner and the bonus is not currently at its peak so id lean toward one of the mr cards
churning,not_removed,wait for a decision you must not have many new card accounts in the last couple years so if you feel good i would call chase recon for both separate calls maybe and if they ask about the two applications just say you want to separate spending
churning,not_removed,i think amex is the only issuer that codes mpx as travel some people buy refundable tickets with their travel credits to get cash from them
churning,not_removed,the applicant is the person on behalf of the business your wife should get the bonus with no trouble
churning,not_removed,not the business card but with the personal spg i applied early in march and received the bonus later in march i referred my wife received the bonus she opened the card and added me as an au met the min spend and received the bonus on that card as well
churning,not_removed,if youre never going to spend on it then ihg is a way better value because you can stay in any hotel for the annual fee and there are far more ihg properties than hyatt the hyatt card restricts your free night to categories and charges you if you were going to regularly spend on the card then the hyatt would be a far better choice as both cards earn one point per dollar but hyatt points are worth more than double ihg points
churning,not_removed,yes you will keep the credit history it probably isnt a hard pull
churning,not_removed,yes you can transfer yes she should apply for the csp to get bonus no you should not marry her for ur point reasons
churning,not_removed,chase uses the language household member so youre fine you just have to click a box saying yes we live together
churning,not_removed,the main benefit to keep the csp after the first year is because it gives the ability to transfer ur points to partners the ink is the only other card that allows you to do this also has a fee its up to you how much you value that ability
churning,not_removed,well you need either the csp or ink plus to the transfers so it depends upon whether you value that ability if you dont then you have options ask for a retention offerwaived annual fee if isnt available downgrade to a no annual fee card freedom or freedom unlimited in this case if and arent available then cancel after moving your csp credit line to another chase card if you do have one
churning,not_removed,nope you cant do a balance transfer to fulfill spending requirement and yes you can fund bank accounts and use it to pay off the card
churning,not_removed,re the latter read the tc of the pnc account theres an early cancellation fee if close within i think days and of course to avoid the monthly fee youll need to keep x minimum in the account otherwise its totally doable
churning,not_removed,that sounds about right since both plat and premier reward gold are charge cards and not subject to a daily limit by amex as far as i know however be aware that you can only earn the signup bonus once in a lifetime and that neither public signup bonus for those cards are rather enticing
churning,not_removed,httpwwwflyertalkcompuddinghtm
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,ive always called citi right away
churning,not_removed,i mean i wouldnt say its high or low but most often the offer only shows up to people who have no past history with amex and have cards with other banks
churning,not_removed,looking to get my first card most people here would recommend that you not get the citi costco card and get five chase cards first due to the rule the second part of your question is more for rcostco and not people on this subreddit but as far as i know costco will begin accepting applications at physical locations when visa goes live at costco locations
churning,not_removed,this happened to me once some time late last year i was helped by a different person than usual and i thought maybe it was something she did on her end that didnt prompt me for the pin i checked the vgc balance afterwards and it was and the had been added to my serve so i shrugged it off and went about my day
churning,not_removed,thats the general idea check out the serve faq in the sidebar for more info on shutdowns though
churning,not_removed,if you want to know for a card that you havent met the soend om yet send a secure message asking when you need to complete your spend by subtract days from the date and you get the open date
churning,not_removed,you could just check on credit karma for the account open date
churning,not_removed,i use an to sign all of my cards including amexes works like a charm
churning,not_removed,you can try a just make sure it dries completely
churning,not_removed,fellow ocd churner here i always sign my cards and i always use a black sharpie ive even had a card ritzcarlton reissued because of a botched signature
churning,not_removed,i tend not to sign my cards always figure if they want to check id i dont mind but of security against being stolen am i missing good reasons to sign a card
churning,not_removed,check out creditboards site it varies from issuer bank card and the state
churning,not_removed,i believe barclays almost always pulls transunion but i dont know if its for sure
churning,not_removed,paging
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,csp and chase ink plus and transfer to airlines
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,yes that counts toward the minimum spend
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,what are you doing
churning,not_removed,amex generally has a credit cards per day limit try again in days
churning,not_removed,curious why did you apply for the amex green card
churning,not_removed,you should definitely start with more chase cards the best ones for you will depend on your travel style plans and goals my own very subjective list of favorite chase cards is here if you want more specific advice post more info in the what card wednesday thread
churning,not_removed,csp is a must but the million dollar question is what are your guys goals i suggest figuring out where and how you guys wanna travel and asking on what card wednesday everyone here may be bias towards certain products and some of those products might not even be what you want so to better understand your needs wed need to know wherehow you wanna travel
churning,not_removed,ink united currently have a promo check the forum for the link and see if he qualifies freedom unlimited
churning,not_removed,definitely chase cards probably csp freedom united
churning,not_removed,i would start with the ink if fiancee has a business or even if he doesnt that will net you ur then check if he is targeted for united bonus which lasts until the end of june apply for that if targeted if not targeted for united apply for csp as the second card apply for freedom unlimited as third card here you will likely have to cool off a bit as chase will start denying around this point months later you can apply for your last chase card that is under you need to decide what is worth the most to you but likely this will be united or southwest
churning,not_removed,the amex limit is credit cards at a time theres no limit to charge cards platinum gold brg etc
churning,not_removed,there are reports of people being able to get a credit card but ymmv i was able to get approved for the hilton surpass after calling in it was my personal amex credit card no charge cards at the time
churning,not_removed,i have amex credit cards did not need to call in dont know if it is a recent change or exception made for hilton cards
churning,not_removed,probably im pretty sure it appears on your personal credit report you can check creditkarma to be sure
churning,not_removed,yes its a consumer credit card and would count towards
churning,not_removed,i called in a few days ago after my mariott app was declined due to the csr said i had opened in the last months but only count because my kohls card is a retail card
churning,not_removed,if youve already maxed out using a different card for each of your small monthly subscriptions spotify netflix etc and bills cable insurance utilities etc you would probably be fine rotating the remaining cards you buy an amazon gc with i dont think youd get shut down for not having a charge every month as long as you use it every few months
churning,not_removed,yes there are scripts that do purchases once per month
churning,not_removed,i use serve to do small debit transactions automatically
churning,not_removed,if you dont mind calling on her behalf most of the banks allow that after they get a quick verbal approval from your wife initially on the call
churning,not_removed,use sm
churning,not_removed,work on your female voice i kid but i have called a few times pretending to be my so with her permission they never said anything about not sounding female
churning,not_removed,i just say that i am my wife no one has ever questioned it it got a little hairy when i couldnt answer chases fraud dept identity verification questions when she was at work
churning,not_removed,anything goes
churning,not_removed,no limit or parameters you can make amazon transactions just remember that you will get points instead of if you make instead of transaction a gain of maybe cents if you have some other high value transactions this might be worth it but otherwise dont bother
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,ive read chase wants year of credit history before approving the ink i dont know if that is actually true or not but probably worth waiting a couple months and trying again
churning,not_removed,when you apply for a chase card there is a field have you been denied credit by chase in the past months that should tell you right off the bat that your chances are gonna be higher if not in that category the standard offer for ink is af waived i think the current offer seems only marginal better may be a good idea to wait until september
churning,not_removed,yes but it will be difficult to get approved for a chase biz card if you already have one open
churning,not_removed,yes you can
churning,not_removed,yes any citi card can pc to it i pced my citi aa platinum card to the dividend
churning,not_removed,often cant downgrade branded cards
churning,not_removed,have not had any luck myself either
churning,not_removed,with the arrival i am almost certain you can reimburse on the same statement you just need to wait for it to officially post and if you have enough miles reimburse away
churning,not_removed,mine was on the same statement for prestige
churning,not_removed,so long as you have a good backstory for your business should you have to recon the ink you shouldnt have any problems you may have to move credit around however
churning,not_removed,since the ink is a business card the inquiries will not be combined unless your second card is also a business card given chases new tightfistedness on business cards good luck with that in other words theres really no reason to try to apply for the ink and another chase card on the same day
churning,not_removed,unable to book the free nights online youll need to call the reservation line on the back of the card
churning,not_removed,absolutely worth it especially as you can cancel it after a year and then get another targeted offer for the same card oftentimes without the one bonus per lifetime language and get the signup bonus again ive gotten bonuses for the brg twice and im hoping to get a third targeted offer sometime d
churning,not_removed,data point received a targeted mailer at my office for amex brg spend received mr after spending at and another for af not waived hit the spend in one month cancelled in the second month since i picked up the personal plat received prorated af for brg i expect to churn it again in months
churning,not_removed,thats just how they do it doesnt hurt to email the hotel and let them know also ask if thy have any upgrade opportunities with points they wont but may upgrade you regardless
churning,not_removed,did you book online ive been looking at the site and having a hrd one figuring how
churning,not_removed,various reports of applications going through initially then getting declined because of too many new bank accounts i forgot about that and applied a couple days ago charge has posted to my chase sw already but well see if it sticks once it actually gets reviewed during banking hours
churning,not_removed,id have everything set up in separate browsers and the hit book immediately after each other
churning,not_removed,if you are worried about it you could call in i expect the csr could probably hold the seats while booking the other account holder may have to be on the call too
churning,not_removed,unless youre taking hours to do it youre probably fine
churning,not_removed,i would do it right away by the time you have the points posted met spend the offer could be gone there are tons of dp that support either method
churning,not_removed,from my experience it doesnt really matter
churning,not_removed,for chase you can call the automated line and tell them how much youll be spending so they wont decline your card once theyre seasoned theyll let you do your thing
churning,not_removed,chase really doesnt care amex sorta cares depending on a few factors just dont do things like opening up cards in a month and charging to them cycling your cl
churning,not_removed,season your cards with regular spend before you start getting vgc people get their cards lock due to fraud concerns when they start buying vgc as soon as they activate their cards
churning,not_removed,what are your traveling goals personally id do the cspcf combo and both sw cards if you want the cp im unfortunately over so the only way i could get the cp is an so or if i waited until
churning,not_removed,i started about weeks ago with that guide already hit spends for csp and ihg i got them within weeks of each other though so i dont want to push my luck with chase im thinking of waiting for the united mpe offer in a couple days if it pops for me and hoping chase gives it to me if not ill go with a citi aa card probably for me with a wife skeptical of churning a young son and more of a desire for airbnb than hotels i think im aiming for more flight points than hotel points or points that can go to either but that marriott or hyatt cards are intriguing
churning,not_removed,do you have any amex cards open now the plat offer does show up for people from time to time as a targeted offer to noncard holders
churning,not_removed,it depends on your location most banks chase included will always hit the same bureau for a given person in a given locale so if chase normally uses exp for you they will probably hit exp again however there is a small chance they wont out of the applications for me and my wife one time chase used eq instead of exp
churning,not_removed,are the missing recent if so they still may show up in the coming weeks until then it looks as if you are in the clear
churning,not_removed,were the other two ccs business cards those dont show up on your personal credit reports despite being tied to your ssn if theyre chase business ccs then youre still over if theyre other then youre not
churning,not_removed,about days after the charge posted for me
churning,not_removed,posted reimbursed for me
churning,not_removed,as i understand it yes
churning,not_removed,people recommend autoslash i personally used costco travel and that was my best price for oahu and kauai play with the times and days to get a better price as long as it still works for you
churning,not_removed,check islandaircom click on this link and select car only my folks saved almost off published rates
churning,not_removed,you can sm or call chase
churning,not_removed,you can get a ua or aa round trip economy class ticket for under per person csp bonus should cover that depending on how flexible youre travel plans are you can get them cheaper also are you travelling alone or with someone else it might make sense to get a hotel card to cover lodging in hawaii
churning,not_removed,maybe a chase ink plus then transfer
churning,not_removed,that would be ideal yes
churning,not_removed,id say so
churning,not_removed,the anniversary night must be redeemed used within year of receiving
churning,not_removed,ive heard hyatt is year from date of being issued think ihg is the same dont know about marriott
churning,not_removed,you are thinking about credit inquiries all your cards are reported on all credit reports you might have a small window of time where they are still not reported you can try your luck with chase during that period
churning,not_removed,theres never a guarantee but you may have a better chance of approval from the datapoints ive seen regarding
churning,not_removed,amex mr bonuses post can post days after meeting after the minimum spend purchases have posted check that the charges are no longer pending however if this is your first amex mr cardbonus it usually posts after the first or second statement
churning,not_removed,contact customer rep chat and they will credit in a day or two general timeline is when the next statement closes
churning,not_removed,nah
churning,not_removed,remember buying an appliance with a gift card instead of a credit card you dont get cc benefits like extended warranty
churning,not_removed,no chance amex doesnt match and certainly wont to
churning,not_removed,my funding posted to chase fu on and appeared in checking account on balance was also until the funds cleared now its you may have to wait a day or two longer due to mdw on related note has anyone else had luck opening up a savings account after funding a checking my application status is still showing as referred
churning,not_removed,i am in this state csp charged but i dont even have a fully opened account yet to even show a i have called twice been promised a callback once didnt get it
churning,not_removed,it took several days dont worry itll show
churning,not_removed,so you want to hold two of the same amex cards at the same time the answer is no you cant do that with amex
churning,not_removed,are you asking if you can have a duplicate of your card same number name etc and have your husband use the card simultaneously with you you could just request a replacement card online use card worndamaged for reason and that way youll have two of the same card number with your name this changes the expiration date on the new card so while the old card is still usable for swipechip transactions the new expiration date will need to be utilized for online transactions i have done this as well with my wife in a pinch when she lost her card and was waiting on a replacement having her use a worn prg when i received a replacement and personally didnt have any problems this was for about a week or so so i cant comment on long term sustainability of course your husband may also run into verifying card with id when making purchases and being denied by a csr
churning,not_removed,if hes fine with using your card why not get him an au card its the same account and you get his charges on your existing bill only difference is the card would have his name and a different number since amex doesnt clone cards like chase does you could suggest that a store might call the cops or destroy your card since the name doesnt match his id
churning,not_removed,you can still call in and see if there is any additional retention offer
churning,not_removed,there isnt a reason to double up since the benefits are practically the same and tbh the prestige is probably better as far as af cards go
churning,not_removed,open the prestige and redeem your bonus points from the gold ck account for cents on aa citi might send u a though
churning,not_removed,you can get a prestige and the af will be just that will get you a bonus when you redeem typ for aa flights via the typ travel portal you can transfer points with a premier but i believe you cant transfer checking account points and are stuck spending them
churning,not_removed,did you get denied yet if i were you i would just wait for now
churning,not_removed,if you use points instead of a credit card you will lose the extended warranty benefit that comes with a lot of cards
churning,not_removed,yes i switch hotels on my business trips to maximize the number of stays since like you i travel once a month if you have the hotels available and dont mind the slight hassle its worth it you can also take advantage of promotions that require multiple stays this way
churning,not_removed,off the top of my head im pretty sure yes you can share hyatt points for a nominal fee hilton im not sure and im almost positive that marriott can only be shared within households at the time of booking so at least in my knowledge i dont believe you can combine points with a non spouse to take advantage of one of those packages
churning,not_removed,yes it can be done qantas to australia and most likely qatar airways to get over to dubai if you have a few more specifics on where youre coming from and what not i can give you a little more advice
churning,not_removed,you cant balance transfer from one card with chase to another its basically like using one credit card to pay off another and banks dont like you doing that within their own products as it is meant to steal you from another card issuer
churning,not_removed,i know chase and capital one for sure
churning,not_removed,amex kinda they dont have sm just chat but it works just as easily
churning,not_removed,url to go to but that url prompts you to sign into your mileageplus account iirc so theyre still targeted i think
churning,not_removed,was it httpswwwawardhackercom
churning,not_removed,you get one free report every year from the three bureaus should go here to get your free report httpswwwannualcreditreportcomindexaction
churning,not_removed,activating the card is mostly irrelevant probably best move is calling a few times and trying to get them to match the new offer that has recently been released i personally dont know how good boa is at matching offers though
churning,not_removed,i would go cashpoints route followed by paying to transfer between accounts and transfer ur as a distant third
churning,not_removed,i would do cash and points ur is too valuable to transfer to ihg imo
churning,not_removed,you will pay at least ihg points in each scenario the additional costs are instead of ihg points implying that ihg may be worth cpp ihg points at cpp that is ur and ihg supposing cpp for ur that is pointscash it is edit minor adjustments to options and
churning,not_removed,i did a dd from my employer to my wifes chase account to qualify for the bonus chase either didnt notice or didnt care we got the bonus without any trouble the banker will ask the person opening the account questions about the intended use the source of the funds the estimated amount of activity etc
churning,not_removed,bankers do not care if you trigger the dd requirement through any means their internal system will grant you the bonus
churning,not_removed,correct it wont affect it at all until years from now
churning,not_removed,in the past amex has autoadjusted my cls when approving new cards ymmv of course
churning,not_removed,really doesnt matter too much id say its personal preference only perk i can think of is travel delay insurance with the csp but highly doubt you would ever have to use that so that really isnt a factor besides that it really just depends if you want to wrap up that minimum spend in one go or if you need to top off your aa account with miles and use that cc so honestly just comes down to personal preference and goals
churning,not_removed,not entirely sure of your question here but there are multiple data points around here about which banks pull more than one credit report creating a free account at creditkarmacom will show you how many hard pulls are on your accounts
churning,not_removed,appears to be targeted only
churning,not_removed,more like hoping for one
churning,not_removed,according to you are correct i just saw that and was coming back to update
churning,not_removed,a year
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,thanks i guess ill wait on applying then
churning,not_removed,i would imagine that it would be in amexs interest to keep the spg card under there umbrella so they might be willing to offer better sign up bonuses to show their new marriott overlords that they should stay with amex just a thought though
churning,not_removed,gotcha thanks
churning,not_removed,hmm okay thanks for the info
churning,not_removed,does it have the loophole that i can use travel credit for gift cards
churning,not_removed,fair enough im at a stage in life pretty young kids where im not necessarily anticipating the type of travel many here do on points i suppose i could do the mb plat since its at a higher bonus now then apply for the schwab at the tail end of the year on the mb and transfer points to cash with schwab if i dont see a travel redemption in my near future and still have them in my mr account im still holding out for the plat deal to come back around eventually too so could do that down the road when im more likely to travel
churning,not_removed,i agree i am looking a ways out and all the flights i have glanced at cost miles or
churning,not_removed,what do you mean by recycle
churning,not_removed,despite all of the data of people hitting ms hard and quick i dont know why i still get paranoid too about this i always mix in ms with natural spend as for the most part im meeting minimum spend on one card at a time but i try and schedule my ms so that it doesnt look fishy to the banks for instance i will buy a vgc along with other items times a month at a grocery store as it comes across totally natural if analyzing charges to be making large transactions for groceries i will only buy a vgc at walgreens up to twice a month as i could just say theyre prescriptions if ever approached i also spread my ms out time wise so i dont have transactions of hundreds of dollars at a drug store multiple times a week because i feel that would look fishy i dont ms at gas stations etc because i personally think it would look sketchy to see multiple multihundred dollar transactions at a gas station and couldnt really come up with justification other than gift cards if approached about it i also always purchase other items along with the vgcs to prevent the multiple etc charges i know that in the grand scheme of things banks give credit limits of an amount of debt they are comfortable with me holding at any given moment and as long as im under that limit and paying the debt back as agreed i should be ok i also know that it is more of a nuisance for the banks to be scrutinizing a month of spending but i still definitely proceed with caution
churning,not_removed,can you give an example of a time when it would be beneficial to cancel a card with no af
churning,not_removed,that link also recommends you keep your card in view at all times during a transaction guess they dont want you using it at us restaurants
churning,not_removed,ah thanks
churning,not_removed,post office does sometimes ive been in a few pos where i handed an unsigned card to the guy at the counter he looked at it saw it was unsigned and refused to accept it until i signed it instead of asking for id like most other places would of course he literally watched me sign the card right in front of him which completely defeats the entire purpose of having a signature on the card in the first place
churning,not_removed,just fyi my amex hilton posted to my credit report almost immediately the only time thats ever happened with me with amex but its not impossible
churning,not_removed,thank you very much for the link and information i have submitted a complaint to cfpb
churning,not_removed,but cant you get both prg gold thats total right or do they classify similar cards as one card
churning,not_removed,the ink cash is under ssn would it be possible to do the cspfreedom and then possibly use an ein for an llc to get the ink or would that still be under my name so difficult as a business card i only ask because i have a couple targeted offers from citi like the aa platinum and business for and i have to apply by july
churning,not_removed,thanks so you wouldnt consider it a missed opportunity or at least an inferior one compared to the current csp offer
churning,not_removed,good intel thanks
churning,not_removed,how do you combine hard pulls just apply separately on the same day and they do it for you
churning,not_removed,thank you newbie here still catching on to the lingosm
churning,not_removed,thanks for the advice very much appreciated i dont have the card with me but is this easy to do info to accomplish this available on the back of the card thanks again
churning,not_removed,username checks out
churning,not_removed,ill take some medicine first and then do it
churning,not_removed,thank you
churning,not_removed,not for me yet its been about months ive been looking for it and have not seen it and of course the time it comes around publicly is the one day i dont look at the sub cardmatch consistently gives me a offer but not a offer
churning,not_removed,what els said for ccs sign up bonuses are way more valuable than rewards earned from spending bonuses in terms of sign up bonuses chase has the best to offer for beginners
churning,not_removed,i appreciate that im a part of a community with people who understand these things
churning,not_removed,ive had a store refuse to accept a card once because it wasnt signed i used to write stolen on cards after that just to see if they actually looked never once had anyone notice
churning,not_removed,technically they arent supposed to accept an unsigned card
churning,not_removed,it just dawned on me that if an unsigned card is loststolen you can bet the card signature will match the receipt for the next attempted purchase and im wondering if issuer can back out of any fraud protection because you didnt agree to their terms
churning,not_removed,same
churning,not_removed,its per days limit but only for credit cards the day limit is from the first card applied prg and green are charge cards so you should be able to get that additional credit card since you only were approved for one maybe call csr and get an explanation
churning,not_removed,there is a spend with no af offer floating around that pairs well with any other application
churning,not_removed,mr annual fee waived the first year and the hps were all combined into
churning,not_removed,alternatively if youre not going to ms much downgrade the ink to the cash and keep the csp for its travel protections cash vs ink limit
churning,not_removed,with applying to most cobrand cards now you probably want to focus on the cobrand cards it does apply to first southwest united marriott
churning,not_removed,if you are interested in a cash back strategy longerterm and dont plan to keep the csp after the first year id recommend you go for the csp and chase cobranded cards and then after youre at get a citi double cash and an amex blue cash preferred rather than a freedom its unlikely youd use all of the freedoms categories every quarter but it is likely youd use all of the bcps on groceries throughout the year this would pay for the af also back on gas all year without limit this way you can maximize cobranded points and maximize cash back however for best of both worlds you can downgrade the csp to a regular no af sapphire after your first year then a month later pc it to freedom or fu
churning,not_removed,how do you get an ink with no business
churning,not_removed,i think getting freedom unlimited is dependent on what card op currently holds if they have one fu between them i dont see a point for them both to have it lackluster sign up bonus also unless of course they run out of cards under that they want
churning,not_removed,this is true although as said there are recent reports in the past months or so that amex might be relaxing the cc rule
churning,not_removed,its shows up on my sos credit report but is listed as charge account instead of flexible spending credit card i wasnt sure if that made a difference i saw one dp that indicated it didnt count but cant really find much info other that
churning,not_removed,hmm thats interesting thanks for the hope giving dp
churning,not_removed,im at with a overstock and best buy store cards cant be used anywhere else and wondering if i should try for freedom wish there were more dp on this edit auto approval freedom card
churning,not_removed,i use most cards once a year never had an account closed because of inactivity and i have cards
churning,not_removed,thanks exactly what i needed for anyone else looking for same thing found one in here
churning,not_removed,thanks yeah the goal is to boost a couple thousand spent at grocery stores in just transactions
churning,not_removed,so i should close it before i apply but hold onto it in the meantime for the sake of aaoa utilized credit ratio
churning,not_removed,thanks buddy
churning,not_removed,had to call no way to book online and they didnt know it wasnt points booking until i mentioned the card
churning,not_removed,thanks i ended up doing that it looks like delta warns you if theres only one seat left on a particular flight so theres only the small chance of multiple people booking in the middle of my confirmation
churning,not_removed,you are correct that op should call as for the other account holder the airlines usually dont care aa do require you to pay the fees for the other account using a cc in the other account holders name as an identify protection
churning,not_removed,agree in my opinion the sooner you get confirmation in writing sm the better with the united offer in particular i am actually waiting a couple of days to see if there is a public offer not sure if i will be successful since the current offer is targeted
churning,not_removed,ah so i should be fine no matter i have high income so i wouldnt expect a flag until it breaks near that amount hopefully a k or two is enough
churning,not_removed,ah ok good ive had the premier for a long time over years so im going to cancel reup for the bonus so there is a long history filled with larger purchases will that extend to the rest of my account or should i amp up slowly with every single card mixed with normal spend any suggestions with mosservebbcu limits i figure if i only do per card with checking accounts i can distribute to have one account per card and keep it fairly casual looking but ive heard stories of small amount shutdowns happening quickly
churning,not_removed,ah yeah not a problem there going to mix normal spend in no matter and keep the first week or two pure organic just go start slow my plat saw in organic in three weeks so its time to slam that with ms
churning,not_removed,goals arent strict but id love to get to hawaii as my first goal ive still never been so you think i should go with chase sapphire preferred chase freedom why this one i dont really see any sign up bonuses and then both of these
churning,not_removed,i hear you im more about getting flight points and bumming it with friendsairbnb than id ever do high end hotels if i had a choice just signed up for csp with a referral link whew
churning,not_removed,i have a fidelity amex cashback on everything that is about to move to a visa and the sallie mae mastercard back on gas groceries and amazon im just finally starting to dip my toe into miles vs straight cash back not sure if that amex above counts since it will be moving to visa in about months
churning,not_removed,yeah one of them is a chase business card good catch probably not safe for applying for chase cards then
churning,not_removed,waitnonchase business cards such as amex plat business are not included in the rule so i could get in on good nonchase offers still and not be worried i was under the impression it was minus the cobrandeds that were said to be alive still hyattihgetc this could be nice just in case the business plat goes again etc
churning,not_removed,figured that might be the only way its at least nice their ur cards show pending points
churning,not_removed,i am still deciding on that right now its just me i bought the day night stay through hilton already unfortunately they called me and offered me the stay plus a royal caribbean credit plus a hotel credit for it was a pretty good deal so i jumped on it then i saw that hawaii flights could be up to up in themselves so i wanted to cut that part of the expense out i shoulda stopped by here first to save some money i appreciate the info on the bonus i was trying to convert pointsmiles to cash to compare the price totals and thought i needed way more points than that
churning,not_removed,how long ago did you apply for the savings i was thinking of doing the same once my checking funding cleared
churning,not_removed,i got my documents in the mail after a few days currently somehow have a balance of i dont like paying off bank account funding charges before i see the money in the new account but i also dont want my statement to close with a charge on it
churning,not_removed,i normally wait until month before the fee is due does it make sense to wait until then
churning,not_removed,do you know if the aa bonus can be used with the checking account points
churning,not_removed,i was denied for the too many open credit lines within months sucks because i applied on after waffling for a while looks like i just got stuck
churning,not_removed,what if i cover half of the purchase with a credit card
churning,not_removed,awesome thank you
churning,not_removed,i know the question is specifically for marriott but just as a dp hyatt only required filling out a form that both i and my wife signed to combine points no fee
churning,not_removed,that makes sense the only other nonchase card i have is a capital one card which currently has a balance so im assuming my evil plan has failed
churning,not_removed,thanks just closed capital one they actually have a close account button on their contact us page
churning,not_removed,it was awardace just found it
churning,not_removed,to add to that if you are denied you are able to get a free copy of your report from whichever bureau furnished the lender your report
churning,not_removed,ive heard people cancel this card before using it to avoid the af sometimes they still get the bonus in this case i dont know if it would be worth dumping it then reapplying
churning,not_removed,wonderful explanation thanks
churning,not_removed,awesome thanks for the data point
churning,not_removed,great thank you for the dp
churning,not_removed,exception if you have a so with the card who can refer you you can consider grabbing it now while the referral bonus is many people myself included had luck getting the bonus matched this year to even after months in my case if you apply for it now and get it matched to later if that ever comes back youll get a total of between the two of you plus points now are worth more than points later
churning,not_removed,i dont think so but im not sure someone mentioned booking a ticket that is refundable and then cancelling it id actually appreciate more input on this idea myself how long to wait to cancel etc
churning,not_removed,actually using mr for cash when you have schwab is actually a pretty good redemption
churning,not_removed,spend your max credit line over and over
churning,not_removed,if you hate looking at it id probably never cancel a no af card gotta build that aaoa man
churning,not_removed,ive always wondered why this is still handled the way it is it seems like it would be the easiest thing for a restaurant employee to start stealing card numbers or is there something about this process that i dont understand that would prevent that aside from potentially being able to easily trace it all back to the restaurant
churning,not_removed,prg isnt the same as bgr or gold you could potentially get all three and their respective bonuses and yes people will sometimes apply for a green or gold on the same day to save a hard pull and get more mr
churning,not_removed,ein wont help you still have to put in your ssn as the applicant as well if you can do the spend there is no reason i wouldnt do citi along with cspfreedom
churning,not_removed,i agree with this advice specifically given if you have a somewhat decent credit profile you should be able to open an spg at any time so wait for a better sign up bonus at least in my experience and the data points ive read american express isnt as inquirynew account sensitive as others
churning,not_removed,but now you have those other cards so youll establish a good payment history on those and you wont need your old secured card anymore get rid of it if they wont convert it
churning,not_removed,for certain banks yeah i do it in separate incognito browsers doc of credit has a post on it give his blog a read
churning,not_removed,secure message
churning,not_removed,you can do all of this through the chase websiteyour online account when you can see charges and make payments have you set that up yet remember that the premier has an annual fee which does not count toward the minimum spend so be careful not to count that in your spend
churning,not_removed,yeah youre in the same spot as my wife she has excellent credit and cards from other issuers and i cant get the offer to come up for her just hoping one day it will haha
churning,not_removed,thats what ive always wondered as well would that actually free them from any liability if they wanted to push it worth signing imo just to avoid that possibility even if it is low and also to avoid the minor potential hassle of ever running into a place that wont take it unsigned
churning,not_removed,oh wow really havent seen it yet thanks for the heads up
churning,not_removed,how did you get the mr offer for the green card to show ive tried incognitoprivate mode in both chrome and safari dozens of times to no avail any ideas or suggestions
churning,not_removed,i applied for ink with data from my amazon seller account where i sometimes unload my old books and stuff i put years old and revenue last year approved for
churning,not_removed,good point it may be that regular freedom works better for them between the couple probably the best combo is one csp one ink cash or two one fu and one regular freedom or two
churning,not_removed,thats what i heard too but just wanted to confirm if the card rule is in place though which one to cancel though blue cash everyday opened in spg opened in aug delta gold opened in jan hilton hhonors opened in aug
churning,not_removed,doesnt make a difference
churning,not_removed,awesome did all show up on credit report before applying
churning,not_removed,up to you doesnt make much difference as it doesnt appear on your personal credit report you just need to close it days before you want to apply for the ink again i would recommend
churning,not_removed,that makes it easier good luck
churning,not_removed,i called they told me to book online by searching for one night at a time since the certs were for one night when i searched that way i was able to find award nights and book them in the comments i wrote asking to merge my reservation to stay in the same room i plan on calling closer to the travel date to confirm and ask for upgrade
churning,not_removed,well usually a big purchase on a new card is suspicious no matter your income just let them know and youll be fine within a month or they wont care
churning,not_removed,youre overthinking it just dont do anything sketchy looking also its one servebb per person ive been using serve and bb to hit min spends for the past months ive done over total and while i did get frd i came out unscathed youre worrying too much about it
churning,not_removed,the bonus on the csp is ur for spend its a good starter card because ur points are so versatile with tons of transfer partners im looking into hawaii too if the spg sign up bonuses go up this summer try to grab the personal and business you can fly alaska air to hawaii for economy with a domestic stopover so you could do days in la and days in hawaii on ticket for really good deal look into all your options though both the sw plus and premier at bonuses each will get you rapid rewards points youll just need to get the coveted companion pass which allows you to designate a companion to fly free with you on all your sw flights for years
churning,not_removed,the fidelity card isnt issued by an amex bank so it doesnt count you can check and see if you have any targeted offers from amex on their website
churning,not_removed,i havent tested this myself but from what ive heard this is the case its not that the cards arent included in its that chase doesnt see nonchase business ccs when you apply for personal ccs because your personal credit report doesnt list them now if you were to apply for a business cc from chase and if chase were to pull a business credit report then they might find your other business cards and deny you im guessing here probably worth verifying before trying anything
churning,not_removed,yeah dont convert to cash using points for travel is usually the way to get the most out of them check out the citi presitge the signup bonus can cover another passengers flight plus you get air travel credit and lounge access among many other perks there is a fee but the perks might be worth it to you otherwise see if you can get the bonus on the amex premier rewards gold airline cards could also be useful if you plan on flying them to hawaii look around this thread and boardingareacom for some good info feel free to pm me if you want as well
churning,not_removed,heres a delta
churning,not_removed,i learned about this hobby after booking very expensive plane tickets to japan for our honeymoon at least you made it here
churning,not_removed,applied on status is still showing as referred i will try calling them later this week if i dont hear anything
churning,not_removed,call whenever you normally do ive found calling barclays as close as possible to the af date to be better
churning,not_removed,yes i linked my cg and prestige accounts and get the bonus on all of my points
churning,not_removed,you can try but i havent heard of many success stories getting over the too many open credit lines within months
churning,not_removed,usually has to be the entire purchase
churning,not_removed,i believe it has to be the full purchase but im not completely sure check out the terms and conditions
churning,not_removed,nope
churning,not_removed,sadly so
churning,not_removed,i am also pretty sure bts dont earn points
churning,not_removed,also balance transfers would not earn you any points anyway
churning,not_removed,this would be considered extremely aggressive by most and possible to get a shutdown the accounthardpull wouldnt be removed its just a tactic to receive the as points without paying the af you generally wont find anybody around here who would suggest this type of route
churning,not_removed,this is interesting i have heard that amex doesnt match sign up bonuses often thanks for the tip
churning,not_removed,i have not set up an account on the chase website yet i will take a look tonight and come back if i have any questions thank you very much
churning,not_removed,check in incognito mode
churning,not_removed,showed up first try for me in chrome incognito maybe try a vpn
churning,not_removed,i think ive generally seen they dont allow this though someone may correct me on this however i think ive also seen a few people who had citi citi and made the conversion for them so i wouldnt bet on it but would still try it i am sure though that a pc resets the clock on when you can next earn a signup bonus with citi so just keep that in mind
churning,not_removed,i have read data points of people doing just that aa dc i am planning on doing this when the annual fee comes due on my citi aa plat
churning,not_removed,i would cancel the hhonors you wont lose the points and if you want to keep earning hilton points you can get the citi hilton
churning,not_removed,that would depend on what cards you value more spg card offers you the chance to earn the valuable spg points and some people use this as their daily spend card if you are one of those people keep otherwise cancel delta gold gets you a free checked bag on delta if you fly delta a lot that can add up hilton hhonors doesnt give much but gives you the opportunity for upgrading to surpass a year after opening and netting another hh points for no credit check and no new account bce sucks but it probably helps your credit since it will stay on your credit report and continue to help your credit for another years after closing it i would probably get rid of that one
churning,not_removed,ok thanks
churning,not_removed,yeah i figured this much but not easy to find dp with actual numbers what was the fr for my wife and i both have our own accounts so thats why double for everything helps a ton for building points but ive heard xfer in between loyalty accounts is a no go so bleh
churning,not_removed,thats killer im actually very close to lax anyway so might even be easier to get to hawaii from there either way though it sounds like i want to go chase cards before i go any other direction just to get around the rule right
churning,not_removed,nothing good for now but i feel like i used to get mailed offers all the time i just need to pay a little more attention going forward to them
churning,not_removed,might just be a promo for the sw cards i just got a welcome email that had this bullet point dont forget you can earn point for every in balance transfers up to points within the first days of opening your account
churning,not_removed,they dont but you can often get at least some points if you call and ask for courtesy points
churning,not_removed,like the other user above seems to not be showing for me
churning,not_removed,thanks maybe ill need to try that then
churning,not_removed,there are definitely programs that allow transfers pooling your ur would be a good idea too fr was an income verification it was triggered for buying a vgc on my spg biz on a cl not really sure why that did it but it was not a fun weeks
churning,not_removed,lax to hawaii on british airways is chase ur transfers to ba too id do that definitely start with chase dont get chase cards just to have them though make sure it makes sense to your goals
churning,not_removed,thats pretty cool but only if there is a apr on balance transfers and bt fee is that the case
churning,not_removed,dear rchurning is stealing wrong
churning,not_removed,you received goods or services in exchange for using the card right
churning,not_removed,dear rchurning is stealing wrong even if i think i can get away with it
churning,not_removed,you have got to be kidding
churning,not_removed,if your balance does drop negative im sure a call to customer service will lead you in the right direction
churning,not_removed,removed read the wiki
churning,not_removed,nope bonus is not mentioned anywhere on the paperwork you can confirm it is attached to your card through sm
churning,not_removed,bonuses for cards from most banks are not noted anywhere in the included material or online youd have to sm or call chase to have them confirm it
churning,not_removed,moronic monday thread
churning,not_removed,its just a simple question jerkoff
churning,not_removed,this is a basic question therefore the moronic monday thread is the proper area for it got removed and downvoted for a reason
churning,not_removed,this has been previously reported and applies to all barclay cards
churning,not_removed,a lot of people have had luck getting the annual fee waived for another year at least
churning,not_removed,yea got the letter the other day too luckily renewal is not until end of feb so i can cash in on the travel credit again next year the card itself is pretty sick but not worth keeping for that cost
churning,not_removed,the af is dollars thats insane
churning,not_removed,might still be valuable for feeapr cash advances okay maybe not that valuable
churning,not_removed,i got denied annual spend year customer
churning,not_removed,thats gold jerry gold
churning,not_removed,if theyd let you product change to a no annual fee card it will be awesome
churning,not_removed,i think what heshe means is that the annual fee wont post until it becomes due the next time which may not be for another year
churning,not_removed,its an armani suit jerry

churning,not_removed,youre serious sign me up how come i never heard of this oh wait i did hear of it on friday when it was announced and theyd even a long thread here about this fancy that
churning,not_removed,we have a trip report thread for a reason
churning,not_removed,nice now for your next mission mr bond
churning,not_removed,are you now asking yourself now what like postdreamcompletion depression because the future just bame dimer than the past
churning,not_removed,very cool having done all which would you recommend most
churning,not_removed,you liked ek service over sq interesting
churning,not_removed,damn you actually did it i was thinking the same thing but couldnt gather enough points for my wife and i so opted for other trips sounds like you had a blast the singapore suites is still on my churning bucket list but im taking a couple years off so i can get the csr
churning,not_removed,belongs in trip report weekly but grats what is the total value for these trips
churning,not_removed,i actually have a new goal already sort of similar to omaat of trying as many business class products as possible in different airlines except he uses money to book many im using solely miles for i already have used my amex mr deltaba and united points to book business class flights on turkish jal thai ana lan virginatlantic iberia the key is to do oneway bookings only to sample as many as possible and flexibility
churning,not_removed,emirates is best mostly due to friendly service bar and heated floor showers etihad second same reasons as above slightly less on service sq suites third mostly for double bed allowing you to join the mile high club pretty easily if you take a redeye night flight cathay dont bother over business class unless you really cant afford to get caviar and krug on your own
churning,not_removed,emirates not only did the whole anniversary cakepoloroidcamera thing but our fa also custom made us an anniversary card made cute drawings of me so with nice messages and then sat down with me for about minutes to recommend fun places in dubaithailand etc sq on the other hand when i called them to see if they did any special anniversary stuff were no also the ground service in both singapore and specially transfer at frankfurt was quite frustrating due to long security lines no priority lanes in both cases for some reason onboard the service was perfectly fine as you expect from any premium cabin but it wasnt overthetop friendly as emirates
churning,not_removed,dude shut up its a quality post we need more of these
churning,not_removed,and now next time someone posts a trip report as a standalone thread and it rightly gets removed and redirected to the weekly thread theyll be asking why this one wasnt i understand wanting more visibility to share the excitement of a premium redemption but the rules are there for a reason we cant have arbitrary exceptions
churning,not_removed,i will absorb the down votes for your sins
churning,not_removed,i applied days after card but days after card and was approved just last week
churning,not_removed,is a hard pull done on autodeny violation apps yes you should be able to apply again days after may unless maybe youre applying for a citibusiness card you can only apply for one of those every days but its also subject to the rule as well so if card or was a citibusiness card and is going to be a citibusiness card you have to wait days from the most recent citibusiness app
churning,not_removed,you can apply days after card and days after card
churning,not_removed,removed please use moronic monday for this you should also start by reading the wiki httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiindexwikicitibank
churning,not_removed,i probably wont use this myself but i might suggest adding a longer sleep during the loop maybe a random number of seconds between and and a printed message indicating the sleep the script will take a while to run that way but i think both amazon and your bank would be less suspicious about transactions over minutes than transactions in under a minute
churning,not_removed,probably want to parameterize line as well driver webdriverchromeusersjustincodepackageswebdriverschromedriver
churning,not_removed,be careful for amazon shut down
churning,not_removed,i would love to see something like this for donating to a charity too i feel like everyone with a boa bbr would happily give a small amount to a charity each month
churning,not_removed,id love to write a script like this for comcast they actually allow payments of up to a day i believe perhaps something to look into as well
churning,not_removed,churnbot
churning,not_removed,this script for amex edp but on a daily basis so between hours randomly
churning,not_removed,oh wow my credit union has that requirement too why is always the magic number
churning,not_removed,great script love you guys i wonder how long before amazon raises the limit on transactions to or so
churning,not_removed,i always go to walmart self check out and scan check out x in a row for about an item each my bank requires min mo and over average im getting groceries anyway so it only takes another minute extra once a month
churning,not_removed,this is awesome been doing the allowance minimums lately but less would be great thanks
churning,not_removed,rather than storing everything as environment variables it would be great to leverage to retrieve the more sensitive parameters password cc numbers argparse to allow some user defined options would help for customization as well webdriver location number of iterations sleep delay
churning,not_removed,mah hero would it be hard to do one for google wallet
churning,not_removed,this is slick thanks for sharing
churning,not_removed,this is awesome next up would be a monthly uber giftcard purchase of for amex cards
churning,not_removed,hiya amazon started adding some new popup after you select the card asking about rewards how do we change the script to push past this
churning,not_removed,heres an automated script for buying amazon gift cards httpsgithubcomjustinjohnsogiftcardsgalore
churning,not_removed,hey there i hate to be that guy but i just tried to run the script and found that it seems to be getting stuck just after it enters the amount and before clicking the reload button a small red please revise credit or debit details message appears just below the payment method box i get the following biz in the shell window traceback most recent call last file line in module giftcardbuyer file line in giftcardbuyer driverfindelementsbyclassnamepmtsinstrumentboxclick file line in click selfexecutecommandclickelement file line in execute return selfparentexecutecommand params file line in execute selferrorhandlercheckresponseresponse file line in checkresponse raise exceptionclassmessage screen stacktrace seleniumcommonexceptionselementnotvisibleexception message element not visible session info driver info nt so i guess they changed the name of the element were looking for im going to keep poking at it but this isnt really my specialty so i figured id let you know and see if theres an obvious fix thanks
churning,not_removed,in addition to random delay lets also set to one iteration and throw it in a daily cronjob d
churning,not_removed,are there any data points on this anywhere ive been doing transactions a month for about a year and havent had any issues maybe it helps that ive been a prime member for around years
churning,not_removed,if you do multiple transactions quickly you will get shut down for sure
churning,not_removed,thats very interesting both because it means less foregone spend and an opportunity to fuck comcast over with swipe fees
churning,not_removed,my money is on sooner rather than later id go straight to
churning,not_removed,you might be thinking of the amex everyday which earns a mr multiplier after swipes per month
churning,not_removed,hmm interesting i just tested it and everything worked as it normally does i did see a banner advertising rewards but it didnt block any part of the script do you have amazon prime
churning,not_removed,fixed it and updated the code on github the script will now click the correct buttons whether or not the rewards popup appears also the path to chromedriver is now parameterized if you just want the popup hotfix add this from seleniumcommonexceptions import nosuchelementexception to the bottom of your imports line and this try driverfindelementbyxpathspanclick driverfindelementbyidasvreminderactionprimaryclick except nosuchelementexception pass just above drivergethttpswwwamazoncomasvreload
churning,not_removed,thanks for the heads up ill take a look at this when i get the chance
churning,not_removed,a month should be fine there is dp about people got shut down by doing multiple loading in one day
churning,not_removed,iirc doctor of credit posted something about being having for doing these in rapid succession a few transactions every couple days probably wouldnt hurt
churning,not_removed,iirc doctor of credit posted something about being having for doing these in rapid succession a few transactions every couple days probably wouldnt hurt
churning,not_removed,ive done several transactions monthly of under in rapid succession for the past year no shut down here
churning,not_removed,ive done in minutes for my edp and nothing went wrong
churning,not_removed,ive done cards in a sitting several times and no issues have you or someone you know been shutdown
churning,not_removed,is there any information on how far you have to go for shutdown i have a debit card that gives a nickel back per perchase reloading amazon gc in cent increments would be like off
churning,not_removed,you could pay cents times a day every day of the month to pay your full bill im sure comcast would love it d
churning,not_removed,yes im prime it appeared to work for me too but i checked my bank today and no charges listed on account i did it normally and it looks like its a reload rewards popup once i selected my choice it went away thank you
churning,not_removed,having the same problem as umistbornjedi apparently that pop up has the final load button on it and if not clicked the load wont happen i tried to alter the script to accommodate with no luck the pop up only appears sometimes not always making the script fail
churning,not_removed,thanks for the update for some reason its going through the whole process and i get proper output in console however its not making the actual purchase probably same as umistbornjedi mentioned above however all button ids match and no popup appears ill try to figure out what exactly is going on there
churning,not_removed,ill have to check that out thanks ill probably start splitting up my lmcu loads into two separate days just to be safe obviously its easier to just bust all out at once but its not worth me losing my amazon account the wife would kill me
churning,not_removed,if there is no delay in transactions from the script there is a high chance tripping either amazon or bank flags
churning,not_removed,what would make you have to do with the edp
churning,not_removed,why would you have to do
churning,not_removed,ahh that explains why i didnt see it when i reran the script did you get the id class or some other selector for the popups button writing in a conditional for the final load should allow the script to run regardless of which button shows up
churning,not_removed,so driverfindelementbyidformsubmitbuttonclick works maybe try adding a couple seconds to the sleep before drivergethttpswwwamazoncomasvreload fires at the end of the loop and does it reach the confirmation screen after it should have made a purchase ill test this on another computeraccount and see if i can replicate your issue
churning,not_removed,after transactions you earn more points
churning,not_removed,for my edp
churning,not_removed,bonus earning rates on mr
churning,not_removed,after transactions you earn more points
churning,not_removed,yep the id was asvreminderactionprimary it appears after the first button formsubmitbutton is clicked i also found that its required to wait a couple of seconds since that popup doesnt appear immediately heres what the popup looks like
churning,not_removed,whoa can you explain further or link to more info
churning,not_removed,httpswwwamericanexpresscomuscreditcardscardamexeverydaypreferred
churning,not_removed,neat thanks
churning,not_removed,that combined with the amex business platinums redemption makes it a dope groceries gas everywhere card
churning,not_removed,i have mine set to add five dollars every day so i can make sure my edp stays in the green no script necessary its a built in option on the reload screen
churning,not_removed,but you pay in annual fees to get those rates
churning,not_removed,yeah but a day is a month of foregone spend thats in rewards now you do get some from the esp and your miles may vary but its a not insignificant loss
churning,not_removed,edp pays everywhere since i use my points for airfare through biz plat so the difference is only the rest of my amazon bill goes to paying down min spend so i am missing out on some there
churning,not_removed,im not as hard core as some of yall i try to keep it pretty chill in fact ive never bought a single visa gift card
churning,not_removed,still publicly available and no need for dummy booking
churning,not_removed,the with sc is available i just completed a dummy booking to check and it shows up at the payment step
churning,not_removed,the sc is available via a dummy booking i applied earlier this month personally points
churning,not_removed,received offer for business card
churning,not_removed,is the for no spend gone forever that may have been my favorite deal
churning,not_removed,i received this offer in the mail a few days ago seems like a pretty good offer especially if youre running out of other cards to apply to
churning,not_removed,i got of the offers a few weeks back
churning,not_removed,thanks anyone know if its easy to get approved without any boa history
churning,not_removed,thanks for the link this helps a lot
churning,not_removed,ya ive heard a number of people speak highly of that deal apparently you could sign up get the miles and then cancel within days and have the annual fee charged at account inception refunded
churning,not_removed,business and personal
churning,not_removed,nope personal
churning,not_removed,youre able to sign up for and get bonuses for personal ccs at the same time with boa
churning,not_removed,yes i was just as surprised as you were when i found out
churning,not_removed,im not sure if anything changedbut both me and my fiance tried this yesterday we both have great credit and the second personal was denied even after calling recon they wouldnt budge personalbusiness worked great though
churning,not_removed,yes there was a thread a couple of days after i got them where someone said a rep told them they couldnt do multiple cards anymore this was around mid june if you want to do a search
churning,not_removed,wait how did you get matched you are the only person that i know who got marched
churning,not_removed,you got the extra i just filed a cfpb complaint because they matched me and then after i spent the additional refused to give me the miles
churning,not_removed,hopefully i can pay it back to the community somehow someday please tell us how you got matched for from i assume you had applied for with af not waived offer
churning,not_removed,met spending requirement for my chase sapphire preferred time and was able to convert to southwest pts and purchase two tickets from east coast to san diego for only the security fee trip would have been if i paid for flights in cash edit fixed improper use of k and commas
churning,not_removed,was there no last minute booking fee for united
churning,not_removed,go to uncle biffs cookies while youre here
churning,not_removed,i took the iad san route last month on united really a great redemption
churning,not_removed,was the offer you received with a waived af chase told me they couldnt match because my offer came with waived af and offer did not waive the af
churning,not_removed,congrats on the awesome redemption looks like you have almost more round trips to san diego left in value lots of envy here that you got matched to
churning,not_removed,awesome glad you succeeded
churning,not_removed,seriously op how and when did you get matched
churning,not_removed,a few people got matched in those first few days before they pulled the original links and put up real ones
churning,not_removed,im more curious how op got marched
churning,not_removed,youre making me nervous about my ink match
churning,not_removed,let me know how the cfpb complaint goes im very curious
churning,not_removed,hahaha who would spend a million dollars for two rt domestic southwest tickets kappa
churning,not_removed,im curious about this too either he has status used one of the tricks or his idea of last minute is not the same as some
churning,not_removed,agreed sooooo good
churning,not_removed,i hope you at least got matched to with increased spending
churning,not_removed,did you offer to pay the annual fee
churning,not_removed,he was probably targeted when he signed into his united account most people when signing in it showed either or for me but op should confirm
churning,not_removed,talked to my banker about the match for ink she called in and within days i had courtesy points which posted before the for min spend all verbal i couldnt even have a copy of their internal offer sheet but i did get to read it
churning,not_removed,im a datapoint for asking and getting the matched after my ink minimum spend no fuss
churning,not_removed,ha thanks fixed
churning,not_removed,what tricks
churning,not_removed,yep would have happily paid for points said they couldnt do it it was something like three weeks after i signed up for the offer too apparently they took a hard line on this specific situationoffer
churning,not_removed,i applied for was targeted for but chase wouldnt match
churning,not_removed,i have the verbal match but only just crossed so dont have the points yet
churning,not_removed,book the same flight days out and within the first call and change flight to the days itinerary and hope you dont get charged the close in booking fee never used this myself so take that with a big ymmv
churning,not_removed,i had the same issue i signed up for noaf and they said the had af then they ended up charging me the af anyway after complaining loudly they took the af off
churning,not_removed,same
churning,not_removed,same as me im extra curious how op got approved for the match
churning,not_removed,youll be fine the united is the only offer chase didnt match
churning,not_removed,start redeeming my hard earned pointsover million to use focus on cashback for my ms identify low hanging fruitdeals for points and miles donate of my milespoints earned in i read the postsstory and was really inspired to think outside of me good luck
churning,not_removed,find an ms unicorn in my area and keep my mouth shut about it
churning,not_removed,i want to be that ms guy from the front page today would be amazing to churn myself a new car in a week or two i guess ill settle for a csr preapproval spg business round trip business class or better to japan this is my first year being serious about credit cards and i earned a little over miles doing the same amount or better next year would be great
churning,not_removed,im shooting for net value in earnings combining cash travel redemptions etc less annual fees id also like to do more bank account bonuses most importantly i want to start doing some good with my miles and points im gonna buy a bunch of canned goods at rite aid using plenti points transferred from mr to donate to the food bank and ill try to cover flights for some family members as well
churning,not_removed,csr is chase ever dumps
churning,not_removed,japan
churning,not_removed,learning how to ms
churning,not_removed,status goals earn at least amtrak guest rewards select status that will also get me hhonors gold earn spg marriott gold cards to acquire amex ed green gold easy mr to snatch up boa agr platinum mastercard as business there are other ones i just havent planned that far out yet travel goals crosscountry amtrak trip accomplish what i originally wanted from this hobby in a way to get a free hotel room for a nerd convention i regularly attend finally feasible now that i have the csr i posted almost an identical thread a few weeks ago but it was immediately removed for possibly breaking rule i messaged the mods but never heard anything what no of course im not bitter
churning,not_removed,my twin daughters start daycare on january my goal is to have each daycare payment count toward a credit card sign up bonus i have a couple of chase disney cards lined up they just dont take american express
churning,not_removed,csr monthly checks in branch and onine otherwise gonna focus on business cards this year will be going for amex plat first have a nice little stash of mr and want to have the bonus for the business plat when i redeem outside any new amazing deals i will try to lay low this year and get into good graces with chase so i can apply hopefully for the new ink and csr ur is a nice goal i think plus i am hoping chase will intro another new card after the csr success with any luck some of the other banks will want to get in on it too so im optimistic about the new year
churning,not_removed,hit the million mile per year get involved in bank bonuses ms regularly currently doing only to meet the minimum spend
churning,not_removed,cool off apps for months so i can get it on with citi in the meantime step up the ms game to maximize all my rotating categories also i gotta find more liquidation routes start developing my portalstackingfu possibly dip my toes into reselling
churning,not_removed,getting the southwest companion pass before summer
churning,not_removed,get the csr card when i fly into sd attempt of inbranch preappoval my wife and i are also talking about a vegas trip for a friend of hers who turns in april im also trying to attempt to squeeze in a cruise in late febearly march time isnt an issue on my end unlimited vacation days yay start up it agencies but i have kids so child care typically wipes out any value i get from traveling with my wife argh
churning,not_removed,end of january have credit inquiry fall off and apply for freedom end of february apply for chase ink cash first and then apply for spg some time in get into the mr world everyday platinum upgrade and get into citi ty world rest of the year max out grocery spend on blue cash preferred churn the f out of the spg pray that spg doesnt change max out rotating categories on both the freedom and discover it max out office supply spend on chase ink cash learn new churning techniques
churning,not_removed,now that i have all these points actually find time to travel
churning,not_removed,all the cards
churning,not_removed,redeem many points earned in and early
churning,not_removed,keep msing even though im going to have a lot less free time whenever theres a good opportunity max all categories on freedom and discover with year doubling dont miss any easy deals or point earning opportunities ihg priceless surprises aa loophole cards etc and i want to get approved for the freaking arrival
churning,not_removed,i have no extra vacation days to plan extra travel until august i calculated it out and after my two week trip to eastern europe in august i will have hours of vacation time leftover so my main goal is to stockpile points across the board and to take advantage of the fact that i get every other friday off to hike more and maybe get into backpacking i also want to get into casual ms because im not a big organic spender and im playing the churning game in single player mode so i could use a bit of a boost in earning
churning,not_removed,trip to germany and netherlands in the spring has been covered with an assortment of skypesos spg and hilton points and a bit of airbnb next goal is accruing points to use for lodging in china for possibly fall
churning,not_removed,amex plat and any other mrs havent dabbled in that currency yet
churning,not_removed,cash is king goals are bankbrokerage bonuses credit card bonuses and through amex offers portal bonuses etc will essentially be a cleanup of any cards i skipped over or was denied in planning to get csr merrill arrival plus venture and mb plat in that order i will then lie in wait for months before i attempt to storm the beaches of us bank after my defeat earlier this year hopefully once i have a toehold i can set the stage for future cards through cl shuffling that should get me to september if all goes well by which time i assume a few new profitable offers will be unveiled like any good battle plan im willing to change any part of the plan if better options appear or if my assumptions are proven wrong
churning,not_removed,because writing it down somewhere motivates us apply for as many cards as i can afford fees im never going be again so unless i get targeted for certain cards ink preferred united marriott p gotta wait a year more to try to get preapproved for csp scale up on reselling ms and maybe turn that into a business i was limited by not having a car but ill slowly work up so i can either rent regularly or save up for a car start applying for bank bonuses not enough liquid observation spending more seems to up my inks limits significantly
churning,not_removed,loved the hyvee gift card frenzy i could have easily met my spend on my new boa ml card but i chose not to do that would like at least bbrs for more passive income my so will be eligible this summer which is awesome plan on checking in branch every few weeks for csr for me only have ihg and aarp now debating on the amex ebp for better mr redemption rates for flights for the times im not using non rev positive space with friends on as or we have short notice have over mrs after a ton of macys shopping and retailmenot rebates and part of me says cash out half of them but dont want to deal with the risks have to decide if i want to apply for or upgrade ed to edp maybe app for brg waiting on so to get upgrade offer on amex hhonors to surpass been almost months no offer in sight spg biz would be great especially for amtrak spending like crazy on the spg until when possible for small biz month etc would like to broaden my cu exposure not only doing more bank account sign on bonuses but finding random lesser known banks that have apy i also want to get into lending robot a little more for passive income possibly motif investing definitely slowing down on apps is a lot and still in shock boa approved me for ml i think after that and hyvee its a sign i need to get in gear before its too late
churning,not_removed,early this year i want to focus on accumulating hotel pointsnights i went really hard on most of the best airlineflexible point signup bonuses in knowing that i wanted to travel for a couple months before starting a company in so im sitting on airline miles even after a few great redemptions in i only have hotel nights hyatt anywhere hilton points right now so i want to add to that as much as possible so that in addition to airfare most of my hotels on that trip are covered that trip will essentially be aroundtheworld minus africa and after that i expect ill be pretty heads down trying to get a company off the ground given that ill probably be spending as little money as possible and thus applying for cards much less rapidly compared to cards first year of churning once i settle down after that long trip ill probably just try to take advantage of whatever lowhanging fruit is available to get me free domestic flights since its been pretty nice not to buy any in a long time of course if a loophole that lets me get csr pops up ill be jumping on that asap
churning,not_removed,earlier this year i was waiting to get under i then hit csp again got lucky in my timing with the csr and last month i went through marriot hyatt and ihg next year go through all amex and citi cards i am not sure how long the sign up bonuses game will last and i want to ride that train till it stops
churning,not_removed,its a long game year for me my work situation is really bad for time off so i need to come to terms with that plus i am going to be buying a house also have a bunch of inquiries coming off in april so i am laying pretty low til then i may grab a chase for husband hes atm over the rest of the year ill be picking up the schwab plat to turn my mrs into brokerage deposit ill be cancelling the citi aa likely the amex hilton and biz gold and the almost definitely the chase marriott and ihg and cutting loose a couple boa alaskas trying to downgrade the prestige maybe and turning sos csp to a freedom given that i end up paying for flights to accommodate my ridiculous work restrictions idk what cards we will be grabbing im sitting on more points than i care to most urmrspg though i do have a hefty stash of marriott points that should probably just become spg i dont want to get into ms but i will make an effort to max out rotating categories amex offers and other deals and with the mortgage out of the way can do another bank bonuses
churning,not_removed,ms jetblue mosaic i fly them frequently enough that the nochangecancellation fees would be useful might be able to use for status match elsewhere too what status is most useful that can be msd that you dont just get with a cc signup
churning,not_removed,apply for csr in march ill be under by then i guess the good thing that came from is that it prevented me from signing up for cards just because i still have points leftover so its not like i needed more points it definitely has grounded me lol
churning,not_removed,my goals are to enjoy the trips i have planned from japan in hanami with my husband taking a friend to rome who couldnt afford it otherwise this year im setting up which is my brothers dream of taking his son to oktoberfest in munich neither have been off the continent and i offered my brother anywhere so well all go there even though im the one person on the planet who doesnt like the taste of beer would love advice on hotel redemptions in that insanity as i am already good on airfare
churning,not_removed,break ur stay under
churning,not_removed,reselling diversifying my ms status mileage runs miles and points
churning,not_removed,toe dip into ms with serve to bill pay dont know if it qualifies as ms really but its seems easy pretty straightforward
churning,not_removed,current plansgoals greatly appreciate any suggested edits planning a trip to paris french open and barcelona primavera fest will use milescash ive earned with venture and bcp going to apply for arrival next week and will hopefully use the bonus from that as well all of that should make the trip extremely cheap csp early next year and then csr after june back to to double dip for a trip in find more vgc liquidation outlets find some way to have ms make a dent in student loans suggestions definitely welcome
churning,not_removed,get companion pass as early as possible utilize the cp for fun trips have at least one big redemption for europe and find a great deal to get there value in points earned not a big amount but it would be bigger than the net i had this year
churning,not_removed,buy a fucking house so i can finally start churning again bos hkg all around east asia with wife to meet some inlaws and party it up
churning,not_removed,we are targeting the sw cp my husband just got the first of the chase sw cards will get the in a month or two
churning,not_removed,use ur points to take my mom to see mtrushmore its her dream use ur points for a flight to sfo and backpack the lost coast get the csr once im back to around june saving to buy a used truck and camper to travel all over uscanada start experimenting with buying money orders to churn
churning,not_removed,unfortunately mine are extra tame since ill have a house purchase in early get ink and one other chase card in march probably the marriott then stop with new cardssigh learn how to ms get into the new bank account bonus churn game avoiding those hard pull accounts of course keep my csr and pc my csp to cfu before the af hits eagerly await when ill hit the ground running full speed since ill be at that point
churning,not_removed,be around when the next amex plat link drops i am flying from phl to split croatia next summer so hopefully i will be able to rack up enough points for a round trip
churning,not_removed,i just returned from an epic month backpacking trip in south america saved a ton of money thanks to rchurning so my immediate goals are pretty modest get in on the mr typ game new to both programs and way over get my so the companion pass shes toein at this point but has given me the green light to make it happen asap get to iceland vietnam
churning,not_removed,enjoy the hard work of i have trips planned using miles or points every month out until july with the exception of march and june still sitting on sw miles with the cp with trips already booked so definitely trying to use them all before the end of
churning,not_removed,did csr and csp late last year and got the bonuses getting the southwest cp asap in both cards in the mail already then me and the girl are going to take some trips
churning,not_removed,taking a trip to italy w my grandpa for his birthday he just signed up for the csr to pay his part then seriously contemplating going remote for a few years so figuring out how to get the absolute most miles for my gf and i to subsidize at least the travel part of the expenses
churning,not_removed,crank up my churn started in november and between some pretty large org spend and recently dipping into ms it seems ill be able to go through at least a card a month want to see how far i can take it booked a flight for europepre churn though so im going to try and make a few trips here and there to visit friends and finally travel a bit more
churning,not_removed,i want to find a bank that would let me open bank accounts using a credit card in increments
churning,not_removed,my goal is a month worth of giftcards netting around wish me luck
churning,not_removed,im nearing the end of getting all the miles for my first redemption will be trying to book rt businessfirst to maldives along with either the park hyatt or conrad have enough points for flights and hyatt aiming for the conrad though
churning,not_removed,new here so i guess learning the biz as much as possible im going to new zealand for school so that is covering my first ever ms on a cc venture after that trip in march maybe cancel that card and move on to something with better points
churning,not_removed,i am brand new so basicallyread and read more about churning and all the subtopics i am going to dubai uae in march and my wife and i would love to fly business class on points wish me luck
churning,not_removed,use one of the chase freedom signup bonus to get off of my new google pixel purchase never had one of the freedom cards even though they are the entrylevel can i combine hard pulls for both freedom and fu if i apply at the same time currently
churning,not_removed,get started full on churning so i can reap all the benefits
churning,not_removed,gotta learn to ms
churning,not_removed,how long did it take you to get million
churning,not_removed,awesome edit im hoping to post a update in the next couple of weeks
churning,not_removed,my goals are pretty similar have about pts right now and no longer trying to get cards plenty of other great deals pop up unexpectedly like aa loophole used to be or ihg priceless surprises last year just trying to be an expert at redemption values
churning,not_removed,i just read that and it blows my mind
churning,not_removed,that was amazing to read
churning,not_removed,link please im not seeing it
churning,not_removed,so i know the food can donation idea is amazing and it is but please please ask your food pantry what they need they are often overloaded with canned food and often they may need other things that you can still get at rite aid such as womens care products toilet paper and paper towels and many other products as someone who has had to organize around bazillion cans of green beans you can do so much more good if you just ask what they need
churning,not_removed,just read doctorofcredit daily and you should be just fine well and here too
churning,not_removed,have you checked for preapproval
churning,not_removed,man listen please drop that stupid
churning,not_removed,i just got back from japan a few weeks ago using delta skypesos i enjoyed it so much im planning on going back in april using aa miles
churning,not_removed,this was my first serious redemption besides a long weekend to new york through citis portal it was incredible
churning,not_removed,for bbserve for mos basically same process but buy a mo instead of going to cashier and then deposit mo at your a bank be smart with this some banks care ymmv
churning,not_removed,i too want to learn
churning,not_removed,ping me if you have any basic amtrak questions i fell into this hobby back when i discovered ur transferred to amtrak please give a moment of silence for that redemption option ive spent a decent amount of time in the sleepers
churning,not_removed,kudos fellow amtraker do you already have the wmc can you apply for multiple amtrak cards aside form the regular you get in on the wmc bonus
churning,not_removed,im really curious as to what the mcc will show up as
churning,not_removed,i am insanely jealous that your daycare takes credit were paying now that is around and man so many missed bonuses and no they wont take money orders
churning,not_removed,branch out strategically on your ms if you do min spend only now next add rolling bonuses on freedom and discover next keeps margins high and better use of your time
churning,not_removed,i really wish we had solid evidence spg amex wasnt going to change i love the card but i dont like them changing the transfer partners what happened to the rumored chase spg card
churning,not_removed,why do you want to apply for the freedom sounds like youre fairly into it already so id think you have better options if you dont have csp or csr already get one of those instead if you already have one of these do a pc to the freedom saving you a hard pull and a hit to
churning,not_removed,and keep those cash bonuses in a high yield checking
churning,not_removed,read read then read more wiki guides daily posts then post in the what card wednesday post
churning,not_removed,s
churning,not_removed,my eyes my eyes op pls
churning,not_removed,please god no csrcsp then pc the csp to f or fu
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,couple of days
churning,not_removed,quite frankly that guy is exception to the norm he worked at hyvee for a long time so people probably knew him at the store if i did that volume id probably have the cops called on me i like a hussle that ms brings but not to the level that he was doing it especially liquidation methods are dwindling ill be happy if i can hit about per month
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,yeah youre right i should i was just gonna get canned soup mostly as thats cheap fairly nutrititious and easy but ill give them a call thanks for the suggestion
churning,not_removed,when i was in nyc i did no go nearest chase branch is like miles away
churning,not_removed,i love japan it was my first overseas trip aside from mexico and i couldnt wait to go back i went months later that was years ago and never forgot it been there three more times since
churning,not_removed,fyi ana gives you biz class na to tokyo for miles and i believe they are transferable from mr and urs
churning,not_removed,id love to get to japan at some point do you have any pointers on where to start did you follow any travel adviceblogs
churning,not_removed,thanks for the writeup and link
churning,not_removed,start small and go vgcmo route
churning,not_removed,manufactured spending check out the wiki or the weekly threads on the sidebar
churning,not_removed,theres a list of abbreviations in the wiki httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiglossary manufactured spending
churning,not_removed,is silent for a moment of commiseration i got into this hobby literally the month before the transfer option expired have you ever redeemed for a usa rail pass im thinking that and using points to upgrade to sleepers if thats possible might the most efficient use of points for a crosscountry trip
churning,not_removed,just got it back in november really wish i got it earlier this yearmaking select status would have been easy spent over on amtrak tickets since august most of which i was reimbursed for but getting the bonus almost makes up for that i havent researched dps on getting more than of each agr card at once
churning,not_removed,what about debit cards vgc otherwise that sucks
churning,not_removed,i want freedom because i want a af card that earns back on rotating categories i already have the csr and my only other chase card is the freedom unlimited which i was approved for on wednesday so a pc is not going to happen im trying to get the chase quadfecta csr freedom fu ink before i get any other card because of
churning,not_removed,transfer to ke and af for economy to europe transfer to united for economy to china
churning,not_removed,ive done a bit of gift card arbitrage but i want to start probably with electronics ipads and what not
churning,not_removed,ive also got aa as united and ba so im well stocked for a while im planning on just hanging out till feb when im at and hitting chase up for csr csp and united card
churning,not_removed,yeah im pumped about all of it thinking of some bike riding in the dolomites time in wine country and visiting florence venice and rome
churning,not_removed,i sure hope so
churning,not_removed,kinda hard to hit a major league homer run if they dont let you even hold the bat
churning,not_removed,wait can i not apply for freedom and then apply csp later
churning,not_removed,thought u had to pc the csp or csr to cs then fu then f
churning,not_removed,yeah it was a pretty crazy amount i do recall though that people were reaching also reaching crazy amounts with the wells fargo card its just crazy to think how much is possible with a lot of knowledge and a bit of luck
churning,not_removed,id probably have the cops called on me what would the cops even do
churning,not_removed,oh that i thought it was one from the reddit home page thanks though
churning,not_removed,im assuming you saw the way to seemingly check for preapproval on the chase site
churning,not_removed,thanks ill look into it
churning,not_removed,the parts unknown episode on tokyo was a big influence on me deciding to go and then a few other anthony bourdain shows gave me more ideas i did get a guidebook on tokyo but didnt end up reading much of it and didnt bring it with i went during fall so i went to a lot of parks and shrines for some leaf spotting so i just looked up best leaf locations i kind of just absorbed things and made notes as i came across things in the months leading up to trip im a big music fan and i love cocktails so i just searched tokyo in rvinyl raudiophile and rcocktails and that lead me to some places so id recommend doing the same for your hobbies i love food and while i had a few restaurants in mind i also wanted to allow myself to explore and discover some specifics id recommend in tokyo rikugien garden koishikawa korakuen garden tsukiji market thats moving soon though golden gai omoide yokocho or nonbei yokocho for kyoto fushimi inari go early you dont need to go all the way to the top theres no view that high but you can get an incredible view of kyoto a bit before the top kiyomizudera kinkakuji and arashiyama were cool but way too crowded for my liking but i went in the afternoon at peak time so again probably go early sorry this got way too long this trip was just a month ago and im still riding the high
churning,not_removed,i think bbserve is easier for a newb
churning,not_removed,any vgc with a pin i remember someone saying there was some catch with vanilla cards but i didnt have the context to understand what they meant
churning,not_removed,i have not i was more focussed on using the region break towns for stopovers because the redemptions were broken into three regions when urs transferred cities on the borders would give you the better region for that redemption and it got to the point where i had them memorized it makes me wonder if i might have been one of the reasons for them changing the redemption charts
churning,not_removed,what about doing it like the alaska cards not apping for them at the same time say i app for the platinum card thats a no brainer but if i downgrade my curent wmc would i lose my bogo and biz upgrade wonder what would happen if i appd for plat downgraded wmc then app for a new wmc do you consider doing any mariott to spg to amtrak transfers or amex mr to spg to amtrak jan was a bad day for me but i am so glad they brought back the cards but will be crushed if spg loses amtrak as a partner the rumored chase spg card makes me wonder
churning,not_removed,why not get the csp for the signup bonus then pc in a year the sign up bonus is easily worth more than the youll earn from the categories the first year and a lot less work to boot
churning,not_removed,well assuming this isnt s good chance at getting csp and then try for csr right after they already have two high end amex cards so probably a decent applicant
churning,not_removed,you can its just a waste of a chase slot
churning,not_removed,only if you want to pc in under a year
churning,not_removed,dont forget time i live in a fairly populated area so we have plenty of post offices walmarts cvs etc but it still takes time out of your day to drive to these places to do the sheer volume that he did requires hitting up several places it becomes a part time job people should keep that in mind and dont assume it comes with no effort or time spent away from your family and friends i personally cant do what he did and even shy away from some of the office depot deals because i dont want to deal with how much time it takes im comfortable just hitting up a new card signup bonus every month doing it the lazy way through nwbuxx
churning,not_removed,at the very least they hassle you some other guy had an irs agent called to interview him sure no crimes are being committed but the only way to deescalate the situation is to voluntarily answer their questions and explain an entire afternoon explaining what ms is and how its completely legal
churning,not_removed,i can see how that was confusing i meant the churning front page haha
churning,not_removed,still better to go in person i had nothing over the internet but in branch i still got my preapproval thank god because i am about
churning,not_removed,awesome thank you for sharing
churning,not_removed,wow thank you so much for this the search within subreddits is an amazing idea will definitely check out that parts unknown episode and all those places you mentioned as well
churning,not_removed,vanilla cards dont work well at limit on a transaction you want to get metabank issued vgcs
churning,not_removed,i accidently applied for both the csr and csp on the same dayim an idiot and accidently did csp when i meant csr and had to verify both eventually got approved for both but when i ran my credit score chase wasnt on there wtf was that all about
churning,not_removed,hey thats me you are so right about it turning into a part time job i probably spent a total of hours during days driving to stores and getting gift cards i did my first mo run took a little over an hour to get bluebirdserve loads will probably be similar ill probably end up spending close to hours throughout the whole process so close to an hour salary i even said to my buddy if i was in a relationship there is no way i could have done this
churning,not_removed,did you do anything other than just go into a branch and ask if you are preapproved for any cards
churning,not_removed,great to know thanks
churning,not_removed,u go guy i have shown your story to so many people so inspiring
churning,not_removed,pretty good salary its pretty inspirational tbh that could cover a whole lot of vacation haha
churning,not_removed,yes just ask to talk to a banker not the tellers in the window
churning,not_removed,sure ill take one if there isnt any interest or you find extra i could use another and set up an account for my wife too thanks for posting
churning,not_removed,ill take one please thanks a lot
churning,not_removed,ill take one
churning,not_removed,fyi for those of you who hold chase card you may get this coupon online eventually i have chase freedom and i got this offer last january
churning,not_removed,mine says coupon code does not work for my zip code anyone else with that issue the zip code is for ft worth tx
churning,not_removed,these are inbranch only never heard of that issue these get passed aroundsold on ebay all the time
churning,not_removed,drat guess ill pass this along to my dad so it should work to open in branch in texas
churning,not_removed,should be no problem
churning,not_removed,now spirit will add a precheck fee
churning,not_removed,the are aruba airlines avianca boutique airlines emirates key lime air miami air international southern airways express spirit airlines sunwing virgin atlantic xtra airways i can confirm that the change is already effective i was able to add my ktn when checking into a spirit flight thursday night for friday travel
churning,not_removed,til miami has their own airlines
churning,not_removed,spirit airlines blows but i fly them fairly regularly as they have super cheap flights from bos myr where my in laws are ive gone round trip with a family of for including one checked bag i cant complain about that and without a layover its usually ok
churning,not_removed,i am glad emirates was added to the list i was going to be annoyed next week since i have an international ticket with jetblue as the first leg and emirates as the leg i would have precheck for jetblue but not for emirates when i switch from the domestic terminal to international
churning,not_removed,thanks for the heads up glad to see emirates added to the program i was disappointed last time i flew emirates that i couldnt use tsa precheck
churning,not_removed,when did frontier sneak in they arent one of the new ones but they sure as hell havent had it all this time
churning,not_removed,wait so precheck is for five years isnt global entry a one time application fee
churning,not_removed,for those of you with precheck it is worth your time to log in to your accounts with these airlines to add your precheck info known traveler number to your account so it is automatically applied to any flights with that airline
churning,not_removed,if you have global entry does it matter which airline you fly cant you just show them your global entry card
churning,not_removed,i assume the answer to this is no but if you redeem a partner award using miles on an eligible airline to travel on metal for an ineligible airline can you get precheck on your boarding pass if you check in through the eligible airline
churning,not_removed,joymore people to crowd the precheck line and clog it up like the regular line if you have metal on you remove it otherwise leave everything else on and move people if everyone is going to end up in precheck bring back diamond square and circle lines to help differentiate your flying skill level
churning,not_removed,when are they going to let foreigners sign up for this
churning,not_removed,who else do you guys hope will be added next
churning,not_removed,good news just used my csr for pre check
churning,not_removed,kinda wish spirit wasnt added i swear every time i fly the precheck line is just as long as the regular line and i have a feeling spirit passengers will just gum it up more
churning,not_removed,revised headline additional airlines have agreed to share data with the dhs
churning,not_removed,flew spirit with precheck on thursday the ktn option came up during the check in process and was free wouldnt put it past spirit to charge in the future
churning,not_removed,im sure everybody is jumping for joy at the addition of key lime air
churning,not_removed,allegiant wasnt part of the program at my airport now they are listed
churning,not_removed,i swear airlines are getting more creative with names than the credit card companies
churning,not_removed,avianca no need to get screened coming from colombia
churning,not_removed,think you meant etihad not emirates couldnt see the latter on the list
churning,not_removed,only country americans dont need a passport to fly to
churning,not_removed,airlines generally gave it to their elites so they should fly enough to know how pre differs
churning,not_removed,didnt they stop randomly sending people into the precheck line
churning,not_removed,they definitely serve a purpose just know that you get a barebones experience and then you can be happy with getting a flight
churning,not_removed,what airport in the us requires you to go through security again i did not realize that there were still some that do thta
churning,not_removed,given that your reservation was made before emirates was participating id call emirates and confirm that they have your ktn associated with their reservation jetblue may not have transmitted your ktn to emirates since there was no reason to when you booked
churning,not_removed,im flying emirates in a few weeks but theres nowhere to add my ktn do they have an official join date
churning,not_removed,it has to be on your boarding pass your number is useless once youre at security
churning,not_removed,keep calling its new enough that it may not have filtered through to everyone at emirates yet
churning,not_removed,a few months ago
churning,not_removed,global entry also lasts five years
churning,not_removed,you still have to enter your known traveler in advance showing your global entry card does nothing anywhere except for the mexicous border by foot or in a passenger car where all other passengers also have global entry cards
churning,not_removed,you need to have precheck on your boarding pass to get the benefit which you need to provide the airline with your ktn beforehand you can still show the card but it wouldnt really do anything else besides count as a form of id
churning,not_removed,nope the tsa does not give you access to precheck based on your ge card it has to be printed on your boarding pass
churning,not_removed,thats not how any of this works
churning,not_removed,no
churning,not_removed,im thinking spirit passengers have precheck at a lower rate than most other carriers also the line being the same length doesnt make it the same since it is moving faster and because most appreciate keeping their shoes on in public
churning,not_removed,but its faster so it may not be so bad i flew out of dtw last week and noticed the precheck line was longer than the regular line albeit not by much both lines were really short i still got through precheck before the last person in the regular line
churning,not_removed,hahahahaha cute this data is already all shared with dhs the tsa scans every ticket before security and compares it to your id precheck is just a reward for those of us whove handed all our data over already
churning,not_removed,lol tsa probably prohibits that im sure theyd like to though
churning,not_removed,never flown with them how would it be for a flight from dfw to ord
churning,not_removed,hey they make great dessert so how bad can the airline be
churning,not_removed,etihad is on the list of airlines that were already participating in the program emirates just joined the program
churning,not_removed,miami isnt a country
churning,not_removed,stuffthatpig is specifically talking about the random people that get precheck access sometimes
churning,not_removed,my dad flew virgin america recently and upgraded himself to first class he got tsa pre added on to his ticket after one time using it he signed up for the program ive had it for a couple years and its worth every penny
churning,not_removed,i flew southwest with my mother last week she was randomly given precheck on the way out but not on the way back she mucked it up both times by the way then i got stuck behind a group of in the precheck line who had never used it before i knew i was in trouble when i noticed two giant water bottles sticking out of either side of one guys backpack
churning,not_removed,jfk sfo lax are all missing airside connections between some terminals probably others as well
churning,not_removed,if you have to change terminals you have to go through security again if the terminals are not connected i have to do that for my pvdjfkinternational my last trip for example last month i did pvd to jfk on jetblue and from jfk to sgn on korean airlines all on one international ticket so that involves a terminal change jetblue drop me off at one of the domestic terminals and then i had to go through an international terminal thus go through security again jetblue had precheck but korean airlines did not it was a longggg wait to go through security at the international terminal on my return trip korean airlines gave me my boarding pass for both flights ke and jb and jb didnt have precheck on it so i had to get a new boarding pass at jfk just so i can go through precheck
churning,not_removed,just give them a call or message to add it
churning,not_removed,a lot of airlines will let you add it when you check in i agree with the other posters suggestions to call though
churning,not_removed,you might have to call in and ymmv some emirates phone agents are better trained then others if you say tsa precheck and they have no clue what youre talking about then huca
churning,not_removed,if you can time it to get it right after your birthday it lasts closer to six the expiration date is tied to your birthday i got it in a few months after my birthday not even intending to line it up this way and the person doing the interview mentioned that id have closer to six years because of when i got it
churning,not_removed,it is definitely worth the extra if you will maybe fly international even once during those five years
churning,not_removed,nexus gives you global entry and precheck and is only for five years now if theyll just hurry and approve my application
churning,not_removed,oh i guess i missed that last time i was looking at it
churning,not_removed,also works for the canadaus border but only when youre coming back to the us everyone in the car would also need ge
churning,not_removed,thanks for the info i was wondering what the card was for
churning,not_removed,you need the ge card to access the canadian version of pre check
churning,not_removed,doesnt the global entry card actually allow you to do the simplified customs process when coming back from an international trip in this case the card is actually useful just not for precheck nevermind
churning,not_removed,there was a reason i was asking these questions i didnt know if the process with global entry was different so i asked for clarification you comment is as unhelpful as it could be literally provided no other info other then saying your wrong
churning,not_removed,i actually dont mind spirit when the conditions are right can travel with a backpack short legs like mspord dfw you have to play their game google thriftiest fliers outwit feehungry airlines and choose the wsj article its dated but lays out a lot of nice tricks
churning,not_removed,never fly spirit
churning,not_removed,they make spirit look like air emirates
churning,not_removed,ah yes youre right sorry misread the announcement on the tsa website
churning,not_removed,when was the last time you were there spanish is the official language and if youre white you will be in the minority unless youre in select areas
churning,not_removed,my dad got shuffled to the precheck line once and actually complained about it i didnt know what to do everyone was yelling at me i didnt know i could leave my shoes and belt on
churning,not_removed,correct me if im wrong but airlines such as jetblue also offer expedited security for an extra fee or certain ticket type which gives passengers access to pre as well
churning,not_removed,ord as well between and
churning,not_removed,jfk sfo lax gotcha i guess i was lucky when i flew international jfk the one time and had two terminals that were connected or i just cannot remember guess i will try and stick with dfw and iah to avoid the double security being a nonwhite american going through security always stresses me out the random screenings and bag checks each time i go through security at one of the larger airports definitely dont help
churning,not_removed,ewr does it even if you are in the same terminal fuckers
churning,not_removed,yep thanks to the long delays for getting a global entry interview i ended up having my interview the week after my birthday im glad now that it took so long because i basically gained an extra free year compared to if my interview had been a week earlier
churning,not_removed,if only i lived near a border
churning,not_removed,precheck and ge are reimbursed by a lot of cards but i dont think there is any that reimburse for nexus or sentri
churning,not_removed,i was at yvr coming back to the us yesterday and while the passport control worked with my global entry just fine i couldnt use the global entrynexus line to go through security since i didnt have my global entry card with me which i was confused about because i thought the card is useless if youre coming back by air but im not sure if there would have been any difference such as not having to take off shoes if id had the card yvr was pretty dead while i was there though so not sure if it would make a practical difference in terms of a shorter wait or something to have access to the global entry line even if the airport were busy
churning,not_removed,also helped me jump in front of the immigration line at abu dhabi while returning to us
churning,not_removed,you use the global entry kiosk when returning clearing customs coming back to the us for that you just need your passport
churning,not_removed,key lime air is really nice though
churning,not_removed,since when was it a prerequisite that an american city be predominantly white
churning,not_removed,spanish is the official language no its not though it is the primary official language of puerto rico another place that other americans can fly to without a passport
churning,not_removed,can confirm felt really weird to be in the states and have someone start speaking in spanish to me before realizing that i had no idea what they were saying its sort of like a really nice spanish speaking country inside of the us for sure
churning,not_removed,even if youre that guy that flies once in a blue moon at least if youve signed up you should know what to do its the random ones that dont expect it thatll start messing things up
churning,not_removed,on the flip side ive had plenty of situations at lax where theyre not running precheck and dont properly communicate whats going on to the precheck passengers at lax this is a big problem because a lot of laxs busiest departures hours are early morning and late night not in the middle of the day yet they seem to only run precheck during standard business hours what happens is that they still have a separate precheck line but you get funneled into the same queue as everyone else after your id and boarding pass are checked they announce that laptops have to come out even if youre precheck but they never announce that liquids have to come out too one time they didnt even bother announcing that laptops had to come out as you might expect this reliably results in them overwhelming themselves with secondary manual bag checks from precheck passengers who packed like precheck passengers and didnt remove their liquids from their bags because the tsa agents didnt bother to announce that liquids need to come out for everyone
churning,not_removed,read the fucking signs that are posted up everywhere including the waiting line for tsa
churning,not_removed,it doesnt give them pre access just cut the line they still ahve to take out computers and shoes
churning,not_removed,priority security is different from pre there are no priority lines with pre you cannot pay for oneoff access to the pre lilne
churning,not_removed,i must be going crazy because i do not remember though only have flown out of maybe times
churning,not_removed,it depends if you are flying one airline or codeshare jetblue is exclusively at jfk and they codeshare with emirates which is in a separate and unconnected terminal i have a few international flights this year and was looking at a jbemirates trip so this is timely for me
churning,not_removed,i flew stlewrlhr back in october and didnt have to go through security again i had to take a bus to get to my ewrlhr gate so i dont think it was even the same terminal if youre thinking the other way around international to domestic connections then you will always have to go through security again no matter what the airport layout is
churning,not_removed,what ive never seen having to go back through security at ewr for same terminal
churning,not_removed,the enrollment center is just six miles away from me seattle
churning,not_removed,tell me about it it makes no sense at all dear card issuers you can give me a better benefit for half the cost with basically no extra effort just do it
churning,not_removed,global entry gives you precheck and nexus its well worth the money
churning,not_removed,sssssh if you say that too loudly everyone will know and theyll be able to charge more for airfare
churning,not_removed,its not but compared to many major cities you do not feel as much in the minority as you do in miami
churning,not_removed,i was being facetious if you ever are in miami people will initially speak spanish to you even places like target checkout line regardless of the law that states english is the official language of florida miami is a great place but i do have an issue with the large groups that make it a point to not learn english and have been living there for years
churning,not_removed,i rented a car in downtown miami and not a single person in the building spoke english its a very strange place
churning,not_removed,not pertinent to your post but something i noticed recently that i felt was odd flying out of midway going through non precheck line instructed to leave shoes on and laptops in bag this was on january i believe still having holiday travelers high volume
churning,not_removed,i learned two days ago that houstonhobby closes down precheck after or pm i was there at pm and it was dead but it was still annoying that i had to take my laptop out the struggle
churning,not_removed,wait you are right i think ewr priority pass lounge is outside security thats why i had to go through again
churning,not_removed,itll be quite a wait last time i checked seas center had a three month backlog blaine was immediately available though
churning,not_removed,whats too bad is that nexus expedites getting in to canada too right not that it was particularly slow at yvr last week
churning,not_removed,american express refunded my nexus charge just fine
churning,not_removed,global entry does not give you nexus nexus comes with ge not the other way around
churning,not_removed,global entry doesnt give you nexus for instance only nexus expedites getting in to canada however the benefits of the two are pretty close to each other
churning,not_removed,huh it seems to be a chartered service
churning,not_removed,i feel like a minority there because im not cocaine
churning,not_removed,of miami is hispanic you can get along perfectly fine not speaking english in the city i wouldnt go to a chinatown and expect even good english at many of the places as generations are further removed from the immigrant one they will assimilate into the american culture and language
churning,not_removed,ord did this too last summer every thursday between and was all lanes precheck
churning,not_removed,yup the pp lounge is not airside at ewr
churning,not_removed,ive heard its sometimes gotten up to six months though if you keep looking for cancellations its often possible to get in within a few weeks my next international trip is planned for september so im good waiting
churning,not_removed,yep people with nexus can use the kiosks when they enter canada by air
churning,not_removed,was it automatic or did you have to request it i think for the csr chase has language specifically excluding nexus and sentri
churning,not_removed,did you request this amex has language that excludes nexus reimbursement
churning,not_removed,sorry i meant sentri not nexus
churning,not_removed,ge comes with nexus as well fwiw but only coming back into the us from canada
churning,not_removed,i meant sentri not sure what exactly what the benefits of that program is however
churning,not_removed,you get nexus benefits leaving canada and coming back to the us with ge i think you also get sentri as well but theres an extra fee as you have to register a specific vehicle
churning,not_removed,what kiosks though going into canada i still did the electronic passport control machine that printed a customs declaration receipt and i just had to hand it to an officer on the way out i was unclear on what benefit exactly having nexus would have gotten me likewise going back through passport control at yvr to get into the us the machines on the nonglobal entrynexus side looked exactly the same and i still had to show my passport to an american cbp officer before being let into the terminal
churning,not_removed,yep and got it immediately credited
churning,not_removed,ge comes with nexus as well fwiw but only coming back into the us from canada nexus is the system you use for entering canada
churning,not_removed,similar to nexus but for mexico
churning,not_removed,its a nexus lane either entering canada or coming back into to the us unless youre talking about by air
churning,not_removed,oh you mean the land crossing yeah that makes sense
churning,not_removed,chase megathreads thataway
churning,not_removed,why are you bothering to track this down just report them as fraud get a new card let chase investigate and dont waste your time you arent liable so it doesnt matter
churning,not_removed,multiple large charges to my csr that i dont use very often
churning,not_removed,this should be in daily discussion
churning,not_removed,chase seems to have a problem with fraud there are stories of people whose accounts have been compromised before they even receive the physical card
churning,not_removed,yes happened to me last week when i was traveling and using my csr at the hotel for my credit there were a bunch of online charges chase caught and shut down the card
churning,not_removed,my chase hyatt got compromised recently and my chase ihg gets compromised about once a year chase is pretty bad with fraud
churning,not_removed,yes there was a charge from california for petsmart chase called and told them we didnt do it its crazy i know that a company idk if chase lost our account information fraudulent services stopped the payment before it was approved
churning,not_removed,ive had separate chase cards breached in the past year
churning,not_removed,no but ever since i got back from china a few days ago i have had attempts trying to access my apple account
churning,not_removed,yup the merchant isnt going to admit to being sloppy about who they allow to use a credit card calling them is a waste of time
churning,not_removed,i wanted to know if it was somebody i knew that conducted the fraud charges also speaking from experience banks dont investigate these at all they budget tens of millions of dollar a year to write off fraudulent charges
churning,not_removed,someone stole my chase card from my doorstep and made some charges they ship preactivated smh
churning,not_removed,i had one around that timeframe via chase it was the first and only time ive had issues with any card let alone chase
churning,not_removed,for the record this should be posted in what card wednesday you should get a discover its good cash back and you wont get any premium cards with that little income if you have a way to increase your income to then you can start getting better cards
churning,not_removed,i waited over a month finally at the day processing mark i called and got a phone rep who manually approved it on the phone while i waited keep calling and be polite but firm and they can do it for you
churning,not_removed,seems like they switched benefits providers and the transitionnew team is rough prestige holders are also complaining about this
churning,not_removed,size matters im sure some larger dollar amount refunds might get put in the processing game in hopes people will forget about it
churning,not_removed,same issue here been waiting for days for a refund since the day completion i messaged them but was just given a run around it was saturday at midnight so im sure whoever i spoke with had no authority to actually help me
churning,not_removed,it took me a month and a half before my refund was approved on a purchase with the prestige even with the switch in providers it shouldnt take this long
churning,not_removed,similar situation but sending sm didnt seem to help at all after over a month it finally processed and hit today
churning,not_removed,dude yes it was so goodeasy to process refunds about months ago my recent ones have been held up for months now
churning,not_removed,i had a refund when i bought an ac it took business days to finally approve and get on my statement
churning,not_removed,i did it once last year when i had the nexus and google had it on sale i didnt have any problem then
churning,not_removed,damn some of these comments are not sounding good i was thinking this was like a nice bonus perk on my prestige havent used it yet as no really worthwhile purchases and ive only had the card a month
churning,not_removed,previous benefit provider approved them really quickly ever since they switched anything larger than goes into a review bucket which takes a really long time
churning,not_removed,i never trust the online portal to any of the work instead i mail in the paper claims form along with receipts and things always works like a charm
churning,not_removed,took like months for sneakers to get price matched but finally got approved they waited almost months just to ask me for a card statement showing the purchasewhich seemed very odd for them not to have citi being citi
churning,not_removed,ive never done on of these but dont want to affect my relationship with the bank they outsource this anyways right
churning,not_removed,my search ended on july and i just got my refund on august
churning,not_removed,got one done in less that daysdo everything by phonecall multiple times just to make sure managers are the only ones who are allowed to create tickets and approve them
churning,not_removed,yeah thats what the last csr told me she was doing she was working with her supervisor over im to get it done and i should see it within days i assume she meant business days so well see normally wouldnt care but this is lol
churning,not_removed,im at about weeks and have a prestige was approved in early august still no payment
churning,not_removed,im pretty sure this is true
churning,not_removed,lol i did forget they sent me the email saying it was processing that was the only way i remembered now i aint forgetting its
churning,not_removed,ive used it and its great but its best to submit then forget as you see it aint looking to good right now i normally wouldnt care but its
churning,not_removed,asking for a statement is pretty typical from most cards that provide this service since its provided by a party and not the bank
churning,not_removed,i uploaded the receipt so they shouldnt need the statement
churning,not_removed,it used to be basically you entered the info from your purchase then they search for a better price for days if they find one you get a refund either statement credit or check
churning,not_removed,she approved mine while i was on the phone with her i immediately got the email notification that the claim had been approved i saw the credit on my online statement within hours the first time i called them they gave me the day nonsense which of course nothing happened for what its worth this was for me maybe higher priced amounts they are being slower on citi price rewind loses its value to me if theyre going to make me wait months from original purchase to get my refund and make me expend considerable energy to do so
churning,not_removed,same here got the email still shows processing
churning,not_removed,ah was not aware of that thank you
churning,not_removed,prove that you used you citi card
churning,not_removed,great so it looks like i have to call again tomorrow smh if its wasnt for the cash back id cancel the card
churning,not_removed,the uploaded receipt shows the last digits of the card i used
churning,not_removed,oh yeah good point i wonder if all receipts have that or is this just citi being citi
churning,not_removed,removed post this in moronic monday
churning,not_removed,everyone start chanting churning churning churning
churning,not_removed,instead of roses everyone throw their liquidated vgcs on the stage
churning,not_removed,op routoftheloop here how come too many churners are there is there an ongoing deal i missed just got back churning again
churning,not_removed,hello from the other side of the balcony
churning,not_removed,well amex should have closed the doors and started indiscriminate firing profits would have been good next year 😜
churning,not_removed,dress circle for the matinee it was a great show
churning,not_removed,who else from the sub is here
churning,not_removed,hi
churning,not_removed,did the redditor wear the wife beater he was considering
churning,not_removed,cant wait to see this in london
churning,not_removed,i was there last night down in the orchestra section pretty much straight view to the stage what an awesome show way better than expected
churning,not_removed,went a few months ago it was amazing i was looking to make this trip but just didnt have the availability at the time to fly in from la great show how was wayne brady as burr
churning,not_removed,such a good show sat in the dress circle
churning,not_removed,had to pass this up for my asia trip hope it was awesome
churning,not_removed,i really want this for los angeles when should i request
churning,not_removed,does anyone know if there will be future opportunities for getting hamilton tix through the plat or has anyone been offered future dates recently
churning,not_removed,this was chicago right any idea if they plan to do this for ny
churning,not_removed,when did you receive the tickets two weeks before show
churning,not_removed,i heard about a lot of people who bought these tickets through amex with the intention of reselling them were they successful or were the tickets nontransferable anyone know
churning,not_removed,i was right by you i think row j in the balcony woo
churning,not_removed,it was amazing i was in row d of the mezzanine with mi madre who in the hell was the super cute redditor next to me you were with your wife who was extraordinarily pretty
churning,not_removed,here mezzanine front row
churning,not_removed,ill be there in two weeks stoked
churning,not_removed,jealous im hoping i can snag some tix for one of the la dates hope you all have a great time
churning,not_removed,why is this place so popular
churning,not_removed,chase chase chase chase
churning,not_removed,brilliant
churning,not_removed,amex bought all tickets to the show and made them available to platinum cardholders
churning,not_removed,im to your right blonde girl two brown hair guys mid twenties
churning,not_removed,adele is that you
churning,not_removed,look around look around there are so many churners in here
churning,not_removed,we were balcony center left wife and i were blown away by the show two guys in front of me grabbing drinks had csrs i felt in good company
churning,not_removed,im not there but it sounds like the perfect opportunity to meetup
churning,not_removed,i was in the row at the matinee youre in for a treat
churning,not_removed,i was there for the matinee today enjoy the show
churning,not_removed,not there but bought tickets for friends living in chicago of course they paid me back in full lol
churning,not_removed,you can see the top of the heads of my sister and me in the picture we loved the show
churning,not_removed,im in balcony center right c what rowseat are you in
churning,not_removed,you can call the amex concierge and they might be able to give you an idea whenif tickets are available
churning,not_removed,my tickets arrived about weeks before the show
churning,not_removed,you could resell them it was a little tougher with the show since stubhub wouldnt allow those tickets to be listed but you could sell therm on other ticket sites
churning,not_removed,i sold two and kept two they changed ticket distribution last year though because of scalping for example my tickets that i bought through amex in june werent delivered until to prevent the market from going wild still managed to sell them for about apiece two weeks ago making a tidy little profit to fund dinner for me and the lady and pay for our tickets each in orchestra
churning,not_removed,la pantages replied to my tweet about sale date they tweeted back just you wait
churning,not_removed,theyre releasing dates for la
churning,not_removed,i bought la seasons seats at the pantages to get hamilton front row mezz and theyre allowing us to buy extra tickets each starting exchangesextra purchases end so maybe thats when general onsale will begin season seats seem to end late october so if there is a special amex performance expect it in novdec since all other shows previous are essentially sold out
churning,not_removed,are they on sale yet
churning,not_removed,when are they on sale
churning,not_removed,its an activity that helps people save money on travel travel more frequently travel more luxuriously andor feel like theyre winning at the system
churning,not_removed,hamilton is a broadway show not a location
churning,not_removed,its a super successful broadway musical
churning,not_removed,csr csr csr
churning,not_removed,does anyone thinkknow if they will be doing same for other cities
churning,not_removed,huh
churning,not_removed,wish i had seen this at the show and i would have said hey hope you guys enjoyed it
churning,not_removed,does csr get points at theater bars
churning,not_removed,i think i sat right next to youlol
churning,not_removed,haha thats awesome too funny glad you enjoyed the show we thought it was amazing as well
churning,not_removed,oh excellent we were e wonderful show really we just listened to the original cast recording on spotify truly awesome they have a geniuscom page with the meanings behind the lyrics too cant wait to dig into it more
churning,not_removed,not yet hopefully soon
churning,not_removed,yes call the concierge and ask
churning,not_removed,seriously
churning,not_removed,if shes the churner i think it might go the other way if she got them hamilton tickets
churning,not_removed,not sure working on min spend for ink business so left my csr at home
churning,not_removed,how about los angeles
churning,not_removed,when i got my chicago tickets they said los angeles was sold out
churning,not_removed,aw man thats sucks would like to get it as a surprise birthday gift for a friend thanks anyway
churning,not_removed,put it in the daily discussion
churning,not_removed,charge your gas to the chase freedom have fun
churning,not_removed,most likely depends on the hotel if you want to be safe of is which would cover the au fee anyways thats what i would do
churning,not_removed,contact the hotel and let them know that you want to pay for their room they will faxemail you a credit card authorization form on which you can indicate exactly what youre paying for room only or room and incidentals ive done this multiple times
churning,not_removed,why dont you prepay for their stay right away and the resort will most likely ask only for a card incidental charges edit i have always booked my parents hotels on my card and they have never have been asked for the original charge card
churning,not_removed,removed ask in mm
churning,not_removed,gift card rescue closure has me out and if i see any of that it will be pennies on the dollar which at this point is better than nothing
churning,not_removed,my chase hyatt and wifes csp both went to need more time to make decision page she doesnt have many credit accounts and thinks this is all needless because her parents only had credit card why do we need to keep applying especially if we arent using them frustration
churning,not_removed,applied for brg at after spend wednesday get a mailer in thursday for after spend grrr

churning,not_removed,this friday just keeps getting more frustrating pulled my csp out to book a hotel for my trip to iceland in september realized it had someone elses name on it the last time i used it was at a restaurant for lunch on wednesday so i called them and they claimed they had no record of me buying anything there even though the charge was on my online statement i called chase and they offered to cancel the card and send a new one to get here in days then they asked if they could just give my contact info to the person whose csp i have so i could give it to them directly wtf how is that at all secure like shouldnt they have immediately canceled it on the spot edit and if the card doesnt get here by tomorrow im not gonna be able to meet min spend by statement closing date the hotel stuff wouldve put me over and will have to wait for the points to post on the next statement noooooo
churning,not_removed,more than frustration it is the story of greed i loaded bed bath and beyond amex offer to of my cards my initial plan was to buy shell gift cards and spend iti do lot of road trips planned so thought i can use all the gift cards within a month however the store i visited had only two shell gift cards which i bought without any issues i noticed sunrise bank issued visa gift cards on the corner of the gift card rack and at that moment i got an idea of buying visa card and using all the remaining cards and pay using split payment i asked the cashier whether i can split the payment upto cards and she checked it with her manager and all looked good but after i swiped my first card the cashier entered but the payment system took all from the first card itself now i paid for cashback which is small but just wanted to post it so that no one else spends time and money on these kind of ideas

churning,not_removed,logged into my citi account and noticed that of my ty points are gone i just checked last week and saw no points expiring anytime soon then checked on this subreddit and saw someobdy post about phantom expirations i cancelled my citi premier card not too long ago and guessing that was the trigger really annoyed as i feel there shouldve been some sort of warning or at least show that it is expiring soon hoping i can call them and get it reinstated would really suck if i can not

churning,not_removed,i was planning on finishing off so i can go ahead and start applying for other company cards now because im tired of chase but with the rumored sapphire elite i am holding off on my last card before i go over just to see how this plays out
churning,not_removed,amex mr points still frozen ink went to pending sitting on my hands being unable to do anything aside from naturally meeting the edp on minimum spend edit fuck the targeted ink offer wasnt targeted and fell under fuck
churning,not_removed,still waiting on my boa mlb cards that were approved on they still show up on my online account and i did receive letters saying they would be shipped ive been trying to avoid this but i think i will have to call boa uredwritinghood have your received your yet
churning,not_removed,applied for ink using the wifes name after being denied i had her call in to recon with specific instructions to tell them i would be speaking and then hand the phone to me after they got her info well she begins having a conversation with the recon lady about the card and im listening on speaker as my wife accepts the we are waiting to see how you handle your credit with sapphire preferred says thank you and hangs up i was baffled she thought i simply wanted a reason why we were denied i said i dont care about their reason i want the card weve since reconned again with no better luck but at the time i wanted to rip my hair out now we laugh about it
churning,not_removed,frustration ughhhhhhhh applied for ink at beginning of the month rejected after a week called recon still waiting for a decision i really want to get that out of the way before the new sapphire card comes out frustration ive been counting down the days waiting for my mpe signup bonus to post so i could finally book my rt laxlhr flights for thanksgiving it finally went up but fuck it of course the return flight i was targeting is no longer available so now on my return trip i have to fly lhrsfolax which adds like hours of travel and has me leaving hours earlier in the day
churning,not_removed,i applied and got approved for the amex blue cash everyday card on sunday using a after spend in first three months offer i got in the mail hopefully it arrives in the mail later today when i get home i just hate having to wait for a new credit card to arrive after getting approved for it its and credit card companies not just amex talk about the whole taking days its just annoying because you would think they would be more efficient about it cant wait for the card though no annual fee and apparently you get a shoprunner membership free day shipping on certain sites for free its my first american express card and im a bit too excited for it
churning,not_removed,tons of bloggers and others had been warning about that site for at least a year the perils of playing the reselling game
churning,not_removed,thats brutal how much were you typically floating on that site
churning,not_removed,they returned my cards to me without even opening my envelope though if you mailed yours earlier than i did you might be out of luck
churning,not_removed,how are you going to be out so much do you not ha e in gift cards

churning,not_removed,this must be reposted to rfirstworldproblems
churning,not_removed,i feel your pain though ive only been waiting weeks now i know that i might not be able to expect it for my september trips
churning,not_removed,ive been waiting weeks for my precheck got denied global entry a few years back so not too optimistic
churning,not_removed,jeez chase should just be cancelling both your cards at once and sending you new cards
churning,not_removed,dispute the restaurant charge see how quick they find it
churning,not_removed,that should absolutely be cancelled on the spot whats most interesting is the restaurant claiming no record of you you figure they accidentally swapped the two cards and now are trying to deny having any hand in it
churning,not_removed,thats incredibly absurd to suggest that you hold onto the persons active cc and give it to them
churning,not_removed,may be the cashier didnt know how to do it i did split transactions and went fine swipe the card only when it shows amount due is
churning,not_removed,ask them for a goodwill statement credit
churning,not_removed,from march to june i got plat plat mb prg spg upgraded my hilton green really shocked i didnt get a fr just so many good offers
churning,not_removed,should be ok if you didnt lie about your income
churning,not_removed,samesies so annoyed trying to cut costs of solo trip wo so and it wouldve been a big help
churning,not_removed,never used rp to pay rent but in my expereicnes renting most landlordsmanagement agencies are pretty good about extending leniency time if youre charged late fees notify rp and they should reimburse you i know plastiq does
churning,not_removed,i bet hell love the alone time to play games and jack it unless hes clingier than saran wrap not even joking
churning,not_removed,dont he should be happy for you also plan trips with friends
churning,not_removed,i wish i had an unlimited vacation policy is the work week true
churning,not_removed,best strategy
churning,not_removed,are they still honoring the week timeframe
churning,not_removed,im frustrated that im over
churning,not_removed,are you a banking customer
churning,not_removed,thats strange i just applied yesterday for cards two alaska and an amtrak and they were dishing out credit limits like they were going out of fashion i think i got total between the cards only one was auto approved but the recon was painless no real questions about why i needed the cards even do you have borderline credit low income any other thing that maybe the other banks dont care about but boa has a thing for
churning,not_removed,they are tough for me too but i have found the alaska business easier to get than the personal i am about at
churning,not_removed,im at or so and i have been denied for mlb alaska etc but got approved for virgin atlantic if you can ms its really worthwhile
churning,not_removed,im seeing the citi checking account promo and im like fool me once citi
churning,not_removed,i was so annoyed that i went for the typ and then the aa offer came out slightly after i applied after my points posted flawlessly im not so sad any more that aa offer seems more trouble than it was worth
churning,not_removed,i feel you amex is the absolute worst when it comes to tracking referrals it seems like a total roll of the dice every time ive given up trying to get them to pay up if the system doesnt track it automatically its not worth the timeheadache to me at least
churning,not_removed,i feel like they queue it up and issue them the next statement calendar month which is why they say days its been about two weeks for me as well
churning,not_removed,just a quick update my points showed up yesterday in my account when the monthly fee posted did you get yours as well
churning,not_removed,i thought ihg wasnt part of
churning,not_removed,how long before you got the bonus ie when did the transaction complete and when did the bonus post
churning,not_removed,does schwab at least have a better fee structure for the ira than the old bank
churning,not_removed,i believe you can sometimes get transfer fees like that refunded by the new brokerage if you ask though might be better to do before transferring since they obviously want you to switch to them they might reimburse switching fees
churning,not_removed,schwab will refund this fee if youre a good citizen with them fidelity dinged me with for transferring out my ira from them to schwab and schwab was happy to give me back the id been using them for my primary checking and brokerage accounts for over a year at that point
churning,not_removed,depending on how urgent your travel destination was i could view this situation in two totally different perspectives is there any chance you can get that back at all
churning,not_removed,if you dont accept the voucher you would have got times the value of the ticket as compensation i may be wrong
churning,not_removed,youre brave i would never want to stay at an airport for over
churning,not_removed,call
churning,not_removed,i was instaapproved but no email either even after getting the card
churning,not_removed,call and ask them to expedite the card though i believe the plat is expedited by default if the csr says no huca youll definitely get it by thursday
churning,not_removed,i feel sad that you cant get the new chase card i mean neither can i but im so far past i just stopped caring the southwest companion pass is awesome though ive had it twice now with my wife and its one of those situations where its hard not to find a use for the points
churning,not_removed,time to go scorched earth on your wifes credit then
churning,not_removed,i worked out a deal with my so she gets the cp next year i get it in then her in etc every two years
churning,not_removed,oh damn how quickly would your next oldest new account be outside mo could try to squeeze the potential new chase card in if its not too long waiting after getting sw for another old account to be old enough
churning,not_removed,is cp companion pass read the wiki but need to find glossary
churning,not_removed,have you tried talking to ups directly and seeing where they delivered the package amex should be able to give you a tracking number and if they have to ship another one ask for signature verification ive had ups deliver packages to my address in neighboring towns before its never fun
churning,not_removed,try having your amex mb plat card delivered a month late
churning,not_removed,are you by any chance using an iphone ive had issues in the past with touch tone systems not working solution disable wifi calling on the phone and huca
churning,not_removed,use the points save the cash points get devalued eventually
churning,not_removed,if you have the points and its good value might as well use them
churning,not_removed,it all depends how much you spend on average but best to plan ahead and always have spend options the new cards always take longer than you think and can hit recon etc i start apping for new cards when im down to spend on remaining cards noting i dont ms
churning,not_removed,maybe try using your aa miles to go pptnrtcdg pptnrt on air tahiti nui nrtcdg on jal
churning,not_removed,how bad is one ways
churning,not_removed,metabank sunrise bank and us bank visas work at walmart and the post office vanilla visa gift cards issued by bancorp only work at the post office
churning,not_removed,care to share which store since its shut down anyways
churning,not_removed,check to see if youre prequalified httpswwwchasecomprequalified this will allow you to bypass and get the bonus
churning,not_removed,i was thinking of applying for a csp again later this year but very skeptical dont bother if youre over and it sounds like youll be over for a long time the only way youre going to get approved and get the signup bonus if youre over is to get preapproved for the csp inbranch which is possible but very ymmv id take this approach at trying to get it other applications will just be denied and be a waste of a hard pull until you get under again she offered a product change to csp no credit check no welcome signup bonus annual fee of will not be waived basically this will allow me to get the csp and finally have an ultimate rewards account of my own this isnt worth it at all if youre an au on your wifes csp the only value of you getting a csp as well is the signup bonus
churning,not_removed,we are also aus in most of the cards that we have so long as theres an addl sign up bonus benefit given to having an au just beware that this counts toward so if youre serious about getting more cards from chase you should probably end this practice but i have to do a new csp application and chances are id be denied again given the above reasons i was thinking of applying for a csp again later this year but very skeptical i dont think youre getting it chances are thinking of very skeptical you keep saying things that show you dont really understand this chances are not that you will be denied its guaranteed is not a guideline or a rule of thumb its a hard and fast rule she offered a product change to csp no credit check no welcome signup bonus annual fee of will not be waived basically this will allow me to get the csp and finally have an ultimate rewards account of my own why is having the csp so important to you in the first place if its just so you can transfer urs to other programs then ask yourself what the value of that is is it worth the af if so go for it if not dont get it and if youre potentially close to and you really want the transfer ability and the bonus hold out on getting more cards and aus for a while
churning,not_removed,you had an ink autoapproved thats rare
churning,not_removed,you applied for chase ccs in one day even if youd gotten the email from ink why would you voluntarily go against
churning,not_removed,if youre close to a branch probably better to go in
churning,not_removed,the citibusiness side of the company is a special level of hell id recommend writing them a secure message for some reason youre limited to characters or something ridiculous though you can then reply with more characters and waiting for days to get a response instead better than waiting for hours on the phone
churning,not_removed,ive had good luck contacting citi reps using sm on the website any reason why you specifically need to get someone on the phone
churning,not_removed,there are so many options around disney that are reasonably priced i just booked embassy suites lake buena vista through ur portal for including taxes coupled with ur back with freedom
churning,not_removed,i literally planned a last minute disney trip last night and understand your pain i suggest looking at hilton disney springs depending on what points you have its a pretty well reviewed spot thats across the street from disney springs swan and dolphin are of course good options but given how hard it is to accrue spg points its expensive haha
churning,not_removed,if you can afford to wait and dont already have the spg credit card the bonus should be increasing in a couple weeks sometime around like it does each summer
churning,not_removed,there is no way to save the points after cancelling a checking account or a credit card unlike the two other programs downgrading instead of cancelling is a good alternative in this case because it will keep the original expiration date so two things when you cancelled the csr read you a disclosure saying your points will expire and a bunch of other stuff after which you had to confirm that you agreed to all that why did you cancel in the first place you couldve just downgraded to any other tyearning card and kept both the points and the benefits your card gave to your credit score
churning,not_removed,my husband just got his first card after ive been doing this for more than a year still has trouble remembering to use it over his debit card
churning,not_removed,send himher on a longhaul business or firstclass flight tell himher that you all will be able to do that semiregularly if heshe gets into churning
churning,not_removed,they do participate but they hold their inventory until about weeks out i would book a refundable backup but keep checking everyday if that is what you really want
churning,not_removed,did you try calling them they can and will expedite cards once youve been approved got mine in business days
churning,not_removed,applied and got my card yesterday the dude processing my card for id fraud screwed up so i had to fax stuff to them i sent a sm asking to push out the min spend reqmt if not at least more bonus points waiting to hear back from them
churning,not_removed,ouch applied for csp letter in the mail saying more info needed and they had to confirm my wifes name change and the cards were in just in time to put down a few hundred on home network installation errwhere hopefully everything works out
churning,not_removed,dang thats awful i applied on called and got approved on and requested that they expedite my card so i would be able to use it on a trip that weekend card arrived edit though i did have a really annoying problem where the new card wouldnt show up in my chase account it took a while to get that sorted and they even had to revert me to the old website design to do it i can only imagine what fresh hell their system is for that to be a thing that is even possible
churning,not_removed,grrrrrrrrr
churning,not_removed,citi doesnt have a equivalent rule they have an ish rule though only one citi card in days only in days both approximate im trying to remember the rule and too lazy to look it up citi are a very disorganized financial institution i cant pretend to predict what they will do
churning,not_removed,at the customer service line theyll give you cash for the value of the voucher
churning,not_removed,expect to handle everything via physical mail or fax wait about months for it to be resolved it can happen just not at internet speed
churning,not_removed,i had this happen with two of mine spent in texas somewhere im partially through the process and so far its not bad but we will see how the resolution plays out
churning,not_removed,wow thats crazy i was just about to go buy one of those as a trial balloon you paid with a cc right ive been wondering about those since some greendot products are cashonly
churning,not_removed,tax returns
churning,not_removed,google how to get a replacement social security card you can get one by bringing in the required documents to your local soc sec office you can also mail them in as well
churning,not_removed,not yet was told it vl be seen after statement
churning,not_removed,buying something and not entering your pin number
churning,not_removed,the account gets reported right after approval i believe amex is the only one that takes their time in reporting
churning,not_removed,nonwhite
churning,not_removed,pull the power plug on your modem keep it off for a few minutes plug it back in this will usually get you a new ip address clear cookies and cache and try again
churning,not_removed,im sort of in the same boatthis new card is throwing a wrench in my plans i just got the csp to put me at and i was planning to get the ink to round out the this new behemoth shows up still not sure what im going to do
churning,not_removed,fwiw the flyertalk thread has not been making it sound as great as wed hoped for great for a signup bonus but not longterm unless we hear something theres also talk of a high income restriction the only other visa infinites in the us have a minimum income requirement this is all still speculation though so it certainly doesnt hurt to hold off until we know more
churning,not_removed,ink essentially always goes to pending
churning,not_removed,same boat will call on monday
churning,not_removed,i got emails saying your card has been shipped my first batch of cards got thrown in the trash idiotically so after the pony show of getting to send out another batch i received a batch of emails saying they were shipped and received the cards not long after that
churning,not_removed,man you need to relax a little about all this dont want to ruin a relationship over ur points well maybe for that new ur card
churning,not_removed,did you ask to move credit from one card to another
churning,not_removed,that sucks i had one old boa card formerly alaska and this weekend applied for the alaska personal and the amtrak card issued credit similar income to you credit score from their credit pull they provide it electronically for auto approvals im sitting at probably credit with them now i dont have a checking or savings account with them for what its worth
churning,not_removed,read the section in the wiki on boa cards boa value a true banking relationship for those who are new to the game stating a high income matters little as the banks cannot verify your income unless they do an fr your income does not show up on your credit report the banks want to see a number that shows you have income to pay back the debt but putting a large number down means little
churning,not_removed,no
churning,not_removed,get the platinum so you can get drunk at the sfo centurion d
churning,not_removed,they intentionally ship the first card slow i read they do it because technically opening usps paper mail is a felony whereas opening fedexups is only a misdemeanor not sure how accurate that is
churning,not_removed,you dont have any open accounts with amex so you likely qualified for their better targeted offers why did you settle for a bonus
churning,not_removed,ill be honest i should have done some research i assumed they were reputable like the others ive dealt with like saveya cardpool and abc gift cards
churning,not_removed,it was my first time using that site but i usually float between with the other sites and have never had an issue
churning,not_removed,yeah mine were mailed in may and they all have zero balances now
churning,not_removed,anyone who sent in cards prior to right before they closed but didnt get paid yet is basically being told we dont have your gift cards and we dont have any money so sorry
churning,not_removed,for me it was the hyatt in kauai
churning,not_removed,same here she hates closing accounts or asking for retention she definitely will never call recon haha but after flying in business across the atlantic and staying in a few hotels we could never afford shes in kinda
churning,not_removed,yep pretty much thankfully there were no other customers there i felt like an idiot walking up to the window with this busted plastic tube and asking for a new one
churning,not_removed,which is why its even more embarrassing for them since she called the number they gave her from the bank email
churning,not_removed,didnt work
churning,not_removed,i applied for precheck and got my ktn the day after my appointment i would call and ask for an update
churning,not_removed,may be the cashier looked new and she said she entered least she said after i swiped the card she was asking her colleagues on how to split before making the purchase
churning,not_removed,yeah incoming was rounded up about to the nearest thousand so im not worried just a pain in the neck to not be able to finish this mom spends
churning,not_removed,can confirm source wife has been visiting family since wednesday wont be back till sunday have jacked and gamed each evening
churning,not_removed,depends if i have work to do i have work to do some weeks are busier than others but i work in tech so working remotely is also an option as long as my work gets done my employer is happy doesnt matter where it gets done were not a huge fan of seat warming requirements either
churning,not_removed,so many times though unlimited vacation policy really translates to being difficult to actually take time off especially an extended vacation and granted around here we arent necessarily average people but most people end up taking less time off because they dont see themselves losing weeks pto at years end if they dont use it up
churning,not_removed,no idea i do not need the points right now so i think not drawing attention is the best course i wont call for another months
churning,not_removed,me too but i have a feeling that theyll open it up at first who better to promote it than churners im excited based on the most recent update on ft its good enough for me to drop my prg for good and apply for a nofee mr card to save those points ill stop using my csp entirely and pc it to a freedom next june if i can get the sapphire reserve
churning,not_removed,in branch might get you an override my closest branch is miles away unfortunately
churning,not_removed,no that would probably help ill see about opening an account thanks
churning,not_removed,credit score is only so im sure that plays a role income is but amex has given me seven cards chase has given me six citi four us bank three barclays four three discover two and comenity one and boa has turned me down for virgin atlantic amtrak and alaska business twice
churning,not_removed,does alaska biz show up as an account on credit file apart from inquiry
churning,not_removed,hilton pts may not be worth all the time effort but already spent much of it on this its about the principles wont give up til amex top dogs andor govt agencies say not appreciate if anyone has contacts of amex exe ofc or who else i can contact
churning,not_removed,yes mine did post but now you cant redeem the thank you points for rei gift cards so i have no idea what im going to do
churning,not_removed,ihg isnt but it counts towards one of the
churning,not_removed,uapplesauceyum says it all neither ihg nor hyatt is ive been over since january but if i new about a new highend sapphire card i would have waited until my card dropped past months opened that then opened ihg and hyatt afterwards im still happy to get the two bonuses but it looks like i may not be able to get a premium card that i would really like to have in my wallet
churning,not_removed,you can get ihg if youre over but ihg does count toward the cards that could prevent you from getting other chase cards
churning,not_removed,it hadnt posted after roughly two months and i sent a message to inquire about it the ira was another account i had to open on top of the checkingbrokerage combo that the bonus is associated with perhaps adding funds to the ira didnt meet a strict interpretation of the bonus rules but schwab came through and posted the bonus two weeks after my message i was just expecting the money to go into the checking account
churning,not_removed,the ira itself had no fees but i also transferred a brokerage account that had a fee ameriprise overall much happier with schwab which tempers the frustration i just opened one of their roboinvestor accounts which turned out to be an additional hard pull eq
churning,not_removed,doubtful from what i hear sw is being dickheads and only offering voucherscoupons havent heard anything of reimbursements
churning,not_removed,it was nice good beer and snacks it was pretty crowded but thinned out a bit overall a great place to chill only downside is lack of hot food which i wouldve really enjoyed
churning,not_removed,not necessarily depends on who they boot off ya know i imagine i was one of the first to buy tickets to that flight the night before so i doubt i wouldve been booted off but who knows
churning,not_removed,it is not fun i just spent hours in dtw last night my pm flight didnt leave until am not so fun facts when i was dropping off the rental car a virgin atlantic plane took off overhead it landed in london before my flight took off the dl i saw barreling down the runway minutes after i got to the gate landed in amsterdam a few minutes after my flight took off if instead of dropping off the rental car i had driven it to my house in st louis i would have been sleeping in my own bed by the time my flight landed in stl
churning,not_removed,i called and they said the card was automatically shipped out via snail mail yesterday and theres nothing they can do
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,regular plat concierge to the rescue apparently my address was off by one digit despite me using autofill on the app multiple confirmations in chat and the bad address not actually existing the tracking shows delivered with note left at dock so who the hell knows what happened there oh well still have months to do aint no thing
churning,not_removed,whoa yeah i am thanks for the tip ill try it when i call in again
churning,not_removed,i have enough natural spend its just annoying that these expenses couldnt have come up after i got another card and made that min spend easier i also dont ms which is why it wouldve been nice
churning,not_removed,only miles more but its miles i dont have
churning,not_removed,does onevanilla vgc work at post office
churning,not_removed,does being prequalified online also bypass ive read many times on rchurning and elsewhere that the only reliable way to bypass is to get preapproved inbranch
churning,not_removed,i checkedno offerswill hold off for awhile
churning,not_removed,thanks kevlarloverso as far as the inbranch approach do i get an email that im preapproved or do i just approach one of the bankers and look up if i have anything preapproved and yes i agree with youskeptical about applying the hard pull and get denied againnot a move id like to make
churning,not_removed,roger thatthank you
churning,not_removed,there are plenty of exceptions to someone posted just this week about getting a cfu with
churning,not_removed,in retrospect i should have taken a screenshot i had it in my head that i had to hit apply as fast as possible on the initial apps in their separate incognito windows maybe i might have just been sloppy but the ink was the second app i sent right after the fnbo card i really wanted so i think i did it correctly
churning,not_removed,i was autoapproved for the ink in branch banker hit submit and started to tell me that it might be a few weeks before i was notified and when he looked back at the screen i was already accepted i was at had a chase checking account and csp here i come
churning,not_removed,is news to me my understanding was you can do business or personal if you assume at least one will require a call i did the marriott late in the day because i was getting greedy and most of my other apps were approved
churning,not_removed,i know this form i thought you could only do characters turns out you have to manually hit enter every characters to break to a new line then you can continue the message crazy
churning,not_removed,i ended up going via sm i initially avoided sm because i couldnt copy and paste the exact error message into the sm their system keeps rejecting special characters and the error message was rifled with special characters like hyphens commas parenthesis etc so it wouldnt send
churning,not_removed,i ended up going via sm i initially avoided sm because i couldnt copy and paste the exact error message into the sm their system keeps rejecting special characters and the error message was rifled with special characters like hyphens commas parenthesis etc so it wouldnt send
churning,not_removed,yeah i am starting to look around the further you go out the more options there are but you lose that nice benefit of being able to walk around and back to your place
churning,not_removed,yeah i got frustrated and signed up for the offer once im done with the spend i will refer my gf hopefully for the
churning,not_removed,i cancelled over the phone through their automated system so never talked to a csr i have too many credit cards and wanted to free up the credit to get other cards i already have most of the downgraded cards i have the citi forward and ty preferred already however now that i know they will pull back points i will make sure to downgrade in the future the thing is i earn a good amount of points on the forward and i have all the ty points combined not sure how they determine which points to use first as i have burned a good amount of ty points over the past year really hoping when i call them i can convince them to give me the points if even temporarily so i can at least transfer them
churning,not_removed,seriously damn staying at the andaz would be awesome and im actually down to less than weeks away worth a try thanks
churning,not_removed,theyre expediting the replacements to us i had sent sm and was trying to wait it out figuring it would show up good to know for future reference thanks
churning,not_removed,the au on account just talked to them and said the csr said we could apply for extension if we dont look like we are going to meet minimum spend however in their sm that csr sent a very confusing mixed message saying they dont extend but they did
churning,not_removed,well maybe ill get lucky then and be denied haha this is the first citi card i have applied for so it was strange to me that my app went to pending
churning,not_removed,at the register give it to them after you pay for your groceries works without fail
churning,not_removed,shamereally dont want the amount of cash ill expect to have as i bank with ally and a credit union without local branches for mehoped this could be a check or statement credit somehow
churning,not_removed,yes cc i do not want to call amex and call for attention on my account so i have to fight it with greendot or walmart
churning,not_removed,unfortunately the last time she held a job was around years ago
churning,not_removed,the caveat is that walmart and fred meyer and probably others change it back to a debit transaction i got screwed last month by freds doing this
churning,not_removed,in my experience it got reported right after the first statement dropped i was approved march first statement dropped april it hit my credit reports april
churning,not_removed,reporting accounts after days is not unheard of
churning,not_removed,im going to guess an incorrect autocorrect though i cant imagine what it was correcting chase and white arent that close on the keyboard
churning,not_removed,i have a static ip address and ive never visited the site before so clearing the cache and cookies is kinda pointless
churning,not_removed,mine just switched from days to days bad
churning,not_removed,good luck i had trouble getting through on the call twice i called with over an hour wait without being connected however a very nice and patient csr on the website chat program reordered all my cards for me days she claimed they had originally been shipped on july hopefully no issues this time
churning,not_removed,relax relax
churning,not_removed,approved today for a cl of recon
churning,not_removed,tried everything and didnt work was told approvals cant be given by moving credit
churning,not_removed,i am a banking customer from the past years with average monthly balance at but still no go 🙃
churning,not_removed,judging by usernamehistory op has a habit of making bad shortsighted decisions
churning,not_removed,well my reasoning had to do with my spending habits as of right now i was thinking of the platinum but im not really spending enough to get that bonus i was also thinking of the prg but i dont have any plans to really travel within the next year i think a few years down the road when making more money and traveling i will look at those cards also i did look online for prequalified offers and the after in spend was the best one
churning,not_removed,i understand people have always said this but i dont think its very worth it to muddle around waiting for a great targeted offer it would be like almost never getting new cards to be able to get chase cards sure your value per card may be much higher that way but youll get way more value overall if you just go harder at other banks especially since the holy grail of targeted offers the plat has been available publicly multiple times in the past granted for very short periods and this latest time seems to be bringing up a whole other clusterfuck of issues
churning,not_removed,heh we all make mistakes or sometimes dont become careful enough thats the risk we take in playing this game is a lot to lose hopefully youll somehow get your money back fingers crossed for you
churning,not_removed,the biggest problem i saw was giftcardwiki left them up there with the ranks of all the other reputable vendors despite the mounting evidence of claims lodged against them it gave them legitimacy where there was none
churning,not_removed,exactly
churning,not_removed,i called at days and they said someone would be getting in touch with me they havent
churning,not_removed,did the register have a chip reader there have been reports at other retailers best buy meijer that splitpayments are no longer possible if the first card you use has a chip hopefully a software update eventually fixes this
churning,not_removed,uh
churning,not_removed,they dont see themselves losing weeks pto at years end if they dont use it up every time i read something like this i swear never to leave california where vacation is considered another form of wages and these use it or lose it policies are illegal i work for a fortune company and they do have such a policy but theres an asterisk except for california employees i do agree with you though i have weeks of pto plus a few personal days and i would not hesitate to take them all even in one go if we had unlimited vacation i would probably feel bad taking more than or weeks throughout the year
churning,not_removed,meh this is not true at where i work i know people who takes two weeks off every other month
churning,not_removed,i wish but sadly im not being optimistic on this one
churning,not_removed,i really hope so or that they prequalify a bunch of us who have been with chase for a while
churning,not_removed,thats what o was hoping but were in the middle of applying for mortgages and stuff im pessimistically guessing that if there is an open period im going to miss it
churning,not_removed,miles checking in
churning,not_removed,i am a banking customer and they approved only for alaska saying they already given me enough credit income total cl with them is
churning,not_removed,open a checking account and deposit into it recon whatever your last app was and ask to be transferred to a resolution specialist instead of speaking with whoever answers the phone tell the resolution specialist you opened an account with and wanted that to be used in reconsideration
churning,not_removed,maybe theyre more sensitive to total credit to income ratio than other banks im assuming your credit outstanding far surpasses your income at this point you have me curious though why apply for the alaska business when the personal comes with the credit to cover the annual fee is there something im missing ive always prioritized the personal card
churning,not_removed,if you really want to do this you could file a cfpb complaint amex is obligated to respond in a timely fashion and prove their case keep in mind though that turning to government agencies can increase the odds amex might blacklist you down the road
churning,not_removed,nope just let it go it seems that is always hilton amex that cant track for shit
churning,not_removed,great id personally use them for travel but thats me
churning,not_removed,i think its more to do with if you get an assigned seat when you book if you check in early the people who do not have assigned seats get ranked by check in time and get seats as people dont show up at least thats how aa did it on my last missed flight
churning,not_removed,ty
churning,not_removed,apologies i forget and couldnt find it in the glossary does ms stand for minimum spend or manufactured spending
churning,not_removed,they do
churning,not_removed,yes it should
churning,not_removed,damn hannaford worked ive lived within a minute drive of one for years and never thought to try cause i wrote off grocery stores shame i missed that opportunity
churning,not_removed,it worked for me at the end of june
churning,not_removed,smart idea this is also assuming that you accept prequalified offers also cant hurt to check inbranch
churning,not_removed,you have to literally go in the branch and ask a banker if you have any preapproved offers on your account it helps mightily if you have a banking relationship with chase if youre seriously after a csp id recommend opening a checking account with them if you dont have one already they offer lots of bonuses for new checking accounts so you might as well grab one of those as well leave it open for a few months and then go back and see if youre preapproved for the csp
churning,not_removed,yes but not from randomly applying for the off chance that they might get it they were preapproved and was told so in the branch
churning,not_removed,congrats
churning,not_removed,huh im not sure about the personalbusiness interaction but the rule of thumb id always heard from chase is they wouldnt approve more than applications within days maybe that only applied to personal cards
churning,not_removed,oh shit thats amazing if i were made of money id gild this comment thanks tons
churning,not_removed,typical citi
churning,not_removed,ive stayed extensively both on and offsite at disney and i can say the quality of life from being at one of the onsite resorts is so much higher you can usually walk or take a boat into at least one park from your hotel and the disney buses that run you to the others are on at most a minute loop far more frequent than most offsite hotel shuttles and separate rides plus disney will pick you up at the airport swan and dolphin are nice properties with epcot access great for dining at the world showcase and proximity to some decent swimming pools definitely a solid option if you can swing them with spg points
churning,not_removed,that is true for what its worth the only park i think you can walk to dolphinswan from is epcot if i recall correctly all others youll need to take a bus most nearby hotels have shuttles
churning,not_removed,i have too many credit cards and wanted to free up the credit to get other cards couldve asked them to reduce your credit limit i already have most of the downgraded cards i have the citi forward and ty preferred already citi att access earns ty points and has no af not sure how they determine which points to use first as i have burned a good amount of ty points over the past year it automatically uses the points that expire first points from the forward expire five years from the end of the month in which they were earned but points from the ty preferred premier prestige dont expire as long as the card is open so in your case the points earned from the forward will always be used first unless you cancel another card and the clock starts ticking you can
churning,not_removed,they can write you a check in fact they wont do cash if its above a certain threshold im not sure which but its fairly low
churning,not_removed,anymore details on the transaction on the scam
churning,not_removed,she should still be filing her taxes
churning,not_removed,thanks this is what i wanted to know i need to make transactions soon i hit credit at walmart in the self checkout last night and the machine asked me if i wanted cash back so im guessing it counted as a debit
churning,not_removed,youre right switfkey has been letting me down a lot lately
churning,not_removed,mine did the same from reading around the internet it is either a denial or a request for verification
churning,not_removed,and arrived
churning,not_removed,same story again on my end claimed shipment on the reordered
churning,not_removed,i started snickering at this out loud and played it out like a tickle in my throat
churning,not_removed,how much do you use your existing boa card before you apply at boa again i would seriously consider lowering the cl of your existing card and also put regular spend on it
churning,not_removed,whatever i have plenty of my life ahead of me to get the more juicy offers
churning,not_removed,not really spending enough to get that bonus is not a valid excuse if you read the wiki or basically any info on this sub you would realize that you can meet the minimumspend within hours if you really needed to
churning,not_removed,it would be like almost never getting new cards to be able to get chase cards well i would never advocate this but the point is to optimize all the cards you get especially if youre new an optimized approach would be something like chase cards then maybe a barclays card and a couple of citi cards to start with then a boa card or two then back for more amex and citi etc like i said all of this is very available information in what card wednesday
churning,not_removed,yep that is definitely the risk im going to open up a few new bank accounts to sorta offset the loss
churning,not_removed,completely agree with this and i did the same exact thing
churning,not_removed,tsa being the tsa i suppose
churning,not_removed,mobile keyboards 🤗
churning,not_removed,in california companies can put a reasonable cap on how much vacation you can accrue so if you dont use your vacation while you dont lose any accrued you would stop earning any additional beyond the cap
churning,not_removed,my job went from pto days a year that you could cash out if you didnt use to unlimited you can be damn sure im taking more than days of vacation this year
churning,not_removed,prequalify a bunch of us who have been with abusing chase for a while ftfy
churning,not_removed,because since they rejected me three times in the past i figured that if they did approve me for an alaska it would likely be for a credit limit which would give me the platinum version of the card and the bonus instead theres no lowerlevel of the business version of the card and i actually have a real business with of annual revenue
churning,not_removed,thx all for the input ill find a contact from the exe ofc to submit my case if still a no go ill rest my case
churning,not_removed,amex just responds that they have no record of the applicant using the claimants referral link doesnt take too much effort to submit that template response in a timely fashion
churning,not_removed,let it go obligatory when one is the father of a year old girl
churning,not_removed,bit you cant transfer the points which limits their usefulness right
churning,not_removed,yep i think thats right i actually had a seat assignment unlike others so i dont think i wouldve been booted
churning,not_removed,ive only seen it used as manufactured spend
churning,not_removed,does ms stand for minimum spend or manufactured spending in this sub it means manufactured spending of the time it usually just confuses people when they use it to mean minimum spend
churning,not_removed,both just about context
churning,not_removed,til something else to try thanks
churning,not_removed,mind if i ask what card it worked for
churning,not_removed,thankswill consider it
churning,not_removed,thanks i do have over years with chase since we were with washington mutual to chase ill try that route
churning,not_removed,thats just one example there were multiple posts this year about people getting around it might be effective but that doesnt mean its absolute
churning,not_removed,yeah its my first time at disney so i want to be on the property
churning,not_removed,thanks for the tips will use it in the future guess i was just trying to trim as many cards from my stash as possible figured i would get some type of warning thats why i was looking at the expired window will definitely be more careful in the future
churning,not_removed,att access has af
churning,not_removed,thats promising
churning,not_removed,taxes dont need to be filed if a persons income is below a certain level for someone her age that level is i dont know how much she gets from her social security checks but it could very well be below that
churning,not_removed,i had to switch to buying gas in dollar increments times a month to meet my transaction quota annoying as hell but if im getting gas anyways
churning,not_removed,yet more ff material
churning,not_removed,my lucky day travel rewards is approved for cl on recon
churning,not_removed,i feel that was an unnecessary and silly personal attack people are free to believe in whomever they wish and thats what makes america great but he isnt entirely wrong that it may have been hasty there is at least a bce offer typically getable through incognito
churning,not_removed,right but in the few companies ive worked the cap has always been your annual vacation quota so you wont reach it unless you dont take a single day off for two years and even as someone who has a very flexible schedule and can work from home and thus doesnt need to take days off for running errands ive found this to be pretty much impossible
churning,not_removed,i was thinking the same our cap is hours of accrued pto which is like a month and a half of time any time after that hours is lost
churning,not_removed,i wonder how many days people take on average i feel like people wouldnt want to feel bad by taking more than the others and that would just drag everything down
churning,not_removed,hey thats only most of us im sure some people here are actually long time chase customers and have held onto their products longterm because of business travel etc just not me
churning,not_removed,😑
churning,not_removed,correct but you can combine them with another account if you have the prestige or premier and redeem them for or cpp towards travel booked through their portal
churning,not_removed,thank you
churning,not_removed,csp
churning,not_removed,definitely worth a shot i live about miles from the nearest chase branch and the only way to get their checking bonuses is to open an account in branchive been thinking that i might have to visit my friend in ny and have a field trip to the nearest chase location
churning,not_removed,the access more has a af theres also a regular access version with no af
churning,not_removed,my gas purchase looks like its going to be counted as a debit even though i hit credit i also purchased something off amazon for last night and that so far looks like a credit transaction
churning,not_removed,well i normally avoid politics studiously on this sub and on reddit in general but if you have a username like pretty much everything you dosay on reddit is political objectively getting a bce signup bonus as your first amex card is a bad shortsighted decision as most of us would have helpfully pointed out in what card wednesday youre taking a bce offer over an offer easily worth as much in the form of a amex platinum bonus and this is rchurning if were i a single issue voter prochurning i would never vote for trump he said that hed default on the national debt he put it in other words of course which would cause billions trillions of dollars in losses to the banks both pushing the economy into a depression and destroying the banks ability to hand out huge signup bonuses for years to come if im a singleissue churning voter id want my signup bonuses to keep flowing dammit ok i hope to be done with any potential political commentary for a loooooong time to come
churning,not_removed,i just dont get the comments i got a bce offer for after in spend which is a pretty good offer in general cash back and with getting the card i get a complimentary shoprunner membership for online shopping that is valued at also the card is no annual fee and comes with some of the other amex benefits there was a offer i once saw for spend before a while back but didnt pull the trigger even though i have done the spend before i just didnt think i would hit it now not everybody who goes for credit cards starts off by getting the biggest offers that require more spending i currently have credit card accounts which are all no annual fee and still have travel bonuses left to spend when im starting to travel more i will go after some of the annual fee ones with big bonuses like the csp and i heard chase is gonna debut some elite one to compete with amex platinum and citi prestige
churning,not_removed,yeah were a small company so people generally use their vacation but i know that at the larger tech companies that have unlimited vacation netflix for one people tend to take less in a look at how dedicated i am to the company kind of move that results in everyone taking less and less vacation
churning,not_removed,well my freedom is a year old account not opened as a freedom i still abuse the hell out of chase though
churning,not_removed,i know i know ill let myself out
churning,not_removed,i do not sadly and i dont think citis going to approve another card for me for a few more months
churning,not_removed,thank you will make plans
churning,not_removed,you cant walk feet in ny without passing a chase branch
churning,not_removed,ok that makes sense and you do make a good point but i was under the impression that i could at a later time get the amex platinum offer as well but i get why people would think what i did doesnt make sense everyones situation is different depending on their lifes circumstances and all that maybe i will have a different user name that is not for politics also just because my username is a political one doesnt mean thats the only thing i care about i love sports as well and many other things you just didnt have to be a dickbag about it
churning,not_removed,for me is not worth opening up a new account for there are more lucrative options available for instance the boa mlb card was back after spend the best offers from amex are typically reserved for people who have never had an amex before now you have an amex it doesnt sound like you know that a lot of those cards with annual fees waive the fee for the first year and many you can downgrade to a card with no annual fee before the first year is over chase has a rule which you have to look out for if i were you id read a ton more about churning before applying for more cards and better plan out your credit card future i find researching about credit cards and personal finance enriching and part of selfimprovement it is better time spend than shitposting about politics while not super on topic your comment about making more money in the future and traveling more is a bit of a red flag in the credit card game make sure not to go into debt meeting minimum spend assuming youll be able to pay it back in the future because of a pay bump
churning,not_removed,yeah theres a branch less than a block from his apartment wouldnt be much of a field trip
churning,not_removed,just read more dummy you think natural spend is the only way to hit minimums lol
churning,not_removed,what would you expect from
churning,not_removed,ah cmon dont be an ass sweetie
churning,not_removed,im just going to keep posting these until a megathread finally gets created
churning,not_removed,mine are unfrozen ms for both mb platinum and regular platinum edit tried a second transfer got the frozen error
churning,not_removed,have they been locked for weeks now
churning,not_removed,im not sure why i got excited by this post i checked like an hour ago and they were frozen checked again still frozen sigh did you transfer to a ff program
churning,not_removed,frozen yesterday just transferred miles to delta and it went through this time thanks for the heads up

churning,not_removed,able to transfer mr to eithad i was frozen for weeks but wasnt supposed to get unfrozen until the middle of august now i am going to try to get my raincheck on the eithad bonus that i requested when they were frozen edit amex not honoring the bonus to ethiad raincheck they promised when my account was frozen so i guess i will have to wait for another points bonus
churning,not_removed,transferred to spg and posted within hours weeks since i met my min requirement also got from prg in the last month or so no ms
churning,not_removed,mine were freed today as well and transferred out points better believe a csr convo is coming tomorrow as adequate points were available to make booking due to the month long wait we had to pay in cash over twice the value what a shit show that couldve been avoided by simply delaying the bonuses
churning,not_removed,met min spend called csr told me points would be available july tried to transfer yesterday error message called csr gave me a date of sept asked them to recheck since i had been given a date of july originally told me that i was right said to wait til monday because of the weekend still frozen as of today
churning,not_removed,unfrozen
churning,not_removed,not only are my points still frozen now the website is telling me that my card is not enrolled in the mr program
churning,not_removed,dp mine are unfrozen roughly a third of the minimum spend was done with serve too but ive been throwing additional spend on the card just in case time to go book some flights
churning,not_removed,not unfrozen
churning,not_removed,unable to process
churning,not_removed,code so sad
churning,not_removed,i just transferred to my delta and it went through says it will be credited to my skymiles account in hours but then i tried to transfer some to asia miles to my authorized user and no go code what gives
churning,not_removed,how many weeks from the statement closing with the min spend are you at how many weeks from the actual charge that put you at min spend are you at
churning,not_removed,mines still frozen sigh
churning,not_removed,still frozen met min spend back in may
churning,not_removed,anyone ever transfer to morgan stanley for in value i am guilty of the occasional uber redemption i am pushing mrs and dont see the harm in burning or here and there especially if i am gonna get reimbursed with a drink or three

churning,not_removed,mine still frozen have called to complain twice in two days
churning,not_removed,datapoint still frozen sadface
churning,not_removed,they had been locked since at least june
churning,not_removed,on delta skymiles are roughly worth a banana
churning,not_removed,youd think the mods could post a simple explanation as to why they wont put up a megathread instead they waste time responding to this guy
churning,not_removed,how many weeks from the statement closing with the min spend are you at how many weeks from the actual charge that put you at min spend are you at
churning,not_removed,ha they really blueballed you with that edit
churning,not_removed,yes transferred to delta
churning,not_removed,glad you have been thawed
churning,not_removed,how many weeks from the statement closing with the min spend are you at how many weeks from the actual charge that put you at min spend are you at
churning,not_removed,how many weeks from the statement closing with the min spend are you at how many weeks from the actual charge that put you at min spend are you at
churning,not_removed,weeks since the actual min spend charge or weeks from when that statement with min spend closed
churning,not_removed,how many weeks from the statement closing with the min spend are you at how many weeks from the actual charge that put you at min spend are you at
churning,not_removed,similar situation here i tried went all the way up past supervisor to manager it seems they are ready for these complaints and are standing by their week bs saying its in the terms they didnt blink when i said what will you do to keep my business
churning,not_removed,are you unfrozen
churning,not_removed,how many weeks from the statement closing with the min spend are you at how many weeks from the actual charge that put you at min spend are you at
churning,not_removed,did you make it to without the serve spend the card fee or the airline reimbursement
churning,not_removed,see if the dl miles actually post you definitely got the same error code everyone whose points were frozen did for that asia miles transfer
churning,not_removed,schwab not ms
churning,not_removed,they did an enquiry and called me back today to say that i needed to wait weeks i said that it had been the rep went away and then said you should be unlocked on aug due to reaching spending on jun i asked her to notate that in my record well see
churning,not_removed,damn my last dl redemption only got me a kiwi nice job
churning,not_removed,you mean like in all honesty theres not a ton going on right now and most of the amex points freezing threads have had varied and interesting discussion the mods have obviously talked about whether a megathread is warranted or not weve heard the complaints from what we believe to be a vocal minority of users at this point if and when we change our minds ie there is an actual announcement instead of idle speculation and data points there will be a megathread in the meantime upvote threads you think positively add to the discussion and downvote threads you dont
churning,not_removed,thank you
churning,not_removed,june spending finished june paid off fully edit called about my points last week and told it would be another weeks june not july sorry
churning,not_removed,another level to the freezebastards haha
churning,not_removed,weeks from statement closing would be middle of august points posting is weeks but tried to transfer yesterday and no luck edit called last week and they said it would be early august when i paid off the min spend
churning,not_removed,weeks since the actual min spend charge
churning,not_removed,just called a few hours ago still frozen they said wait til aug to let their computers unfreeze the points i filed a complaint with the cfmb right after i did mention to the rep that it seemed unfair that i had waited the full weeks per their tc and i had missed out on flights and had to pay cash when i shouldve had the points available he said there was nothing he could do except transfer me to their travel agents who could book the flights and let me pay with points at a rate of points per dollar no thanks edit cfpb not cfmb
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,nope im probably at around of natural spend and will make sure i complete the before the deadline though
churning,not_removed,right will report back for the record my platinum points posted on june so just started my week edit we really need to get a megathread going
churning,not_removed,right my bad what is the minimum amount to open a schwab account plus you would get mrs and airline credit and the ability to cash out all your mrs at would this be a good idea for a person who used to travel but stopped if this cs amex plat added another person as an au would they be able to transfer their mrs into the schwab account if they were also listed on it
churning,not_removed,are you unfrozen
churning,not_removed,amex freezing all points is a violation of the terms no matter which way you put it ideally their business assets should be frozen in the us until they comply my points were unfrozen a week or so ago and i transferred them and closed immediately
churning,not_removed,thats fine with me all i was looking for was a response and i have it now thanks
churning,not_removed,that doesnt line up at all with the weeks they have been quoting
churning,not_removed,thank you for the reply trying to gather data points im hoping you dont get unfrozen weeks after pts posted that was mid july for me and i met spend in may
churning,not_removed,i also got a august date when i called a week ago
churning,not_removed,hey quick question do you know where in the tc it says they have weeks to freeze points
churning,not_removed,im in the same boat i crossed the if you take out the annual fee but that includes of reimbursed airline fees should probably spend a little more before my boa cards arrive
churning,not_removed,lol my points posted may theyre clearly not even trying to follow the tcs
churning,not_removed,no minimum open the bank account currently bonus to compensate for hard eq pull and a schwab one account will automatically be opened
churning,not_removed,this is true i tried last week to buy a gift card and was rejected just transferred to hilton without a problem a few min ago
churning,not_removed,finally unfrozen i filed the complaint and days later they responded with we have looked into your account and released your points immediately transferred to delta and it went through
churning,not_removed,no idea theyre the ones that told me their terms and conditions had a week period before points may be available
churning,not_removed,congrats its been over weeks for me now and im considering your route
churning,not_removed,hey there atx local here we have a pretty sizeable local group that has had a couple meetups since july i think we have had people at each one so far so you could probably count on us being there

churning,not_removed,anyone here over i suppose we can also list annual ms volume
churning,not_removed,chronic churning going for million points in a year
churning,not_removed,only
churning,not_removed,who has achieved the most in the churning community in year without a contribution from a so
churning,not_removed,keep up the good work rchurning i continue to rely on yall to know the answer to lifes most pressing question httpswwwredditcomrchurningsearchqsearssortnewrestrictsron
churning,not_removed,does anyone else find it weird when the worst category on a store card is the store it came from
churning,not_removed,it is a public offer
churning,not_removed,anybody have any luck pcing their card
churning,not_removed,youll notice that they are removing the sears name from the card
churning,not_removed,they cant afford to give cardusers that big a discount with the state of their financials lol
churning,not_removed,our books need to be kept clean for future audits im no accountant but this seems like a potential headache down the road that could easily cost more than to resolve even if its technically legit theres a reason many companies ban point redemptions for business travel period
churning,not_removed,if you want to maintain a good relationship with your company i would highly discourage this yes they would be happy to save but it would look very bad on your part to pocket the especially if they find out you used miles to pay the for the flight after they reimburse you
churning,not_removed,i wouldnt do it keep things simple this would be hard to explain after the fact in an audit and likely wouldnt hold up
churning,not_removed,technically speaking you arent selling your miles they stay in your account and you use them to purchase a ticket you are selling the ticket to your employer at a price you believe to be fair so have you considered that you may need to pay taxes on the you get from your employer
churning,not_removed,dont shit where you eat
churning,not_removed,since people have already covered why not to use points might i suggest you use credit cards with statement credits for travel in the future arrival venture rewards and the new pnc premier traveler come to mind you can charge the flight as a normal charge on your credit card and then do a statement credit months later that or just a card which earns miles for that airline which you can bank for personal use
churning,not_removed,fwiw my fiancee gets conference stipends and we use it for a trip every year i usually book hotels with refundable rates and submit then cancel and rebook with points with flights i book companion pass and submit the charge she has an amazing relationship with everyone in her practice and theyre aware of it though
churning,not_removed,i will chime in as a former accountant still a cpa i dont consider that this would be a high risk expense item although i highly doubt it would pass an audit it technically isnt a reimbursement since you didnt lay out the money in the first place on audits the irss favorite first place to look is meals entertainment and travel in all likelyhood if they did question the transaction they would likely classify it as employee comp which would just reclassify the transaction from travel to compensation this wouldnt change the taxability to the company but it would make the money taxable to you my suggestion its unlikely to ever come up but probably not worth it
churning,not_removed,hey everyone thank you all for the input it does seem that involving my company will over complicate things ill probably save them for friends and family and offer them discounts for their flights cheers
churning,not_removed,does not seem worth the risk to you or your company
churning,not_removed,gray area here definitely but i dont see anything wrong with it in principle is there a refundable ticket for that you can purchase cancel submit the receipt for reimbursement and then use your points to book should be the same exact flight for it to be somewhat kosher most accounting departments wouldnt have a problem as long as it shows what the lowest market price was for the ticket and the flight your coworker flew is indeed that exact flight that was reimbursed
churning,not_removed,i understand the process is transparent with your company and co worker but are there any terms and conditions from airlines regarding not being my able to sell your miles of course airlines will have no easy way to know but since everything will be documented and the amount probably taxed figured i would ask
churning,not_removed,i used to work for a company that actually had language written into the employee manual about this if you used personal miles for workrelated travel they would reimburse the price of the ticket but only up to you may want to dig around and see if an old policy is in place people may have just forgotten about it
churning,not_removed,one thing that needs to be taken into consideration is also why the coworker is flying is he visiting a customer if so is the expense going to be charged back to the customer if the answer to the above is yes i would be very very wary of using miles because contractually you could be putting the company in a sticky situation for reimbursement
churning,not_removed,i wouldnt risk it you want to keep your books clean for future audit then do things in standard way anything out of ordinary you better be ready to explain and convince irs and do you really want to do that rich people use complicated financial instruments and vehicles even when they have to explain meticulously if theres an audit because they can save buttload of money so its worth it but for this kind of redemption just go pure kosher man save your points for your travel
churning,not_removed,why would you do this you can earn points off your company paid for flight answer to your question is entirely up to what company you work for and what their policies are currently my company requires all bookings to be through the official travel agent and paid for with a company card
churning,not_removed,i doubt any company that has a clue would do this why would they buy them from you as opposed to a third party what happens with cancelled flights rescheduled flights etc let alone the violation of the tcs of the program by doing this
churning,not_removed,just book it with cash and earn some more points
churning,not_removed,dont do it just get a revenue flight accumulate points on it to use elsewhere and get reimbursed for the cash the the company would save is not worth the accounting complexity and risk of future audit
churning,not_removed,first i applaud you for wanting to have full transparency with your employer i discussed in length on a previous post similar to this with the importance of having disclosure with your employer for any sort of cash in hand profit you get for business related activities i was surprised how many folks here believed in the what they dont know wont hurtem philosophy now to your story as long as you have disclosed the nature of the transaction with your employer and received an okpreferably in writing from your boss hr andor legal then you should be just fine source work in hr for large company
churning,not_removed,to keep the books clean you could setup yourself as an llc or sole proprietor as a travel concierge or similar unicorn travel services seems legit
churning,not_removed,unless it is a very small company id wager businesses in general value convenience and reliability over saving who do you think primarily uses those concierge lines that never have the best deals but take care of everything for you
churning,not_removed,i dont think youre reading it correctly it seems to me a coworker is in play here so op is offering to effectively sell the company hisher points at mutual benefit
churning,not_removed,you may need definitely need if you are profiting you probably wouldnt get caught but if hes profiting he definitely owes taxes
churning,not_removed,do you couldnt you claim a loss equal to the sale price
churning,not_removed,doesnt work with most business travel as they look at the receipt after travel is completed whats this you paid no cash just points reimbursement
churning,not_removed,i usually book hotels with refundable rates and submit then cancel and rebook with points so fraud then
churning,not_removed,on audits the irss favorite first place to look is meals entertainment and travel exact reason my company doesnt play around all travel is done through cwt company we currently have a contract with and paid for on a company card meals and other incidentals are done using rates set out by the dos at a flat per diem
churning,not_removed,this x that is exactly what i do
churning,not_removed,is there a refundable ticket for that you can purchase cancel submit the receipt for reimbursement and then use your points to book thats called fraud
churning,not_removed,terms and conditions from airlines regarding not being my able to sell your miles you are correct you can book travel for yourself or gift travel to others you absolutely cannot chargebarterexchangeinvoiceetc other party to use your miles that is the salient point in my mind not sure why you were downvoted im not an accountant but i can imagine that would be a monumental headache if op wants to help out his company they can donate the travel otherwise they might as well go to sellingmilescom ffs
churning,not_removed,the miles arent being sold as they belong to the op and op is the one to redeem them
churning,not_removed,they use quickbooks how big do you think they are
churning,not_removed,thank you for the response for clarification this process will be transparent with the employer and the accountant as uvigilias pointed out i am looking for a means to sell my points at a mutual benefit with full transparency with my employer
churning,not_removed,unless theyre trying to sneak this by their employer together then i agree shady move
churning,not_removed,lol try telling that to the irs
churning,not_removed,its probably ymmv based on the company i submit the original travel receipt for airfare only because any seat upgrades adjust the ticket price and come out of my pocket
churning,not_removed,most probably her company pays upon purchase not travel and based on value of ticket not how it was paid they know we rebook with points its a small practice and everyone gathers socially i would never be allowed to do the same at my firm
churning,not_removed,no not at all they pay the value of the ticket regardless of how its paid theyre aware that we book with points but use the original price as a basis for refund try reading comprehension next time k
churning,not_removed,yeanot exactly miles points have a monetary value its mostly fluid and adjustable value but monetary value nonetheless by booking the refundable ticket youre establishing what the market value is to your company for that ticket in order to get reimbursed if you purchase with milespoints and get reimbursed the value in cash it may not be morally kosher to everyone but it is definitely not fraud
churning,not_removed,yes they are being sold read the tc
churning,not_removed,i dont know about the formal definition but early stage startup to me seems like anywhere from people id put the not caring about saving for convenience line at about people
churning,not_removed,i think the proper way to do this is buy the ticket with your points give receipt for point redemption flight to accountant be reimbursed as a normal dollar reimbursement for all parties go on your merry ways
churning,not_removed,you book it then cancel and submit the receipt for something you didnt pay for to get reimbursement that is the definition of fraud
churning,not_removed,by booking the refundable ticket youre establishing what the market value is to your company for that ticket in order to get reimburse except you arent because the market value for a ticket to get you to your destination is a nonrefundable fare and you arent doing this to set the market value youre doing this to submit the ticket for reimbursement as though thats what it cost to get you to your destination when it didnt
churning,not_removed,yeah no its exactly fraud first off miles and points have no monetary value try reading your tc sometime second youre booking a refundable ticket and submitting that for reimbursement youre then canceling that ticket and booking something cheaper welcome to the definition of fraud
churning,not_removed,i clarified what i meant in another post the miles arent being sold the ticket purchased with the miles is sold instead and yes the idea of selling the benefits of the rewards program is against the tc of most programs
churning,not_removed,good idea just talk to the accountant beforehand to make sure this can work out on their end
churning,not_removed,youre paying the market value in points and miles and receiving compensation for the market value in cash nonrefundable tickets are not market value as theyre restricted rates that have limitations in place ie non refundable and non cancelable
churning,not_removed,try purchasing the amount of points youll need to redeem for the ticket it will cost much more if there was no monetary value then how are you able to purchase points directly from the company with cash when you receive points miles as a promotional award there is a stated arv value in which youll have to pay taxes ontherefore there is a monetary value that you can argue
churning,not_removed,the miles arent being sold the ticket purchased with the miles is sold instead thats the same freaking thing try that argument in front of a judge
churning,not_removed,they are same thing all those people who got banned for selling miles online dont necessarily sell their miles which is hard for most of the airlines they get caught because they book tickets with miles and have a monetary transaction for them you might think its similar to you buying a revenue ticket and selling them to the company but its not the monetary vehicle is the crux of the issue when you buy a ticket with miles you are technically buying a ticket with the airlines asset not yours no matter how much you want to argue for airlines this isnt a kosher transaction
churning,not_removed,nonrefundable tickets absolutely are the market value for what my company would otherwise pay to get me from point a to point b my company wouldnt pay as much for a flight they know i need to take theyd want me to buy the nonrefundable ticket
churning,not_removed,youre talking purchase price that does not equate to monetary value you could have a million skymiles today and tomorrow delta decides to kill the program or kick you out of it you have no recourse for your loss because the miles themselves have no monetary value
churning,not_removed,its actually a distinctly different thing they may both be not allowed but they are different things
churning,not_removed,im not arguing this transaction isnt kosher im simply stating that the miles and the ticket are two different things if the miles were sold they would be transferred from ops account to the coworker or bosss account and that person would book the ticket
churning,not_removed,all major us airlines except one provide a refund when canceling within hours of making the reservation therefore you can book the cheapest rate cancel and then book with points for most us airlines
churning,not_removed,the value youre able to get for your miles is how much theyre worth and how much you should be compensated for so if today if i redeem a ticket worth for of my miles my company should reimburse me for would you think differently if it was a travel voucher worth x do you think you should be reimbursed if you used a personal travel voucher for your business flight ticket its the exact same thing so is this fraud nobut it is gaming the system im assuming since youre on this thread that you churn ccs for signup bonuses so youre no stranger to gaming the system
churning,not_removed,sigh you really dont get the point do you yes technically they are different but in the eyes of the airline which is what really matters they are same you are not supposed to get any monetary gain from the miles period thats the tc again try arguing with the airline and let me know what is your result
churning,not_removed,the value youre able to get for your miles is how much theyre worth and how much you should be compensated for so if today if i redeem a ticket worth for of my miles my company should reimburse me for no they should reimburse you nothing because it cost you nothing you may value those miles as but their actual value is nothing would you think differently if it was a travel voucher worth x do you think you should be reimbursed if you used a personal travel voucher for your business flight ticket its the exact same thing no again companies reimburse you for what it cost you you do realize they arent just doing this because theyre nice right these are qualified business expenses that they can use to offset taxes so is this fraud nobut it is gaming the system im assuming since youre on this thread that you churn ccs for signup bonuses so youre no stranger to gaming the system yes submitting a false receipt is fraud you didnt spend on that ticket you canceled that reservation getting a refund and then submitted the receipt for reimbursement
churning,not_removed,yes technically they are different thats been my point the while time you are not supposed to get any monetary gain from the miles period thats the tc i have never argued against this point i dont know why you keep bringing it up
churning,not_removed,did you still fly on that flight where tickets were worth if so then not fraud and company needs to reimburse you if they dont have miles to reimburse then they need to pay you cash
churning,not_removed,bc your first comment is the miles arent being sold as they belong to the op and op is the one to redeem them you are implying that technical difference doesnt make any difference theres no point of distinguishing them when the end result is same when the airline finds it out
churning,not_removed,no it doesnt because your miles have no monetary value httpdavidandersonassociatescomfraudinvestigationsidentifycommonexpensereimbursementschemes the scheme some companies allow employees to travel in first or business class or to book coach tickets that allow flight plan changes without incurring an additional change fee fraud occurs when an employee buys a ticket with a personal credit card submits the cost for reimbursement and then returns the ticket to the airline for reimbursement and replaces it with less expensive travel according to anderson a forensic accountant who also is a certified fraud examiner the employee may fly coach instead of first or business class replace a nonchange fee ticket with a less expensive ticket that carries a change fee use frequent flyer miles or even travel by train or car instead of plane
churning,not_removed,did you ignore the post after that the one you replied to
churning,not_removed,wrong miles have a monetary value to the airline otherwise they would not accept reward flight redemptions for that flight therefore if youre able to book the same flight with miles the dollar cost of the ticket is what your miles are worth to the airlines they could easily black out award redemptions if the discrepancy was too much i agree with all other examples in the article for fraud however using miles instead of cash is not fraud and probably wouldnt hold up in court if the employer pursued legal action this is a pretty common occurrence in the workplace and employers that dont want it to happen issue corporate cards for business related expenses
churning,not_removed,no the miles have no monetary value the ticket has a value to the airline the miles do not miles are no different from a punchcard at your local coffee shop its an accepted loss to foster customer loyalty a business expense go tell delta you want to sell them back all your miles oh you cant right because the miles hold no monetary value you can argue about it all day but what you are suggesting here is fraud i provided you with a link to a law firm that specializes in forensic accounting and fraud detection they used the exact situation youre advocating as an example of fraud
churning,not_removed,i can sell chase ur points back to chase for or i can sell points to them for united milessounds like monetary value to me if achase ur points bcash and achase ur points c united milesthen cunited miles
churning,not_removed,this really isnt that hard of a concept ur points are considered a rebate when used for cash back united miles have no value united will not let you cash them out you can exchange them for a free plane ticket in the same way i can exchange box tops for a free toy do those box tops have a monetary value no
churning,not_removed,sounds like you need a lesson in economics definition of monetary value the amount of value an item or a service has in relation to if it were sold for cash to a willing buyer read more doesnt matter if the willing buyer is the consumer company or party if one of those parties is willing to purchase for cash then that good has monetary value in this case the monetary value could be determined in court by the price in which the airline or company is selling those points for cash
churning,not_removed,and to answer your questionif your grandma wanted to buy those box tops from you for and a kiss on the cheek then those box tops would have monetary value
churning,not_removed,irs pub business expenses to be deductible for tax purposes expenses incurred for travel meals and entertainment must be ordinary and necessary expenses incurred while carrying on your trade or business generally you also must show that entertainment expenses including meals are directly related to or associated with the conduct of your trade or business for more information on travel meals and entertainment including deductibility see pub pib travel by airplane train bus or car between your home and your business destination if you were provided with a free ticket or you are riding free as a result of a frequent traveler or similar program your cost is zero no value
churning,not_removed,not sure why youre referencing the irs tax code for business expenses your flight ticket would never be tax deductible if you paid cash or with miles as your company is reimbursing you try again
churning,not_removed,and all you would have to do is purchase the number of miles directly from the airline redeem for ticket then claim on your taxes
churning,not_removed,try reading sometime flight tickets are a business expense hence the link to the publications that state that they are a business expense this whole thread is about someone using miles to pay for a business expense which is tax deductible if paid for in cash its not deductible if you use miles as those have no value
churning,not_removed,yes they are a business expense but this entire thread were talking about employer reimbursement see title in which case the ticket whether paid for by cash or miles would not be tax deductible and i very clearly explained that if you had your own business and would be looking to deduct you could very easily purchase the points outright redeem for flights and then claim the purchase price of the points on your taxes therefore value is established
churning,not_removed,cant answer this survey properly as a couple of my answers would be zero and you have no option for that
churning,not_removed,how does one gets banned from kid r us and why
churning,not_removed,search for survey result
churning,not_removed,who is this one guy with zero cards that enjoys reading about all the amazing trips churning has made possible and still has the absolute willpower to not get in on the action ama pls
churning,not_removed,first question needs revision does it mean have open right now have opened in total there also need to be options for
churning,not_removed,question where are you banned from best answer your moms bedroom classic i almost spit my coffee out
churning,not_removed,your poll could use some clarification the first question is how many cards do you open in which time frame edit sorry ive been drinking and cant spell
churning,not_removed,that guy thats closed cards and is banned from kids r us
churning,not_removed,as a beginner since summer i currently have all the cards that i have applied open so year mark is still months later i would suggest an entry of how many are you planning to close in next month or something like that
churning,not_removed,just as an aside this poll is irrelevant without including earnings opening up walmart cards wont exactly make you a heavy churner a person with wf card opened in the past months can be a much bigger player than someone with cards opened for points each the poll should include options for earnings cb flexible currencies ur mr spg typ airline miles and hotel points separate because its criminal to put hh in the same category as as that being said the big players will likely never let on just how hard theyre hitting for those people the less spoken the better in general there tends to be an inverse relationship between outspokenness and output
churning,not_removed,nice survey i wonder if it be interesting to go deeper to see why we churn i actually dont travel much and am single but i spend about a month on average on credit cards and just discovered this as a way to maximize reward points i just plan on rolling through one after another with my daily spend only on my card though other people hit it a little harder and find ways to pay their rentmortage and all spending essentially through cards then we have the most active who frequently use ms to maximize rewards so maybe a multiple choice question asking something along the lines of what category of churner one considers themelves would be interesting to see
churning,not_removed,seems to me im hitting it way harder than average any reason for those of you who only opened cards in just trying to be respectful of banks financials
churning,not_removed,any other suggestions are welcome cant figure out how to get results to show for everyone without submitting a new one
churning,not_removed,just call it
churning,not_removed,stay classy reddit
churning,not_removed,this is not a moronic monday question
churning,not_removed,you are talking about ms and i agree if you would like to make that poll i would take it also the big hitters get banned i just met a dude who is banned from chase citi staples paypal and bunch of other places i think for most of us being banned form chase or citi is a big deal
churning,not_removed,you can always sell your stuff for cash i have done it multiple times doc has some articles on it
churning,not_removed,i opened my first card in the only reason i opened a second was because i was working nearby a target and i was buying stuff from there often pretty much every shift so i wanted to save on everything from there starting in feb then i found the freedom in december and rchurning shortly after thus my reason for opening in
churning,not_removed,almost bought a house so had to slow down for a while picked up more cards a few weeks ago though so ramping back up
churning,not_removed,you may want to add a response for example i have closed cards so far in
churning,not_removed,i agree with a zero option i have not yet closed any cards in either
churning,not_removed,i havent closed any cards in someone else might not have opened any yet someone else might have not closed any in why attack me for giving you some simple feedback
churning,not_removed,i think zero is uniquely different from though
churning,not_removed,also different from through when you think about it
churning,not_removed,probably and while very different are things nonchurners are very likely to pick and up with unlikely to be a nonchurner sure there are many people that will still do cards in a year but that number drops a whole lot since most people only get like cards total ever
churning,not_removed,what cachaça you using op cheers i shouldnt have married a brazilian now im an alcoholic thanks to her
churning,not_removed,just out of curiosity why is a post thanking the community being downvoted to hell ╥ ╥ i love all you guys hahaha
churning,not_removed,yea thank you especially to those who go through mm daily you all are so helpful
churning,not_removed,ill agree this is a great community and i have really appreciated all the support both wayskeep it up reddit
churning,not_removed,enough of poopbutted threads like this
churning,not_removed,op care to share the comment which helped the fellow redditor it might be useful for me and others
churning,not_removed,velho barreiro not sure if theres better but thats what we had at the house haha open to suggestions
churning,not_removed,we love you its just that threads like these tend to clutter more important information and something as simple as saying thanks could be saved for another thread i havent downvoted you but i think thats why youre being downvoted
churning,not_removed,bro go redeem some points and loosen up you commented this thread twice so youre clearly bored but looking at your post history your last posts are either disparaging someone talking about farting or commenting on an year old chicks butthole go contribute something positive and stop having an ugly soul
churning,not_removed,it was a loophole thread for the platinum select
churning,not_removed,you sound fun
churning,not_removed,tell me im not the only one who looked through his history for the year old chick butthole post couldnt find it though lol
churning,not_removed,i am
churning,not_removed,i dont even like buttholes
churning,not_removed,yes there will be a hard pull
churning,not_removed,but it is true that it does not show up on your report generally if it is a small buis card
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,may want to read teh section in the wiki just for this card httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiindexwikiboaalaskaaircard what you are seeing has been reported before
churning,not_removed,if the card is exactly the same in every way then yes anything days is flagged as a duplicate in some cases i think mlb you can skate by because of the different team choices they dont seem to always enforce the days duplicate thing but its not a brand new rule just seems the system kicks out the app if it is the same exact card within days
churning,not_removed,it isnt normal lots of folks got multiple mlb cards on one day i got i saw for one person i think most folks churning as cards do two apps at a time chalk it up to the vagaries of bofa credit applications hope you get approved
churning,not_removed,are there good transfer partners for the alaska points who can you move them out to if so
churning,not_removed,which is why they tighten it up now
churning,not_removed,you dont move them out to any other partners you simply book partners with alaskan miles alaska has different redemption rates for different partners but you can often find some pretty low redemption rates on those partners
churning,not_removed,google alaska airlines partner awards youll get better info than the other idiot who responded gave plus youll learn how easy it is to find some of these things on your own
churning,not_removed,alaska points are mostly only useful for their wide selection of partners such as avis budget holiday inn total rewards and motel i have heard some people having success using them to book a corvette from jfk to lax with a personal driver for like points the signup bonus of this product for more information i would read more on the as site overall i give the card dongers up because i much prefer cards with better earning structure where i can get lots for free such as this card
churning,not_removed,this isnt new it just isnt common the mlb churnathon didnt affect how they handle multiple applications
churning,not_removed,ah i get it now thanks
churning,not_removed,thanks for being condescending ive searched and keep finding ways to earn alaska miles via all the partners instead of ways to redeem them
churning,not_removed,how about their utility for you know actually flying to or around alaska
churning,not_removed,i wasnt aiming the idiot comment at you no condescension here i meant the guy who replied sarcastically before me and yes i am trying to teach you how to redeem alaska airline miles on their partner airlines you cant transfer alaska miles like ur mr or typ please google what i told you and you will see your redemption options
churning,not_removed,alaska is great on the west coast flights to hawaii they also serve my tiny local airport which is nice

churning,not_removed,that moment when your coworker almost defends himself and starts a new topic with i know it sounds weird to pay such a high annual fee and proceeds to tell you he got the csr
churning,not_removed,just a psa dont forget to check that your af has been refunded regardless of what the csr says just got a month late notice for a card i closed in november boa alaska business the csr said they would refund the af but never did card doesnt even show up on my online account noticed that the af was still on my personal alaska account too closed a few weeks ago had to have them manually remove it this time my citi premier card which i downgraded to double cash still has the af from the premier too
churning,not_removed,brother in law was bragging yesterday about charging a month on his chase freedom mostly travel and then paying for their vacation using a cash rebate on his statement i immediately took out my different chase cards tried to explain the difference and how much more money he could be making and how much more travel he could be getting he said it sounds too hard and would probably need me to manage it i spent the rest of the dinner dreaming about what i could accomplish with organic spend every month
churning,not_removed,i have been checking my girlfriends preapproved offers with citi for the past several months there was nothing there last week she downgraded citi aa platinum to bronze to avoid af and a couple of days later shes got a preapproved offer for aa platinum with no language anyone else experienced something similar
churning,not_removed,just a note that ive booked two summer camps for my son this week and both coded as travellodging when they posted wasnt expecting that nasas space camp in huntsville and a local one so you might use a card that pays extra for travel if youre booking camps

churning,not_removed,not the two most important dps but maybe it will help one of you out i booked a flight on studentuniversecom with my csr and it coded as travel so i got points and reimbursed havent used my credit yet i also added to my chickfila mobile balance with my csr and it does indeed code as restaurant for ur
churning,not_removed,got my bonus it looks like my ach from ally triggered the dd requirement is there any reason i should keep this account open i dont do a whole lot of ms really hardly any though i do have branches that are local to me
churning,not_removed,generated a referral link for my amex bgr and while the email said it was for the bonus when i clicked the link it too me to an application page for a bonus i generated a new link today and the same email was received but this time it linked to the matching bonus page just something to keep an eye on
churning,not_removed,amex gc purchased still pending with citi aa plat card it was purchased right after the statement cut so hopefully it clears by the end of it but come on days
churning,not_removed,how does a noshow work with the global entry interview hospital work is variable and i currently have an appointment at pm depending on how many patients are on the floori can get out at pm or pm i want to keep the appointment and try to make it but am afraid i might pull a no show
churning,not_removed,few questions first off does sallie mae transitioning count as a new account i have a csp csr and getting cf in the mail now also have my sallie mae in the last until july so now first im wondering what i should go for next thinking cfu i also need to get rid of the csp to avoid the af so should i just downgrade it to the cfu or maybe ask for retention bonus then cfu will i still be able to get the sign on bonus for it or should i apply separately i got cfu to cover groceries from sallie mae but still looking for gas and long term groceries so return on cfu looks nice when freedom doesnt cover it also if i want to do card apps at what should i do as i want to go ahead and get to soon because then i want the ihg chase amazon the hilton amex and probably a bunch others i have a trip in may that id like to use the ihg card and a trip in july that id like to use the hilton card lastly assuming i get all these cards and end up with accounts or whatever by may with all being a year or younger csp will be months by then am i essentially fucked for getting chase cards for months marriott is really the only other one i could imagine wanting bad enough for the anniversary points edit let me know if this is weekly thread material
churning,not_removed,do we have any guide that looks at what to get while respecting combining hps im pretty sure that chase has extended me all the credit theyre going to and im over so im looking to see which other bank i can get the most valuehp out of
churning,not_removed,anyone know if amex waives annual fees for au for military too i have a plat with fees waived but im thinking of adding my so as an au if no one knows i may just be the dp
churning,not_removed,what are the recent dps on where sunriseblackhawk issued vgcs work po wm
churning,not_removed,for the citi bank aadvantage when they say points if you spend in months do they mean spend by the end of the months even if the full balance hasnt been paid or do you have to spend and pay the before the months ends
churning,not_removed,probably too early to ask but are people thinking of keeping the csr or dropping it by next year my primary interest is east asia travel so im thinking of pcing the csr in time and pick up a prg for the anaunited flights
churning,not_removed,at least you now know you have someone at work your can discuss lifes important questions with
churning,not_removed,im picturing you two sitting around talking about sports and he brings this topic up cue awkward silence you reassure him there are dozens of us and then fade out to you two talking and you are not alone by mj starts playing
churning,not_removed,i can never have a conversation with others about churning without feeling the need to pull out whatever hair i have left on the my head cant see how to explain all this stuff to people who have savings actually carry balances on their ccs and pay interest till the sweet release of death
churning,not_removed,ive had only one coworker thats a churner so far we had a bond stronger than some marriages
churning,not_removed,i like it when a coworker in the cafe line sees my csr card and just launches into a points conversation the csr really is the icebreaker of churners
churning,not_removed,i was asked to pay the citi premier annual fee and they said that itll be refunded within days on the citi double cash card that i downgraded it to that was in early january so keeping close eye on it for the refund i hope i dont have to call them
churning,not_removed,thats good to know am about to start my round of cancellations soon so appreciate the reminder
churning,not_removed,i dont even worry about points from regular spending im always doing one signup bonus or another meet the minimum spend for the bonus and move on to the next card
churning,not_removed,at the very least he should get the fu that shouldnt be too hard to manage i would hope
churning,not_removed,the too hard thing always gets me when im not talking about churning and just walking through csrcfcfu seriously its too hard to remember different things
churning,not_removed,just did some quick calculations to compare cfu and cf assuming in spend a month and maximizing category spend though he probably doesnt on cf cfu x ur cf x x ur of course he could optimize his spend and get even more ur at the very least switching from cf to cfu gives an extra statement credit edit formatting
churning,not_removed,just get him to convert to the freedom unlimited one card no annual fee
churning,not_removed,just get him the usaa limitless or citi dc
churning,not_removed,i would recommend that you steer your brotherinlaw into getting a quicksilver or double cash he is never going to use the point transfer feature so its best to just get him a cash back card quicksilver is also has no ftf if he needs one of those cards
churning,not_removed,start small get him to apply for one card csr of you can overcome the af hurdle get the bonus realize how easy it was and move on from there
churning,not_removed,thats a weak humble brag if hes not going to bother maximizing citi double cash is probably best
churning,not_removed,sounds like citi being citi a citism perhaps no reason not to apply since the af is waived the first year unless youve got other application plans that an app for that card would interfere with
churning,not_removed,did you check the preapproved link with no month language to see if its usable by others if so youd be this subs hero
churning,not_removed,for space camp
churning,not_removed,for this
churning,not_removed,same anytime i bring it up first to my friends they look at me like im trying to sell them on a ponzi scheme
churning,not_removed,my motherinlaw needs a new card too but she only wants cash back because she doesnt travel and she wont consider a card with an annual fee
churning,not_removed,dont worry about hyatt they wont have any loyalty customers after this year jk i see this all the time with tone deaf companies alas you can only suffer in silence for their ignorance
churning,not_removed,when was the last time you checked knowing they can unfreeze on sunday is definitely going to increase the number of times per week i go in there and see if im still frozen
churning,not_removed,can you confirm you were able to transfer a large block say to a partner the reason i ask is because weve had some clueless posters claim they were unfrozen for cash redemptions you were always able to cash redeem its transferring to partners which is frozen
churning,not_removed,when did you complete min spend when did your mr post to your account
churning,not_removed,happy dance
churning,not_removed,mine is still frozen i met minimum spend on so its about weeks already
churning,not_removed,great news any more details such as when you met the spending and when your was posted
churning,not_removed,my points from the thanksgiving platinum posted on and points are still frozen
churning,not_removed,were you autoapproved for each card
churning,not_removed,same happened to me a couple months back applied for csr approved after recon wednesday of the first week then on tuesday the next week applied for ink denied and ritz approved after recon all pull
churning,not_removed,spg are great to accumulate get the personal and business before the offer goes away just use a referral link even if you dont have redemption to use now you can link to marriott and moving them around and adding to either marriott or spg points will keep them active if you have a so at your same address its very easy to combine spg balances
churning,not_removed,id say go for it its at the high offer there is also speculation about the future of the spg card such as the possibility it moves to another bank this could mean you can snag the current bonus as well as another one on the new card who knows what the spg points will be worth once the merger is complete but i think the odds are in your favor if you get the card now
churning,not_removed,spg cards arent fantastic keep cards but the points never expire and there are plenty of dps of people being offered generous starpoint rewards to not cancel after a year even if they overhaul the rewards program therell probably be some advance warning so you could cash out for airline points in the worst case
churning,not_removed,not crazy at all
churning,not_removed,well the spg program is likely to go away in january and merged fully into the marriot program so if you dont get them before then you wont be able to get the points at all
churning,not_removed,just depends on if there is a devaluation between now and then
churning,not_removed,its impressing children that make the hobby worthwhile
churning,not_removed,but the real question did it code as a restaurant
churning,not_removed,what they take credit card
churning,not_removed,next time use the ritz card its noticeably heavier heavy cards heavy wallets
churning,not_removed,no for me
churning,not_removed,why would it
churning,not_removed,awardwalletcom is awarding points for commenting on their blog used it last month to reset the month clock
churning,not_removed,assuming you dont have an aa card join aa dining book a trip for the future book a cheap one way flight that you wont use
churning,not_removed,cant you just do something to reset them eg use their shopping portal or if you have the cc charge something to the cc
churning,not_removed,pick up a few aa miles by commenting on awardwallet httpsawardwalletcomblogearnbonusaadvantagemilesforcomments
churning,not_removed,cant you just buy miles for like
churning,not_removed,the easiest way i think is join aa dining and then use the card you registered in aa dining to grab a soda from wendys
churning,not_removed,you can post a comment on the awardwallet blog for aa miles
churning,not_removed,the end of february thats too close for most methods to post in time likely going to need an activity directly with aa
churning,not_removed,i believe you could donate miles to a charity and that would reset the clock for the rest of your miles httpshubaacomenjudonate
churning,not_removed,subscribe to news china for miles
churning,not_removed,downgrade to the bronze didnt know that it still was around scrollup credit goes to mirob
churning,not_removed,i extended mine by donating miles
churning,not_removed,yeah just ask the csr shouldnt be a problem but if it is just have them mail it to you and you can mail to your mom
churning,not_removed,i asked this yesterday from what i was told you will pay resort fees and the taxes on those fees but not on the room rate
churning,not_removed,it might be ymmv but when i stayed at half moon bay last year i wasnt charged a resort fee
churning,not_removed,in addition to others comments i have read that in certain locations you can request the resort fees be waived if you already have status with the hotel chain because your status would presumably cover many of the features that the resort fees purport to cover
churning,not_removed,havent gotten my yet either i went back and read the fine print and they say it will be deposites with days of meeting qualification thats months hope you arent counting on having that money anytime soon
churning,not_removed,i didnt
churning,not_removed,i should add this as a flare by my username no i havent received the regions bonus either
churning,not_removed,have only seen data point of someone actually getting it so far
churning,not_removed,i was able to extend by months in was given a line of how it was one time exception of course worth a call
churning,not_removed,do we simply give the code to the banker if opening inbranch no need to show anything
churning,not_removed,it looks like i can generate endless email codes of premier plus savings and also total savings they all expire pm me with your email if you want a code let me know which one and ill forward the email
churning,not_removed,i got a this is a heavy card eh from a waitress in canada a couple weeks ago
churning,not_removed,my bosss reaction when i showed him mine the other day this thing was made for the music industry you could do some serious lines of coke with this i work at a record label
churning,not_removed,its funny my first ever and second card have both been metal csp csr so now that im not getting metal cards its almost a disappointment
churning,not_removed,wait until you get your hands on a ritz card that thing weighs a pound and does not bend because it is so thick
churning,not_removed,marriott card also i dont like the extra weight and thickness it adds to my already fat from churning wallet i ended up cancelling the card and was unable to destroy like i usually do with a pair of scissors
churning,not_removed,it always feels good to be complimented on the mass of my csr card
churning,not_removed,same thing happened to me when i was in pizza hut a few weeks ago definitely a nice compliment to have
churning,not_removed,i got a haircut with my new csr and they were complaining about the weight lol
churning,not_removed,or is this just an ad and effort to make me transfer more money into chase this one
churning,not_removed,if i were you i would be the dp and just attempt to sign up for it regardless of what assets i have with chase i realize that the dps of cpcs bypassing have dried up but for some reason i feel like that might be temporary or just ymmv ie i dont see how it hurts to be cpc edit tuthefithittheshan is probably right
churning,not_removed,not sure if the referral offer will have waived af if it does that turns it into with waived af or without i would still take the but others might prefer to save
churning,not_removed,yep this is the highest offer ever for the mpe and so your so would be better off to take it rather than wait for the referrals
churning,not_removed,you could try to apply directly for the ink preferred so you get the or possibly targeted coming soon bonus otherwise id go with spg at their properties and ur at for everything else since those are what i value the most edit sorry just saw the part where you were over open a biz checking and see if theres a pre approval its more work but would be worth it otherwise yeah csr or ink preferred
churning,not_removed,check preapprovals in branch to get a ur personal card then convert it to csr
churning,not_removed,depending on how much youll be able to spend on flights it may be worth to get one of the amex cards with a high mr return on airfare
churning,not_removed,if you are regularly spending nights at a hotel at a time i would get the citi prestige charge the nights to the company legitimately and you get a statement credit back for one night after the stay its easy to make a lot of money this way
churning,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiccreferrals
churning,not_removed,at least on the android app the links from the sidebar wont work within the app bookmark the link that urightatthelight mentioned in your browser
churning,not_removed,i dont bother with the official reddit client i use sync and a swipe from the right side of the screen on the app brings the sidebar while on rchurning
churning,not_removed,oh no i opened my account in november counting the days to close this piece of crap account
churning,not_removed,i recommend trying again once the af posts
churning,not_removed,why not wouldnt hurt to try times just in case
churning,not_removed,wait until youre closer to the af
churning,not_removed,i got lucky on call
churning,not_removed,thanks all ill hold off on calling again until it posts
churning,not_removed,depends on the state youre in some states require documentation while others are easier
churning,not_removed,in ca i didnt need any documentation but it varies state to state
churning,not_removed,be assertive about what business you do as the banker will definitely ask the question to fill in the form most people can mention their own trade as a side business or ebay of course in some states they ask for more documentation but even there if you are just starting up a new business those requirements are relaxed
churning,not_removed,my experience is they are very thorough so if you dont have some sort of actual business you may have a hard time they even asked for my website and about the kind of vendors i use and where they are located biz credit card recon interview was much easier
churning,not_removed,my banker didnt require any documentation but had to spend minutes asking the bankers questions about my business
churning,not_removed,churn your so
churning,not_removed,so why go for the companion pass do you travel a lot on wn anyway
churning,not_removed,same situation so i wont even go for it until next year
churning,not_removed,no other friends or family that like to travel
churning,not_removed,invite a friend
churning,not_removed,yes this can be used to drain the rebate vgcs too
churning,not_removed,of course theres a minimum load tho
churning,not_removed,fyi you can still use a visa or mc cc to pay navient directly if you call and just say its a debit card gift of college may be the way to go with amex though
churning,not_removed,yes i have been able to pay off my navient loans with gift of college
churning,not_removed,im also considering the same thing and would love a dp
churning,not_removed,this is useful for who are new
churning,not_removed,this was posted on flyertalk by the hilton rep are reward stays eligible members will earn bonus points with the points every day promotion if they have eligible incidental folio charges during a reward stay from so basically buy a soda or a candy bar and charge it to the room and you should get the points
churning,not_removed,i had a diamond award stay at an embassy suites booked through the app charged bar tab to the room checkout receipt showed id be earning points works
churning,not_removed,mine usually show up in a day or two no clue how its reported through rewards network though
churning,not_removed,or so biz days for me
churning,not_removed,do you mean wm mos ive never been able to get it to work for me i get the same error youre getting
churning,not_removed,crazy idea but have you tried taking the picture with the mo upside down
churning,not_removed,ive read that wu mo work never tried it myself
churning,not_removed,ive deposited western union ones without any trouble i think the problem with wm is the way they print the amount as not a solid black
churning,not_removed,same error for me
churning,not_removed,never worked for me
churning,not_removed,yes get those aus off asap it will help with preapprovals thats an aggressive strategy with the business cards but it can work like it did with my wife after applying for csp and sw plus i see youre at assuming youre going for the companion pass make sure you apply for the sw premier before united just in case you dont get an approval on the second card pcing the csp to fu seems unnecessary at the moment since all your spending will be going toward min spends is there a reason why you need to pc it so soon
churning,not_removed,great bold strategy not ideal to start working on the cp at this time of year as you will limit the time you could use it for but if you plan on getting those sw cards in november for cp then i see where your heads at
churning,not_removed,cant see her getting both the preferred and cash cards certainly not close together the cashback is nice on the cash card but that should come later in your strategy imo if you like the purchasing benefits of that card just pc to it from the ink preferred after hitting the bonus on preferred close the au accounts as soon as you think she can stand on her own and file disputes with the bureaus to have it removed from her reports takes you about minutes to file the dispute and typically days to get it removed
churning,not_removed,definitely dont see the preferredcash combo going down why arent you trying to bookend those preferred now cash at why are you trying to pc the csp so soon are you going for the cp because i definitely wouldnt put the mxp before the premier if thats the case its also hard to determine whats best with the information you gave without a timeline or idea of her business things may be different if theres months between step and and then zero months between steps and youll be ok as long as you reverse the order of the mxp and premier edit are to arent
churning,not_removed,if youre going to settle for a plat offer id just wait until novemberdecember so you can triple dip travel credit with af
churning,not_removed,platinum is not that uncommon rather wait for more organic spend opportunities when it comes to amex also you might be pushing it way too hard with amex cards in such a short period of time platinum wont go away and the bonuses are once per lifetime you can spread your reach to other cards that are churnable and wont be from the same issuer
churning,not_removed,im all about the hyatt card ive got most of my family getting that card so that we can all party together down in cancun at the hyatt zilara in the near future otherwise there is some real value with the ritz carlton if you can find that link my wife and i are still trying to figure out what amazing hotel to go check out for days
churning,not_removed,ritzcarlton visa infinite theres still a link for free nights after the minimum spend plus you get a travel credit and some cool visa infinite features like off roundtrip flights with a companion
churning,not_removed,if you havent gotten all the amex charge card bonuses id hit those up you can get those pretty easily even if youre over look at the cobranded ones like the ameriprise gold signup bonus but yeah hyatt cc is good too
churning,not_removed,you only need the by to get the companion pass you can keep working on adding more marriott points after youve been issued the companion passes from what csr told me you have up to a year from original date of purchase to upgrade and thats supposed to reset the clock on the year not sure what your status is but getting another spg to get the companion pass is worth slots in my opinion check out the referral thread for links
churning,not_removed,when i called about the atlantis two different csrs told me that it wasnt and that it was best bet is to call atlantis and ask them directly
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,just call again
churning,not_removed,sounds like bs to me although boa csrs always seem to have misinformation worth another call
churning,not_removed,its csr was bullshitting i did this a couple days ago for both of my bank of america cards just called the number on the back
churning,not_removed,lowes but with a max
churning,not_removed,those have the big dogs groceries drug stores office supply all seem to only have
churning,not_removed,i believe it would say something under the bonus points clause
churning,not_removed,so anyone can apply using the invitation when i went to test it out it required a last name and then autofilled in details for the targeted mailer is that all editable
churning,not_removed,probably using them at staples but the profit is nowhere near what it was at cvs
churning,not_removed,yea either order staples vgc online or eat the fee and go straight to walmart for a mo
churning,not_removed,personal card called the bankamericard cash rewards cc dont really see any downside no af min spend is easy also says since i am a preferred rewards platinum client is get a rewards bonus just read that i didnt include that i just got the barclay arrival plus weeks ago
churning,not_removed,i would go citi or barclay for my next min spend i would check out arrival
churning,not_removed,go for it
churning,not_removed,thats pretty awesome which card
churning,not_removed,is this for one of the business cards if so it has the benefit of not going on your personal credit report
churning,not_removed,get ready for another few thousand subscribers and more people to help fund our activities
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,yay
churning,not_removed,i withdrew most of my initial deposit after opening i kept in there and set up a monthly credit card bill payment received the bonus after meeting terms
churning,not_removed,there is no minimum balance so you could drain it and simply schedule transfers in and out to meet requirements as already mentioned a good idea would be leaving a small balance and scheduling small automatic bill pays towards a credit card
churning,not_removed,thats a great haul
churning,not_removed,it was alright
churning,not_removed,people watch the oscars
churning,not_removed,yep its great when you look at the front page and half the posts are card art or liter signup bonus jokes but posting something with amex or chase in the title automatically gets flagged
churning,not_removed,i know that citis does not cover home airport delays
churning,not_removed,id try but under not covered is delay that was made public or known to you prior to departure still worth the shot
churning,not_removed,what do you drive a vespa
churning,not_removed,is it really that hard to keep an account open for days the general consensus around here is to keep bank accounts open at least a couple months after receiving a bonus if we all close our accounts immediately after receiving bonuses banks will catch on and will be less likely to give the same bonus in the future
churning,not_removed,the mt bonus is really easy to complete and they pay you as soon as the direct deposit posts but you need to keep the account open for days or there is a early termination fee
churning,not_removed,bofa has a checking bonus but i think its targeted for credit card holders
churning,not_removed,im still waiting on the santander account to open for my offer otherwise it seems pretty easy to do one transaction in or out to avoid fees and even though it needs to stay open there isnt a minimum balance
churning,not_removed,where are you located
churning,not_removed,it is very complicated and different for every program the main way is banks buy the points from the airlineshotelsrewards network at a discount and the bank makes money off the up in usage sometimes though the company and the bank split the money from transaction fees
churning,not_removed,i know that the cobranded cards have been very lucrative for the airlines particularly for american and delta at the end of deltas partnership with amex was bringing in in annual revenue there was an article on americans cobrand financials recently on viewfromthewing
churning,not_removed,the cards also act as mini advertisements that help reinforce brand identity
churning,not_removed,edit he needs to fire his banker you are exactly right closing the cards and lowering his limits would increase his utilization ratio and as a result lower his credit score with the assumption that he isnt maxing his cards of course
churning,not_removed,that banker is setting him up for a high interest mortgage
churning,not_removed,he is getting poor advice i received a mortgage with cc open he will be asked for an explanation on why he has the number of credit cards he does and the reasoning for opening them saying rewards has sufficed for me and nearly everyone i have read about
churning,not_removed,wow that is definitely bad advice from a banker he does not have your friends best interest in mind
churning,not_removed,i agree thats bad advice its not the number of credit cards that matters lenders care about credit score utilization and debt to income ratio im about to close on a mortgage and my lender didnt bat an eye at my new credit cards since november my credit score above allowed me to get a competitive interest rate
churning,not_removed,not at all what may scare a lender could be if you have too many recent inquiries though
churning,not_removed,ive been complaining about the same thing on their desktop website every time i log in i have to answer two security questions wtf is that about
churning,not_removed,ive been getting either the security question or the securepass prompt just about every login from them lately desktop website mobile website android app etc its mostly annoying with awardwallet refreshes
churning,not_removed,its the same group everyone who would have boarded before group anyway now just has a group instead of being arbitrarily separate from the groups and ahead of them
churning,not_removed,yeah it looks like the boarding order remains the same they just numbered all the priority boarding groups
churning,not_removed,yes i did the same thing i received the bonus the day after my dd from ally posted total process took days easiest bonus ever
churning,not_removed,if youre over green is green is highest prg had targeted but thats targeted
churning,not_removed,id keep trying for the ed it takes a while to get it to show up
churning,not_removed,if you can make the offer show up in two separate tabs in incognito you can apply and get both offers theres nothing limiting you to just one green and prg are both good offers everyday seems weak compared to edp which is still around i wouldnt give up possibly mr just to avoid a pull either these are once a lifetime so theres no hurry
churning,not_removed,try opening the platinum business card page first in incognito mode and then going to all personal cards it worked for me
churning,not_removed,i just pulled up the ed offer earlier today using the chinese website method heres the details if youre not familiar
churning,not_removed,there are some targeted eds starting seems to be for examex costco cardholders worth researching or waiting for dps
churning,not_removed,check which bureau barclays pulled they almost exclusively pulls tu and if youve applied for amex previously you should be able to check which bureau amex usually pulls if there is a cross over they will see it but it doesnt generally mean anything bad a hp could be a credit reallocation etc amex wont know why barclays pulled your credit file
churning,not_removed,afaik it shouldnt they would only have the information on your credit report as if the time they made the hard pull of your credit report otherwise theyd have to do another hard or soft pull and i dont think they do that but if im wrong someone please correct me not to mention amex doesnt show up on your report for a few months
churning,not_removed,no problems
churning,not_removed,i tried opening a pnc account the same day after i had already opened santander and wells fargo i was denied due to the early warning system
churning,not_removed,are you based out of california earlier posts are saying it wont work in california
churning,not_removed,i asked around about this here last week and tweeted a couple blog owners that i know fly delta the answer i got back was a few days after your statement closes the same time all of your miles from that statement post
churning,not_removed,mine posted this morning my statement closed on the
churning,not_removed,they wont care about cards in months if your why not apply for spg biz today if there are still active surpass links id be tempted to even do that first for the increased hilton multiplier depending on the math
churning,not_removed,you can upgrade your noaf hilton to the surpass without a credit inquiry and you can get hilton points after spending within mos then youd get hilton pts per dollar on the surpass which is pretty damn good if you have csr thatll get you points per dollar at hilton valuing hilton pretty conservatively at and valuing ur slightly liberally at youd be at exactly cents per dollar spent on either csr or surpass if you spend per year on surpass youll be a diamond so that imo would tip the scales towards surpass for all your hilton spend currently have cc and charge cards are you saying you already have amex cards or cards in general
churning,not_removed,if it was close to your previous statement it probably missed the cutoff so itll be on the statement since the referral if not id sm and figure it out
churning,not_removed,it takes awhile i had a bunch of referrals show up in january and hadnt posted my referral link since november
churning,not_removed,the original serve blue had free reloads at select retailers like walmart and cvs but that version hasnt been available for some time the current blue flavor does not have free reloads
churning,not_removed,dumb question but what do you guys do with serves
churning,not_removed,i believe all cards count towards with exception of business cards but the ritz is one of those that if youre over you can get
churning,not_removed,it counts towards but you can get it after youre above
churning,not_removed,heres a list of cards that do and dont consider
churning,not_removed,one thats what i am doing
churning,not_removed,yes separate bonuses there was a business checking bonus last year but not sure how often it comes along
churning,not_removed,chase is currently running a promotion to get bonus to open a business checking account but it is targeted you can usually buy the invitation code on ebay but pm me if you need it for free expires on check out
churning,not_removed,here is the plastiq referral thread note there is no specific referral thread for the plastiq business promo as the referral code to get ffd is same as standard referral code to get ffd but its a targeted offer and only a few people got that business referral offer
churning,not_removed,its possible but it will be a lot harder then the first one
churning,not_removed,its hit or miss getting my second chase business card just meant calling recon and telling them a little more info about my business
churning,not_removed,if you do not see the months language you should be able to i believe doc wrote an article about citi pre approvals in the last couple of days
churning,not_removed,i might be an outlier but i tried it last year and initially got denied the bonus despite having screenshots and the online tc showing no month language ive heard others speak of success though
churning,not_removed,be sure to wait days after your first aa plat app then go for it ive already applied for and am waiting to use my mailer invite days after my lastp app to get
churning,not_removed,amex mr points post slow you might not get it for more statements
churning,not_removed,have a little patience while youve made the purchase that gets you over the minspend threshold it is probably just posting today going from pending to posted thats what will really start your mr bonus mine first mr bonus posted pretty quickly a few days after spend just recently i was expecting it to take much longer for being my first mr card
churning,not_removed,is this your first mr card that makes all the difference
churning,not_removed,my application went through easily i had a brief phone call explaining my business i had been banking with them personal not business for several years already though
churning,not_removed,i got mine very quickly in january for my bonus one of my first items if i recall correctly sorry
churning,not_removed,as long as you know how much you earned the bonus amount you dont need the actual
churning,not_removed,same situation for me i filed without the document and just reported it since i knew the amount
churning,not_removed,ah the palladium was even discontinued for the jp morgan reserve
churning,not_removed,mine is still correct did you do the linking of the accounts a while back heres marriotts elite cust service number im sure they could help
churning,not_removed,open a checking acct for cash and get another chase card while youre there
churning,not_removed,if you do make the trip it would be a good idea to schedule an appointment so you are sure they can see you
churning,not_removed,thats honestly worth it at least try to find a nice restaurant or something to do on the way too haha
churning,not_removed,points is worth about bucks if used wisely seems like it would be worth it to most people but it completely depends on you
churning,not_removed,good to know its still a pretty awesome site to get an idea whats out there to grab for points
churning,not_removed,dam you for mentioning chik fila on a sunday
churning,not_removed,it seems like any of the fast food mobile app gift card refreshes count for starbucks dunkin etc
churning,not_removed,i did the checking with the bonus for myself and my wife i had such problems with them i did an eft from discover to fund the accounts took a long time then i wanted to transfer money out and it lost my transfer to accounts spent a lot of time on the phone with them and their csr are not knowledgeable at all their it systems are terrible as soon as i got my bonuses i went to the branch and asked for a physical check to close the account this and they charge per external transfer really charging me to transfer my own money no thank you
churning,not_removed,there are quite a few recent data points of referral emails not matching the actual link in the email with respect to the offer definitely double check
churning,not_removed,mine has been pending since
churning,not_removed,ive ordered received and venmo the amex gift card before it appeared in posted charges
churning,not_removed,if its the play offer i would go for amex otherwise go with mpe and wait for offer
churning,not_removed,if youre targeted with the amex plat offer go for it otherwise ink preferredmpecsp will be a better choice
churning,not_removed,mpe is under and has that offer so definitely that also if you have never had an amex you could eventually receive a offer
churning,not_removed,if youre not targeted for plat and really want centurion lounge access get a schwab or ameriprise plat for the benefits but ideally as others have mentioned below youre better holding off until youve maxed out chase
churning,not_removed,organic manufactured spend
churning,not_removed,i had an appt scheduled at las and my flight got delayed by hours and i missed the appt i logged back in the next week on the goes site chose the manage interview option and just picked another time just did my interview at the ronald reagan building in dc in and out in minutes
churning,not_removed,downgrade csp to cs to cfu unless youve had csp more than a year then you can go directly to cfu are you by a united or southwest hub i would consider united if eligible for bonus or sw cp sw plus and sw premier if thats your thing also posting in the weekly what card should i get may be your best bet edit i wouldnt waste a spot on chase amazon but thats just me
churning,not_removed,you will be at after next card so i would say go for the marriott if that is one you could see yourself using cfu bonus is worth far less and you can just downgrade the csp to cfu any possibility of mixing in a business app as the card at the same time as next chase app ink preferred has offer and in branch starting yes whatever cards you decide next it will be awhile under current rules until you will be able to get any chase cards under personal preference but my view is after you hit that there are too many attractive offers from other issuers to hold off to get back under
churning,not_removed,seems like a waste to go for cfu and cf for that matter but whats done is done can you hit something with a better bonus sw marriott you can pc existing cards to cfu
churning,not_removed,the sallie mae transition should count as a product change but you can preemptively call and change to another card to be sure
churning,not_removed,its the beard hides of the face so any relatively normal looking dudes who have it will look similar
churning,not_removed,when looking at the most inquirysensitive banks barclaysciti are up at the top of that list
churning,not_removed,they do waive the au fee
churning,not_removed,give them a call
churning,not_removed,wm only
churning,not_removed,the former spend within months
churning,not_removed,i pcd minutes ago from ink pref to ink cash via sm no issues
churning,not_removed,well it seems like at this point you might as well keep it till the annual fee is due next year and then you might be able to pc to an ink cash there have been or dps of churners being able to pc recently even though it hasnt been possible before then you can get office stores and if that isnt allowed by then you can cancel that is what i am doing
churning,not_removed,im probably keeping it since after the travel credit annul fee is only for me thats worth the ur credit for tavel and restaurant and priority pass
churning,not_removed,keeping i get so many points out of it based on our spend patterns and the fee is really only with the annual credit
churning,not_removed,personally i think the benefits outweigh or at least come close the af ill be keeping it
churning,not_removed,im keeping it for the lounge access
churning,not_removed,you can always transfer ur to virgin atlantic and book ana awards through them
churning,not_removed,probably cancel or downgrade
churning,not_removed,i actually spoke to them today and they told me the same thing im expecting that i will need to call them
churning,not_removed,citi can take some time to handle af adjustments make sure your account is current at all times if you go delinquent the product change is cancelled
churning,not_removed,this is what most people seem to do regular points are a bit harder to make worth it very possible though
churning,not_removed,one too hard to manage comes out of their mouth it is a lost cause
churning,not_removed,thats what i told him still nothing
churning,not_removed,yeah this always drives me nuts its a minor amount of work that gets you free vacations most of my friendsfamily think im the strange one for doing all that work but theyre the ones leaving points on the table all the time
churning,not_removed,i think for newbies like me it feels too hard because of the amount of information needed to make informed decisions and take those first steps i think im enjoying it and i am certainly learning a lot right now i am looking for a glossary of all the acronyms people in this sub use but since im on the app everything is hidden so ill hop on my laptop later
churning,not_removed,you know that cf category bonuses are capped at spend per quarter though right the max extra ur you can gain from one cf annually is quarter thats why many people have more than one if they can on the other hand the cfu is an urearning machine if you have lots of nonbonused spend each month ops brother in law could be adding ur to his travel coffer each year just by swiping on his cfu every month im retarded
churning,not_removed,she got new cards on her credit report in december amex boa im really not sure if this is a good time to apply
churning,not_removed,unfortunately this is a preapproved link that includes a preapproval id preapp vs unsol from public apps
churning,not_removed,yeah im jealous of my kids lives i grew up poor and never went on a vacation as a kid theyre going on this year alone lucky little assholes
churning,not_removed,more
churning,not_removed,i actually think a ponzi scheme might be an easier sell
churning,not_removed,i had a friend once ask me if this was illegal seriously credit cards scare people
churning,not_removed,haha yeah when i told her about the csr i thought she was gonna have a stroke when i mentioned the af
churning,not_removed,because it sounds too good to be true it would be if so many people werent so bad at credit
churning,not_removed,yes my mom is constantly thinking that im going to end up in jail
churning,not_removed,its a tough sell on someone who doesnt show any interest i dont want to get them involved if theyre gonna carry a balance so i mostly just make recommendations when asked and my friends know im a bit too into this credit card thing
churning,not_removed,or anytime i explain it out to a friend and say if youre thinking about signing up let me know and i can get you my referral and then they make comments about how im going to profit off them or laugh at me wanting to get easy points i just spent minutes explaining this to you and im sure ill keep answering your questions so yes use my referral code
churning,not_removed,chase freedom unlimited you could give a referral if you have one
churning,not_removed,american express blue cash preferred is my goto reco for moms on groceries on gas gotta be the bulk of an average suburban middle aged ladys spending yeah theres an annual fee but its easier to prove it counsels out if you napkin math based on their weekly grocery bill on groceries cancels out the fee
churning,not_removed,if she can meet spend get her the merril cash bonus no af
churning,not_removed,the last i checked before this time was last week wed
churning,not_removed,i tested it by transferring mr to british airways for many weeks previous it wasnt go through as late as last week wed but yesterday it finally did
churning,not_removed,i completed spending in the first week of january the posted and unfroze all natural spending
churning,not_removed,i completed spending in the first week of january the posted and unfroze all natural spending
churning,not_removed,how likely is getting both spgs personal and biz to affect my status with chase in the next months im still going after chase cards but should be done by jumping on united mpe in weeks as soon as im out of then more cards i heard that amex personal cards dont post for a month and the biz one shouldnt appear on my credit report at all but i would rather not risk it
churning,not_removed,has there been any info regarding spg and marriott rewards programs all becoming one im a hilton guy so i dont know a lot about the merger and the future as a hilton guy i fear the spg properties in east europe going from up to like marriott points similar to hilton prices before i ever have a chance to use them something tells me that even though spgmarriott point conversion is i worry that the award prices might change like or worse
churning,not_removed,yeah that is my fear spgmarriott havent released any info on what will happen to the award cost for spg properties have they
churning,not_removed,yeah square
churning,not_removed,it should not but there was some speculation and unconfirmed rumours that some people were getting
churning,not_removed,i will look into something cheap on their shopping portal
churning,not_removed,thats the easiest find an aa restaurant then buy a burger
churning,not_removed,thanks is there a way to transfer to a partner program i wont be flying american airlines in the next year as a paying passenger anyway
churning,not_removed,i have her card in my possession right now i just want to make it so she can just user her address for billing and not need to remember mine
churning,not_removed,good to know im not the only one
churning,not_removed,yeah definitely call they are now technically owned by marriott and marriott has been proactively mentioning the ability to extend certificates so
churning,not_removed,the offer says to print out the sheet but i would assume theyd be ok with the code
churning,not_removed,yes the code is entered in by the banker
churning,not_removed,i have nonbusiness checking codes and id like business ones see above
churning,not_removed,lol
churning,not_removed,yeah my mpe came the other day and it just felt cheap i like a card that doubles as a weapon
churning,not_removed,i truly love the card wish it had better perks though
churning,not_removed,if you contact chase theyll send you a prepaid mailer to send it back to them for destruction theyre aware that their cards cant be cut with scissors
churning,not_removed,oh my god becky look at this credit card it is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo heavy it must be one of those rap guys credit cards
churning,not_removed,ill just go ahead and imagine you made a pair of scissors out of your csr and the barberstylist didnt like how heavy they were
churning,not_removed,haha figured thanks
churning,not_removed,haha i sort of figured though it was weird that they suddenly targeted me for this ad i thought about it but now i feel like it would be a waste of time to go into a cpc branch and ask about this when i clearly do not qualify
churning,not_removed,hmm good point i probably wouldnt buy ua miles for so if thats the case it sounds like a better deal
churning,not_removed,hmm your username indicates you might be a girl will you be mine
churning,not_removed,when i visit people i fly southwest so i got a couple chase southwest cards for the points the companion pass was an added bonus just hate seeing it go to waste
churning,not_removed,types of posts like this are why i read this thread thanks for the info and the chuckle at navient it fail i assume this is tried and true to not code as cash advance
churning,not_removed,thanks i will give this a shot im working on minimum spend on mcs and amex so i can make it work appreciate the feedback
churning,not_removed,they dont know the difference
churning,not_removed,they dont accept amex debitgift cards
churning,not_removed,great to hear did you pick up the cards at trubru and add them to your goc account or did you buy the cards online do you know how long the funds took from your goc account to post on your navient account
churning,not_removed,another dp my first payment posted to my navient account in business days and im still waiting on the second set of payments on day i bought all cards in store totaling so far
churning,not_removed,i have a stay thats a negotiated group rate in april for two nights totally planning on charging a soda to the room each day to get the bonus points normally this stay gets me zero points
churning,not_removed,thats what i thought i sent an email to have them fix it
churning,not_removed,good tip on the premier before the united no that pc can happen whenever im able to ms a large amount and we have worth of wedding bills coming due this summer so minimum spends arent even a concern my main goal with this strategy is to get all of the cards i want in our ms arsenal and then never have to worry about again i made a few rookie mistakes and only ended up with csrcfucf so i want to make sure to get everything with hers as i really dont see us being eligible for these cards again as long as is active
churning,not_removed,thats the plan ideally
churning,not_removed,id also recommend to wait until it lines up better with your organic spend andor centurion lounge visits maybe you end up with a better bonus andor can get travel credit for three years
churning,not_removed,agree on the hyatt those two free nights anywhere are a great sign up bonus plus you get the points from meeting the min spend and another points from adding an au and you pretty much have enough points for another free night at their lowest tier then the free night each year is definitely worth the annual fee i know they are changing how their status program works but i think the card still puts you in the status category where you can get some decent extras as well such as free wifi late checkout and so forth
churning,not_removed,visa infinite features like off roundtrip flights with a companion wait a sec the csr is infinite does it not have this benefit
churning,not_removed,i believe this is correct you should redeem asap and upgrade the cert later
churning,not_removed,unfortunately my spg personal came and went over a year ago im probably at and my so is probably around thanks for the advice though that would make it a lot less stressful
churning,not_removed,yeah i was pcing a different card to bbr and had to call multiple times to get it done as several kept telling me it was not possible
churning,not_removed,ive heard you can with the aa ones but unsure about other mailers so i hoped it was worth a shot as a dp it looks like this one was tied to the original recipient and couldnt be edited
churning,not_removed,if you can swing it and are looking for cash after spend is solid
churning,not_removed,the first churning related post was pretty deep in that thread so maybe not too many
churning,not_removed,doesnt that affect your credit facepalm
churning,not_removed,moral dilemma does a rchurning subscriber a downvote that thread post to bury it from reddit community b comment on that thread to provide apparently much needed insight to the other readers who arent on rchurning c merely facepalm themselves as usneakytactics stated already d realize how far ones come prior to their rchurning days thank the good lord credit cardbanks have customers like that to allow us to operate on the fringes of margins and bask in the wonderment of someones comment on there about making at least cashback last year with their credit card
churning,not_removed,did you have to setup an actual direct deposit of a paycheck or did it work to just transit money in from another bank
churning,not_removed,ya saw that sentence that sentence means that i would not be covered even if i have stayed at bos because i was made known about the change hours before the departure which doesnt seem right
churning,not_removed,a truck but work is only miles away military makes it a pain in the ass to ride any sort of motorized two wheeled vehicle
churning,not_removed,i used to drive one of those a few years ago in college would literally be gas money for the week haha
churning,not_removed,increase utilization but yes your point stands
churning,not_removed,got it thanks for your input
churning,not_removed,i want it to park mr long term wo the annual fee im scared of coming up on lots of annual fees and no uses for mr
churning,not_removed,it got a ed mailer never had a amex before and have been getting the offers and prg offers for the past months
churning,not_removed,i meant for a recon with barclays yes they pull different bureaus
churning,not_removed,ah ok i have a flight to yvr on delta coming up a few days before my statement closes oh well
churning,not_removed,good to know thanks for the follow up dp
churning,not_removed,reason i havent already applied for surplus is that would put me after the starwood promotion i may go ahead and apply for business starwood soon though
churning,not_removed,i am already diamond until and will easily get the stays to be renewed yeah i was doing the math and might split the up to diversify my points i have amex cards total
churning,not_removed,ouch okay i was hoping to get the bonus sooner any idea if the referral bonus counts towards the minimum to get the cp
churning,not_removed,excellent thank you ill apply for the green version feels like selecting a pokemon game edit just applied for serve but got a message saying unfortunately we cannot approve you for an american express serve® account right now thank you for your interest in american express serve huh ive never applied for a serve before
churning,not_removed,pay off your bills
churning,not_removed,lit good luck and cheers to potentially miles are you also getting a business card
churning,not_removed,the ones i got didnt have any month language so i believe they ought to work
churning,not_removed,the business checking coupon is still alive as i just received one in the mail last week ill probably be opening an account sometime soon it has a fee that is only waived if you have so thats not going to happen and you need to keep the account open for months or else they claw back the bonus so in effect the bonus is taxes on of bank interest worth doing still especially if it gets me some preapprovals for chase business cards
churning,not_removed,theres one here
churning,not_removed,awesome thanks i just wasnt searching the right stuff unfortunately it disappeared on me this morning
churning,not_removed,thanks didnt even think of just checking my mint records
churning,not_removed,thanks didnt even think of just checking my mint records
churning,not_removed,ha i like that the card is atop a prada wallet
churning,not_removed,thanks yeah linked my accounts months ago made a marriott reservation for this coming weekend as gold only to find out today that ive been downgraded to silver ill give them a call
churning,not_removed,sure
churning,not_removed,awesome i think its settled then
churning,not_removed,a shame i dont agree with their corporate ethos because they make a dam good chicken sandwich
churning,not_removed,haha sorry ive been a victim myself plenty of times
churning,not_removed,is only for business
churning,not_removed,im in rdu which i guess is a southwest hubi just got a gf and was thinking going for the companion pass next year since its kinda early in the relationship so i dont really want that yet im not really an airline loyalty type person just whatever is cheapest the amazon card would be after all the others since it doesnt count after when you say down to cs then cfu what is cs my csp will be at a year at the end of may so i could wait that long
churning,not_removed,i have a youtube channel i think that would count as a legitimate business so youre basically saying downgrading the csp because the signup for cfu isnt that big yeah i want to go ahead and get the best cards i can under then ill just go berserk instead of waiting to get back under hopefully nothing good from them comes for a few years i guess
churning,not_removed,what about marriott business that doesnt count against
churning,not_removed,looking httpwwwdoctorofcreditcomcardissuersthatcombinemultiplecreditpullsinquiriesciti then since citi only allows for one personal card per day im probably better off looking at two barkleys cards then now to figure out which combo there gives best value
churning,not_removed,citi is whats barclays inquiry limit
churning,not_removed,perfect thank you about to reach it but not sure if i had to pay the full balance or can let it sit for a few weeks
churning,not_removed,why would you pc to ink cash when their is a bonus on it and it will be increasing as of march
churning,not_removed,if you pay annual fees youll be able to get travel credits which is breaking even
churning,not_removed,yea the and pp are real attractive i value mr around cents though is the going to be around for awhile seems like itll cost chase quite a bit
churning,not_removed,agreed its my primary use card when im not trying to hit ms on a new one im deep into ur though
churning,not_removed,this i did not know ill have to take a look thanks
churning,not_removed,can you explain why i like reading about other peoples situations and i learn from them too
churning,not_removed,exactly and they try to complain about not having money to travel
churning,not_removed,you know that ops bil only uses card for everyday spend and thinks the rest is too complicated right you can throw in however many combinations and freedoms you want but for a single chase pc the bil can easily be getting more with a single cfu instead of a single cf which is what i tried to demonstrate very simply and maybe you could clarify your ur calculation
churning,not_removed,but you had the magic school bus which took us to jupiter
churning,not_removed,hahaha true
churning,not_removed,a lot of people just assume that anyone whos methodically making money in any way other than a to job must be breaking the law thats where weve come to in society
churning,not_removed,tell them its an investment you invest and you get back at least ± benefits travel credit thats a fold return
churning,not_removed,i told her about it but if shes deciding between that and the citi double cash card she should get the double cash though the dc doesnt have a signup bonus and the fu does so theres that
churning,not_removed,not to nitpick but it would be more like a year to be worth going toward the preferred with a fee versus regular blue cash without a fee and on groceries above does not take into account gas obviously my point is that someone who doesnt want a fee card might like the standard ole amex blue cash if they have a lot of spend on groceries and gas and want all the protection amex brings to the table
churning,not_removed,i was thinking either bcp or bce but they buy the majority of their groceries at the military commissary on base my fatherinlaw is retired air force and is now a civilian employee idk if commissaries read as grocery stores they also buy a lot at walmart which i know doesnt code as groceries gas bonus would be great as they both drive a ton but they wouldnt take advantage of the grocery bonuses most likely
churning,not_removed,my situation is very similar except mine didnt unfreeze yet thank you
churning,not_removed,business card will not appear on your personal credit reports wife and i each have one neither shows on any reports the spg personal wont show for statements after opening it ive never had one post in less than days so go for the business now burn through the spend set yourself up to open the personal card around april the offers are set to expire april youll have no issues with that card causing you any issues with chase if youre gonna finish up with them in april i opened my spg personal in november and it posted mid january to my reports
churning,not_removed,i thought the two currencies were merging eventually but now im questioning myself can anyone confirm one way or the other
churning,not_removed,have you checked marriott to see what they charge today eastern europe should have a lot of courtyards and ac hotels in addition to marriott and renaissance
churning,not_removed,heard of zero people saying they got
churning,not_removed,dont think the miles will post in time ie before the end of the month
churning,not_removed,not that i know of
churning,not_removed,ok so i just asked a csr and this is what they said i am afraid that there will only one statement generated for your card with the aus charges on that but heshe can have a different address updated on the additional card so pretty much yeah you can change her address but there will only be one statement generated your mom should be able to see the statement online with her au account if it isnt set up set it up for her hope this helps
churning,not_removed,agree mpe looks ridiculous
churning,not_removed,after doing some research it actually seems like the rc card is very underratedoverlooked sure the af and or free nights upon sign up doesnt seem that enticing however you do get annual travel credit a bit harder to utilize but there are multiple dps out there saying what works and what doesnt where it gets even better in my opinion is the perks that the free authorized users get from what ive read they get their own global entry credit and priority pass as well as the visa infinite flight credit if you never stay at the ritz then it wouldnt make sense to put a lot of spend on the card but you could definitely make money just by using the flight credit a couple of times
churning,not_removed,i was wondering about this after i canceled my wife as an au on the csr
churning,not_removed,lol that would be a sight to see
churning,not_removed,smooth
churning,not_removed,unless you live close enough to use a cp i think its unlikely shes interested sorry bro
churning,not_removed,ahh gotcha makes sense its a shame to waste it
churning,not_removed,i only have experience with using a csp and a citi aa plat but ive seen a few other dps and no mention of it coding as cash advance keep in mind they will only let you pay your current monthly amount due so if you want to pay more youll have to ask them to increase your monthly payments
churning,not_removed,youre surprised that navient has bad it
churning,not_removed,apparently not not yet anyway
churning,not_removed,not sure havent had the need to use amex i just assumed the digits would be a giveaway but who knows id be interested to know if it does work though edit now that i think about it i think they ask if its visa or mc before they take the info
churning,not_removed,i purchased the gift card from edvestcom since you can get up to there compared to on the goc website it takes about week or so for it to post to navient
churning,not_removed,another dp my first payment posted to my navient account in business days and im still waiting on the second set of payments on day
churning,not_removed,it does not sadly currently only available on the ritz and the cnb crystal in the us
churning,not_removed,certainly less stressful but you should have enough points to secure the cat property in time and that will get you the companion pass then you have a year to work up to the cat property
churning,not_removed,thats because the pizza exploit could be worth more than a csr if you hit it hard and it doesnt even require a ssn
churning,not_removed,the correct answer is d thank god for schmucks
churning,not_removed,i still have a serve so i loaded money onto that and transferred to santander worked without issue
churning,not_removed,thats the same way i interpret that sentence which is why i would try anyways let us know how it turns out my initial thought was you wouldve been more likely to be covered by going to boston did you get a military excuse type note from the airline if so what was the reason for the delay im going to guess that because you proactively changed your flight they will deny the claim saying you werent delayed the flight out of bos was delayed not dtw
churning,not_removed,i would totally jump on that
churning,not_removed,then they wont be able to see the pull at all they wont pull your credit again theyll work with what they pulled when you initially applied good luck with the recon
churning,not_removed,no i did not this was a comment on my post about it i went through the process of calling ews they make you fill out and email some forms to them in order to get them to mail you their file on you my ews file had what seemed to be no red flags it only showed a few bank accounts that i had open they are no help beyond that at telling you why you got declined my only other thought was that i had a pnc savings account that i had opened to fund a card with and had closed it out a month or two prior to that application i got declined for
churning,not_removed,yes referrals count for cp
churning,not_removed,i would apply for the onevip version instead free reloads monthly fee can be waived easily in loads its basically the green version without the fee httpswwwservecomonevip
churning,not_removed,apply for the onevip serve it is basically free for everything
churning,not_removed,how is your relationship with amex any issues in the past ive only seen denial dp from people who had a serve shutdown or have had previous issues with amex not saying there cant be other reasons but usually approval is painless
churning,not_removed,i got that exact same message but mine was because i assume i was shut down in the last wave
churning,not_removed,denied for biz card on my day due to rule i read dps getting approved in an day timeframe so i gave it a shot ill reapply for the biz card on day or
churning,not_removed,apparently you can downgrade immediately after you get the bonus resulting in only monthly fees
churning,not_removed,is the business code from a webpage or did you get a mailer
churning,not_removed,the good thing about the bonus last year was that anyone could generate their own code didnt need a mailer fees are waived for the first few months so i was able to get the bonus then downgrade without paying any fees
churning,not_removed,do you mean the pre appoval or the public link that disappeared
churning,not_removed,that delta plat au is likely screwing you on getting the plat offer
churning,not_removed,it seems to be related to you not having any amex or possibly having another amex which you put a lot on i also believe that your total credit line matters quite a bit though i have not seen lots of other data points on this in my experience it was pretty immediate that after i opened up another card with a higher reported annual income switched jobs hence doubling my total credit line that when i checked amex for prescreened offers they went from being a few smallercrappier ones to all of the good ones plat prg etc
churning,not_removed,theyre different products so you are good to go but id say ink preferred is best for you right now cause getting this card wont affect your current status
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,oh yeah well sign up for ink preferred and hope for a platinum business mailer
churning,not_removed,just make sure to never ask the csr if you can ms your csr to hit ms
churning,not_removed,chase sapphire no fee version of csp basically they usually wont let you go from csp to cfu directly you get around this by changing to cs then days later you can product change to the cfu i did this about a month ago
churning,not_removed,also you can change your companion up to times i believe
churning,not_removed,if youre able to get the marriott biz youll still be at whatever youre at now since its a business card but if youre able to get a biz card now l you might want to get something that falls under so you can still go for the marriott biz down the road however long that may be
churning,not_removed,i should add that barclays pulls tu the majority of the time depending on where youre located your tu report may be pretty clean and the barclays inquiry wont affect you too much
churning,not_removed,also the answer would be the same for any card that gives x points for spending y in z months
churning,not_removed,well i cant speak to the original poster but i am now over and wouldnt be able to get an ink cash plus i hear that getting two business cards from chase is very difficult
churning,not_removed,shakes magic ball maybe
churning,not_removed,might not cost them as much as you think between kickbacks they likely get for booking roomstickets and also potentially not giving the lowest rate there is a whole thread on the front page of rawardtravel about hotels through ur right now
churning,not_removed,ur really is pretty awesome
churning,not_removed,lol that was a terrible post on my part i didnt read your comment completely didnt see you had already factored in the limit on bonus for the freedom and then totally blew the cfu calculation by adding in an extra multiplier the of cfucsr combo gets you maybe i need coffee
churning,not_removed,yeah once i talked her through everything it made more sense to her but her credit score and income isnt in a place for that card anyway unfortunately
churning,not_removed,they would probably rather keep their money invested in their savings account earning interest
churning,not_removed,the breakeven on the difference between cfu bonus and dc is if you can convince her to get the fu for a year or so and then switch shell be getting a pretty decent return
churning,not_removed,good point though even works out to which even lil ol ladies easily meet
churning,not_removed,i think they will merge eventually but its usually a long process since they have to combine all their internal systems including points booking etc
churning,not_removed,i dont see any marriott properties in croatia or slovenia or slovakia or albania spg has hotels in croatia at points per night in zagreb in dubrovnik a hotel in ljubljana slovenia that goes for pts per night a hotel in slovakia for and a hotel in albania for sheraton bucharest romania is points marriott bucharest is points and the room is only edit i derped it apparently marriott shows total points per stay when you search online as opposed to points per night i thought it was points per night but it is for the night stay that i searched for lol the potential for eastern european spg pointsproperties to get screwed by this merger looms large
churning,not_removed,that is what i expected just looking for any counterpoints before i make the plunge
churning,not_removed,despite my best efforts au do not get free global entry even with the net fee id still rather have ur instead of marriott points just such a cool card to have id pay a extra a year on my csr fee to get this card be my csr
churning,not_removed,everybody has their own travel priorites but i just see more appealing alternatives even if we subtract you still have a fee the first year there arent ritz locations all over in contrast to other hotel chains id rather get either the fairmont card and get two nights of luxury for free or get ihg points that i can use for more nights in more places also for free
churning,not_removed,is visa infinite flight credit automatically applied as statement credit
churning,not_removed,it was worth a shot
churning,not_removed,dunno never had a bad experience is there any way to tell based on the number whether it is a cc or debit
churning,not_removed,thank you so much
churning,not_removed,damn then again of the travel i book is solo work travel so i probably come out ahead with the credit
churning,not_removed,plz explain the pizza exploit
churning,not_removed,ok thanks i read somewhere that an ach would work but not sure what the other options are have to submit a form to corporate to change direct deposit so im trying to figure out which accounts i can open without having to do that
churning,not_removed,just googled and found out what is military excuse i didnt get one its emirates and i called the customer care they asked me to fill an httpswwwemiratescomusenglishhelpcontactemiratescrfccertificaterequestflightcancellation which will generate a flight certificate i completed my trip is there a way to get military excuse now
churning,not_removed,even if you dont waive it i think the fee is like
churning,not_removed,or if you live in tx ny and some other places just get the green no monthly fee in those states
churning,not_removed,i tried loading it at a wm money center and they said they dont do it where have you been able do load it with vgcs
churning,not_removed,relatively new i guess ive had spg biz for about a month i did call about times to get offer matched but i was friendly and never hostile towards the csrs
churning,not_removed,there was a note concerning the barclay aa red
churning,not_removed,and they normally dont assess those fees for the first two months
churning,not_removed,good to know ill have to look into that saving sounds good to me
churning,not_removed,mailer
churning,not_removed,pre approval for citi aa stopped showing for me this morning in that post in the comments at the bottom there were some dps for what i was asking should have been more clear
churning,not_removed,cool thanks
churning,not_removed,per calendar year
churning,not_removed,good idea
churning,not_removed,valid points
churning,not_removed,exactly it is pretty attainable for most families for ff debit card users that still cant seem to stomach an annual fee i recommend they get one of the no fee amex cards blue cash or every day due to their purchase protection etc then at the end of the year their awards center will show them how much they spent in each category simple math usually gets them comfortable with applying for the preferred
churning,not_removed,even if so you should always find a cheap cash rate in eastern europe and you should always find a good option to transfer spg points the alternative is you wait too long the card goes away and you never get the points
churning,not_removed,huh thats odd maybe theyve cracked down on it someone told me their aus got their own goes as well as their pp i agree though the spending structure on it sucks and i pretty much put everything on my csr or ink nowadays i was planning on shooting for the rc card later in the year but i may rethink that now
churning,not_removed,i agree also the fairmont card has been discontinued fyi im still in my and actually dont care where i stay during my travels i understand that that will change once i get older but for now hostels work fine for me i prioritize quantity over quality as well and do that by focusing primarily on flight redemption thats why i want to get the marriott card just to utilize the arbitrage opportunity by transferring over to spg
churning,not_removed,i dont think its really a credit but more of a discount so you book a flight for yourself and your companion and during checkout they take off the total
churning,not_removed,its the top post
churning,not_removed,call the pizza company and claim there was a rivet in the pizza dont tell them it was from your pizza cutter because you didnt know it came from there until you ordered another pizza
churning,not_removed,yeah being in nyc i havent found a place to load vgcs onto my serve so i mainly just use it to meet the dd requirement for checking bonuses
churning,not_removed,walmart money center but if they dont do one vip serve at your money center they wont do any serve
churning,not_removed,by the way the link is back
churning,not_removed,thanks was approved a few hours ago
churning,not_removed,im pretty lucky in that my job lets me change where my payroll gets deposited as many times as i want and its all online really depends on what i need though for day to day stuff i use chase since theyre reliable and a big bank with lots of locations plus theyve never screwed me over otherwise i have other checking accounts currently that i usedam using for bonuses i dont use any of them as my main bank though i set them up for the absolute minimum to keep them feefree then close them once the etf date passesthe clawback date passes a well maintained excel sheet plus a link up with mint makes keeping track of everything a breeze i assume thats what most people who are into both the cc and bank churning game do
churning,not_removed,i do the minimum dd required but keep my capital one as my main account have about checking accounts open right now between me and my wife
churning,not_removed,i recommend everyone here have simple cool app money order deposit via app charles schwab no ftf no currency conversation fee all atm fees are reimbursed and fidility cash management all atm fees are reimbrused i would also recommend ally and capital coz theyre both nice and they do count as dd for various banks that said i dont switch around bank accounts often i just dont find it fun nor worth the effort
churning,not_removed,absolutely i keep my main ones and just switch around dd to meet the requirements
churning,not_removed,please forgive my ignorance what does msing mean btw i did try a google search first and ended up with results asking did you meanpmsing lol
churning,not_removed,the biggest consideration for me is the taxes since bank bonuses are taxed its not worth the time especially when it involves going to a physical branch
churning,not_removed,i have my main bank and then others based on convenienceperks ive been with wells since the and am living in my second state without local branches its nice having alternatives as long as they dont cost me anything my employer can split up dd so thats not too big of an issue
churning,not_removed,i wish i could do this but where i work its not something that can be just done online i would have to go and talk to the fin people and fill out paperwork etc then they would have to change it i can see that getting annoying for them after a few times
churning,not_removed,and its all online i wish i have to fax a form with a voided check for payroll to set up new deposits for me enough to make me just give up on the checking coupons i get in the mail
churning,not_removed,sometimes i usually dont cancel dormant accounts if theres no fee or min balance requirement beyond a small membership fee for credit unions schwab is my main bank where i do most of my activity but i appreciate chase atms for cash deposits and theyre everywhere however i usually cancel chase after months to churn the bonus every year and i definitely dont piss on kittens
churning,not_removed,yup i do this to offset my msing fees
churning,not_removed,yeah
churning,not_removed,hell yes it covers the afs i actually pay
churning,not_removed,about the only con is that it can be difficult to juggle all the accounts although you do get better at it with practice i currently have accounts open but i try to close any that i can as soon as possible just opened up a chase performance biz and an amalgamated bank checking for the bonuses this weekend
churning,not_removed,my main are chase and pnc chase for everyday pnc was my bank for a few months until i got the sign up bonus and cc funding then i downgraded to a semi fee free account now its just for mos pnc has been good to me but im going to hit them hard this month with mo deposits so well see how it goes
churning,not_removed,i am reading up on a lot of things before jumping in the thing which is difficult for me is i am not not a us citizen so i cannot apply for most stuff online like others ex huntington asked me to visit branch for opening account the benefit i do have is that i dont have to pay taxes for cash rewards
churning,not_removed,this is not a regular part of our churning and hustling scheme i am spoiled as a former ing now capitol one account holder online banking is a miracle of miracles putting on pants and going places just isnt my thing anymore i just think banks can be such a hassle obviously they arent always always but my husbands last name has a hypen and hes a jr so frequently something pops up and we need a document to clarify it often it means going getting the document or calling around a bunch and then coming back to the branch and resubmitting we prefer to both be on the account so trying to find the time we can both go the bank and add the other just doesnt seem ideal to me in the end of the day that all said if we are low on other bonuses and cash flow that month we get a really nice offer and we have time to spare we will occasionally go ahead with it
churning,not_removed,this is what i do i can split my paycheck across as many banks as i want which makes it really easy to meet direct deposit requirements i have quite a bit of cash in the bank for float so i can do several at a time without much problem i keep ally as my main account because ive never had problems with adding more ach accounts i think i have or something right now and ive run into limits elsewhere btw i could never use chase as my main bank because their signup bonuses are just too good to pass up
churning,not_removed,good stuff thanks
churning,not_removed,quick question when it comes to closing do you have to do it in branch my last experience with pnc i had to do it in the branch and well thats inconvenient how do you typically close your accounts
churning,not_removed,i still have all my direct deposit going to my credit union i had in the military it would be annoying as hell to try to get my dd changed on disability and education benefits id probably not get paid for months if i tried
churning,not_removed,have you been depositing mo with simple recently it looks like all the posts about simple on ft were from when a lot of people were being shut down for mo deposits just wondering if there are more recent dps
churning,not_removed,charles schwab does a hard pull and fidelity does not fidelity does not charge a currency currency conversation fee on atm transactions applies only debit card transactions and pays market rate for currency conversation all atm fees are reimbursed fidelity is the better choice and i dont see much of a reason to have both fidelity and charles schwab
churning,not_removed,manufactured spending
churning,not_removed,its only another highest federal highest state local at max youre still coming out a net positive for minutes of work why not
churning,not_removed,its as simple as keeping a spreadsheet with basic info like statement dates what is required to avoid fees what date you opened the account very basic stuff getting these bonuses and avoiding taxes and fees requires very minimal organization
churning,not_removed,free easy ms small bonus is usually what incentivizes me for offers under
churning,not_removed,you can often use a regular bank account to meet the direct deposit requirement i used ally for several sign up bonuses until my company moved to an easier to use payroll system where i can now change my direct deposit online
churning,not_removed,its possible that you can trigger the dd requirement with an ach push
churning,not_removed,you can meet most direct deposit requirements with ach however ymmv
churning,not_removed,what do you tell them when you close this is always the most awkwardhard part i have when closing
churning,not_removed,branch deposits at pnc seems only option for me is mailin just too risky and i have enough other options to keep me happy
churning,not_removed,if youre in the us you probably do have to pay taxes on them whether youre a citizen or not not certain on this but its highly likely
churning,not_removed,you are required to pay taxes on cash rewards regardless of whether you are a us citizen or not the bank reports this to irs with your ssn so you might get audited if you dont report it with your taxes
churning,not_removed,i dont have to pay taxes for cash rewards yes you absolutely do if you are residing anywhere in the united states
churning,not_removed,yeah its great i really think bank account bonuses are amazing for that quick effortless cash just need to pay attention to them or times a month and close them when you can and youre great
churning,not_removed,how soon can you close out chase checking after cashing out bonuses
churning,not_removed,closing chase accounts by calling in is no hassle ive never been asked any questions when ive done it youll just need to transfer your full balances to another bank beforehand ally is a good option for free achs to and from external banks as they can only close accounts with balance i recommend doing this shortly after a statement cycle closes to avoid the chance that they try to charge an account maintenance fee for dropping below the minimum balance
churning,not_removed,there was a dp on docs site saying that someone was able to close the account using sm i am going to try that out when my months hit would hate to have to call in or go to the branch to do this
churning,not_removed,ive closed bank accounts with a snail mail letter before actually
churning,not_removed,if one account is compromised you can continue to use another this is super useful when travelling aboard schwab does not have ftf on debit card purchases schwab also gives you investment and checking account to begin with you can disconnect these accounts and transfer money instantly during office hours you can put minimal fund on checking and move funds from investment account to checking account as you need
churning,not_removed,its more than ten minutes of work on average in my experience occasionally you get a bonus that ends up being a lot of hassle so its a few hours of hold time calling etc for those you have to go in branch you also have to go to the branch too dont get me wrong it still comes out positive but on average ive found that its lower than my hourly pay and much less lucrative than credit card bonuses
churning,not_removed,my gf needed an account because started a job and i had a code so it worked perfect opening the account for a legit reason and not to churn took about minutes is taxes worth minutes of your time plus switching direct deposit to and from this account and keeping track of it until you decide to close it i think its kinda borderline if its worth it or not at least credit card bonuses have a ton less hoops to jump through unless your msing
churning,not_removed,im not saying its complicated but if you compare a twohour bank account bonus which ends up being or so after taxes to a amex plat where all i had to do was wait for it to get to my mailbox
churning,not_removed,have you used your ally account for a dd requirement with chase recently does it count towards the dd requirement
churning,not_removed,how does one perform an ach
churning,not_removed,i tell them their online banking isnt as good as the competition its completely true for nearly all the banks i do signup bonuses with
churning,not_removed,i am looking to streamline my financial portfolio when i had the santander account open i tried to use the bill pay and it froze my account i was never able to get it resolved when i went to close the account i said you never fixed my bill pay issue so i want to close my account
churning,not_removed,i just dont find myself using it anymore or i change the way i manage my finances ive closed bank accounts with a snail mail letter before so no reason required for that
churning,not_removed,atm deposit ive only been inside a pnc branch once since i opened my account in january
churning,not_removed,i am classified as a nonresident alien so that income on is not taxable now before anyone thinks thats unfair i pay times more tuition since i am a nonresident alien
churning,not_removed,well shit i didnt even think about that last year when i did my chase how do i correct it or am i screwed
churning,not_removed,i have not received a from my bank of cash rewards or interest i would pay tax but i dont get any
churning,not_removed,i also keep a spreadsheet which really helps in doing taxes at the end of the year
churning,not_removed,you have to wait months before closing to avoid clawback
churning,not_removed,pacific marine
churning,not_removed,youre correct on all counts but i disagree with your conclusion yes on average you will profit from a new credit card more than you would from a new checking account but doing one does not prevent you from doing the other and you cant open as many credit cards as you want so they both complete each other quite nicely yes once you take into account the bonus research signup forms account tracking changing your direct deposits closing the account taxes etc you probably come out with an hourly pay lower than your job but im having fun doing all that so i dont consider it work and im paid salary so i cant just put in more hours at the office instead of handling all that in i received in bank signup bonuses not including interest from high yield accounts and not including citigold this year ive already received and while i dont have any more in the pipeline for now these do come and go so i wouldnt be surprised if i end up with even after taxes thats a fairly consequent profit for something that im having fun doing
churning,not_removed,fair enough i see the time i spend as a sunk cost time id spend on netflix or games but im also a student
churning,not_removed,it depends on the bonus size i did a pnc bonus and my effective tax rate last year was like totally worth is for doing nothing but changing my direct deposit online for paychecks
churning,not_removed,if im making a year living in california wouldnt be worth it at all even for minutes as a student hell yeah also i suppose it depends on what the requirements are and how easy it is to change direct deposit
churning,not_removed,true but in the end theyre not mutually exclusiveeven getting only for my efforts is infinitely more than the i normally get when im off work
churning,not_removed,i did it last year and it worked i have a more flexible direct deposit system now so i use real dd now
churning,not_removed,its just a banktobank transfer you essentially add your external account to your bank account using the account number and routing number then your bank will make trial deposits which youll use to verify that you control the external bank after its verified you can make transfers that will take business days usually days depending on the bank i have this set up for my netspend cards and each checking account that i open for the bonus it takes about minutes to add a bank and another minutes to verify a few days later key bank is the worst ive had where it took days before i could verify
churning,not_removed,this thread is hysterical you started a thread about switching bank accounts for the bonuses talk about how easy it is for you to meet requirements because thankfully your job lets you switch easily and you have no clue what an ach transaction is seconds on google will take one far assuming ones reading comprehension skills are up to par
churning,not_removed,this is really is the easiest most effective line because there is nothing they can offer you or do to immediately correct this or just basically listing out everything ally offers and they pretty well know theyre completely outmatched
churning,not_removed,smart thats true for the ones ive done in the past never figured to use that one thanks
churning,not_removed,i think you can file a corrected tax return however please consult your tax preparer or cpa about this also check to see if chase sent you a form this is what they use to report to the irs
churning,not_removed,fill out form along with a check for the amount you owe and mail it to the irs its easy ive done it before make sure you look up what irs office to send it to for your state your state will have an equivalent form to fill out if you live in an income tax state usually nameoforiginalformx google to get form fill it out make out check mail it to the appropriate place and yes do correct it you dont want to mess with the irs especially if you hope to become a citizen in the future
churning,not_removed,try logging in at httpsstmtschasecomstmtstaxlist they have them online as well
churning,not_removed,wont you geta too
churning,not_removed,i got the bonus for checking nearly months ago eventually i want to close it so i can get it again one day i already have other checking accounts that id prefer to keep and my dd is starting to spread too thin edit quick search says months
churning,not_removed,i mentioned this on the other branch of the thread but i personally dont find having to close the accounts and making calls to check bonus status etc particularly fun as thats my least favorite part of churning for me i would be okay with not receiving after tax if i dont have to go through with that so to each their own
churning,not_removed,can i ask what bank bonuses youve been doing to gross that much
churning,not_removed,the requirements on this account make it a little tough to avoid a service fee direct deposit avoids it but then it would have to be your main or only account also i think its min balance or ave balance and it has to stay open for months i unfortunately cant split my direct deposit so you would have to park of your money in the account to earn and close it which adds another opportunity cost i didnt think about of lost investment gains say another apr and this is one of the biggest bonuses ive seen so it only gets worse
churning,not_removed,thats fair i personally find dealing with calls less enjoyable than ms and the like so id pick the to not have to deal with it
churning,not_removed,chase took forever to verify netspend i may open a account which will do ach for free as well right now i rely on chase for all my ach needs
churning,not_removed,gotta start somewhere why ask instead of google well googling revealed a bunch of unnecessary information im just looking for the meat and potatoes of how youre supposed to do it
churning,not_removed,so i am a citizen lol but i went into the chase site and dont see a form for me how do i know if i had one
churning,not_removed,yeah but i get tons so its nice to have a reference to make sure i got everything
churning,not_removed,ive opened and closed maybe accounts in the past two years and i have never had to contact the bank to check on the bonus status except with citi because citi and capital one because i wasnt targeted both of which were through sm not calls the only times i have been on the phone with a bank has been for welcome calls these dont happen very often and are usually very quick yes i have everything setup already no i dont need help with anything yes im aware of all your great services yes ill call you if i need help thanks bye people in general seem way too stressed about their bonus ive seen so many comments on doc from people who get worried when they see others have received theirs faster just complete the requirements sit back and wait however long is announced in the tc times out of youll automatically receive your bonus by then i usually close accounts in branch when there is one around just stopping by on my way to work in the morning it typically takes less than minutes and i walk out with a check for the remaining balance and a written confirmation that the account has been closed most banks allow you to httpwwwdoctorofcreditcomcompletelistofwaystoclosebankaccountsateachbank id say on average it takes about one hour of work per account from the time i start reading about the bonus to the time the account is closed
churning,not_removed,last year capital one checking savings chase checking savings discover savings santander the entire year homestreet bank us bank this year so far hsbc first tennessee chase checking savings amalgamated homestreet bank tech cu santander until june not included in my math above citi citigold ty points and cc funding with lmcu last year x savings accounts with citi with nrl fcu recently these alone on my citi double cash got me more than in taxfree cc rewards
churning,not_removed,yeah i get that thankfully ive only had to actually call one bank for not crediting my bonus intentionally it turned out it was pretty annoying and if i had to deal with that more often i wouldnt do it as much either actually though i probably still would just for the fun of forcing banks to have to live up to their marketing claims
churning,not_removed,ally is fantastic and ive never had a problem with their ach system
churning,not_removed,how much do you make off bank bonuses in a year
churning,not_removed,is there such a thing as too many chex inquiries or new bank accounts opened i recently read about some instances where someone had too many chex inquiries and it caused problems with their main bank account
churning,not_removed,how often can you get the chase bonuses is it once per calendar year for both checking and savings
churning,not_removed,but i could do more if i try harder many of the state specific bonuses arent available in my area otherwise it would be more i tend to have from banks each year
churning,not_removed,once per calendar year for both checking and savings and previous accounts have to have been closed for more than months also you cant close the accounts within months of opening or theyll claw back the bonuses i usually open them in january and close them in august been doing this years in a row now if you have chase credit cards youll already have an online login and they do keep your list of external accounts for ach transfers even after you close your checking account so everything is already setup when you open a new one
churning,not_removed,ever been rejected by a bank
churning,not_removed,is there a reason you would ever stop this practice or do you see yourself continuing it perpetually until they put a halt to it somehow
churning,not_removed,no i only do about a year my other are from banks i have longer term ally discover local credit union i look for deals that are so i dont need much to hit
churning,not_removed,looks like amex plat doesnt get expedited just received email that my plat has shipped and will receive in business days
churning,not_removed,alex platinum just came in the mail usps never got an email saying it was shipped and didnt call in to try and get it expedited
churning,not_removed,if you missed the uber promo from certain airports registration opened back up code amexairport
churning,not_removed,i havent seen anyone post anything like this before so i hope this isnt old news i applied for chase marriott and was denied for too many recent requests for credit i was sitting at at the time and im now at not including the chase marriott i applied for two other cards with citi and amex right after being denied the marriott this morning i got an email outlining my new chase marriott benefits and logged in to confirm that i do in fact now have a chase marriott listed right underneath my chase hyatt i thought this was particularly strange because not only did i get flat out denied but i never received an email saying i was approved i only just found out that i was approved from the email listing out the list of benefits has anyone had this happen before
churning,not_removed,had a pretty funny experience with a citi rep when downgrading my premier to the access card today she asked me if i wanted my new card to be issued as an american express visa or mastercard ohh citi
churning,not_removed,my boyfriend applied for the amex spg card last week and was able to get his card number online once approved he then added the card to applepay and has been able to use his card before receiving the physical card in the mail i got the amex platinum card a couple days ago through the linked leak but i was so excited that i forgot to read through the approval pages slowly so that i could get the card number to add to applepay im assuming this can be done for all amex cards so it may be an opportunity when applying for amex cards in the future for those of who want to use your card right away before your amex physical card arrives
churning,not_removed,i got a chase sapphire reserve card about a month ago and i still have left of the travel credit as i understand it i need to use that before the end of the year so im trying to figure out the best way to do that i do not anticipate that i will spend that much on travel in the next month could i buy some type of gift cert from uber or united or something any other ideas
churning,not_removed,not really churning related but a great deal nonetheless sling tv has a cyber monday special to get a free roku streaming stick with month of sling orange a month no contract amex has a spend get back for sling tv be sure to check the details of the amex offer to make sure you do it right so for you get a month of sling tv online streaming essentially a basic cable subscription without cable and a roku streaming stick retail and youll get back from amex today only likely ends here in a few hours
churning,not_removed,hello all three data points regarding what chase considers travel worth points on csr and will reimburse for annual travel credit southwest egift cards bought online travel reimbursement received hyatt egift card bought online not travel hornblower dinner cruise not travel not dining either
churning,not_removed,added my amex plat to my account and found offers for amazon best buy target and courtyard all of them line up with planned purchases in december feels good
churning,not_removed,data point applied for amex plat via leaked link later in the day last week got notification at last night that the card has shipped and to expect it in business days
churning,not_removed,i need some newbie help on how to maximize the value from my points for an upcoming vacation i have mr ur starwood and a small amount of marriott points lots of skymiles too will probably just pay for the flight at this point unless a united redemption is cheap i know nothing at this point on how to redeem award stays in hotels and what the best way to go about that is any good advice or guides good sites to check that will search award availability
churning,not_removed,just a dp was approved for ink preferred this sat after recon with expected delivery time days just called to expedite the shipment and they obliged noice
churning,not_removed,does amex require proof of business and income for business card applications i was looking into applying for the spg business card
churning,not_removed,citi aa personal data point was just charged the af but id been able to get it waived in past years no retention offer for me this time and they wouldnt even let me pc to another card oh well i went ahead and canceled
churning,not_removed,how valuable is it to be back under i know this is an impossibly broad question and its the sort i usually make fun of on these threads that said i think its also a really valuable question for lots of us here if i stop getting cards now ill be able to get chase cards in the spring of for me that means csr southwest and probably csp for a total value after fees of like so at the simplest level i have to decide if i am going to get more value than that over the next two years from other cards i probably will but theres also a lot of work involved also it would suck to permanently be over an never be able to get big ur bonuses again the other factors i am considering are the probabilities that chase clamps down even further on churners bonuses are much smaller in or there are excellent cards i dont even know about from other issuers over the next year that id miss so how are you making this decision what factors am i not considering

churning,not_removed,i just got the chase sapphire reserve recently and i had my first charge posted on i would like to take advantage of the calendar year travel credit for in my account it says that my next payment is due on and when i tried to change my due date online it would not let me because my account is new is the based on due date or statement closing date and if it is based on the closing date how can i find what is it does a due date mean a closing date in summary what do i need to do to get the travel credit in and then again in thank you
churning,not_removed,does anyone know if amex charge cards have cash advance im going to pay my rent via plastiq soon and i dont want it to code as a cash advance

churning,not_removed,i recently called to cancel my hhonors reserve card and was offered a retention bonus of points so i accepted thinking id just cancel it as soon as the points posted and either get the full af fee refunded or enough of it prorated to make the worth it anyone have a similar retention offer and if so how quickly did the points post if i cancel the card immediately after they post is it likely that citi would claw them back obviously id be ok if they do since theyre explicitly a retention benefit but just curious if they generally do
churning,not_removed,ive heard that plastiq payments code as a ca the first time you send to a new payee and then every time after as a purchase remember hearing this for chase is it true of amex as well thanks
churning,not_removed,my girlfriend needs to make an spend very soon probably within the next few days so not enough time to find a good credit card apply and get it in the mail so we are probably looking for a card to do a balance transfer with she already has a chase freedom credit card please help us find a card that has as many as these features as possibleif it matters she spends about on her current credit card every month we could probably get that monthly spend up a bit if i also started using the card for some things she also has excellent credit balance transfer fee interest on that balance for at least months annual fee is ok as long as the first year is free cash signup bonus edit lots of people pointing me to the wiki saying that i am not trying to churn or that i shouldnt be churning went to the wiki before i posted and didnt come across anything that suggested i didnt want to churn or that i shouldnt churning is the practice of signing up for credit cards that offer large signup bonuses in the form of miles points or straight cash back for the purpose of obtaining the bonus before canceling the card churning has broadly come to mean simply maximizing credit card and travel rewards i guess i just dont understand that definition because i am trying to sing up for a credit card with a large cash back other features to use before i cancel the card when all of the promotions run out maximizing the rewards of a credit card to my advantage it never says anything about having to do this on a large scale with a dozen different cards
churning,not_removed,same here
churning,not_removed,mine was automatically expedited i applied on thanksgiving received an email on saturday and its supposed to arrive today i didnt use the leaked link though
churning,not_removed,thats standard language my recent plat schwab was expedited automagically
churning,not_removed,im pretty bummed about this i have a expense planned for today and the card will not be here on time got my shipping confirmation email on saturday and it says days online it says days and i have nothing on my ups account
churning,not_removed,i didnt use the leaked link but i applied late wednesday got an email friday morning at am saying card has ship and will arrive in business days ups package from louisville ky due for delivery by end of the day according to mychoice applied for spg shortly after and got email on at am saying card has shipped expected days which is expected i believe but maybe the delay in between emails is helpful dp
churning,not_removed,there is a disconnect between their emails and what youre told on the approval page you should get it in days
churning,not_removed,congrats i am expecting mine today too
churning,not_removed,was it regular mail could share when you were approved thanks
churning,not_removed,got mine too then decided to hold on the expense i had planned looks like meeting minimum spend will take a bit longer
churning,not_removed,hmmmmmmm interesting sorry collecting mental dps as i asked about this earlier in the day thanks for your dp
churning,not_removed,thanks it only applies for new york laguardialga john f kennedy internationaljfk newark liberty internationalewr chicago ohare internationalord chicago midway internationalmdw seattletacoma internationalsea boston logan internationalbos mccarran internationallas george bush intercontinentaliah washington dulles internationaliad ronald reagan washington nationaldca
churning,not_removed,never heard of that happening but its awesome
churning,not_removed,thats a nice surprise maybe the rep closing your file accidentally hit the approve button enjoy
churning,not_removed,is this the chase marriott personal card or business card the business card is known not to fall under if this is the personal version it could be significant
churning,not_removed,what did you say
churning,not_removed,im pretty sure citi has had amex cards before but i dont think the access more card has been one of them
churning,not_removed,not sure about the data but anecdotally the plat app last week did not show me my after approval i was pretty careful and did not see it
churning,not_removed,interesting
churning,not_removed,that could be really good did he just call up to get the card number or was it on his online account somehow
churning,not_removed,i will say that when i applied for my personal plat awhile ago and not part of a leaked link the account number was available to me immediately that being said i wouldnt worry about it too much with plat products because they are typically overnighted once approved
churning,not_removed,i was also able to get my card number after being approved but when i received and activated the physical card i noticed the digit cid number on the front was different
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,you actually need to use it before your last statement of the year closes so that could be anytime of the month i would check into that first to see if you need to rush or not
churning,not_removed,not uber directly from the site i heard mpx works
churning,not_removed,since uber gift cards are processed via cash star a party gc processor the transaction wont code as travel and you wont be reimbursed that being said many gcs from travel companies are processed directly by the company and will code as travel and earn the credit dps suggest most domestic airlines dl ua aa wn etc will work
churning,not_removed,make sure to add these to docs post
churning,not_removed,adding delta booking tickets and award travel fee and priceline bid booking as well were all covered
churning,not_removed,ive focused pretty exclusively on chase so im not totally aware of all the amex benefits what are these different offers you get and how do you get them through amex it seems like something like that would make the af easier to swallow
churning,not_removed,ditto
churning,not_removed,same
churning,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiusefullinks and rawardtravel youll have to decide where you want to go and figure out the best strategy from there
churning,not_removed,rawardtravel for sure there are quite a few guides on their sidebar
churning,not_removed,pointimizecom is one of my new favorites for finding the best deals if you know where you want to travel to
churning,not_removed,any charge i was just approved and would love the card asap if its possible
churning,not_removed,what was your application process trying to get this card next month and fuzzy with the whole single propritier stuff
churning,not_removed,amex basically requires that you can fog a mirror
churning,not_removed,usually not ive had several biz cards with amex and never had to send in documentation
churning,not_removed,from my experience they are much more laid back compared to chase for example all biz cards my so and i have with them were approved instantly
churning,not_removed,no
churning,not_removed,i recently got it and i dont have a business
churning,not_removed,nope no proof required its pretty easy to get an amex business card especially as compared to chase which practically grills you under a spotlamp
churning,not_removed,wouldnt let you pc thats odd did they say why
churning,not_removed,i am in a very similar position as you and likewise laugh at questions like this but also feel the need to pose them once in a while i am currently but i have adopted a strategy of only applying for business cards im currently only months into this strategy but in about a year ill be under and can hit a few chase cards for the bonuses
churning,not_removed,opportunity cost there are a ton of cards you can get other than the ones that fall under off the top of my head using tpg value highly subject i admit various flavors of amex platinum offers amex prg offer amex spgspg business offer amex edp offer barclays arrival barclays jetblue plus offer capital one venture chase ba offer chase ritz free nights chase hyatt free nights chase marriott business offer citi aa platinum offer citi aa executive offer citi prestige offer if you mix and match you can get in value edit the csr csp and ink preferred while great cards are using tpgs valuation pretty significant difference
churning,not_removed,dont wait a year csr is miles you could easily get more than that with three cards plus all the cards youd get in instead do you have a chase branch locally that you could go to and see if you are prequalified for any of the chase branded cards that gets around
churning,not_removed,too soon to mean anything means application hasnt been processed yet wait it out
churning,not_removed,it codes as travel so with csr also the travel reimbursement ive done this myself or use a card to buy an airbnb gift card somewhere up to you whether the timegas is worth the
churning,not_removed,staples stores sells airbnb gift cards
churning,not_removed,i went through this yesterday amazon would not let me buy an airbnb egift card with amazon credit and would only allow me to buy of the physical airbnb gcs ymmv though
churning,not_removed,there should be a confirmation that explains the cancellation policy for the rate you chose
churning,not_removed,depends on the terms it stated when you booked which you should be able to easily find typically you can cancel but lots of rooms are prepay non refundable right now due to bfcm sales side note did you consider the opportunity cost of losing hyatt pointsnightsstatus when saving the ur ur seems awfully low to give up all the above unless you dont value hyatt points highly or rarely stay there
churning,not_removed,you have to cancel via ur portal just remember that if you book via ur portal you might not receive benefits of hyatt members if you have one take that into consideration too
churning,not_removed,referral bonus
churning,not_removed,referral bonus maybe a bit of a stretch since you said you just got them though cant think of that many things that would cause that though
churning,not_removed,amex site detailed full tc
churning,not_removed,im going to be using the plat just for hitting ms but otherwise id probably use spg since its more valuable imo
churning,not_removed,i told them that id be willing to reduce my personal lines in order to have the business line since they said that i was going to call today to see if theyve reconned it
churning,not_removed,i think those dps of transferring credit from personal to business are old pretty sure its a hard rule now
churning,not_removed,no in fact i spoke with two chase agents on recon calls who both said they were unable to move credit between business and personal cards
churning,not_removed,ups or usps if all the dps i received are correct i bet it was ups also did your app go pending before being approved thanks
churning,not_removed,yes they expedited amex plat card shipment
churning,not_removed,personally i would wait until you have an answer on the ink card since it is such a valued card dont want to risk a denial for too many credit cards spaced too close together
churning,not_removed,wait not only would it increase your odds on the ink but also could simplify your life with sw statements closing in january
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,what kind of gc did u use
churning,not_removed,weird loaded my serve last night with no problems il really hope that doesnt spread here fd is farrrrr
churning,not_removed,ive flown each once and it was perfectly fine norwegian had a ton of free movies which was nice wow didnt have anything special but one thing i really liked was the windows had seats instead of so it was just my wife and i in our section
churning,not_removed,ive flown both across the atlantic and within europe norwegian was nicer than wow they had free wifi when flying within europe decent movie selection you had to pay for food on both but i would say it wasnt terrible pricing ive heard that wow air desk staff can be mean but they were nice to me just make sure you know the luggage rules before you get on the flight dont argue with them when they say your bag is too bigheavy because theyre probably right that being said i only had my bag weighed once on the five flights ive been on between the two of them and wow recently upped their baggage weight limit i would say average experience but considering the price i paid dollars one way to iceland on wow it was an excellent value

churning,not_removed,strange i just looked at the box again it was not crushed but it did however have the perforated seal on the box that you have to rip to open it i looked at the ends of the box and you would have to severely rip the ends of the box or have it severely crushed in order to get the contents of the box out
churning,not_removed,ive been able to get amex credit cards but ive seen mixed dps from others so its ymmv if you decide to cancel one i would cancel the surpass and then try to get the hhonors upgrade offer for the no fee card see link
churning,not_removed,i got approved for my amex credit card just a few weeks ago one is the ed which ive seen people say allows you to get the though
churning,not_removed,the limit for amex credit card is in my case it is i was at cc cancelled two at once and applied for two more the same day or the next day cant remember after i received cancellation email needless to say i am back to credit cards
churning,not_removed,why add an au bonus also what trick
churning,not_removed,its a mistake they sent the letter out to a lot of citi prestige customers even when they werent gold you should have gotten points as an im sorry we messed up gift maybe check your email
churning,not_removed,if you can get just one referral per year it more than covers the af in cash value cash positive if you transfer the points it could be worth over for one referral but lets just look at the points ignoring perceived cash value freedom categories earn up to a max of ur per quarter for a total of ur per year assuming you can max all the categories you can get ur for csp referrals but then you also have that af to contend with the benefit of keeping csp for referrals is you dont do anything whereas getting ur from freedom takes some effort and possibly limits your spend potential for other cardsoffers if you can reliably get or referrals per year its absolutely worth keeping otherwise its really a personal preference as to whether you think the effort on the freedom is worth your time or if youre happy with whatever indeterminate outcome you may receive from keeping csp
churning,not_removed,i was just thinking this question a few minutes ago also interested to know what people think
churning,not_removed,there has been data points of success getting csp referrals even if you product change to a freedomfreedom unlimited you have to use previous referral links of course
churning,not_removed,you actually have to spend extra on sw to get to rr points if you want that cp sooner rather than later just remember not to do any spend on sw cards until dec statement closes congrats on those approvals
churning,not_removed,thanks for this dp i am about to go for sw cards today both at once to combine hp i am only and just dropped one of my chase cls by so fingers crossed for autoapproval on both really dont want to have to call in
churning,not_removed,those kinds of loans should be illegal
churning,not_removed,but its in your pocket today christmas is right around the corner
churning,not_removed,the chase marriott business card does not fall under great card to get if youre after marriott rewards points considering it gives been as high as in the past
churning,not_removed,while the marriott personal calls falls under the business card version does not
churning,not_removed,at the very least you can get marriott gold and hilton gold httpshiltonhhonorshiltonappscom i believe best westerns status match is also still going on if thats your cup of tea
churning,not_removed,do you get this with the amex or did you have it at baseline
churning,not_removed,if the card was expedited you should be able to get a tracking number by signing up for ups my choice i believe not everyones cards are getting expedited though
churning,not_removed,i chatted and they said it was mailed usps so i assume no tracking
churning,not_removed,depend on your card i have platinum pgr and edf only the platinum has tracking with it other two were sent via normal mail without tracking
churning,not_removed,why not get lots of cards meeting the minimum spend should be easy
churning,not_removed,go for the marriott if the commute to work is roughly the same but as with all stays you should prioritize convenience especially when it comes to work travel if you are under then get the marriott personal card if you are over then go for the spg andor spg business keep in mind the spg to marriott transfer ratio works the other way around edit if you are under and dont have the csr csp andor ink preferred i suggest you get one of them first steeper minimum spend but better sign up bonus
churning,not_removed,random question do you live in indiana
churning,not_removed,was this your first amex card
churning,not_removed,what card did you use to purchase the gcs i know amex is really great about buyer protection if you call and tell them youve been cheated they might refund the money to you
churning,not_removed,august i believe but there was a offer back in may for the personal and business cards
churning,not_removed,chase
churning,not_removed,the offer is k with k for adding an au you may be able to get the but you need to apply in branch the bank is chase if there isnt any near you see if you can call i heard of a couple who managed to do that use the referral links here if you end up going the online way once you are done with the csp i recommend hitting the hyatt easy and nights free are really worth it
churning,not_removed,is for adding an au
churning,not_removed,venmo codes as a purchase youll be fine as long as your daughter doesnt immediately send the cash back to you
churning,not_removed,it depends if you just want the benefits of that card ie signup bonus was not your primary motivation for upgrade then you might have dodged the bullet since arguably there are better cards for hp and recent card slot in your credit report
churning,not_removed,if you wanted the signup bonus yes you shouldve applied for it like normal
churning,not_removed,product changes do not qualify for new card signup bonuses amex does offer upgrade bonuses on occasion
churning,not_removed,lol same here saw it this morning and wanted to use my amex offer
churning,not_removed,dont believe so i believe you need to book the hotel though the chase booking system to get the benefits
churning,not_removed,you have to book thru the csr visa infinite booking site to get the benefits
churning,not_removed,try the prg i believe you can get the mr points offer in vpn
churning,not_removed,worked for me make sure you send chase an sm and have your cash advance limit reduced just in case its processed as a cash advance but it shouldnt be
churning,not_removed,i just did this over the weekend and it already posted on my csr as a purchase im just waiting for the pnc info to come in now
churning,not_removed,i took a similar trip earlier this year to hong kong saw it on flight deal too and was to good to pass up have fun
churning,not_removed,same got my notification too but no ups alert so it might really be regular mail
churning,not_removed,yeah i can imagine only just got mine this morning and doesnt seem to be expeditedhopefully coming soon
churning,not_removed,got my notification days however to wait
churning,not_removed,i applied for the gold and plat in a span about minutes and the application numbers were over numbers apart they were getting like appssec fortunately mine shipped on thursday near midnight grats on yours
churning,not_removed,got my ship email at cst yeah they must have gotten slammed
churning,not_removed,still no notification for any of the charge cards i got wednesday
churning,not_removed,the cvs closest to my house does not carry them on the gift card rack even though the uber search through merchants selling them site specifically says this location does sell them guess i will try some other cvss as well wouldnt mind spending the whole on uber gift cards
churning,not_removed,its not made of platinum why am i paying
churning,not_removed,when did you get a shipping notification email
churning,not_removed,okay youre definitely giving me hope that its in my mailbox im also on the east coast
churning,not_removed,agree and the ink logo also has a terrible silverblack hue combo
churning,not_removed,chase is really skimping on the quality of their cards except for the ridiculous ritzcarlton card my csr is all scuffed up and its only been a few months
churning,not_removed,did family have anything to do with it
churning,not_removed,yeps tried a onevanilla no go invalid tender csr let me take a photo of the httpimgurcomlkpikgk
churning,not_removed,i spoke to chase cruise planner all about this and they said they match whatever the cruiseline offers not other tas though including any discounts reduced deposit loyalty discount on board credit etc whatever you can get direct from the cruiseline you can get with themshe said you can also ask them if they have any special offers or obc like some other tas do as well because sometimes they do if you are paying with points you can only use them on the initial depositpayment for however much you want but after that you cant apply any additional points and you have to pay for the balance of your cruise if you have one over time with a chase card i think it is great for cruising
churning,not_removed,just had a friend who churns book a cruise with ur points said it was easy and straight forward and near identicalcomparable to the party sites for the cruise line just dont get any of the bonus or addons that would normally entice you to book
churning,not_removed,even if you spend the entire through plastiq at it will only cost you if you value your points at much more than that then maybe play it safe and use plastiq
churning,not_removed,just to add another example discover came down hard last year during the apple pay promotion despite not having level data they denied amounts that were closeresembled increments of gc purchases you had to send them receipts for valid purchases to demonstrate it wasnt a gc purchase in order to manually receive the cash back
churning,not_removed,bluebird better than serve or can you use both
churning,not_removed,location
churning,not_removed,loaded onto my serve yesterday afternoon might be specific to your walmart or you just got an unfriendly employee
churning,not_removed,points per dollar on chase portal
churning,not_removed,no
churning,not_removed,funny but thats how i started with chase two sw cards then ink plus i would recomend that you reduce the credit limit of your current sw biz before applying you can do that via secured messages
churning,not_removed,btw ink plus is under rule
churning,not_removed,yep many reports of chase doing this recently unfortunately for people who use the referral threads there is no solution as you need to give details of who used your referral link
churning,not_removed,yep its down
churning,not_removed,you cant balance transfer from one chase card to another
churning,not_removed,no it is per person you can be but if your wife is she can still get cards
churning,not_removed,no not unless you are aus on each others cards
churning,not_removed,only if youve been adding your wife as an authorized user on the cards
churning,not_removed,to be eligible for this coverage you need to purchase either a portion or the entire cost of your common carrier fare using your account coverage is in excess of any expenses paid by any other party including applicable insurance yeah this language is pretty tricky wrt common carrier fare id probably callsm just to be sure
churning,not_removed,never hurts to ask
churning,not_removed,probably just have him explain that he got the referral link from you
churning,not_removed,i think there is a good chance of a match
churning,not_removed,did you apply using the link last week
churning,not_removed,same here i even called amex to see if i could find out anything and all they told me was that a different department is handling my case
churning,not_removed,if you can buy the items for a cheaper price now at the same store perhaps you can ask for a store credit when you return the item and then use the store credit to rebuy it ive done that a couple times when i didnt want to worry about not meeting the minimum spend
churning,not_removed,spend the difference to be safe but chase cant do much dont be a test case though
churning,not_removed,nothing will happen unless you consistently do this and someone manually reviews your account
churning,not_removed,chase sapphire reserve chase ritz carlton citi prestige amex biz plat amex personal plat amex personal rewards gold citi expedia voyager
churning,not_removed,csr credit on all travel ritzcarlton airline incidental credit prestige airline credit all variations of the platinum airline incidental credit amex prg airline incidental credit
churning,not_removed,prestige travel credit
churning,not_removed,ritz carlton i think but need to request credits and its more limited than others what counts
churning,not_removed,i dont believe the bgr has a travel credit id love to be wrong because i just opened one but i couldnt see any mention of that feature
churning,not_removed,people on here usually say it doesnt hurt to recon immediately with chase personal cards
churning,not_removed,plat if its useful enough for you
churning,not_removed,the amex platinum has a public offer but it has a rather high spend you will receive membership rewards points after spending in the first three months and another if you spend an additional in the first three months the is not waived the first year but you get credit for airline incidental fees plus some other perks if you cant meet the minimum spend for that card consider the spg business but if were me i would hold off until the spring and see if they bring back the alltime high of starpoint bonus
churning,not_removed,i assume opening the prestige and transferring the points over isnt an option because you received the typ in the last months pcing to prestige really isnt a horrible option if you can use the travel credit twice net
churning,not_removed,read typ wiki downgrade leads to expiration after certain days
churning,not_removed,when you set them up you have an option to use your existing amex account
churning,not_removed,have any toll roads should be able to add funds to account
churning,not_removed,gift card with an airline you will definitely fly with in the future
churning,not_removed,airline gift cards you can use it sometime down the line should be able to find a list somewhere for which ones work
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,ubereats
churning,not_removed,everything is a business transaction if you are doing it while on the job dont worry about it
churning,not_removed,it should be fine so long as you selected churning as your business type
churning,not_removed,dont worry about it legally there are some different consumer protections for personal cards vs business but as a practical matter its fine
churning,not_removed,what class of service if j its free if y you have to pay ask aa for the ab specific pnr and use the ab website to pick your seatspay online
churning,not_removed,pretty sure it just depends on when the points post just finish the minimum spend in to be safe
churning,not_removed,you can start when the december statement closes some people recommend waiting until jan to hit the a little paranoia maybe
churning,not_removed,if youre under then i suggest keep calling recon for several days until you get approved say that you need this card to separate your expenses i cant see a reason why they would outright deny you after recon
churning,not_removed,depends if you think youll be able to meet the spend within a few weeks after receiving the card it would be worth it to just wait until januarylate december to reapply considering that youll want to meet the spend in january to get the cp otherwise i dont have any advice as to when you should reapply maybe someone else does at a minimum though id say wait a week or two
churning,not_removed,its pretty awful their points system is quite convoluted so it can mask the fact that youre only getting back for each dollar spent each point is worth about cents so the bonus is worth you can get about if you use amazon gift cards but cash out is you then get points per dollar spent so per dollar after that you can do much better with the citi double cash or chase freedom combined with csp or csr
churning,not_removed,i went through almost the exact same process also on i applied on and after days found out that i had been denied for business too new i decided to call recon on went through a review process and was finally told i would hear back in weeks i posted about it in the chase mega thread
churning,not_removed,this happened to me i have maxed the amount of credit chase is willing to lend me based on my current income they cannot move credit lines on personal accounts to make room for the business line to keep the total credit line the same so they go through this underwriting using the answers to these questions to and refer it to someone to make an exception my guess is its some avp or department head and they just dont get to their exception queue more than once a week or so
churning,not_removed,this same thing happened to my so and i had him call in about days after it went in for final review and csr said congratulations its been approvedthat was days ago and waiting on card
churning,not_removed,pretty much the same thing happened to me i just kept checking the automated line to see if there were any changes the day the message changed from days to days after my application was sent on to a supervisor for a review i called recon for the second time and was told they needed me to send in proof of my business address once i told the agent i was a sole prop and worked out of my house he put me on hold and then came back and said i was approved i dont think there is anything you can do to expedite the secondary review process
churning,not_removed,take a look at an httpsunrollme
churning,not_removed,i think you need to try another branch where bankers are not idiots
churning,not_removed,yup it does
churning,not_removed,the ameriprise and regular platinum cards are identical minus the bonus and annual fee for the prg just select that card on americanexpresscom and then hit benefits
churning,not_removed,high peak standard award
churning,not_removed,id be surprised if the fees on those kind of sites would make it profitable just checked they take
churning,not_removed,an egift card will trigger it
churning,not_removed,weird i used the promo code from jfk and it worked fine for me pretty awesome amex is doing this
churning,not_removed,its either would have or wouldve but never would of see httpwwwgrammarerrorscomgrammarcouldofwouldofshouldof for more information
churning,not_removed,still works just used it twice earlier this week and got reimbursed
churning,not_removed,when do you have until to do this
churning,not_removed,its your december statement date not the due date your bill should say what the statement date is
churning,not_removed,my gf got her reimbursed the next day from when her purchase posted did not have to wait for statement close
churning,not_removed,try calling chase and request to have your first statement closing date changed to later part of december so you have more time to get in your travel credit chase is quite accommodating to such requests also keep in mind the statement closing date is different than payment due date
churning,not_removed,it is based on statement close date which i believe is days before your due date i would use it relatively soon but you should be good
churning,not_removed,based on my personal experience and a lot of dps there is nothing to worry about it will even give you points until the end of year
churning,not_removed,no one has reported amex charging as cash advance as far as i know that was a problem specific to visa and they usually warned you first
churning,not_removed,this is a visaspecific problem with plastiq see like toplevel comments down
churning,not_removed,amex charge cards do have cash advance every amex card you get should be accompanied a week later with a letter with your cash advance pin
churning,not_removed,have them lower your ca limit to that way anything coded as such gets declined
churning,not_removed,i have use biz platinum charge card on plastiq a lot to hit min spend nothing has coded as cash advance including mortgage ymmv
churning,not_removed,on amex plat yes
churning,not_removed,is it really ms though its not exactly easy to liquidate mpx gift cards
churning,not_removed,not that ive ever seen this was the only suspicious thing i did on my plats last round and they didnt get a claw back as of yet
churning,not_removed,i call the number on the back of the citi card i am making a payment
churning,not_removed,it does
churning,not_removed,proceed with caution some members here report purchasing airbnb gcs for yourself has had problems or been denied do some search reddit
churning,not_removed,wasnt able to buy a egift card for myself but worked fine when using my gfs account to buy one for me couldnt buy one for more than and couldnt buy a second one right after but the second gift card worked a few days later when i tried
churning,not_removed,one of the first purchases i made with my csr was an airbnb reservation i got the reimbursement
churning,not_removed,i think generally it is not very advisable to do that either take the offer and keep the card for another year or just cancel it if you are playing long then dont stretch too far happy churning
churning,not_removed,recently i tried it with my amex prg and it works as expected refunded two days after the transaction was posted its purchase
churning,not_removed,still working for me with amex business platinum last week reimbursed after days i believe it needs to get done by end of calendar year
churning,not_removed,did three last week only one has been credited so far prg
churning,not_removed,you need to get it done by the last statement date in said another way you need the transaction to post on a statement that closes in if it ends up on your january statement it will count against next years credit
churning,not_removed,id recommend waiting a month i got my csr and applied for the ink a few weeks later and was declined for too many accounts i called for recon and they said they couldnt after a huca and getting a new rep i got a recon answered a ton of questions and was approved however when i asked on here if others had a similar issue a couple of other people said the same thing happened and they didnt get approved after recon ymmv but if you can wait the month id recommend it
churning,not_removed,the only reason to go in branch would be if there is a chance of getting a higher signup bonus eg the recent inbranch offer for csp otherwise just apply online with referral links and no you dont need to wait to apply im with you on wanting to avoid questions in branch i went into a branch to open a checking account after i had recently opened both csr then csp as the banker was scrolling through my file he sort of commented on how i had cards with them i also have an old united card and asked if i planned on eventually just moving everything to the csr i think he was just curious or just wanted to be sure i was aware of all the overlapping benefits i just sort of mumbled something about wanting the csp because i dont know if i will be able to keep up with the csr af longterm and wanted to have another option or something haha of course at this point the accounts were already open so its not like he could have done anything about it point is if you do go inbranch id have some sort of answer prepared for that exact question
churning,not_removed,you should wait with chase business cards the system has been autodenying people that have applied for other chase cards within days yes you can call recon and maybe get it approved but probably better to wait
churning,not_removed,technically no chase typically limits to applications every days but this is not a hard rule like
churning,not_removed,i think it depends on the receiving side i have used plastiq for paying mortgage hoa and property tax and it was coded correctly also i think plastiq will warn you if it thinks the transaction could be coded as a ca read it in this sub
churning,not_removed,only affects visa cards
churning,not_removed,i believe the issue was just with visa credit cards you need to establish a relationship with them first amex me personally and mastercard card dont have a ca issue so use amexmc and then a visa to avoid cash advance
churning,not_removed,if balance transfer fee and apr are major features both of you clearly arent ready for this hobby every major card with a meaningful sign up bonus has a balance transfer fee and regularly or more apr edit for reference with a credit score and annual income my average apr across all of my cards is the lowest is and the highest is the only cards that had an introductory apr were the citi double cash no bonus and chase freedom ur at the time all of the credit cards platinum is a charge card have a transfer fee
churning,not_removed,you shouldnt be churning
churning,not_removed,id start with the same message as everyone else based on the information youve provided it doesnt sound like youre in the right situation to churn here are some more assumptions im making it sounds like youre not trying to churn based on youre just trying to maximize the time until you have to pay off a school payment and if you can pick up cashback thats cool too payments usually arent only for the school year so im guessing there are other payments in the future if thats wrong my idea might not apply going to assume that youll have no issues making these payments and you just prefer the flexibility of a credit card if thats not the case and making payments is a concern this wont work for you ive never actually tried doing this if youre trying to take a points card and get points youre probably going to end up with a bad redemption value ideaapply for credit cards with a signup bonus there are a lot of these and you can look all around rchurning for ideas and the chase slate prepay tuition on the credit card that offers cashback when youve hit min spend youll get the signup bonus assuming you get the introductory offer with transfer fee on the slate you can transfer the balance from your points earning credit card to the slate within days fee free then youd need to convert the points on your first card into cashback and then apply that cashback to the slate payment eta based on other comments it sounds like you cant do a chasechase transfer with slate so keep that in mind
churning,not_removed,chase slate is the only card i know of that has balance transfers and interest for months no annual fee but also no sign up bonus
churning,not_removed,chase freedom freedom unlimited citi double cash have apr iirc no af and sign up bonuses use referral links from here please bt is much rarer though thats only citi dividend chase slate off the top of my head and no sign up bonus
churning,not_removed,try amex everyday preferred it currently has apr for months and it offers membership rewards
churning,not_removed,a balance transfer card and a card with a signup bonus to put of monthly spend on should be two different cards i dont know of any cards that have a cash signup bonus for balance transfer without spending money on the card which you dont want to do if youre opening it for a balance transfer if she puts the on her chase freedom card she will need to transfer the balance to a nonchase card and then not use that card for monthly spend here are some options for balance transfer cards httpswwwnerdwalletcombalancetransfercreditcards
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,mine is out for delivery today
churning,not_removed,hmm interesting thanks for your dp
churning,not_removed,is it coming through ups
churning,not_removed,did it come via ups
churning,not_removed,it might be standard but its actually true this time i applied with everyone else using the leaked link on the instant approval and immediately called in to try to have it expedited csr stated that due to overwhelming volume there was absolutely zero chance that id be able to receive it before dec on the other hand the biz plat that i applied for on the same day just before the leak total coincidence was automatically expedited and arrived before pm on black friday
churning,not_removed,was it shipped via ups or usps
churning,not_removed,me too yep yours is also being shipped via usps i just dont get all these discrepancies im still trying to figure out whats the reason behind shipping some plats via ups expedited vs usps snail mail
churning,not_removed,hmm also interesting oddly enough mine is being sent by usps thanks for that
churning,not_removed,usps is sending mine so im not holding my breath lol
churning,not_removed,i was approved wednesday night at est it wasnt an auto approval i was told it would take the days to look into it i never got an email that o was approved but when i looked on the amex website about an hour later it said i was approved the card came regular mail today
churning,not_removed,this was the personal card i stopped applying for the chase business cards because i already have ink
churning,not_removed,it was online when he was going through the approval pages since i forgot to go through the approval pages slowly i havent been able to find my account number once logged in it may only be available when first approved
churning,not_removed,could be when my boyfriend applied for the spg was the first time i ever saw it but then again ive never paid attention before
churning,not_removed,mine wasnt overnighted but how did you get the account number i was able to register online but that was it edit nvm the reply below answers it thanks
churning,not_removed,awesome i searched and didnt see this thread thanks
churning,not_removed,im a little unfamiliar with this so i can just download the mpx app and make purchases from amazon or whatever and it will count as a travel purchase
churning,not_removed,will do could you provide a link please im a still a newb here
churning,not_removed,amex offers are a pretty awesome benefit most cards have offers like statement credit if you spend at newegg on mr cards it can be a flat bonus amount or an extra multiplier so the courtyard offer is for bonus mr and the amazon is mr
churning,not_removed,they are offers that you sign up to be added to your card for example if i spend at courtyard hotels before january then i get mr points it helps to soften the blow of the af
churning,not_removed,thank you didnt know about this subreddit
churning,not_removed,i third awardtravel subreddit those folks there are extremely helpful and really know the ins and outs of pointmile maximizing just figure out where you want to go and ask them for help for the best redemptions
churning,not_removed,free of charge
churning,not_removed,i made a rookie mistake and applied while my ink application was pending i was told by the recon department i would have been approved instantly if i did not have a concurrent pending application i did call and mostly reiterated facts i put in the application and explained why i wanted a biz card sent a copy of ein and was approved a few days later
churning,not_removed,even if you cant theyll approve you
churning,not_removed,she just said something to the effect of that offer is not available
churning,not_removed,excellent idea
churning,not_removed,what business cards have you gotten are you targeting
churning,not_removed,yeah i have been going roughly once a month since september no luck yet although december is the first month in which ill be at least six months from my last chase card some people say that is the trigger for having prequalified offers on the surface i agree that one csr is worth the same as three cards but i think that analysis is missing the cost of never being able to earn chase points again those are supremely valuable in a difficult to quantify way without them youre either paying cash for part of every trip or youre booking everything a year out right when award space opens
churning,not_removed,dont forget to use delta airbnb for extra miles
churning,not_removed,just checked statement should have been my first move and youre exactly right thanks
churning,not_removed,any update
churning,not_removed,confirmed with them in chat mine shipped today and is going through usps
churning,not_removed,usps it came in a white letter sized box and i didnt get a tracking number my app went pending for minutes before i got an approval email
churning,not_removed,i can confirm the same here so got day email as well but received the card today in white box by regular us postal service back in may i got the white box via ups cardboard in business days
churning,not_removed,called in and the csr said their system glitched where it read my schwab as a personal plat she understood that they are separate products so she pushed it through to manual review
churning,not_removed,i would like to know this as well
churning,not_removed,i never even got to that part it failed when they swiped my serve card
churning,not_removed,oh i know i dont have any vacation time for a few months though so im not too worried i mainly just need the cp in time for late spring isnt there a way to transfer ur points somewhere then transfer them to sw
churning,not_removed,good luck to you its definitely possible
churning,not_removed,are you serious thats excellent i havent had a chase business card so ill get on that thank you
churning,not_removed,thanks thats what the guy that deleted his comment said too i will do that for my next card never had a business card with anyone but it should be good if i just put my own ssn down ill say im looking to expand by ebay business or something
churning,not_removed,thank you there was a post about silver car status as well but i am not able to find it for some reason
churning,not_removed,its with the amex i am not sure if it makes a difference
churning,not_removed,looks like this time around they are not expediting some platinum cards as well could you share how long it took to receive your cards via normal mail
churning,not_removed,currently live in germany but from texas originally how come
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,ive had this problem before with vanilla i bought and one worked and the other didnt i call the csr number and they sent me a new one got it and it worked fine
churning,not_removed,didnt use an amex but boa definitely wanted to avoid talking to the bankcc issuer
churning,not_removed,tried to get them to match the personal but they wouldnt knew it was a longshot trying to decide if i should apply now or see if pops up again soon
churning,not_removed,okay thats what i was thinking but i wasnt sure in the back of my mind i feel like it used to be
churning,not_removed,thanks for this no my daughter is not sending me back any cash money i am reimbursing her for something she bought and we wanted to give it to her as a xmas gift to begin with
churning,not_removed,this is the correct answer there are much better bonus options for the hp if you want cash back and have a chase branch near by drop in and see if you can get the bonus for a spend on the freedom unlimited
churning,not_removed,or just incognito
churning,not_removed,probably just a slight delay at that location these are just rolling out now so i would expect them to hit shelves intermittently over the course of the next few weeks
churning,not_removed,am nov
churning,not_removed,nah but i just have my mom check every weeks i did change my income both in branch and online and i also reduced my credit line by
churning,not_removed,was this a visa or a mc
churning,not_removed,but again youre referencing a specific promotion if you exploit a specific loophole or promotion you might get banged my comment was simply a psa that normal unbonused ms to meet min spend thresholds has to date not triggered any clawbacks from amex
churning,not_removed,i have both
churning,not_removed,its annoying these cashiers are always unfriendly to me despite me being very friendly and much easier with which to deal than other people trying to transfer money to god knows whom halfway across the world hate walmart cashiers being salty to me just bc im making moneypoints doing something completely legal additionally why do you need forms of id when im adding money to an account if i were withdrawing ok i guess maybe that makes sense but im adding money to a card that matches my drivers license really ridiculous
churning,not_removed,thanks looking more for straight cash back or savings if possible though
churning,not_removed,no but you should be able to at least downgrade it to the no af ink cash
churning,not_removed,we just did this and it didnt work my husband had an existing sw business with an cl which we reduced to before apply for ink had to recon the ink and was only able to get approval by shifting form the sw leaving only limit on sw my advice is dont reduce cl you probably wont get it back
churning,not_removed,yea thats part of why i think my odds are low if the sw business card doesnt count im at if they do count it im at
churning,not_removed,and even then you can remove yourself as an au and call chase recon and point out that you are under for primary accountsthe other accounts on your credit report are au accounts and they often will be ok with it if everything else in your application checks out
churning,not_removed,she is on mine may have to remove before we go that route is there any benefit to each getting csp in other words can you transfer ur points from one person to another or would we have to find scenarios where wed be able to each book separately
churning,not_removed,yep around pm that night so i assume i got in on the tail end of the apps
churning,not_removed,good to know thank you
churning,not_removed,unfortunately you are correct just travel credit for prg not brg
churning,not_removed,correct only the prg offers the airline credit despite the similar names and annual fees
churning,not_removed,i called recon got a denied saying i had too many accountsnew accounts with chase any advice i went csrseptember cspoctober sw premierplus november
churning,not_removed,probably isnt i have no travel planned where id get the benefits of the card itself and i have tons of ur banked that would easily last me a year figured im best to wait for plat until i can utilize the card benefits
churning,not_removed,re plat i have of ur and skymiles at the moment and no travel planned anytime soon and i figure therell probably always be a biz plat offer whenever i need it so i was gonna hold off most people here are saying that any higher offer on spg biz is unlikely though id strongly prefer to hold out for the offer if there was any chance it would come around
churning,not_removed,cool the citi method is annoying having to log in twice
churning,not_removed,perfect pretty much the same as my initial plan of buying pointsmiles glad to hear that counts towards the credit
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,i can understand the paranoia id hate to get points on the last day of and blow the whole deal i have an bill due that i was going to split across these two cards ill see if i can hold them off until the the end of the year
churning,not_removed,does the rule go by date of the application in other words will recon approve a card that was initially denied due to but a couple days have passed and thats no longer the case
churning,not_removed,i guess ill call in next week then
churning,not_removed,possibly this is a private client branch
churning,not_removed,ahh got it yea is hard to overcome with points
churning,not_removed,and i got the spg points for riding with uber too its awesome
churning,not_removed,awesome
churning,not_removed,did you have to wait for the statement to post before getting reimbursed or does it happen sooner than that
churning,not_removed,well its on a calendar year basis so i want to make sure i get it done early enough in december so that the reimbursement posts in time
churning,not_removed,i havent gotten a bill yet my account is new
churning,not_removed,thank you for your answer a couple more questions does it only apply for airline tickets or any travel categories can i buy an airline gift certificate i know that i need to purchase flights with wow air but i am still not sure of the dates
churning,not_removed,do some search reddit while this is good idea in theory trying to search reddit makes my soul hurt its so painful and ineffective
churning,not_removed,on this topic and only as a theoretical question as it seems fishy but could you rent the house to yourself thus redeeming the travel credit airbnb only charge like right
churning,not_removed,thank you would it change your riskbenefit calculations if you knew that ive had the card for two years already just curious
churning,not_removed,i think youre confused the amex plat statement credit goes by posting date which is typically days after your purchase many people have confirmed getting the credit on dec and also jan of statement closing dates
churning,not_removed,based on posting history it looks like uitbry isnt trying to churn he got referred here by rpersonalfinance because they thought this group would be better suited to answer which credit card guess they havent read why you should not churn
churning,not_removed,i think they are going to put the spend on the cf and then do a balance transfer to avoid interest some time in the first month allowing the time to apply receive activate transfer
churning,not_removed,the payment is for tuition that her work was supposed to cover she didnt get the minimum grade that she needed in the class for reasons that i dont need to explain to you either way the payment is due now and work isnt paying for it its not that she cant pay off her balances she could pay off the balance but why pay off the full balance right away when you can use a credit card to give you more flexibility with your cash please help us find a card that has as many as these features as possible what i was thinking was that someone might know of a card that has a cash bonus with a minimum spend i was never expecting that the balance transfer would qualify for the signup bonus and the tfapr if that card doesnt exist then something with the tfapr would be fine
churning,not_removed,if she puts the charge on chase freedom and need to transfer the balance it has to be a nonchase card
churning,not_removed,ups and also did you use the leaked link thanks
churning,not_removed,yup i got an email from ups my choice
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,well come back on dec and well see if youve gotten it
churning,not_removed,ups
churning,not_removed,it seems like it was only expedited if you went to pending and had to call to get approved too bad i was approved within a couple of minutes
churning,not_removed,wheres it shipped from i have a thing on its way usps from wisconsin but i have a lot of outstanding orders so it might not be the amex plat
churning,not_removed,good to know thanks
churning,not_removed,interesting i wonder how your app eventually made it through my initial theory would be that you were part of chases test group where they approve applicants that are over so they can run analysis on the behaviors of customer sets
churning,not_removed,yep ive also done this its available when first approved but you wont be able to find it when logging in online
churning,not_removed,not exactly some merchant codes pass through others dont uber coded as travel on my csr but jcpenney didnt code as dept store on my freedom other good options for prepaying travel to burn the csr credit are ezpass and local transit
churning,not_removed,you can buy gift cards through the mpx app amazon is one of them as well as uber
churning,not_removed,southwest and hyatt is already on the list edit misread was thinking of the that already mentions hyatt
churning,not_removed,its the sister sub for redemptions not as active as this one but definitely helpful
churning,not_removed,thats wells fargos banking division
churning,not_removed,exactly im in the process of hitting the min spend on the delta biz plat and then ill be picking up the delta gold plat
churning,not_removed,amex bgr amex delta plat amex delta gold chase marriott biz or wait for citi aa biz match to amex biz plat but high spend
churning,not_removed,out of curiosity do you have a chase checking account open at the moment ive read conflicting dps of whether or not you need to have a banking relationship with chase in order to receive preapprovals and whether or not it improves the chances overall
churning,not_removed,but i think that analysis is missing the cost of never being able to earn chase points again i think thats a flawed assumption assuming you have the chance to get in branch preapprovals that side step like many of us have for the csp and csr if you can get those that way youre really only missing out on the partner cards that are under so sw and marriott personal
churning,not_removed,yep totally whiffed on this offer a couple of weeks ago
churning,not_removed,they submitted it for a final review theres no way to expedite that review and they say to weeks
churning,not_removed,perfect thanks for that i was really bummed out when the mentioned usps
churning,not_removed,thank you this is the exact dp i wanted to see i might actually be able to use this card for my purchase fingers crossed edit came home to an empty mailbox smh
churning,not_removed,see above
churning,not_removed,damm that sucks i tried last wed west coast and it worked fine
churning,not_removed,yep i did something very similar a couple months ago norwegian was a little more comfortable and like i said some good entertainment options wow was fine nothing available in terms of entertainment but still a good experience just make sure as youre booking these and comparing prices you are aware of the extra fees specifically on wow i had to pay for checked bag seat reservation and a few other things i cant remember off the top of my head norwegian i just bought the lowcost or whatever the option is includes meal seat reservation baggage etc
churning,not_removed,my offer page says could possibly be different person to person but i didnt think so i know freedom refs are
churning,not_removed,if you dont need the cp right away you can take a little more time with the extra spend on the sw cards
churning,not_removed,ur transfer directly to sw but those transfers do not count towards cp to count for cp you could go ur marriott sw but the marriott sw part is a ratio still may be worth it though if you end up needing that last quickly
churning,not_removed,i believe you can transfer ur to hotel points marriott and hyatt and convert then to sw but the exchange rate wont be great
churning,not_removed,lots of dps of people using ebay selling as their business and getting approved banks are typically pretty lax about what they consider a business for the sake of credit cards
churning,not_removed,with silvercar you get a discount code that anyone can use for off google silver car visa infinite for the code
churning,not_removed,i am in california and it took them biz days its weird as i received the email notified me about my edp shipment but not prg i ended up receiving my prg before my edp i applied two of them at the same day
churning,not_removed,looks like they are autoexpediting plat for new customers but not for existing card holders
churning,not_removed,this would be the recommended approach
churning,not_removed,or now and next year
churning,not_removed,ah thats good to hear mine was sent at exactly the same time heres hoping mine is delivered today too
churning,not_removed,cool thanks for the dp i plan to reduce my credit line with them as well to trigger more preapprovals ive read somewhere that it should not exceed in general
churning,not_removed,visa onevanilla
churning,not_removed,fair point it was just the first and only time that i had seen discover look negatively at ms at all but youre right ive seen no reports of amex holding points for ms to meet a min spend outside of the leaked plat link
churning,not_removed,is one better than the other they seem like the same thing
churning,not_removed,fraud
churning,not_removed,ive had fair to good experiences so far but ive only done a few runs so far i get your frustration though if the cashier is concerned with what your doing asking questions would be more effective than making up rules on the spot
churning,not_removed,per dollar back as statement credit
churning,not_removed,yes thats the risk i was looking for instant approval as i do not want to call in
churning,not_removed,sw business should not count but you may have a tough time getting second business card so soon after the first one not impossible just improbable
churning,not_removed,so the au on your account will count also towards her you can remove that if needed you dont need csp to transfer ur points to someone else who lives at the same address you do need a csp csr ink or inkpref to transfer ur points to travel partners
churning,not_removed,there is no need to officially remove your wife as an authorized user the process is that if your wife is over including au cards she will be denied after getting denied have your wife call chase recon line and ask the agent to disregard the au cards they will ask her if she the au has financial responsibility for the card once she says no the agent should just ignore the au cards if not say thank you hang up and call back to speak with another agent
churning,not_removed,chase has a card in days rule
churning,not_removed,surprisingly i was not able to add my personal plat card from the leaked link though but this is an outlier i will deal with this when i receive the card
churning,not_removed,im hoping the answer to this is yes lol but i think i applied or days apart depending on how they count it i guess i will keep pestering the recon line
churning,not_removed,no and yes not totally clear what youre asking is based on approvals if you apply for a card within days but wait to recon until one of the cards is over days old based on approval date youre no longer that being said dps suggest that is not a hard and fast rule and even if youre within that guideline you can still be denied for too many recent appsaccounts
churning,not_removed,fyi ive heard its best to keep the transactions at or under i think i read that gift cards over might not trigger the reimbursement
churning,not_removed,sooner i got it in a few days some people have said to wait like weeks though
churning,not_removed,my question is does it go after post date or statement close
churning,not_removed,thats rough id sm chase to confirm but the earliest your statement can close is going to be december i believe depending on where you are it may close as late as december but its more likely to be on the earlier end
churning,not_removed,check flyertalk for dp
churning,not_removed,any travel categories it is incredibly broad just be careful with buying gift cards that may be processed by parties yes you usually can but see note above
churning,not_removed,inputting this into google gives better results sitehttpswwwredditcomrchurning
churning,not_removed,what part of fraud is unclear i do not do airbnb and do not know much about it i have read some airbnb gcs for your use has had problems using them
churning,not_removed,it wouldnt change for me but i am too cautious by nature
churning,not_removed,youre right it looks like im mistaken for american express it goes by posting date of the transaction sorry for the confusion and thanks for the correction
churning,not_removed,i wish there was some way to automatically forward first time visitors to the wiki
churning,not_removed,yeah ups applied using the leaked link and it went pending it was expedited when i called them for verification
churning,not_removed,did you call in at all regarding this card or were you automatically approved and just received the email looks like they are only expediting it for folks who called in
churning,not_removed,looks like not everyones card was expedited some were shipped through usps
churning,not_removed,ah okay thanks yeah me sucks and here i was thinking this would have been the quickest ive ever hit a min spend bonus smh
churning,not_removed,no clue since i have a ups my choice acct i get alerted every single time theres something being shipped to my house my other two amex cards gdb and spg biz i wasnt alerted for and long behold it was delivered by usps
churning,not_removed,i havent heard of that before is this a bad list to be in i dont think any churner wants to be extra scrutinized
churning,not_removed,i dont see anything crossed out or bolded am i missing the point i didnt read all the comments
churning,not_removed,and then theyll charge your corpse a fee
churning,not_removed,i do not i have heard several people say they got a csr preapproval without a checking account but i do suspect a banking relationship helps
churning,not_removed,thats a valuable insight i was assuming that inbranch preapprovals were mostly just tied to the launch of the csr if i can expect to get them with some regularity in the long run i should keep churning away maybe its worth getting a chase checking account after all
churning,not_removed,yeah guess it was my fault assumed they would expedite automatically but it should come by the end of the week
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,yeah that was my bad it definitely does say the i got last month must have been from my au card which is weird because i hadnt received itmade a purchase yet oh well
churning,not_removed,thats my initial plan its just good to know i have the option of transferring points if a trip comes up that im able to take before hitting the
churning,not_removed,awesome thanks
churning,not_removed,thank you
churning,not_removed,nah i dont think thats it im a first time amex cardholder and i got the day email early saturday morning expedited seems to be through ups and i havent gotten any alerts about anything sent my way via ups so my amex card seems to be coming usps
churning,not_removed,i read from someone that your credit line should not exceed of your income not sure how accurate that is but i reduced it to i also got the preapproval after i applied for the spg amex card not sure if it has anything to do with it though haha maybe that triggers a soft pull idk haha
churning,not_removed,damn thanks
churning,not_removed,rather similar i just got my bluebird so only noticeable diff so far is bluebird can only be loaded at walmart and serve can be walmart family dollar and dollar general although not too easy there i stick with walmart
churning,not_removed,seriously and as i was walking up to the register she was talking to her coworker in spanish about me nice
churning,not_removed,ive only seen two dps of getting a second business card without recon ive been looking since i also have sw bus and looking to apply for ink preferred soon i dont really mind calling since i have a real business but its always better if you dont have to
churning,not_removed,ive been curious about this if i only have the freedom card but my gf has csp can i transfer points to her then she can transfer them to her southwest account with cp
churning,not_removed,i wasnt able to add my card either at first just keep trying if you really care i kept trying because i want to look at all the shiny benefits d
churning,not_removed,yeah i was thinking amazon codes should work
churning,not_removed,gotcha just wondered its not something id generally do when the first year fee hits because its just being greedy and unnecessarily risking wrath but i thought maybe after the second year it might go unnoticed
churning,not_removed,wow people here were very adamant about the plat automatically being expedited hence why i didnt call i shouldve thanks for your dp
churning,not_removed,did they call you or contact you first ive called twice and no one acts like they can do anything
churning,not_removed,i was automatically approved and did not call in this is my first amex card though so maybe theyre trying to impress me
churning,not_removed,it isnt publicly verified by chase but some people have predicted this to be the case in order to explain some csr approvals in late augustearly september definitely not a bad list to be in most of us would kill to somehow get on that list
churning,not_removed,amex bgr amex delta plat amex delta gold chase marriott biz or wait for citi aa biz match to amex biz plat but high spend
churning,not_removed,good to hear that people have been preapproved without a checking account ill keep holding out hope in that case
churning,not_removed,yeah the points for the au card get added right away no need to actually do anything with it
churning,not_removed,the only transfer option is chase ur to hyatt to sw which you dont want to do as those points will lose of their value
churning,not_removed,interesting i wonder how they are targeting people for expedition then
churning,not_removed,i am not sure about that my csr application went pending and the recon department told me the reason was too much credit extended and it is less than of the stated income i just sent a sm to reduce my csr credit line by and they just confirmed they reduced it will be waiting for a lot of preapprovals now fibgers crossed
churning,not_removed,if you live at the same address yes
churning,not_removed,i was too excited
churning,not_removed,should be fine good luck
churning,not_removed,i would strongly advise against accepting a retention offer and then cancelling the card as the risk far outweighs the benefits ive heard dps where they refuse to refund you the annual fee if you accepted a retention offer and i think if you did cancel its likely that your points will be clawed back
churning,not_removed,calling doesnt make difference
churning,not_removed,i tried to call after being automatically approved for the prg and was given the runaround over many calls and chats they wont expedite noncobranded cards at least once youve been approved
churning,not_removed,i called and said that i wanted to know the current status of my application
churning,not_removed,its now his solemn duty to be our test case and apply for chase cards next month
churning,not_removed,thanks for letting me know i definitely dont want to do it if i can avoid it but i like having a backup plan i have no problem buying gift cards on the southwest cards if need be to a certain extent im just too new to this to feel comfortable msing
churning,not_removed,it came ups express next day air did you all get the bonus wonder if the different bonus made a difference
churning,not_removed,awesome thanks
churning,not_removed,at the same time or staggered over a few days
churning,not_removed,thank you i guess ill call tomorrow and cancel it and if they push back at all ill just say i changed my mind and dont want the points anymore hopefully that works
churning,not_removed,good to know thanks
churning,not_removed,thanks for the info
churning,not_removed,you must have said the magic word ive called twice and gotten the run around from a south asian sounding call center
churning,not_removed,haha agreed urybosworld if you are somehow in this special group you will be the envy of the sub
churning,not_removed,im actually going to apply for the southwest card just to see if something similar happens
churning,not_removed,no branches in my state thats the problem if i had concrete evidence that opening an account significantly increases preapproval odds i would figure out a way to open up an account and probably do the bonus at the same time
churning,not_removed,i understand i dont ms at all
churning,not_removed,looks like it i have been trying to find dps of public linkexisting amex customerauto approval and expedition seems like no one with these criteria has had their card expedited automatically this time around
churning,not_removed,i did and the last two were one after the other
churning,not_removed,idk ive always staggered just out of paranoia haha
churning,not_removed,thanks for all the help
churning,not_removed,youre right next time im in a state with a chase branch and i stop in to check for preapprovals ill open up a checking acct
churning,not_removed,good for ice cream runs this one
churning,not_removed,got the same thing might ms it via grocery store
churning,not_removed,i got one that was basically an addition aa milesso total the categories were great though diningdruggrocery
churning,not_removed,too bad the cap is so low an extra aa is solid
churning,not_removed,do you receive offers for the aadvantage card through email or do i have to navigate citis crappy web portal to access this stuff
churning,not_removed,it already exists keep looking and post in the newbie thread next time
churning,not_removed,its one of the first things listed in the required reading before posting wiki
churning,not_removed,ditto on the other guys comments httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiglossary
churning,not_removed,someone already posted this
churning,not_removed,just noted that over lunch thanks for letting me know will delete it
churning,not_removed,but dont worryyou are still golden for the finals this year have a great rose festival weekend brotha
churning,not_removed,unsurprising when things are maximized by a lot of people capsnerfs almost always follow
churning,not_removed,yep this was reported maybe a month ago it is sad but not unexpected
churning,not_removed,the explicit language at the bottom added early this year iirc makes me think that theyre going to be monitoring ms activity next week unless provided in additional terms for special promotions the following are not qualifying purchases and you will not earn points for them payments of existing card balances balance transfers cash advances atm transactions convenience checks fees charged by us for example annual fees finance charges and related service charges if any apply payments made for prepaid and reloadable cards such as certain gift cards and similar cards payments made for payment instruments that can readily be converted to cash for example travelers cheques money orders wire transfers and similar products or services
churning,not_removed,this has been known now i wish i had gotten it earlier this year ive been reading this sub for years now and only started last year but shit do i always feel like im late to the party on everything
churning,not_removed,does anyone have proof of whether or not the june time frame will be shortened if the finals dont span that long
churning,not_removed,is it safe to hit up giftcardscom during the finals this this year for or will they start enforcing the gift cards language right away
churning,not_removed,anyone know if venmo will count for the
churning,not_removed,ill mention the proverbial saying about pigs getting fat and hogs getting slaughtered i think this should be the official ms slogan if only people could use things in a sustainable manner
churning,not_removed,still golden for the finals this year yep this is the last full period though now we know for sure that its capped before next all star weekend have a great rose festival weekend thanks you too
churning,not_removed,this is a little different than the report i saw which said it would start in now its officially july
churning,not_removed,its definitely possible we know theyre already discriminating serve loads and costco and sams purchases which was a change before the last period that doesnt indicate that theyre analyzing level data which is what tells them if youre buying gift cards versus groceries if they start using that data the card will be nerfed enough that most people probably wont bother with it anymore we just have to hope that doesnt happen
churning,not_removed,theres still plenty of great deals to be had especially if you arent past churning always feels like its dying quickly but its really just changing we can always adapt if we get some long term perspective churning has really only been worthwhile for the past few years rewards credit cards were unheard of until not too long ago and still werent common just a decade ago there are more good cards now than ever before there are also more rules now but despite always feeling like its on the brink of collapse i think this is really the golden age of churning sure youve missed out on a couple cards but ultimately you have much better of an opportunity than the generation behind you or the one ahead
churning,not_removed,it isnt necessarily proof but is confirmation from one of their csrs that it will last until the regardless
churning,not_removed,we dont know yet the language in the terms about gift cards is new im going to ms really lightly and see if they give any points right at the start
churning,not_removed,havent seen data points either way points post days after transactions so you could find out pretty quickly id be curious to know too
churning,not_removed,thank you seems weird that the longest they will go is through game though
churning,not_removed,its because the outcome is rigged cavs in after curry gets taken out at the end of game seriously though i have no idea why im just glad its guaranteed to last that long
churning,not_removed,nah kd and westbrook will finish warriors tomorrow night
churning,not_removed,thunder up
churning,not_removed,just got this as well exactly what i needed for some points for an upcoming trip early next year
churning,not_removed,youll probably get fired if your boss catches you doing this that youre earning comes out of the restaurant in fees ballpark on top of that its just super sketchy theres no way id keep a waiter doing this on staff
churning,not_removed,rshittychurning
churning,not_removed,you are costing your employer money on transaction fees and could risk getting fired
churning,not_removed,sounds illegal
churning,not_removed,other than it likely being considered fraud your employer paying additional cc processing fees for your discover card vs none for cash and likely losing your job once they see you pocketing the cash sounds solid cc rshittychurning
churning,not_removed,youll probably get fired but you could cover your tracks a bit better and buy vgc at office depot with an ink card and use those to pay the bill will probably look a bit less suspicious than a whole bunch of transactions on an employees card
churning,not_removed,dont throw your full time employment away on this idea
churning,not_removed,not all
churning,not_removed,i got a similar email for my personal citi aa plat but for restaurants grocery gas drugstores and commuter transport
churning,not_removed,i got one for bonus miles for spend on diningshoppinggrocery mine was definitely targeted
churning,not_removed,i feel if you cant edit the title you should delete this thread and repost a new one otherwise you will be hit with a lot of downvotes for misleading
churning,not_removed,reddit never allows you to edit titles but it seems fine to me the image is right inline to view
churning,not_removed,received this offer in my email today never been to a bed and breakfast but in case anyone here enjoys them also the made me think of the csr travel credit im not sure if it codes as travel but it is the exact amount of credit the csr gives you per calendar year
churning,not_removed,post removed in
churning,not_removed,daily thread not here
churning,not_removed,wonder how this even lasted minutes
churning,not_removed,upgrade it to a reserve and double dip the travel credit for net af
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,same way i do 😉
churning,not_removed,aaaaand pc it back to csp when the af hits
churning,not_removed,youre learning young padawan chase must hate me by now
churning,not_removed,what does it take to get a megathread going theres been hundreds of comments about this and it would make sense to have them all in one place although now that ive compiled them they kind of are but this comment will get lost in the shuffle new threads over the past couple weeks and im sure we havent seen the end of them
churning,not_removed,listen you guys just listen please dont rock the boat if you were lucky enough to get the latest platinum offer make sure you have at least in blatant natural spend before i read about this freezing shit i had msd i went ahead and made damn sure i put in regular spend on that card and when i say dont rock the boat im talking about self interest have you already gotten the laundry list of mr earning cards let alone spg delta and hh between the wife and i we have mr spg and delta were not done yet either disclaimer if i had plans to use mr anytime soon and found out my points were frozen id be pretty pissed too its just that amex is such a cash cow dont ruin it for yourself edit what im saying is that the wife and i still need the following cards her ameriprise her edp her mercedesbenz nbsp me ameriprise me edp me amex business gold whatever im drunk do whatever you guys want im not going to stress about this freeze thing
churning,not_removed,seems like they are just stalling until september when people cant prorate refund the af
churning,not_removed,mine worked on uber last week cant transfer points anywhere but according to ubers fare estimator i can ride from memphis to portland or in an uber x can only make it to denver in an xl
churning,not_removed,im betting that on september everyones points will be freely transferable
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,for what its worth my points were unfrozen last week even though my spend has some clear ms purchases
churning,not_removed,how did you meet your spend organically or ms
churning,not_removed,anybody know offhand if this is just from the offers or if the more recent offers are affected edit thanks guys i missed the and was worried i was about to get disappointed with my getting locked up
churning,not_removed,this worries me ive avoided the freeze but i have a green thats about to get a bonus posted and that just seems like it would set off some alarms
churning,not_removed,this is what i expected to happen so much for amexs world class customer service huh
churning,not_removed,i feel like its about time for cfpb complaints edit and a megathread
churning,not_removed,currently in week of the week timeframe i can totally use them for uber and nothing else
churning,not_removed,so i have or so points from the prg offer late last year and i have the balance from the amex platinum this year i transferred points to delta skymiles to check it transferred over but i think it started using the prg stash first how can i check if my amex points are ok
churning,not_removed,according to tc you have to wait until the statement closes where you accrued the min spend points will be credited to your membership rewards account within weeks after charges appear on your monthly billing statement ive also been told by amex that it is when you paid off your valid min spend not including annual fee and authorized users fee
churning,not_removed,can you elaborate on the specific words she used did she acknowledge that the prior party line was weeks was she stating it as if she knew already or did it come as a surprise as she was clicking through screens on her end
churning,not_removed,make sure you met the spending requirement in an honest manner huca file a claim with the cfpb
churning,not_removed,has anyone tried submitting this httpswebaexpstaticcomuscontentpdfgcogcoclaimpdf
churning,not_removed,i think the waiting game is best does the government complaint consistently release points if not just let it play out as amex isnt letting go for now
churning,not_removed,now i dont have frozen points but if i did and i hit the min spend naturally i would of went to the cfpb by now everyone was so quick to do it with citi over the citigold miles but no one seems to want to do it with amex although i saw one mention further down the thread
churning,not_removed,yup still frozenover in normal spending in weeks still use the card but not as aggressivelyfrozen and pissed
churning,not_removed,points unfrozen yesterday my points were locked today i was able to transfer miles to delta i was locked and met the spend on june they were at about weeks for my unfreeze i did file with cfpb fyi
churning,not_removed,mine was frozen even before i met the minimum spend and well before the bonus posted rep registered an enquiry when i called in got a call back after a couple of days explaining weeks timeframe after bonus points posting to account i explained how my points have been frozen even before that then the agent changed what he just mentioned and said weeks from when i couldnt use my points for the first time so technically my points should be unfrozen by end of next week but i feel its just a bunch of bullshit and nothing is going to change lets wait and watch
churning,not_removed,mods megathread please
churning,not_removed,have all the automated mr transfer phone lines been shut down
churning,not_removed,any chances theyll request receipts from retailers i bought some vgcs at my local kroger but always with groceries so it was always a different transaction amount
churning,not_removed,is there a way to see whether points are frozen without instantiating a transfer
churning,not_removed,so my points on amex are pending from each of the cards i have msed on is this what freezing of points mean also i noticed others have chatted with amex in the past is there a chat feature on their website i cannot seem to find it all help would be greatly appreciated thank you
churning,not_removed,i have no plans to redeem until months from now so i have no clue if im frozen and not sure if i should care in regards to myselfi am curious though
churning,not_removed,hm whats the cheapest option to find out if points are frozen went for the offer from the sub here but absolutely zero ms to meet min spend i didnt look too closely but is mr the lowest transfer allowed to see if points are frozen
churning,not_removed,just tried the ba transfer mr no ms whatsoever used offer from sub got unable to process your request with some bs error code
churning,not_removed,im keeping it simple when my six weeks time period is up im going to file a cfpb complaint i suspect they are going to drag this out until september so that no one can get any afs back
churning,not_removed,you still can book flights on amex travel with your points its probably worth taking a look especially if you didnt spend the naturally
churning,not_removed,why are people stressing you get another back off af come january the loss amounts to something like or so from that offer that can easily be recouped in amex offer and even if not thats the cost of doing business lot of churners with seriously bad sense of entitlements this is how shit goes down hill not just with amex but across the board just be fucking cool for once
churning,not_removed,couple of weeks ago mods claimed it was a perhaps theyll now reconsider their assessment as it would seem the people of this sub are voting with their upvotes
churning,not_removed,i reported the post stating it needed a mega thread do the same
churning,not_removed,thank you these fucking mods blow
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,dont forget ameriprise gold
churning,not_removed,i have two vgcs groceries at a grocery store everything else legit cant decide whether its worth finding a way to spend that in legit spend in the next days what on or if i could justify it if needed
churning,not_removed,dont stress about the freeze but also please keep us informed of what cards you and the wifey still need whether amex or otherwise inquiry minds want to know drunky
churning,not_removed,what do you mean natural spend buy precious metals thats natural spend for me or in guns again that can be natural for me depending on what i want to get
churning,not_removed,can you take one for the team and take that uber from memphis to nyc to protest in front of amex corporate hq freethepoints
churning,not_removed,whats the point redemption value for using mr for uber
churning,not_removed,because then you cant get a prorated refund of the af
churning,not_removed,how long from the statement close date were your points unfrozen how long from the actual charge were your points unfrozen sorry for the questions but im just trying to get data points
churning,not_removed,normal spend
churning,not_removed,i think its important to state that ms is still legal spend ms is not illegal unethical or anything of the such buying items and returning items should not be awarded with the bonus however most forms of ms should not be grounds for freezing points if they want to close your accounts and take your points thats their right as a business freezing assets unfairly is not thats just my two cents also for anyone who knows me i am always antifiling any complaints this situation may be the first time in my years of actively churning where filing a complaint is the correct course of action as i said above they always reserve the right to close off all business with you and confiscate all of your points its a risk you run by filing complaints returning items or blatant ms on a credit card
churning,not_removed,its just people who got the accidentally public offer
churning,not_removed,i believe its only affecting those who applied for the platinum using the link posted here a couple months ago
churning,not_removed,dont worry about that you will be fine i got the green and gold bonuses a couple months ago and was able to transfer points to aeroplan just fine
churning,not_removed,ive posted this before but i also think the amex concierge is a joke im glad i dont rely on these banks for any actual business outside churning
churning,not_removed,i cant wait for the new rumored chase elite so i can dump my amex plat i love chase and prefer ur over mr anyway due to travel partners their customer service has been hit or miss anytime i call sometimes its great and sometimes its shitty but the worst part is that i never get the same answer from two different reps when i have a question chase has always given great service least to me
churning,not_removed,why does this subreddit always equate customer service with ignoring their tc
churning,not_removed,i did that as soon as i got off the phone today was the last straw
churning,not_removed,seriously considering this i naturally met the minimum spend and this is the first time ive had so much difficulty in using points
churning,not_removed,when you get a freeze it freezes all of your points i dont think you can just transfer from another stash of points from earlier so i think your points are fine
churning,not_removed,seems the only way is to try and transfer them out you could call but with how shady amex is being about the freeze the simple inquiry may cause them to flag freeze your points i wouldnt chance it
churning,not_removed,how can i check if my amex points are ok you already did theyre either all transferable or none are transferable
churning,not_removed,ive also been told by amex that theyve given out dozens of answers all of which have been wrong so far why start believing them now
churning,not_removed,this i dont know why people assume weeks means from the date i completed the minimum spend because thats not at all what the tc says you need to make in net purchases then wait until the statement closes then wait weeks so technically it could be up to weeks after meeting the minimum spend if you finish it early in the billing period
churning,not_removed,she refused to believe that i was told my review was already over and also the week bs she wanted the name and the department of who told me that which of course i didnt know she just kept saying that there are a lot of other people going through the same thing and theyll get the review done as quickly as they can
churning,not_removed,how long from the statement close date were your points unfrozen how long from the actual min spend charge were your points unfrozen
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,the only precedent for that is discover apple pay promo effectively cash back wanted receipts proving that purchases werent for gift cards edit rereading that makes me feel like we need a churning history book i vote for a religious text format so we can build up the myth of the churning gods
churning,not_removed,no but you can do just mr to ba and obviously youre out at most mr because if it fails you lose nothing but if it works youre likely in the clear
churning,not_removed,no yes click help in top right and click online chat works best in chrome
churning,not_removed,assuming you met everything legitimately dont rock the boat i wouldnt even try touching stuff until post september if i was in your boat
churning,not_removed,mr to british airways
churning,not_removed,i believe trying to apply one mr point to an amazon order ie gift card will also tell you if youre frozen order will go through but then you will get an email saying it was cancelled due to amex not authorizing your points for payment
churning,not_removed,that assumes youre comfortable with the risk that they might decide to claw stuff back from youeither try to charge you cash in kind or cancel your travel booking if it hasnt happened yet hitting naturally and waiting it out or filing cfpb seems like the safest bet to me
churning,not_removed,just to clarify i didnt book through amex i transferred to delta
churning,not_removed,why are people stressing because all points are frozen including those previously earned and many people myself included had plans to use some of those points award space is fickle
churning,not_removed,there is no sense of entitlement we have fulfilled our end of the terms that amex created its amex that was entitled to unilaterally creating the terms and conditions there should be a civil penalty along with interest charges for the loss the cardholders have endured and if amex stops providing offers good for them im sure most of us here dont depend on churning income for a living as for a data point my points were unfrozen about a week ago and i was able to transfer that was exactly weeks from my charge i did ms initially but ended up spending in the last weeks before the points were unfrozen interestingly i did not call at any time regarding my frozen points it just happened automatically
churning,not_removed,a couple of weeks ago it was just like the citi issue wasnt a thing until citi went from wait for your points to no points for you and in the same linked post the mod is fine with a mega thread once there is some substance to the issue
churning,not_removed,❤
churning,not_removed,thx bruh
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,im just saying amex is easy to hit so it might not be in peoples best interest to bite the hand that feeds them
churning,not_removed,yes dont buy plastic that was manufactured into gift cards from cvs walmart or elsewhere guns should be fine
churning,not_removed,obviously hookers and blow
churning,not_removed,the tc simply says the following charges do not count towards the threshold amount fees or interest charges balance transfers cash advances purchases of travelers checks purchases or reloading of prepaid cards or purchases of other cash equivalents
churning,not_removed,im saying for this very specific offer amex seems to be combing through accounts i personally dont want to give them any reason to take my mr i understand its not easy for everyone to put in organic spend im just saying if you can it would probably be a good idea as amex is playing hardball
churning,not_removed,where do you live that you own your home and dont own a car im almost on the same boat as you but i still can spend that naturally
churning,not_removed,far from ideal but wanted to test it out
churning,not_removed,winner winner chicken dinner
churning,not_removed,i could see amex doing this but then they would be in violation of their tc for some people depending on when points posted etc i would think some documentation and a cfpb complaint would get an annual fee refunded and card cancelled and maybe blacklisted for those who already filed cfpb complaints you should have a date in the response from amex as to when the weeks began if they dont post points by one business day after the weeks id dispute with cfpb
churning,not_removed,this argument makes little sense since you dont need to keep the card to keep the sign up bonus
churning,not_removed,that shouldnt matter as long as the points post once they do you can just cancel the card assuming you have another mr card to keep them alive so i dont know who they would be fooling with that tactic
churning,not_removed,this information would be very useful
churning,not_removed,per multiple conversations with reps all people who points were frozen a later call indicated was the freeze date i met minimum spend both exclusive and inclusive of annual membership fee as the purchase that put me over the top was a purchase i was able to transfer on so weeks from weeks from and exactly weeks from meeting spend
churning,not_removed,first of all youre a lot better at the hobby than i am arent there terms on amex cards saying that buying cash equivalents doesnt count for earning points i like others are assuming theyre locking down accounts looking for activity they deem as either returns cash equivalents or whatever else that would get them a reason to claw back points
churning,not_removed,ms is legal spend but isnt it technically cashlike transactions so does amex have to honor that for minimum spend
churning,not_removed,also posted on paid affiliates like thepointsguycom
churning,not_removed,well yeah but i dont know if the bonus plus the would cause anyone to freeze my account im just holding out for an spg bonus and then all is gone d
churning,not_removed,all points ive earned on top of the and points i have earned prior to the are frozen i cannot transfer points anywhere
churning,not_removed,the one time i needed concierge there was a minute wait i hung up
churning,not_removed,really i used it times recently and each time has been an excellent experience
churning,not_removed,i have to agree my experience with chase is far superior than amex and its not just because of the frozen points scam ur has far more redemption options that mr the benefits of the cards themselves are far superior than amex im talking about warranty return price car rental and most importantly the benefits are permanent regardless if the card is closed ive used warranty on an item one year after i closed my csp and they sent me a check no questions asked after i mailed them the item
churning,not_removed,same id definitely be interested in the chase elite bad thing i am way over i have one chase freedom should i pc hmm
churning,not_removed,i have had dreadful experience with all of the csp perks that its turned me off that card ive tried to utilize various perks from travel insurance to purchase protection numerous times now and there are so many technicalities and disclaimers with it that ive only been able to successfully use it once and even then it wasnt that helpful
churning,not_removed,could not agree more
churning,not_removed,because ignoring their own tc leads to a poor customer experience
churning,not_removed,please let us know when you get a reply which shouldnt take too long
churning,not_removed,good im hesitant to do so because i wont be using mr for at least months or so and dont want to get on amexs bad side unless necessary got the plat and mb eyeing the prg gold green etc definitely update when you get a response i feel like ive read reports before that amex responds pretty quickly
churning,not_removed,ahh alright ill do another test later just to be sure
churning,not_removed,good point ill keep a close eye without calling in
churning,not_removed,i see i will do another points test later today since i did it the first time last month and i know some people said their points froze after they did one transfer
churning,not_removed,thats not true for me i transferred to ba and was frozen afterwards
churning,not_removed,because im a fucking profitable customer and i have a right to these points now
churning,not_removed,theyre upset because the points are there if the points werent there then the tc would be followed
churning,not_removed,i dont know why people assume weeks means from the date i completed the minimum spend because thats not at all what the tc says lol thats exactly what the tc say
churning,not_removed,it actually is weeks from the qualifying charge educate yourself with the terms before posting your nonsense online i posted a copy of the terms in another thread
churning,not_removed,what did they do for people who threw away receipts most people dont keep receipts
churning,not_removed,yea everything was legit i did do one gc purchase through target online
churning,not_removed,ah just what i needed thanks
churning,not_removed,i called amex and this is their costumer reps advice i told her i cant wait any longer to book my flight and she suggests to book it with points the conversation has been documented and i would like to see them clawing the points back
churning,not_removed,i understand that but throwing gasoline on the fire is not going to help anyone if you think constantly calling them and filing with cfpb is going to resolve this overnight than you are naive all it will do is give amex a bad taste in their mouths and next thing you know bonuses and offers start to diminish and once shop does it it happens across the board sometimes the best move is no move but the lack of patience and tact among this crowd is for lack of a better word disgusting
churning,not_removed,was it weeks since the actual charge that put you over or weeks from the statement date or closing date of the statement with the spend
churning,not_removed,my point exactly of all the comments to reply to you pick mine
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,but i can just sell the precious metals back for melt and get my money back
churning,not_removed,i have very serious doubts amex would blacklist someone because they filed a complaint with the cfpb if the cfpb heard about that youd better imagine they would be furious
churning,not_removed,nah it still makes sense they have to give out the points one way or the other if you legitimately met the terms but at least if they can push it past they will get out of you to recoup part of that cost and of course they think youll see the benefits to holding the card and will want to keep it long term hah
churning,not_removed,they could manually callback points
churning,not_removed,yep and a mega thread asking those questions would also be useful
churning,not_removed,thank you for replying im still frozen met min spend with purchase on weeks statement closed weeks paid off statement weeks amex mr team member on the phone said i met the min spend by my first cycle which was the week would be the of august thats actually weeks so that guy didnt know what he was talking about i even recorded the conversation
churning,not_removed,mine were definitely frozen yesterday and today they are freed or unfrozen or whatever term we are using here
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,they cant prove they are cash equivalents they just see amounts and locations they reserve the right to close accounts for whatever reason but unless the store is providing data they are freezing accounts off of assumptions which is fine whats not fine is freezing them past the week time period that is set as law
churning,not_removed,correct thats the crux of this whole thing tc blatantly call out cash equivalents and i believe gift cards verbatim as nonpoint eligible purchases
churning,not_removed,i dont see why not whats not technically cash like about ms if they suspect it they can shut you down nobody is forcing them to do business with you edit misunderstood the statement they cant tell what type of transactions they are they just see amounts and locations unless maybe staples yes cash like doesnt count but its impossible for a bank to know thats what you purchased
churning,not_removed,yeah im kinda glad i didnt apply for it since it seems to be more of a hassle than anything ill be happy with the mb plat in the meantime
churning,not_removed,i think my post was hidden or something from the sub a few hours after i posted it but heres my dp thats relevant to your situation
churning,not_removed,i posted my experience
churning,not_removed,according to doc the ritz carlton card isnt under maybe since it has such a high annual fee chase decided to not restrict it in hopes of making a ton of cash in annual fees off it hopefully theyll do the same with the sapphire elite
churning,not_removed,well if you value the benefits of the elite id do it when are you under
churning,not_removed,seriously man just wait it out amex has no or many other restrictions you can cancel cards through a live chat apply for two cards every few months yadda yadda i sound like a spokesmen for milking amex as much as you can the only thing you need to do is avoid the fr and even then as long you comply theyll just give you spending limits if you lied about things
churning,not_removed,if youre just burning points you can transfer to ba instead of to delta and avoid the excise tax
churning,not_removed,same with me but mine were frozen first then unfrozen and then frozen again after i got my bonus heres the long version initially my points were completely frozen along with everyone else then i was able to transfer mr points to virgin this is the same number of points i initially tried and was denied i got my bonus assuming my account was unfrozen but when i tried to transfer to of that to plenti for the bonus i was denied im hoping the september theory posed in this thread holds
churning,not_removed,thats not true for me not sure why youre disputing me all your points were available at one time then later they all werent the only way to check is to try to transfer
churning,not_removed,looking at your post history all i see is grief against amex so im gonna assume you either read the wrong tc or you saw what you wanted to see fyi the tc were also posted in the post i was replying to by and they seem pretty clear to me weeks after charges appear on your monthly billing statement notice the word monthly theyre not referring to your online summary
churning,not_removed,if that is the case its been weeks for me since i made the actual charge
churning,not_removed,some pushed back hard and got courtesy cash back anyway one strategy was citing hipaa rights at drugstores for many it was tough shit though
churning,not_removed,in your case id probably say go for it then you have something to fall back on there even if booking with points is a suboptimal redemption it sounds like it will fit your own immediate needs better for those without an imminent plan to redeem who did some ms i would be far more hesitant to do so youll ultimately get a better return by waiting and most of them dont have documentation like you do
churning,not_removed,you could be right or wrong if had success and failure with both strategies what i know you are wrong about is people calling to complain about being fucked being the impetus for a company to discontinue an incentive companies run incentives because they help the bottom line in some way more spend loyalty referrals whatever this doesnt change that
churning,not_removed,maybe you dont understand then lets put a hold on all of your points and see how long you can wait weeks is fine but it is beyond that for many people now
churning,not_removed,it was weeks exactly from the statement close but my spend occurred just week before the statement closed the statement date and closing date are the same thing
churning,not_removed,i didnt meet min spend i am frozen
churning,not_removed,i know very little about this stuff but where are you buying precious metals that you can sell back for any kind of actual equal value i always thought that there are fees taxes or charges that make selling back precious metals almost always a loss unless you really know what you are doing with regards to collectibles
churning,not_removed,how could either side prove one way or another
churning,not_removed,except it doesnt make sense because freezing the points doesnt stop you from cancelling the card
churning,not_removed,on what premise that you chose not to renew your account they would have no grounds to do that because the terms only state that you get the points after meeting the minimum spend within a certain time not that you have to keep the card a certain time
churning,not_removed,the accounts are being blanket frozen for the offer and then the review is to look at any transaction data to verify
churning,not_removed,whats not technically cash like about ms you are correct it is technically cashlike and thats precisely the problem most credit card offered have a clause that cashlike transactions dont count towards minimum spend its just that the automated systems that review this are generally missing a few things that should be coded as cashlike but arent
churning,not_removed,its not hard for credit card companies to get merchant slipssales receipts from gift card salesthey can see the transaction if they want
churning,not_removed,ive switched over to amex concierge by text it works better for the most part on the other hand i find i need to be almost excruciatingly specific with my instructions i still run into issues where they give me maddeningly incorrect information just as an example i asked for tours for grand canyon national park starting from that area she told me that no such tours existed and recommended there partner who operates out of las vegas after looking up that company i discovered that they operate exactly the type of tour i was look for from the location i wanted it im not sure how theyre so utterly incompetent in some ways and yet in others theyre fantastic ive had several positive experiences with them where they saved me hours of research yet there doesnt seem to be rhyme or reason to there competency
churning,not_removed,in months
churning,not_removed,at this rate under isnt happening for me haha
churning,not_removed,oh i am definitely holding off im just happy if others are complaining so i dont have to haha i doubt ill get frd no alarming spending patterns or anything like that the only ms i do is plastiq the worst thing about spending limits on charge cards is that they wont give you more charge cards
churning,not_removed,good call saves me those excise tax
churning,not_removed,well it comes down to semantics it states when charges appear on your monthly statement this to me means weeks from what date is located next to the charge on the statement if they wanted it to be weeks from the statement they should have stated weeks after the monthly billing statement in which the charges appear either way semantics and unless you charged on day one of your statement most people would have to wait weeks at most but it appears in many cases amex is not following their terms and some people have surpassed weeks
churning,not_removed,there is a possibility something like this can impact products the company offers combine that with the fact that calling and complaining will absolutely not resolve this overnight and the costbenefit equation of this strategy clearly shows negative returns at best youll have neutral results aka nothing will change in terms of products but you no amount of calling is going to get them to release your points overnight im pretty sure the tc of the mr program allows them to do practically whatever they want
churning,not_removed,my points are on hold you think im in here commenting because i have nothing better to do
churning,not_removed,gbcue is kidding
churning,not_removed,well you can buy them online for slightly above spot price then when the price goes up sell to your local coin shop or back to the online vendor if the price doesnt go up well youve still got a cashequivalent investment provident metals apmex jm bullion modern coin mart and more are places where us on rsilverbugs buy from
churning,not_removed,im going to admit i havent read all the tcs here but i would be extremely reluctant to cancel the card while my points are frozen even if i had another mrearning card i see that as begging for a clawback on literally any pretext they can find if they cant somehow find language in the terms to make your cancelling the card itself cause for the clawback
churning,not_removed,they are allowed to do that in the terms and they have done it before
churning,not_removed,especially if you can point to my points were frozen with no info on when they would be un done i dont really want to do business with amex if youre going to treat a customer like this on a high af card like this why should i keep the card i used the mb plat shipment delay and all the shit service related to that as the reason to cancel my mb plat after getting the bonus and airline credit i hadnt originally intended to cancel to get the af back but it taking over days just to get a hold of someone that could fix the problem and send me a new card with no compensation for this trouble really annoyed me
churning,not_removed,right and there are restrictions as to how long those reviews can last the laws tc allegedly says weeks at what point is it unacceptable to keep reviewing additional months a year rules are rules weeks anything after that i feel rightfully opens them to complaints if someone feels the need to edit updated law to tc
churning,not_removed,nothing is coded as anything in the majority of stores unless a store is providing what exactly each purchase you made was and very few do they just see a total and a store
churning,not_removed,that has like literally never happened no way amex is going through thousands of card members reaching out to tens of thousands of stores asking for receipts across multiple days
churning,not_removed,whats the number for texting them
churning,not_removed,well have your lawyer read them and then make sure they go by the terms i wouldnt waste my time if they were following the terms
churning,not_removed,you need to be able to recoup the over spot price and the surcharge for using credit cards usually yes you can make money off of precious metals but for credit card purchases you will be a good bit behind at first and if youre unable to flip those bars quickly at a profit you will be destroyed by interest on your investment if you were going to buy it anyways and have the cash thats fine otherwise youre buying on margin more or less
churning,not_removed,do the laws say weeks
churning,not_removed,assume youre correct how hard is it for amex to assume simon mall purchases for isnt gift card purchases simon doesnt even sell anything else
churning,not_removed,you need to call and ask for an invitation you might be able to do it through email as well personally i asked for an invite and they said theyd call me in two business days to set it up it actually took tour
churning,not_removed,i do believe so according to a data point from someone here a couple weeks ago unless he was just bullshitting in which case my entire argument is worthless
churning,not_removed,well just like i said they can assume all they want and they can shut you down and confiscate your rewards without notice and for no reason at all they dont have to do business with you but freezing accounts for weeks while they comb over activity come on
churning,not_removed,id like to see this law this isnt a bank account id honestly be a little wierded out if there was such a law for rewards programs
churning,not_removed,well if thousands of people are violating their ts
churning,not_removed,basic response was that they were within their rights for week hold according to account tcs and cfpb considered the matter closed i still have an opportunity to dispute which i may if something doesnt happen monday so not law just tc somewhere says they can freeze accounts for weeks while they investigate
churning,not_removed,technically that wording there is that a week hold is within their rights according to the tcs it doesnt actually state that the tcs allow for up to weeks id imagine if the datapoints actually suggest an indefinite freeze on all accounts it would be arguable but as long as they are unfreezing accounts they could theoretically keep the last one frozen for a long long time
churning,not_removed,rchurning requires you to flair your post this post has been automatically removed but will be reapproved and this comment deleted once flair has been added to add flair to your post open it and click the button labelled flair beneath your title from the menu select the most appropriate category and then hit save you do not need to delete or resubmit your post dont blame me from httpraddit
churning,not_removed,according to the rchurning spreadsheet this appears to be the best public offer ever
churning,not_removed,since this offer seems to go until id personally wait for amexs big release on could be a new cc offer platinum reward structure change who knows remember the amex rule for credit cards of the time this cannot be circumvented except for the rare case where people were able to get around this
churning,not_removed,do i grab this as my amex card or do i wait for this unveiling of a csr competitive product
churning,not_removed,nobody has yet mentioned the companion pass that accrues should you decide to keep the card for a second year lots of us wont get much value from that but its nice to have the option value a year from now good details on the delta cp
churning,not_removed,darn i got the offer back in july though that spend req was
churning,not_removed,if i hit the min spend and the statement closes next year would i get the mqms for next year
churning,not_removed,already have cards to ms and worst of all amex credit cards what are the chances of me cancelling one and getting this card approved i guess if i dont get approved i could try to uncancel the cancelled card but during the whole process someone might go no cerdit card and i would be doomed decisions decisions ps great offer
churning,not_removed,the easily has to be worth right
churning,not_removed,got this last time it was can confirm a buyonboard drink triggers the credit and you get buyonboard too
churning,not_removed,its worth noting both the business and personal are showing mqm e spend on business
churning,not_removed,i had this card years ago and cancelled last year just got approved for it again today will i get the bonus
churning,not_removed,id say hold out until oct for the potential amex plat update
churning,not_removed,can this card be switched to a no fee card after claiming the rewards sorry if this is obvious i feel like its always possible but would hate to harm my transunion score by cancelling a card
churning,not_removed,will amex pc you to anything with annual fee after the first year
churning,not_removed,as somebody who lives in a delta hub this is offer is downright tempting but theres a part of me that wants to be patient and cool off a bit especially since i hit my minimum spends with plastiq otoh tapping this offer would give me enough skypesos to turn my ur account into a slush fund for hyatt
churning,not_removed,does anyone know if you apply for this card and wait to meet the spending requirements until your january bill would the mqms then hit in january of and be good for any help would be awesome
churning,not_removed,i already have delta miles i need more
churning,not_removed,business might be a better option no additional annual fee for more people as an authorized user and you earn miles from their usage too
churning,not_removed,im trying to see if this card is right for me im based out of ewr and mostly interested in domestic travel for my wife and i what would be a good use of these miles for us if at all side note already have ur and united miles just looking for some more flexibility out of newark
churning,not_removed,am i wrong in thinking delta has very expensive biz class mileage requirements compared to their competition last i checked they wanted miles for a round trip flight to europe i think i am using miles on a trip coming up in november with aa
churning,not_removed,im on a dl flight right now theyre hawking this hard along with gold at made a special announcement and everything
churning,not_removed,is anyone able to generate a referral link for this deal when i tried it came up with just the offer
churning,not_removed,buuuut then you have to have points with delta the program where they literally change redemption rates overnight and have nope listed award chart sweet ill take five
churning,not_removed,i am afraid all these offers of higher bonus makes me squirm all i see another devaluation coming sigh such is life in the miles lane sigh again
churning,not_removed,does the count towards business cards as well for example i just applied for an everday card can i get one delta personal and one delta business card or would that put me over the
churning,not_removed,hot damn i wonder to what extent we can ms this card wo the bonus getting rescinded granted isnt that hard to do organically
churning,not_removed,not sure if this card is for me or not im not looking to churn but do want to take advantage of getting another credit card ideally i want to get as many points as possible without churning to help pay for a honeymoon in fall to europe i also plan to use the card i get as my everyday spend card originally i was planning on holding out for a amex plat offer or comparable but this one seems just as good of a deal with this delta plat do you get all the bonuses of the regular plat in addition to the delta perks edit i also get the annual fee waived on amex with scra
churning,not_removed,crap i really want the personal and biz of this card but im for at least weeks have revolving lines with amex two spg im not giving up and the hiltonskymiles i just got and just got bonuses for any ideas
churning,not_removed,would one be able to apply for both the personal and the business versions on the same day for combined credit pull i only have credit cards with amex so far rest are charge cards so i wouldnt go over the limit i did get the plat though a few months ago so maybe theyve got me flagged somehow
churning,not_removed,im seriously aggravated that two weeks ago i wasnt thinking and upgraded from gold to platinum for a bonus after spending and then this pops up
churning,not_removed,im still sitting here waiting for the points i earned for this card
churning,not_removed,is there still time enough in the year to get the mqms applied towards qualifications my wife is a bit short of hitting platinum for i dont want to apply and not have them add the mqms to the account until january for example
churning,not_removed,do you think it is worth it for me to get it if i wont be using them until summer realistically worried about them being further devalued
churning,not_removed,ive never been able to get a clear answer from amex on this question about years ago i upgraded my delta gold card to delta platinum never received signup bonus for the delta platinum if i downgrade back to gold i am still eligible to receive platinum bonus correct
churning,not_removed,this card would be good if i want to redeem a flight with aero mexico right
churning,not_removed,i just want to post this since i was a bit nervous when i did it and everyone loves confirmed data points i applied for the delta gold late and received the bonus i applied for the delta plat in summer and received the bonus they are different products
churning,not_removed,remindme days delta offer
churning,not_removed,fml i just applied for this a week ago and now amex wont honor this offer does anyone if amex would typically honor these
churning,not_removed,they usually do this every june now theyre doing it again barely months after the latest high bonus either amex is desperate in the wake of losing costcostarwood or there is a massive devaluation of skymiles coming if thats even possible lol
churning,not_removed,remindme days delta offer
churning,not_removed,cant figure out if hundo is time thing or once per calendar year
churning,not_removed,remindme one week delta offer
churning,not_removed,do i go with this or the chase sapphire preffered credit card just looking for the best airline rewards
churning,not_removed,can i upgrade my gold to plat and get the bonus i want this but my gold is years old so i dont want to cancel it
churning,not_removed,if i have the delta gold can i move up to platinum and take advantage of this edit got it also got it thanks for the info
churning,not_removed,can you get both this card and the regular delta
churning,not_removed,statement credit is for delta charges only can it be gift cards really tempted to get this and the gold card for quick delta miles ill never be under omg
churning,not_removed,can you get this if you have the delta gold
churning,not_removed,whats the importance of the mqm
churning,not_removed,so i plan on cancelling the card before the af can i transfer the points somewhere else if i dont plan on using them within a year sorry im a noob
churning,not_removed,im holding out for drunkamexchick
churning,not_removed,yes includes statement credit as well its normally incognito i believe
churning,not_removed,looks like the highest mqms as well for this card when combined with other delta cards you should easily get silver status
churning,not_removed,meaning you can get credit cards in days but no more correct
churning,not_removed,amex plat is definitely on my list but then the problem becomes whether to apply for this delta card or get the spg offer essentially marriott points before while it lasts
churning,not_removed,its a nice touch but with a free mr earning card everyday and transfers it also wouldnt be too hard to refresh the balance
churning,not_removed,yeah this might be enough for me to get it ive stayed off the delta cc train since i have the st delta debit card to keep my balance growing
churning,not_removed,i just got it pretty sweet work said theyll pay the fee for me at the end of the year so fuckin eh my wife and i are trying to get to italy on pointscash so this will go a long way
churning,not_removed,if you pc or cancel after a year do you get to keep the skymiles if you havent already used them
churning,not_removed,i say wait its only another week supposedly
churning,not_removed,was a little salty about missing the extra skypesos but then realized that the min spend was less with the offer this is a great deal especially as a public offer however
churning,not_removed,same
churning,not_removed,im actually wondering the same thing ill hit of spend on my plat in to get the bonus mqm but what if statement closes in jan
churning,not_removed,if you are at least silver the mqms roll over so it doesnt matter but yea closing next year should give you bonus for next year
churning,not_removed,they let you close one while you are on the phone with them this is from experience the rep told me is the limit and i would need to choose to close to get this approved i chose one to close rep closed it and approved me with the exact same cl as the one i closed no need to cancel beforehand unless you are looking to get instaapproved
churning,not_removed,good lord whats your credit score
churning,not_removed,the real question is are and the mqm worth cuz theres a gold with no fee on spend as well
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,any other dps about what triggers the credit purchases from deltacom gift cards or otherwise
churning,not_removed,do you have a link to the business plat thanks
churning,not_removed,might as well include the httpwwwdeltacomcontentwwwenusskymilesearnmilesearnmileswithpartnerscreditcardpartnersbusinesscreditcardshtmlplatinum
churning,not_removed,unlikely
churning,not_removed,amexs lifetime rule reportedly looks back about years to see if youve gotten the card before
churning,not_removed,there are no no fee delta cards that you can pc into i think some people have had luck pcing to the no fee hilton card but not sure if that is still allowed i dont think it is
churning,not_removed,extra spend is not insignificant though
churning,not_removed,ewr is tricky since its pretty much a ua fortress hub if youre willing to trek to jfk which is a dl hub youd have more options
churning,not_removed,delta offers enough flights out of ewr in addition to jfk being a hub below lga is also a decent east coast domestic hub
churning,not_removed,depending on how early you book i was doing some testing on a trip to ath and it had rt biz class at peak time
churning,not_removed,i thought the same thing im trying book a honeymoon trip to europe and having a hard time getting much benefit out of my
churning,not_removed,not very expensive very bad o class space released
churning,not_removed,no saver award is roundtrip in business after the recent devaluation aa is as is ua partners on ua are also roundtrip the delta awards were ok at roundtrip but now that they are devaluing is still bearable the hard part is finding availability
churning,not_removed,same here maybe tomorrow
churning,not_removed,totally agree their award pricing opacity is a major turnoff i only fly them if its an unreal deal cash economy fare and have no interest in earning delta pts
churning,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of days to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
churning,not_removed,exactly why i am trying to churn and burn despite my natural instinct to hoard mountains of miles
churning,not_removed,counts for biz card as well
churning,not_removed,yes business cards too but only credit cards not charge cards so you could get charge cards like prg green gold plat etc within the day timeframe but in terms of these delta cards you should choose one or the other
churning,not_removed,you dont get any benefits of the platinum card priority pass dl sky club access etc with this card this delta card doesnt provide even free sky club access essentially this is a delta card that just happens to have platinum in the name
churning,not_removed,no the regular amex platinum has many more perks than this card if i were you and not looking to churn i would get the chase sapphire reserve with the bonus
churning,not_removed,from what i heard you can only get approved for one amex credit card per day
churning,not_removed,wasnt the public offer high than before this new offer came out why upgrade instead of opening a new card
churning,not_removed,if she is just short of plat and her expected travel for next year is the same as this year she might want to consider staying gold this will give her a big rollover next year making plat much easier to reach
churning,not_removed,no im sorry but you can never receive a delta plat bonus
churning,not_removed,unfortunately not thats why you should never upgrade or downgrade unless you have gotten the bonus before on the card you downgrade to now there are some datapoints for example where people who had gotten a lower bonus in the past are given the difference to the current bonus when they reapply but these are all exceptions you cant count on that happening and its pretty unlikely the oncealifetime rule at amex is extremely firm and inflexible
churning,not_removed,it really depends on your travel goals are you delta hub captive do you fly united or southwest more figure out where you want to gohow you want to get there and then decide on your cards and order of application remember the chase rule amex delta cards are easy approvals ur earning cards are not for those of us who have been doing this awhile
churning,not_removed,upgrading from your gold shouldnt get you the bonus but you can always apply for the plat separately to get the bonus
churning,not_removed,no doing a product change does not qualify you for a new signup bonus
churning,not_removed,also curious i had a targeted email before about an upgrade but at or so
churning,not_removed,dont upgrade you need to apply for the new card to get the bonus
churning,not_removed,gold yes
churning,not_removed,yes you can also combine a personal and business card
churning,not_removed,any delta purchase will trigger the entire credit doesnt matter if you buy a gift card or just a drink on board
churning,not_removed,yup different products
churning,not_removed,you dont lose delta miles for canceling the card delta miles never expire i think you are confused with amex mr points this card is for delta miles not mr
churning,not_removed,i would advise against cancelling the card to avoid the annual fee thats a good way to get blacklisted by amex hold the card for a year then cancel then you might find it helpful to start by reading these httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiindex
churning,not_removed,whats the back story on this
churning,not_removed,curious what are the best targeted offers for this card
churning,not_removed,what about mqds im like from gold but these cards arent going to help that are they
churning,not_removed,yes that is the max they allow
churning,not_removed,charge cards dont count so if the rumored is a plat revamp you can get both the spg and the delta
churning,not_removed,its not really since amex charges mr excise fee for every miles you transfer but yeah your point remains
churning,not_removed,dumb question but if you link that debit card to google wallet and send a friend money do you get the sky miles im thinking no since the terms say must be pin point of sale would be an interesting data point to try could get you miles per year
churning,not_removed,ah true thanks man
churning,not_removed,it could matter just in between gold for one year vs silver for two years for example
churning,not_removed,thanks for the data point good sir
churning,not_removed,does a business card count as part of the credit card limit
churning,not_removed,midhigh ive had cards in months tho
churning,not_removed,if you fly delta a lot those extra mqm are worth a lot to you especially if youre close to the next medallion status
churning,not_removed,also would be good to go for this card if you already have gotten the delta gold card since you cant get the delta gold card bonus a second time with this public offer and i figure the credit makes it equivalent to fee
churning,not_removed,what about both am i able to get the platinum even though i got the gold a few months ago on a
churning,not_removed,get the plats first is rare for gold has been available via incognito or public offer for a while
churning,not_removed,what are mqm good for i have tried to look into it but i couldnt figure it out
churning,not_removed,the gold has bee around for at least years so many people have already got it this is decent if youre out of options to get the gold personally im sitting on delta miles from the gold personal and business and this is an offer worth considering
churning,not_removed,where are you seeing with no fee i only see the af waived first year and then
churning,not_removed,tbh if youre interested in the skymiles youd eventually end up getting both signup bonuses thanks to almost unchurnable amex
churning,not_removed,docs article about amex cards says that you can skip the af if you cancel within one statement period of the af posting
churning,not_removed,in beer at the delta lounge
churning,not_removed,i get cpp easily with delta
churning,not_removed,i hear gc purchases dont
churning,not_removed,httpwwwdeltacomcontentwwwenusskymilesearnmilesearnmileswithpartnerscreditcardpartnersbusinesscreditcardshtmlplatinum
churning,not_removed,its right in the personal page on delta too
churning,not_removed,im going to call them and see if im eligible for the bonus if not i wont activate the card and thus save the annual fee ill let the group know what i find out
churning,not_removed,that may just be the current timeframe due to their last major database update though who knows what will be implemented in years
churning,not_removed,gotcha thanks for that warning i fly united almost exclusively wouldnt want the dead weight of this card on my conscience
churning,not_removed,lga is probably just as inconvenient depending on whether or not he is very close to the belt or gwb
churning,not_removed,check out jfklhr typically very good availability
churning,not_removed,thanks for confirming it makes it way more difficult when trying to fly the family in style
churning,not_removed,ok thanks for the info i have not seen a biz class flight for yet for any dates i checked on delta
churning,not_removed,my only issue with the csr is they wont waive the annual fee for me under scra im going to wait to hear what amex announces in october regardless but just trying to do my due diligence
churning,not_removed,i got approved for two in one day even in recon
churning,not_removed,like i said i wasnt thinking getting a new card or an upgrade wasnt even on my mind but i logged into my account and the upgrade offer popped up and i just go yeah why not took all of seconds then i go to the web page and see that yes the public offer was higher at not happy to say the least
churning,not_removed,what does ur earning cards mean
churning,not_removed,thank you for the dp i am definitely going to do that haha one whiskey please for dollars
churning,not_removed,no im just not familiar with these so where do the delta miles go if i close the card
churning,not_removed,chick who worked for amex offered to blow me if i held off on applying to this until after i told her to fuck off this spending bonus aint gonna ms itself
churning,not_removed,i think i saw one with not sure about what the minimum spend was or statement bonus
churning,not_removed,s like the highest mqms as well for this card when combined with other delta cards you should easily get silver status you can but itll take of spending httpwwwdeltacomcontentwwwenusskymilesmedallionprogrammedallionqualificationdollarshtml
churning,not_removed,hoping its a charge card thenotherwise im sol
churning,not_removed,wow i opened a credit and charge simultaneously on thats pretty luck with the likely release date
churning,not_removed,new one charge hopefully amex plat charge amex gold charge delta gold credit delta plat credit spg credit if i do it right i can get two credits and two charges right now i just gotta decide what i want haha just filled out my so time to look at mr and top up my skypesos
churning,not_removed,im not sure never tried it i stick to just buying money orders miles a month for is pretty solid plus the annual fee of course i think people on ft reported not getting miles for taxes and venmo but could be remembering wrong
churning,not_removed,engineering we travel several times a year for workconferences so its cheaper for them to let us carry our on cards and use concur
churning,not_removed,the card rule is not strictly enforced most people with cards like me have one of the everyday cards i havent seen enough dp on that though to draw a conclusion
churning,not_removed,yea true i gunned for plat last year and picked the skymiles in hindsight i should have either nabbed the upgrade certificates or just stayed gold to roll over a ton of mqms
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,am i right to assume mqm counts only in the calendar year so this will last you for a few months before the counter resets in
churning,not_removed,you can get the business gold offer thats public right now same as personal one i believe
churning,not_removed,yes two separate cardsproducts
churning,not_removed,mqm will get you to various levels of status see their page httpwwwdeltacomcontentwwwenusskymilesmedallionprogrammedallionqualificationdollarshtml for more info
churning,not_removed,thats what i meant its free in my eyes cause it would be a churn and burn
churning,not_removed,meta as fuck
churning,not_removed,you can easily get more with international firstbusiness but award tickets are very limited
churning,not_removed,looks like gc purchases on deltacom do but it might be ymmv more details
churning,not_removed,what makes you think not activating the card will save you from being charged the af say nothing for the fact that amex cards dont need to be activated
churning,not_removed,of course everything changes but this is the currently reported time frame for successful circumvention of their one bonus per lifetime policy
churning,not_removed,this sort of storage costs money im sure there a point where keeping old information just isnt worth the trouble and expense well i hope
churning,not_removed,can always cancel
churning,not_removed,with scra its a nobrainer basically you should get every single amex there is you just have to spread them out to meet the ms as you said you should wait until next week to see what the announcement is but if you can work the ms between that one and this one id jump on it i got this one with and the mb platinum with on the same day a few months ago and had no problem meeting the spend literally everything but rent goes on them
churning,not_removed,which two cards was it two credit cards two charge cards one of each
churning,not_removed,ultimate rewards flexible currency the delta amex only earns skymiles not flexible but you can use for partner awards
churning,not_removed,the miles will stay in your delta account they dont go anywhere the miles arent tied to the card
churning,not_removed,this story is getting better every day
churning,not_removed,seriously is amex really putting that much pressure on their reps to get customers not to take their deals
churning,not_removed,yeah i dont spend that much and gold status isnt exactly the best way to spend that money but thanks
churning,not_removed,sorry this product is definitely a credit card not a charge card edit was referring to the delta card not the theoretical tba product whoops
churning,not_removed,charge cards dont count
churning,not_removed,more like unlimited charge cards ive seen some that got like cards in a day charges and credit
churning,not_removed,haha so youre already maxing that thing out nice you seem like the minority around here haha everyone hates deltas program i have miles from work so im thinking about ways to top up
churning,not_removed,i didnt even know this existed
churning,not_removed,none of the cards of yours are charge cards
churning,not_removed,unless you have status already then whatever youve earned this year above your threshold rolls over to next year so if you have mqms this year and sign up for this card youd have youd then roll over to
churning,not_removed,its years usually
churning,not_removed,i would not do it though in between the gold and plat you can get years of free checked bags if you stretch out personal and business
churning,not_removed,lol i agree
churning,not_removed,storage got really really cheap per tb
churning,not_removed,two credit cards sorry delta gold personal and spg personal
churning,not_removed,were talking amex not wells fargo there was a story posted on here a few days ago some user saying he met a chick who worked for amex at the bar and she claimed axp was rolling out something special on
churning,not_removed,most people who fly delta enough to benefit from the status have higher status anyways may be a good way to boost status by one tier if otherwise you would just reach gold if you fly delta enough for upgrades the amount of mqm earned in the current year is part of their algorithm for upgrade priority i believe the credit card mqm count towards that
churning,not_removed,how do you know
churning,not_removed,ah thanks
churning,not_removed,aw sweet ive really been eyeing up spg points because of marriott the night marriott southwest package looks like a cool way to get a sw companion pass when over costs marriott tho
churning,not_removed,no the other are
churning,not_removed,thanks i thought i remember reading that you had to have status for it to stick im in deltaland but currently dont have status so this card is a nogo for me
churning,not_removed,this is true i personally dont check bags though because the overwhelming anxiety i get at the thought of getting my bags stolen or lost is enough to cripple me i swear im not attached to my things but going on vacation and having to buy all new things at a resort i would rather smack myself in the face then pay those kinds of prices
churning,not_removed,dang good work thats a solid dp
churning,not_removed,thats an odd question because its clearly categorized that way on amexs website for one httpswwwamericanexpresscomuscreditcards charge cards are green gold platinum prg their business and cobrand equivalents eg mercedes benz edit apologies if i misunderstood your comment umanusbaldspot uroofeeoh is correct i was indeed referring to the delta card
churning,not_removed,i agree the marriott package somehow boosted the value of spg points even more id go for spgs over deltas as its highly likely that this offer will return but the fate of spg is at risk and id personally try to harvest starpoints before the easiest way of obtaining them is gone
churning,not_removed,yes you need to have status for them to roll over if you just get mqms as a base medallion member nothing rolls over you also get shafted if youre a segments flier like me i qualify for status on segments due to lots of short trips segments dont roll over
churning,not_removed,if you call your airline and are nice yet demanding they will reimburse you up to reasonable levels your new macbook charger is at the apple store well if you need it for work just turn in the receipt
churning,not_removed,yup i dont know if it was just luck or what it actually wasnt even recon but i applied for both simultaneously and they both went into pending i called in because i really wanted the spg and was hoping i could say well as long as i get the spg ill be happy but the csr got them both to me and expedited them even
churning,not_removed,haha no worries i just thought you had some insider info for a second i was referring to the new mystery card it very well could be a credit card guess well just have to wait and see
churning,not_removed,if i opened green and gold in august would i be okay or does it depend on the date
churning,not_removed,yea good call im gonna cross my fingers for the new amex and hopefully get that and the spg should keep me busy for a while if im still hungry ill get delta plat and then cool my jets until im able to get delta gold
churning,not_removed,im not sure what you mean about the macbook charger but i didnt know that airlines reimburse you for lost luggage good to know
churning,not_removed,legit haha were the hard inquiries combined
churning,not_removed,no inside intel here but im waiting until after to pull the trigger too so ill cross my fingers that any new product is a charge card as well hoping to capitalize on this and finally jump on spg while i can still earn points instead of stays then again i guess id also be happy if they just buffed my plat maybe id actually keep it if not sorry amex csr wins
churning,not_removed,keep the churning train going you have a solid plan if you can meet spending toss in one or more charge cards every time you app for a revolving card
churning,not_removed,just wanted to say that if your luggage is delayed there is lots of leeway for airline reps to make calls on the level of reimbursement
churning,not_removed,i havent seen them post yet ill try to remember and let you know
churning,not_removed,haha yea buddy its hard to say no to all the points i hit both csp csr in about two months but i made sure i had one before getting the other getting amexs at the same time is definitely a lot to commit to but work trips tend to make things easy in addition i will be starting down the path of opening canceling i havent ever canceled a card yet im not saying its a bad thing but its just something new for me side note umanusbaldspot reports getting credit cards no charge cards in the same day heres my current lineup i just completed the cspcsfu process everyday spend whatever my next card is fu where applicable csr freedom discover it drawer citi double cash quicksilver might as well post up my approximate point balances while im at it lol ur coming soon once csr hits american delta southwest spirit united thanks mpx ihg marriott so is against getting new cards but has somewhere around marriott delta a small amount of hilton a shitload of enterprise
churning,not_removed,you already have a huge chunk of delta you certainly will enjoy the gravy train of mr spg is also a really good everyday spend card for the cpp value of starpoints and i also constantly mix between fu and spg for noncategorical spending goldgreen cards incognito offers with spend are easy to meet with some ms options like plastiq or square and add to a sizable balance good luck
churning,not_removed,thanks it looks like i have more than enough points currently to have a nice honeymoon next year problem is that ill have a lot less points after that haha so time to build up higher in preparation for the big drain and yea now that i have a good handle on ur its time to take a peek at mr
churning,not_removed,i just tried this and did not get credit i ordered an uber with quicksilver as the default card midway in the ride i changed it to my csr in my payments it does not show me having an extra rides for the quicksilver bonus
churning,not_removed,interesting uber is also changing the promotion a little bit instead of a ride token it is now a credit that can be used over multiple rides
churning,not_removed,sweet thanks for the psa
churning,not_removed,this is pretty cool if true does it work on pool
churning,not_removed,i wish i knew this before i wonder if theyll close this loophole anytime soon
churning,not_removed,where can you change the payment after ordering the uber
churning,not_removed,awesome love earning spg points with this so even if i redeem amex mrs then i will still get the ride free as long as i do the first one on qs
churning,not_removed,ditto one hour ago can op or someone please clarify the sequence of steps needed for this to work
churning,not_removed,i got an email today regarding the change starting november youll get in uber credits – instead of a free ride token valued at up to – every time you pay for rides with your capital one quicksilver or quicksilverone® card through march unlike the previously earned free ride tokens valued at up to your in uber credits can be used on multiple rides at any time through april for example if you have in uber credits and use them for a ride you will have an uber credits balance of available for redemption on your next ride in addition any free ride tokens youve yet to use before november will be automatically converted into in uber credits each just be sure to use your credits before they expire on april
churning,not_removed,on csr what is timeframe in which to switch during ride just went back to my rides and cant change nothing albeit last one was a week ago spanks
churning,not_removed,this was a big improvement for me my average uber ride is about so i was just holding credits waiting for an expensive trip or worse taking a more expensive trip because i have the credit now instead ill get three free rides every ten paid rides
churning,not_removed,thats a huge improvement this means youre always realizing the full credit
churning,not_removed,so do you need to call it with the quicksilver then change payment mid ride or something
churning,not_removed,so if i am understanding you start it on the quicksilver and switch it what would you switch it to to get this double benefit sidenote cant wait till and uber credit card would be cool if it gives a reimbursement on uber rides maybe like a month d
churning,not_removed,oh god are you saying you essentially contact customer service via the help section to change payment each time
churning,not_removed,the way i read it was pay for the first one with quicksilver which starts the rides count but pay for the remaining rides with any other card
churning,not_removed,haha sounds awful
churning,not_removed,there was another reply here that was deleted but that person said she switched their payment method times so far theres no other dps other than ops

churning,not_removed,hi all i have both the amex plat as well as the chase ritz carlton card my dilemma is that both cards are soon up for renewal and ideally id like to only keep one of them right now the plat gives instant gold status for spg hotels which converts to marriott gold status with the ritz card you must spend on the card in order to get this benefit usually not a problem but still worth mentioning with the recent move of spg to marriottchase do you in the foreseeable future see amex loosing the benefit of spg gold status i ask because this is a big benefit to me and would prefer to only have card that gives me this status thank you

churning,not_removed,in general some people are so sheltered against doing anything against the norm they just cant fathom doing such a thing i have a friend who has never had a credit card in fact he doesnt even exist in the credit bureaus after years of me talking about credit cards telling him the benefits he finally got his first card maybe well do some churning in a few years i crave learning through new experiences like churning others get scared just keep in mind that if you do plan to apply for a mortgage lay of the the sign up activity for a few months
churning,not_removed,ignorance tends to manifest as fear you have the knowledge they dont theyre scared youre not the whos right question pretty much answers itself when you think about it like that
churning,not_removed,i wouldnt worry about them lack of information which is common my wife and i have been churning for two years just bought our first home last september with no issue getting a mortgage and bought a new car yesterday financed the whole thing in both cases the lenders were just happy seeing high scores for me for her with lowno card balances
churning,not_removed,to play devils advocate theres a chance that your friends are right we dont know whats going to happen in the future maybe the credit scoring model will change in years or banks will blacklist churners but i think its unlikely that theyll lock out churners from getting mortgages partly because the banks goal is to make money and being a credit card churner doesnt reduce the banks profit from a mortgage
churning,not_removed,did they give you a family intervention yet
churning,not_removed,send them pics of you in the caribbean along with your credit score
churning,not_removed,good luck metalcardmasterrace
churning,not_removed,are pre approvals for the csr back or are you under
churning,not_removed,thanks for this datapoint i posted yesterday because i am in a similar situation with aus putting me over hoping i get lucky
churning,not_removed,congrats ink card world if you use it right send off sm for match
churning,not_removed,real business or a business
churning,not_removed,surprising considering the csrs at citi especially seem to almost always know what theyre talking about
churning,not_removed,happened to me too got bonus letter this weekend showing im still going to call and ask for match to
churning,not_removed,i applied for this myself then a month later applied for my wife both apps under ssn and hers was auto denied
churning,not_removed,yes they are
churning,not_removed,alist is very nice on southwest i rarely have a boarding number lower than
churning,not_removed,what did your flying habits look like last year
churning,not_removed,same i wonder how widely this has even offered i rarely fly southwest and wouldnt be able to take advantage of cp so this offer is kind of lost on me
churning,not_removed,congrats would you mind telling us when you met the spend and when your bonus points posted thanks
churning,not_removed,contact the owner directly and negotiate a discount
churning,not_removed,airbnb coded as travel for me with the sapphire reserve so you have that card you could get ur points dollar net on that
churning,not_removed,wow thats shitty i had no issues with receiving the bonus while owning other amex cards hope this helps you
churning,not_removed,getting this stamped out is more important than new apps during this period you should just call in if you want to apply so they can do all the verifications on the phone w you and you dont waste a hard pull
churning,not_removed,change your email password first set up where you can do so
churning,not_removed,dont worry its just their new way of opening accounts to pad their stats haha
churning,not_removed,call wells fargo and check all the information on your account to make sure it matches your actual details
churning,not_removed,you wont have to cancel your original flight you should be able to just add a companion to your existing flight once you get the cp if there are seats available
churning,not_removed,look at booking hotels through southwest sometimes you can find a booking that gets you a few thousand rapid rewards
churning,not_removed,did you have any balance when checking out if so what and how much
churning,not_removed,yeah lolliterally cannot find anything decent
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,ouch ive already established myself as the guy thats willing to pay with my card and have everybody just pay me either cash venmo quickpay etc to make things easier whenever i eat outwith friends they always thank me afterwards and i want to respond with no thank you
churning,not_removed,call back and request them to fix it if they arent charging af and account showing just access means you definitely got the wrong card
churning,not_removed,is the link unique if you dont mind sharing id be curious to try it im sure it probably wont work but its worth a shot
churning,not_removed,wow i wonder why send that my way
churning,not_removed,better yet doesnt anyone know how to prevent these from filling up your order history
churning,not_removed,i just bought mine at a selfowned small store amazing price and all on the amex biz plat
churning,not_removed,i bought mine the same day the csr leak occurred missed out on some spend
churning,not_removed,looks like around est based on some of the older point break release times
churning,not_removed,according to this post looks like the last working links died on
churning,not_removed,nope
churning,not_removed,you dont actually need the card as long as you are approved you can use it when you return to the us
churning,not_removed,the card is only needed if you can crossing borders by land if you are flying then everything is connected to your known traveler number
churning,not_removed,the global entry card is not what you want or need its practically useless you will get an email with your global entry ktn pretty much as soon as youre approved i got my number mins after the interview
churning,not_removed,i received my ktn at the end of my interview at jfk i received the card one week later but as someone mentioned you only need the card when land or seaport borders
churning,not_removed,how can you find out about walk in availability
churning,not_removed,the general consensus is to pick up the spg cards if you dont have them keep at least one if you do the marriott card has value on its own asis due to the free night and since it is under you should probably hold on to it as well until the combined starriott decides what theyre going to do with the programs
churning,not_removed,short answer is i would keep the card since you dont know what changes will happen to it in the future long answer is that my guess is that neither chase nor american express will be able to justify paying what it will cost them to get exclusivity on the combined marriott credit cards so i think they will both continue to have marriott cards the part im less sure about is whether they roll spg into marriott rewards or if they keep them separate programs you could make an argument that they will roll them in since spg doesnt have the brand cache that ritz does so it doesnt need its own program you could also make an argument to combine all three programs into marriott rewards and reduce maintenance costs
churning,not_removed,i would keep it since the card pays for itself and like you saidwould have a hard time reacquiring late on
churning,not_removed,its a very common strategy with many dps of it working
churning,not_removed,this often but not always works be sure to clear cookies or use incognito sometimes chase loses an application if you do back to back without clearing cookies
churning,not_removed,make sure the united app is approved first and use a different browser for the second app
churning,not_removed,in the same boat with nm alaska miles gone at least we have comfort in knowing we still have the amex credit for each gift card if u used the amex offers
churning,not_removed,i did tcp purchases first one went to pending and one was declined right away crossing my fingers on the pending one
churning,not_removed,new orders via tcb are showing up as while old ones show up as pending
churning,not_removed,no referrals afaik only affiliate links pick your favorite blogger and support them with a click
churning,not_removed,generally booking through thirdparty websites does not count towards programspoints you might be able to link your account number by callingemailing the front desk or during checkin or attaching it when you book your reservation but thats up to the customer representative bonus points are not issued for nonqualifying room rates or nonqualifying stays nonqualifying room rates or nonqualifying stay include the following any stay at a kimpton hotel net wholesale individual and group rate certain package rates employee discount rate friends and family rate crew rate special discounted contract rates seasonal workercrew rate travel club discount rate travel industry discount rate distressed passenger rate ihg® rewards club reward nightsairline hotel reward rate rates booked through third party web sites complimentary hotel stays and any other rates not defined as a qualifying room rate at ihgs sole discretion
churning,not_removed,do u mean book with points or cash or both i recently booked flights thru citi typ portal using points and cash i received additional points for the cash potion but no additional points for the points i redeemed i dont know about the ihg program hope this helps
churning,not_removed,discover was far from overlooked just over a year ago when they were giving on apple pay along with double cash back for first year
churning,not_removed,its cardmember you can get the double cash back on multiple cards
churning,not_removed,second time today that someone has said their points were available immediately i was approved for the match but the points were not made available
churning,not_removed,mine was taken back last week
churning,not_removed,they clawed back my points from the ua portal as well edit for the downvoters as and ua portals are run by the same backend company cartera
churning,not_removed,congrats and good data point i also thought i read somewhere on here that if you dont live close to a chase branch theyll honor the offer even using the link as long as u get approved ymmv i would confirm via sm before trying this though
churning,not_removed,works fine for me
churning,not_removed,mine is down too its only from a computer mobile works fine
churning,not_removed,i had to try multiple times on mobile and at their website they seem to be having issues this morning but once logged in everything seems alright
churning,not_removed,definitely some issues this morning httpdowndetectorcomstatuschase
churning,not_removed,yes website issues for me
churning,not_removed,some of my cards are showing not available while some show the normal info ur site is very slow or nonresponsive
churning,not_removed,grats sm for a match to
churning,not_removed,there is no delay excluding a delay of approximately months what dont you understand
churning,not_removed,i got the same answer the other day at least they seem to be on the same page it was explained as account opening date days weeks is the maximum
churning,not_removed,i just logged in for kicks and i only have two of my three i know at least one bank has previously reallocated credit without asking as part of an approval and i bet they took one of mine away when i got the merrill
churning,not_removed,yep just like grandpa
churning,not_removed,i missed the last round because i wasnt quite ready to meet minimum spends and now i find myself checking times a day
churning,not_removed,as of last wednesday and about a dozen huca tries the cash rewards card at least two or three reps told me they specifically couldnt pc that card to the bbr
churning,not_removed,there are numerous dps of people pcing the mlb cards
churning,not_removed,got the same two cards weeks ago and both were overnighted i would love to know what determines the shipping type because it is completely random from what i have seen posted before
churning,not_removed,glad to hear someone else sees the benefit of keeping these accounts open beyond the bonus
churning,not_removed,i received my prg on saturday from the incognito special you should get it today
churning,not_removed,thanks for the info i was planning on waiting for the real debit card but not if its going to take that long i guess ill be heading in branch for a temp as well
churning,not_removed,awesome thanks for the update i just checked looks like i got mine this morning too i was really expecting it to take at least a month saves me a second time having to run more debit card transactions through
churning,not_removed,capital one capone formerly ing shut down my checking savings account for no reason well that seems unlikely given that you posted this to rchurning whatever i dont really care well thats good xd
churning,not_removed,there isnt much difference between co bank and they just never merged it after cap one purchased ing if you want higher interest head over to ally or take a look at httpwwwdoctorofcreditcomhighinterestsavingstoget list
churning,not_removed,sit tight for the i think they are federally required to send out by the end of the month aka tomorrow im pretty sure you can contest their value as well but i dont know how worthwhile it is to bother
churning,not_removed,they dont need to send out until as i recall so you might not receive it until midfebruary i would use the valuation from contests httpssecureflyaacommilesformilestonespromoover
churning,not_removed,iirc they havent issued for miles in some time you would use your redemption amount as the taxable amount but if you didnt use them then you have to value them some other way i am currently valuing mine at per point due to risk of forfeiture the irs doesnt give a shit about my points
churning,not_removed,amex hands out business cards like candy the most youll have to do is call in to prove its you who applied
churning,not_removed,amex is really easy you shouldnt have any problems i was auto approved for amex business gold and platinum no phone calls required if you are under i would get the ink preferred as well
churning,not_removed,on auto approval for multiple business cards platinum and blue for business no worries with amex
churning,not_removed,yes ive gotten status benefits from stays even when person with status is not the one who books but ymmv
churning,not_removed,you might get some responsesreviews for the hotel but flyertalk generally has pretty decent review threads for most hotels
churning,not_removed,chance that you will add your name and gp to the reservation show your card at check in
churning,not_removed,days
churning,not_removed,not yet dp opened account on dd on via capone ach
churning,not_removed,you should get a letter with the reason for denial
churning,not_removed,was not enrolled in the mr program not sure what that means my so applied for the thanksgiving amex plat leak and it was her first amex and she received the bonus maybe huca or call that number they gave please report back
churning,not_removed,i cant help but i know some corporate cards arent enrolled in mr automatically maybe the csr was confused
churning,not_removed,reminds me that i got a weird snail mail for my green card telling me it had automatically enrolled on my existing mr account and that i will receive the card soon got that letter the day after i received the card didnt get anything like that for any other card including the gold for which i applied on the same day as the green and both the gold and green seem to be linked to my mr account as for the thanksgiving plat i did get my bonus quickly still frozen though edit eventually got the same letter for the gold card
churning,not_removed,i called them and they applied a generic bonus to mine x achs have to followup with them to make sure but theyll apply it give that a shot
churning,not_removed,congrats i would still make sure to meet the min spend by the specified date to avoid any claw backs
churning,not_removed,what was the language you used the second time around
churning,not_removed,curious to know what u said was it sm or phone ive tried twice now thru sm asking for a match but denied both times first time they said i would get pts second time they said was an in branch offer and i would get im now waiting to meet minimum spend and then gonna try again
churning,not_removed,shit its already sold out for every friday and saturday for the entire pointbreak season crazy because i was checking the website every minutes waiting for the promo to start it kept saying points then the next thing you know it was sold out
churning,not_removed,called mango and they said the max ach per hours is
churning,not_removed,have a few questions if you dont mind which card did you pc from and how long have you had the card edit thanks for the dps
churning,not_removed,yes it works
churning,not_removed,yes ive bought costco gift cards with my discover this month and they coded correctly for bonus on statement
churning,not_removed,not since november
churning,not_removed,i got it this month i sm initially after the approval november and was told they will match saying reply to this sm once you meet the spend requirements i organically spent by end of december and sent sm which was denied stating i need to be cpc or account should qualify sent more sms but got same response so i called and spoke with a rep who said he will open a case and i will get mail if they match but no guarantees after couple of days i saw points and got a snail mail a week later
churning,not_removed,youll want it to be a charge card amex wont approve credit cards on the same day and per doc theyll pull your cr again when they review the second app after the day waiting period
churning,not_removed,i still enjoyed the cake even if i couldnt have the icing
churning,not_removed,doesnt one of the cards have a rebate on redemption which card did you have
churning,not_removed,if the transaction shows up as gift card then whoever at chase is reviewing that when you request the credit will know and wont reimburse you
churning,not_removed,yeh is way too much for that
churning,not_removed,its hilarious that he thinks southwest miles are worth cpp
churning,not_removed,american express platinum or csr you are very unlikely to be targeted for this offer if you are already an amex customer so it makes sense to start here for at least your first amex not both at the same time because that wastes all of the duplicated benefits that could be stretched over years after one of those id go for as many cards in the points program as i could accumulating as many mr or ur points as possible so id grab a gold amex everyday preferred etc or id grab a csp ink preferred freedom or freedom unlimited but in my opinion the sw companion pass is one of the most valuable deals for anybody who likes to travel domestically the redemptions are dead easy and your companion is almost free the free cancellation on points flights makes spontaneous trips a nobrainer
churning,not_removed,csr ihg love that anniversary night anywhere and i fear it will go away arrival establish barclays chase southwest business perfect for cp chase southwest plus finish the cp i personally get by far the most value out of wn given i have a family and dont fly international with them yet
churning,not_removed,so i just started i got the csr and now i am picking up all the good chase business cards before i even consider any personal cards once i have exhausted that list i am going to get the csp and possibly the amex edp as my daily i have come to terms with the fact that to properly churn i am going to have to go way beyond but the sooner the better i think now is a pretty good time with the csr bonus dropping and having full pick of the litter i cant see missing out of much for the next years that being said i really hope chase launches an ink reserve before i go over i have actual business spending and that card could be amazing for me
churning,not_removed,interesting thought experiment csr dining is my biggest spend category amex biz plat domestic airfare at hotel status amex edp to keep a healthy balance in that mr account ink pref bonus then change to ink cash for steady on phoneinternet bills some hotel card either the citi hilton because i stay a few times a year for work or hyatt for the annual free night so in the end i have just chase cards if you count the hyatt which isnt under anyway after getting this base i would just work my way through bonuses
churning,not_removed,thats nearly in a year over a week if you havent done ms before i suspect that youre going to be scaling a steep steep mountain and i say that as someone who doesnt even ms myself have you done this before
churning,not_removed,why not ms one of them and then status match
churning,not_removed,i hope you know your money order providers real well
churning,not_removed,depends on your spend history for example i put on my amex plat on a weekly basis so its relatively easy to ms on that card the cards you mentioned are from different providers so youve got that going for you the only problem you may run into is it will likely take you months to complete in order to avoid fr or shutdown
churning,not_removed,how valuable to you is it realistically to have and get value out of all of those statuses
churning,not_removed,yeah citi is very querysensitive dont waste your time
churning,not_removed,youre not going to win this one
churning,not_removed,you have to call to get it book cant do it online
churning,not_removed,ive actually just come back from a night stay at the hyatt zilara in cancun last week it was worth the pointsfree nights i called the platinum reservations number i got on my hyatt platinum loyalty card not really sure if that made a difference and booked those nights with the agent over the phone one night at a time i reserved these nights maybe months out again it was an incredible property and an amazing experience maria marie was my favorite restaurant and the bar next to it had incredible craft mezcal cocktails try to weasel your way into getting on standby for chefs plate cant book the restaurant without being in a superdeluxeridiculous suite course menu
churning,not_removed,which caed and what point redemption through a shopping portal
churning,not_removed,i booked hyatt all inclusive jamaica and you have to call cancun is i think jamaica is for people per person additionally
churning,not_removed,but does the metal card still work for in person swipes
churning,not_removed,same here like instantly too im planning on doing it every time theres a new offer even if im not targeted
churning,not_removed,me too every single time every single restaurant milan la nyc chicago sf if its on opentable i can book it myself if its an easy get i can make a call the only reason to use them is if they have special access which they absolutely do not im holding my breath for hamilton tix in la because otherwise theyve been utterly useless
churning,not_removed,sounds like next time you should ask for an escort and they might actually be able to help you out
churning,not_removed,hasnt been there for quite a while
churning,not_removed,only available to platinum members
churning,not_removed,interesting analysis but for the costco you have to have a costco membership lots of the country doesnt live near one and cashback can only be redeemed there plus the foreign transaction fee plus youre valuing the priority pass and global entry credit as its not huge but it does have a value for most theres also the signup bonus but im going to assume you meant this for ongoing spend so that shouldnt matter this also assumes ur at and ignores partners finally there is the value of chase sapphire customer service i value that alone at about a year but others may not
churning,not_removed,citi does this kind of stuff all the time through email and saturday i got or through usps classic example is to upgrade hhonors to reserve but you dont get the main reason people sign up for the card free weekend nights anywhere but you do get to pay the upgraded af
churning,not_removed,you need to have a payment due and pay at least the minimum in january february and march to receive the in april
churning,not_removed,earn starpoints® for every dollar of eligible purchases on the card at participating marriott rewards® hotels httpswwwamericanexpresscomuscreditcardscardstarwoodpreferredguest
churning,not_removed,theres another link for the prg google prg change airline and it should come up
churning,not_removed,when you are logging into his amex account the default card is probably the platinum open the side menu choose a different card and then click account benefits and try to change the airline see if that works
churning,not_removed,usually no stay credit but can sometimes get status benefits if add your number at check in
churning,not_removed,party reservations dont count ive never been lucky getting status benefits neither
churning,not_removed,the aviator min spend is what is there to hit
churning,not_removed,same thing happened to me and they said there is a hold on the payment and then it should be reflected on the available credit
churning,not_removed,arent they usually deducted at the time of booking how did you make the booking
churning,not_removed,probably not
churning,not_removed,id wait it out my last two aa applications i waited and days later they got approved
churning,not_removed,for citi you can do the bronze aadvantage or the citi dividend
churning,not_removed,there is a nofee aa bronze card as well
churning,not_removed,believe thats true for new partner cards no expedited shipping
churning,not_removed,congrats on the second biz card chase rejected me for the marriott business already have the ink plus are you under
churning,not_removed,marriott has announced the programs will run independently until at least i dont see them taking any benefits away immediately so plats gold status should stay for at least a year the question seems to comes down to whether you want to stay in ritz morevs spgmarriott if you have week long paid stays at the ritz then that card has specific benefits if you pretty much stay at marriott and spg then plat seems more reasonable if you stay at the sheraton often then the amex spg biz is probably the best deal as it comes with lounge access at the sheraton
churning,not_removed,spg did not move to marriottchase
churning,not_removed,i think there are better arguments to keep the plat than the ritz for me after the first year this ability will go away if amex loses the spg card but im not sure that will happen and if it does itll be in a year at least you can always sign up for the ritz again if this happens
churning,not_removed,with amex plat youre also getting gold at hilton
churning,not_removed,keep in mind amex does not offer price protection
churning,not_removed,definitely amex platinum has refunded me for multiple things with little work on my end contrarily csp made me jump through many hoops for a claim and i ended up giving up amex is the purchase protection king
churning,not_removed,also all cards cover upto only so if you bought a item you eat the balance
churning,not_removed,how much are you moving what is etrade bonus what is fidelity bonus what are fees
churning,not_removed,this is a pretty common occurrence for people who are looking to downgrade their csp i havent seen any dps that indicate people have had trouble product changing their csp to a fcu and receiving the refund of the af within days of the fee being charged also its cfu chase freedom unlimited not fcu
churning,not_removed,all things chase megathread or newbi monday weekly
churning,not_removed,tons of dps about pcing to the nofee cs then the cfcfu the next day
churning,not_removed,no youre good to go after the year has to do with the card act or something
churning,not_removed,generally speaking i think almost nobody got the tracker but ive yet to see anybody not get the bonus plenty of dp of no tracker and bonus
churning,not_removed,yes received points without bonus tracker
churning,not_removed,no activity tracker is fine letter confirming bonus is good youre good to go
churning,not_removed,this is my situation got bonus letter no tracker both bonuses posted got both matched to
churning,not_removed,i didnt have a bonus tracker on my first one but got matched on both
churning,not_removed,i would spend the minimum spend excluding the af else you risk the points being clawed back you wouldnt want to draw attention to your account considering the leaked link
churning,not_removed,i have seen reports in earlier threads of bonus posting i personally have not
churning,not_removed,completed requirementsdd debit transactions on but no bonus yet
churning,not_removed,yes bonuses post on wednesdays ach push from chase hit the account pushed from chase to regions ive read doing an ach pull does not work did amazon giftcard reloads bonus hit the account
churning,not_removed,never had that problem but sometimes it takes a few hours to a day to authorize and approve the transaction
churning,not_removed,if you just bought it they take anywhere from minutes to hours to activate
churning,not_removed,ive read some dps where people say using the web interface rather than the app goes more smoothly
churning,not_removed,is there any different in the name or business name seems odd its probably an auemployee card
churning,not_removed,do you have cards showing up in your account
churning,not_removed,false alarm set up my chase business account and it listed a single account with two cards attached to it looks like rybitron was right
churning,not_removed,there was a dp of someone gettnig spgs w diff numbers and getting both bonuses dont think so with chase
churning,not_removed,i can login
churning,not_removed,works fine for me right now but yeah that has happened to me with citi a few times before
churning,not_removed,i can login fine onto mine if it doesnt work tomorrow or if you need to do something there quickly id suggest calling them
churning,not_removed,are you seeing it reported somewhere that citi is intending to revise benefits for their tyseries of cards
churning,not_removed,i personally think they have to do something with the prestige and premier bonuses to make them more competitive with chase and amex
churning,not_removed,i recently got the premier smd to get a instead of bonus
churning,not_removed,there is no reason to wait hours it doesnt matter when you deposit it
churning,not_removed,i have deposited them a couple hours after getting them no problem
churning,not_removed,i walked to the atm next to the po and deposited mine
churning,not_removed,cant find the link and probably not the same thing you saw but i remember someone suggesting waiting at least until the next day to make it look like some person had bought the mo and then met up with you later since the date is printed at the top of the mo
churning,not_removed,it doesnt add an account if the au ssn matches the account holder ssn based on dps i have seen
churning,not_removed,kum and go sounds like a brothel
churning,not_removed,where are you located ca here citi only pulls ex only chase pulls both ex and eq
churning,not_removed,yea they pulled mine too
churning,not_removed,yeah they always pull ex and eq for me my ex has so many pulls i dont even worry about it anymore and my eq only has citi pulls im in massachusetts
churning,not_removed,i had the same thing on my new amex business platinum just order a replacement card or call them and they will send a replacement card with the correct member since date your online account will update in the next days so wait till you see that online first before ordering a replacement say the card was damaged
churning,not_removed,i doubt it means anything i noticed that my online accounts for my new incognito cards said member since after the instant approval until after my card was actually processed then they corrected to the true year although my physical cards still say i read that if you sm them they can send you cards with the right year but i imagine if you just request a replacement card it would be corrected
churning,not_removed,mine came with the expected year in my case
churning,not_removed,hot damn sea has a bunch you better not be pulling my legs
churning,not_removed,join the club
churning,not_removed,what denial message do you get if you break or not sure if i was denied for or another reason im not breaking
churning,not_removed,shouldnt be hard at all i was instantly approved for the bgr and business platinum simultaneously
churning,not_removed,not hard at all amex is one of the easier issuers to do this with its easier still if one or both of the cards is a charge card as well
churning,not_removed,you should be fine as long as you dont go for credit cards credit charge card or charge cards should combine hps bgr and spg biz would be a good combo
churning,not_removed,theyve been having issues with their site for awhile now it is possible that they stopped allowing loads already
churning,not_removed,try a different browser or incognitoprivate i was just able to pull it up on my phone using ff
churning,not_removed,fyi there was discussing this already but yeah same boat here
churning,not_removed,united miles w turbotax alaska miles w turbotax american miles w turbotax southwest points w turbotax httpsrapidrewardsshoppingsouthwestcompturbotaxhtm
churning,not_removed,banker told me yikes should i recon now or wait
churning,not_removed,preapproved for all personal except csr im at without csr
churning,not_removed,neah huca
churning,not_removed,make sure they dont consider the au in their decision be prepared to answer what your business does expected revenue how much you will charge on the card etc
churning,not_removed,any recommended verbiage to grease the skids on the match
churning,not_removed,business
churning,not_removed,yes shocking truly
churning,not_removed,hah
churning,not_removed,interesting so theoretically if i bought a refundable ticket using gift cards or multiple tenders to keep it in the range i could trigger the credit and then recoup the money when i cancel i need to think doing this i have in amex travel credit to liquidate and dont feel like losing some value by reselling gift cards
churning,not_removed,had it in and and it spoiled me haha now that ive got companion pass it would be even more valuable to me
churning,not_removed,got companion pass in october flights total paid on points currently sitting on rr
churning,not_removed,what was the challenge
churning,not_removed,i did all organic spend in december thanks christmas and the bonus posted on
churning,not_removed,many owners prefer to go through a party like airbnb rather than dealing directly with a renter because airbnb handles a lot of the details such as paymentdeposit processing insurance and payment guarantee that the owners dont want to bother with
churning,not_removed,good idea will see if owner wants to go outside of airbnb
churning,not_removed,nice was hoping to use my ink through staples gift cards so i could get ur pointsdollar just not sure how much i can buy from staples in one swoop or how often before stapleschase gets suspicious i read can i just go back every day and buy another in gift cards if staples doesnt have airbnb cards can i buy amazon cards and then buy x airbnb cards off amazon is max
churning,not_removed,wow coming in clutch with the screenshot
churning,not_removed,when i opened the account i told myself wells fargo would be stupid to repeat the same mistake but this is not reassuring also wondering how that other guy is going to get access to his account if they dont have his email snail mail i guess assuming of course that they didnt put my mailing address on his account too
churning,not_removed,thanks i did that and they also ran my email address and found the other account it was associated with and removed it
churning,not_removed,not op but every dpa ive seen you have to charge something to the room i charged a drink at the bar to the room was like for a soda but worth it for points
churning,not_removed,im the one who always pays too but they dont pay their venmos very quickly
churning,not_removed,sigh call back in days they say
churning,not_removed,got an email too and says its nontransferrable
churning,not_removed,keep in mind there are addition benefits to credit cards other than points extended warranty damage protection ect i had a friend whos macbook pro got stolen at college and his parents had used their amex for the purchase they replaced it for free
churning,not_removed,im but a common lobster and i cant affordfloat the entire cost of the ring nice find though
churning,not_removed,thank you
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,to add on that my global entry interview the system was down and the guy had to run to the airport for an incoming international flight after my interview the interview was miles from the airport he ended up emailing me my ktn number that night
churning,not_removed,thanks for the info
churning,not_removed,you actually have access to your ktn number as soon as you apply top left of prodgoes screen membership number passid
churning,not_removed,thanks for the info
churning,not_removed,thanks well thats good news
churning,not_removed,call the main customs phone line for your location and go through the automated directory to get a hold of someone in the office have a plausible story about not being able to get off work during business hours or similar and be polite it worked for me let week but as others have said ymmv
churning,not_removed,except i dont think anyone would convert ur into marriott points unless they had something specific in mind if you look at it in terms of value ur at worst while to get that value from marriott points youd have to assume per point and then you give up the ur flexibility in many cases you might be better off just earning ur and booking a marriott through chase instead of using marriott points spg is a somewhat different story as you have transfer flexibility but youd still have to value each point at to make spg get you the same as but since the op already has the marriott card id say to keep it get next years free night and dont risk not being able to get a new card from the new program
churning,not_removed,nobody would transfer their ur to marriott there are much much better uses of ur at the very least just book travel through the ur portal for cpp
churning,not_removed,i disagree because you assume the only goal is spg points better to translate to if you value ur at and spg at then csr gets you and spg gets you
churning,not_removed,yep the portal cb would have been great but im still ahead via cards with very minimal effort
churning,not_removed,thats a shame thanks for the help
churning,not_removed,i had not heard that one let us know
churning,not_removed,me too
churning,not_removed,ive been approved but dont have the card yet im assuming i need to wait for it and set up a new chase signin before sending the sm it isnt showing up in my personal account
churning,not_removed,did you have a balance what happened to it since there is apr i had a balance on there
churning,not_removed,bastards they must be doing some kind of clean up i havent had any new card activity since august
churning,not_removed,thats cold
churning,not_removed,grandpa nooooo
churning,not_removed,did you ever have the rep submit the request and then get denied on the final review or were you always rejected by the front line rep
churning,not_removed,congrats any more information such as the person who approved you was obviously american or you called at a certain time of the day or a different number same number on the back of the card pressed a different menu option or just dumb luck to get a rep that apparently has access to something you said calls but only two or three reps said they couldnt pc was there a delay in this as if they tried but the system did not let them or was it more of a quick answer as in they didnt want to help you to make you go away also the ones that did not say they could not specifically pc but also did not do your pc they tried and the system failed
churning,not_removed,yea to fill the dp trifecta my biz plat was overnighted and blue for biz came a week later of course this dp is what would be expected but they are all over the place
churning,not_removed,you were right just pulled it out of the mailbox
churning,not_removed,honestly i did no suspicious activity with them i didnt have a dd set up but i did fairly regular ach deposits a few billpays nothing ms about it but whatever easy come easy go
churning,not_removed,yeah i was thinking about going to ally but i like atmdeposits so im doing ccuil its easy enough to rack up the with circle pay
churning,not_removed,signup bonuses do not count for taxes but bonuses from checking accounts including typ and aa miles do count as taxable income as decided in
churning,not_removed,couldnt you value the miles at the rate of redemption if it was advantageous i realize some might have used these miles for first class flights to japan i mean if you exchanged miles for a flight the value of that bonus is
churning,not_removed,can i just not claim them if they dont send a the irs would never know about them and even if they did send one to the irs but not to me for some reason i doubt the irs would care about such a small discrepancy
churning,not_removed,the platinum is a charge card not a credit card right i thought credit cards in one day was harder
churning,not_removed,yeah i did with the usual too many accounts etc which im guessing is pretty common with many of us here lol i didnt have any problems with amex for other cards applied around the same time though so my question pardon if i was unclear earlier is if others are also finding it more difficult to get approved for this particular card and if there was success with recon dps will be great
churning,not_removed,thank you i definitely will
churning,not_removed,heck maybe youll even get an additional bonus
churning,not_removed,lol yup same boat
churning,not_removed,good to know thanks got denied previously by sm but guess ill try a phone call when i hit the min spend later this week
churning,not_removed,there was actually a dp in late december i believe of someone in florida getting the match no cpc
churning,not_removed,sweet thats heartening seems like calling is the way to go
churning,not_removed,i have the chase ihg its the only ihg credit card isnt it
churning,not_removed,clearly its a value and you only pay the man is basically handing you cashhhh
churning,not_removed,i would also add chase freedom and united mpe offer which is coming up according to a previous post or sw companion pass cards
churning,not_removed,i was here the day of the amex plat public offer in november and didnt get it because i just got the csr and was at so i didnt want to use up a slot i have been working on business cards and am still at sw just doesnt appeal to me as much because of the lack of nonstop flights i agree that it is an amazing deal though trying to get my parents to apply to get the sw cp
churning,not_removed,i think the csr and platinum are far more complementary than duplicate and they are great to have together at least for year when the effective af on the plat is if you see a plat thats publicly available youve gotta hop on that no matter what
churning,not_removed,what kind of room do you get nice hotel selection
churning,not_removed,i love my ink and hoping to eventually get the ink preferred i do have a business but it is on the smaller side with little overhead so not too much actual business spending i am going to give it some time before jumping on the ink preferred
churning,not_removed,you cant pc ink preferred to ink cash at this time but i like your list
churning,not_removed,about ur and mr with cards and a good mix of category to cover most spending and you would still be at
churning,not_removed,ive done about usually do all the mos in the span of about a week to two weeks depending on climate at my stores that is steep though
churning,not_removed,actually already hold the sw cp lol looking to qualify for next year that is a good idea though
churning,not_removed,eh well enough lol i do about a month so they all know me
churning,not_removed,ive historically put about on all of my cards and coming off a bump from holiday spending so it wouldnt be to hard to start ramping up as my spending cools off only other issue is that my dl plat has a stupid limit
churning,not_removed,the sw cp has already saved me so at least that much lol only really looking at dl silver because im already mqm down and wanted to try it the jetblue is more a side effect of my recent jetblue biz card since it is an option and a goal to strive for id say that if i could get even one upgrade out of the dl status id be very happycould probably live without the jetblue tho if i had too
churning,not_removed,do you know what the latest rules for citi are i recall something along the lines of card max every x days cards max every y days but dont recall the numbers or if they have added additional restrictions
churning,not_removed,sorry i was not specific at all in my post specifically asking about the hyatt allinclusives booking through hyatt points
churning,not_removed,thanks is the only way to check award availability through calling as well
churning,not_removed,damn so i wont get in april because i didnt have a balance in january thanks for your help
churning,not_removed,so id be earning if i converted to marriott whereas marriott card gets me sounds like spg is the way to go thanks
churning,not_removed,thank you
churning,not_removed,haha disregard then
churning,not_removed,theyre supposed to be but they never were deducted for the stay in oct i had never used hyatt points before so i figured theyd be deducted after my stay so since they were still in my account i just used them again
churning,not_removed,just purchasereturn protection thanks
churning,not_removed,can you give me some examples i dont have the plat but it seems like the prg is the next best thing i guess ill use that or the brg thanks a ton
churning,not_removed,heh whoops on the acronym got mixed up with another tla that i see all the time in my area
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,same curious to see if anyone has actually received the their customer service has been atrocious for me so far
churning,not_removed,i believe they post on wednesdays
churning,not_removed,thanks for dp i was hoping to avoid hassle of dd but maybe i will need to for trigger
churning,not_removed,ok i will wait some time thanks for the tip
churning,not_removed,no luck from the web ui but will try again soon thanks for the tip
churning,not_removed,i thought chase au cards have the same account number as the main card or is that only for personal cards while for business cards the auemployee card number is different
churning,not_removed,whatd you do just wait a day or a couple hours or something waiting for it to work again
churning,not_removed,the prestige specifically is being devalued a bit
churning,not_removed,thanks i just recall someone on here suggesting to deposit via atm of wait
churning,not_removed,the good ol ejaculate and evacuate
churning,not_removed,sorry forgot to mention im in il and that was my first ever citi card though ive had a checking account with them for over a year
churning,not_removed,it may take a few tries until you find one that carries variables and lets you swipe your card
churning,not_removed,no reason to wait to recon a person card imo give it a shot immediately
churning,not_removed,days would lead me to think its a denial i dont see the harm in calling to find out whats holding you back
churning,not_removed,you can call now used to mean denial but doesnt anymore i got that on both my card and my wife took a few days then was approved
churning,not_removed,this is for a csr so personal card actually was looking for any dps i could get on and aus
churning,not_removed,be polite say thanks thats about of it the requirements for matching with chase generally they will e and there are recent dps last two weeks of successful matches
churning,not_removed,revenue rt or revenue one way trips or tier qualifying points from revenue flights regardless of the option the flights must be booked and flown by
churning,not_removed,yes its all very circumstantial if you have stayed before then its very easy to contact directly a lot of dedicated rentals have brochures or websites for the properly outside of airbnb also you can negotiate through airbnb but for you are looking at in fees taxes so one way or another i am paying less than the sticker price on that type of rental
churning,not_removed,you can buy multiple airbnb gift cards from amazon but ive only been able to enter a max of egift cards in one day
churning,not_removed,not sure if this matters to you but any benefit of protection from any card you have that has trip insurancecancellation would likely not be passed through via staples gift cardsamazon giftcards it might be worth it to consider the value of that to your travel plans as you decide how to maximize return
churning,not_removed,in all seriousness its a pretty alarming privacy breach giving you some random guys personal info im hoping it didnt have much more than his name
churning,not_removed,definitely makes you want to trust them with your money if they can have that kind of error happening luckily people like us wouldnt leave much money there for long
churning,not_removed,yes that is my understanding also im staying at ph nyc in april just looking for feedback on what was charged to room if anything thanks for dp
churning,not_removed,i didnt charge anything to my room at all haha
churning,not_removed,can you huca what if they say its too late after
churning,not_removed,many of those policies are restrictive enough that a jewelry purchase would not be covered these are better covered by a personal items insurance policy
churning,not_removed,off topic but may want to consider if youre ready to get engaged then the adage that a ring should be months salary has actually been twisted from its original meaning you should be able to save up months salary before committing to a major step like that not to get too preachy but may not want to start off the wrong foot like that getting something you wouldnt be able to afford without financing even at
churning,not_removed,he let me split the over months however i want i cant float the full amount either lol congrats though hitting the min spend makes the pain a little better from a dollar perspective
churning,not_removed,you got it
churning,not_removed,well yeah but its not active until youre approved
churning,not_removed,you can check daily spots usually open up fairly close in
churning,not_removed,i dont know if youre willing to go to ewr but i was able to schedule one just a couple of days out looked like there were some available slots still left as well best of all you can go to the lounge there to wait cause its before security
churning,not_removed,yup theyll send you instructions on opening a business signin with the card
churning,not_removed,just like grandpa
churning,not_removed,always rejected by the first csr i could talk to last one said ok didnt hear back from bofa called today said it was approved
churning,not_removed,denise from one of the carolinas i think i called in around lunchtime so around pst number off of the back of the card i would enter my information then say operator to hear examples of options of what i was calling about then say operator again to get to a specific nonskippable option menu where was the services option which is what i used id then have to enter the authentication code on the back of the card that was the way i did it every time hopefully it was the most efficient two or three reps specifically said that i couldnt pc the cash rewards card most said that no one could pc to the bbr anymore almost all of them told me i needed to apply directly for the bbr one particular csr told me that it wasnt possible to pc any card to try a different department and didnt even bother asking me if she had answered all of my questions before i hung up that was worth a chuckle edit also it seemed as though most either found a note or had already memorized a note saying that the bbr was off limits another note my calls were all in a twotothree day period i figured that no one was really recording how often i called so it didnt make much sense to dilly dally around
churning,not_removed,a few billpays if these where going to capone that might explain it but its not clear if it was this or if you paid bills with capone
churning,not_removed,ccuil is amazing i have it account plus cc just for the higher interest rate
churning,not_removed,i believe you can do that but i am not sure not a tax guy d that is how citi decides the value of your typ
churning,not_removed,i am far too wary about the irs to mess around with potentially in income—the interest and penalties is way more than what youd shell out by just claiming them it may be worth sming or calling citi to see what they are planning to send you when
churning,not_removed,correct i completely forgot about the two credit card issue with amex yes would be harder maybe impossible to get both spg and delta cards
churning,not_removed,i think youll be fine
churning,not_removed,im so bummed about it cause i thought id actually be able to use a pointbreak for once
churning,not_removed,haha so basically still follow chase i have been impressed with their line up too i was just looking at cards from other banks and thinking that it would be nice to be over so i dont feel guilty about using those slots
churning,not_removed,i get why you love nonstops but they just arent worth the premium they often cost for me i look at connecting flights as an opportunity to enjoy the amenities of an airport for an hour or two then i hope on the next southwest leg i enjoyed my delta connection in atlanta in december because i got to visit the skyclub and enjoy some free cookies and booze for example when a southwest trip connected in atlanta i got to use my priority pass to visit another lounge
churning,not_removed,i am soon to be i am also doing the business thing this year however the conventional wisdom is to pickup some personal cards so your resets sooner which makes perfect sense but still hard to do i am planning on getting some cards i actually will use but staying at perpetually unless there is a blockbuster deal i have plans to get the sw cards in a few years when i plan to travel but for now they are no use to me which is nice to be able to shelve that idea
churning,not_removed,funny i like southwest because of their nonstops
churning,not_removed,i guess thats fair id rather spread out my lounge access if i can though that said id totally jump on a offer for either card today if it were available to me but the question is about starting out as a churner and i think starting with both csr and amex plat the same day is not a good way to go for a newbie
churning,not_removed,ive stayed a couple of times at ihg properties in nyc ic times square and cp times square i also stayed at a hix in new england that had a jacked up rate due to college reunion and saved a boat load ihg has a wide range of properties both domestic and international the room you get depends on the hotel but usually a standard award room
churning,not_removed,is a increase in ms im hardly qualified to speak towards this but that seems exceptionally difficult and aggressive given the income youve reported i just dont see how that doesnt raise a lot of flags and an analyst will almost certainly figure out what youre doing the moment any of these cards is manually reviewed if i were you id pick your battles and be aggressive but on just one card at least to start its easier to ramp up cautiously than to deal with financial reviews and account shutdowns
churning,not_removed,approval per day window applications per day window denials count for including autodenials for or
churning,not_removed,if i recall correctly its card every days and cards every days for citi
churning,not_removed,you have to call hyatt and tell them how many people are staying in the room prices very depending on the number of people thats why you cant book online just booked nights on points at hyatt zilara from april
churning,not_removed,i was able to book the hyatt zilara with no problem by calling in took about minutes and had the confirmation in my email before i hung up the phone
churning,not_removed,you will as long as you pay in feb mar i got my cards in oct end statement closed in nov got bonus for all three
churning,not_removed,correct
churning,not_removed,you made the booking online
churning,not_removed,the purchase and return protection benefits they have are some of the best in the industry check your benefits paperwork if you are unsure of what exactly is covered
churning,not_removed,have yet to use purchase protection but have had great experience with return protection bought computer part online turns out it was a wrong part store had day return policy and had to pay return shipping so waited days and filed with amex next morning had money credited to my account no questions asked
churning,not_removed,oh also when you message them to match the offer you recieved in the mail they basically confirm youre getting the bonus as they remind you how long you have to meet the spend etc
churning,not_removed,let us know if youre able to transfer
churning,not_removed,its different for au vs employee cards it makes sense to be different because employees likely have a low level of trust compared to aus for what is your personal credit line in all actuality
churning,not_removed,ah sorry i thought you were alluding to changes that werent already known its an interesting conjecture that they might raise sign up bonuses to ease the pain cant pretend to know whether or not thats likely though
churning,not_removed,called and said application hasnt been reviewed yet
churning,not_removed,yeah i called and they said they havent reviewed so will call back in an hour or so
churning,not_removed,well you are in luck because i was au for the csr last year i had to huca to get a rep to move credit around if they ask you if you make payments or have account access on the au card just say no so you dont have to huca
churning,not_removed,i was able to buy airbnb gcs from amazon all at once back in september
churning,not_removed,would likely not be passed definitely not passed might be worth checking on the travel protections the various cards offer and see if just paying taxesfees would be enough to get the protection to kick in i know this works for airlines not sure how it applies for airbnb
churning,not_removed,his name and the type of account he opened no other identifying info
churning,not_removed,except i was considering keeping the account open for a bit i moved to alaska a year ago from the lower and found out that there are exactly zero boa or chase branchesatms in this state thank god for mobile banking but having access to an atm for cash withdrawaldeposits would be nice
churning,not_removed,i didnt charge a single thing to my room they used the room rate of per night so total was eligible for points base rate of and then bonus for plat for a total of points which is exactly what i got
churning,not_removed,oh thats interesting i thought there had to be a charge thats cool though
churning,not_removed,tried times all of them say the account is locked for days since the first conversion already started
churning,not_removed,more off topoic but i hate the idiot the came up with the months salary so if i make i should spend on a ring thats worth literally nothing in terms of economic value de beers and their marketing strategy is genius but holy crap do i hate them for it thats why i went to a independent jeweler the same diamond wouldve cost more if i went to a chain given the c characteristics i got only because my so cares for it so much that makes it worth it but fuck if im spending months salary on a ring end rant
churning,not_removed,i completely disagree with this but have an upvote for promoting discussion there are lots of times somebody may want to get engaged and it may make financial and practical sense but they arent ready to pay off the entire engagement ring at that moment im not going to go into every exception but there are a lot of them every situation is different and people just have to make sure they are making the right decision for them
churning,not_removed,oh i know i wish i knew that im already months deep
churning,not_removed,correct
churning,not_removed,yes got that from the portal value and just using it as a rough floor i recently booked flights through the portal because i needed specific dates and found the price to be exactly the same as available elsewhere so i got out of it i could have gotten more through a transfer if id had more flexibility on my flight times i guess if you value ur less than then it may make sense to put spend on a marriott or spg card instead
churning,not_removed,i dont know where youre getting your dp but often higher isnt true for hotels they can be higher but for flights ive booked flights through the ur portal and all have been less than lowest published rate through airline or otas
churning,not_removed,i agree especially with domestic flights i think ur is much better utilized via transfer to partners and booking businessfirst rather than economy if you want better than redemption
churning,not_removed,i double checked and they didnt move the balance to any of my other cards ill try giving them a call this afternoon
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,thanks for the detailed response
churning,not_removed,not paying capone cards just using my capone checking to pay chase wellsfargo cards nothing much but oh well
churning,not_removed,yeah i might see if i can get the cc just for the bump i tried to get one w blue fcu but was denied until i have more of a relationship with them so im getting at blue up to and now ill move most of that over to ccuil
churning,not_removed,can you initial fund ccuil with cc
churning,not_removed,there are some cities that have wonderful sw nonstop options new york city is not one of them
churning,not_removed,perfect thanks for the info
churning,not_removed,thanks i wish there was a faq on the latest rules for all the banks is easy to remember but all the others are easy to forget
churning,not_removed,i hope youre right i put a amazon vgc on it this month im going to put spotify on it next month i guess ill see what happens in april thanks for your help
churning,not_removed,initial booking where points werent deducted was over the phone second booking reusing the points was online
churning,not_removed,thanks just sent an sm appreciate it fellow beast
churning,not_removed,my posted a couple of days ago and i was able to transfer
churning,not_removed,no worries doesnt hurt to try again later i see above youll be trying again thats the spirit
churning,not_removed,might take a few days before they have anything to say my wife called immediately and they told her the same thing by third day she got an answer she actually got denied initially which was weird i guess some other department other than lending services saw it and denied it way over with prequal but eventually it got overturned and approved not sure how to be honest haha
churning,not_removed,great advice thanks
churning,not_removed,oh indeed theres a bunch of checking accounts that reimburse atm fees though i use schwab though its a hard pull on your report but i think there might be accounts that dont do that if you do a bit of research
churning,not_removed,did you have your hyatt card on file im heading there in april so ill have to try and figure out if anything special needs to be done but seems like not
churning,not_removed,oh ok good luck then
churning,not_removed,ignoring your bad math not the adage is a relic of the by debeers monopoly to get people to spend money during the great depression and it was months salary at a time when wages were much much lower and disposable income even lower theres also the car rule which is even more ridiculous
churning,not_removed,totally agree man the month thing was originally to make sure youre financially stable enough to handle marriage and earning income for this was decades ago but it got perverted into a spend more marketing strategy the idea that the ring should be proportional to your earning is crap were on the same page brother also i went to an independent jeweler that gets his diamonds direct save tens of thousands appraised for almost of course theres other issues with appraisals but stillgot a great deal haha
churning,not_removed,id like to propose my method as the new standard spend months salary on an engagement trip ring combined went to hawaiisan francisco spent miles between starwoodunited and a few stacks got a photographer for the surprise proposal too the millennial generation is more experiential than material anyway to each their own of course
churning,not_removed,id have to imagine those situations are far and few unless youre gunning for citizenship tax benefits or other similar instances but an engagement ring is worth for monetary standards in my opinion people should be saving towards a down payment for a house or roth ira which all appreciate value over time
churning,not_removed,let us know what you hear i have one missing as well i assume they closed it it wasnt even the lowest credit limit one no idea how they decided
churning,not_removed,no problem it was only reading another churners reply to my dp on the first or calls that gave me the fortitude to keep going i know there are a lot of negative dps on this particular pc so i can understand the interest
churning,not_removed,i dont think you would have an issue with ccuil i opened my checking saving and cc all in one app
churning,not_removed,i dont remember but based on dochttpwwwdoctorofcreditcomdoesfundingabankaccountwithacreditcardcountasapurchaseorcashadvanceconsumerscreditunion you can
churning,not_removed,doc has a good series about the various rules just search things to know xxxxx where xxxxx is the issuer
churning,not_removed,report back with a dp
churning,not_removed,gotta look out for each other
churning,not_removed,haha yeah well see the application doesnt even show in my account online
churning,not_removed,what did you say to the recon lines any specific script or point you made
churning,not_removed,nope i dont think so they asked for credit incase theres something and i gave my csr
churning,not_removed,ha oops and im in finance too i should just quit now
churning,not_removed,higher appraisals higher insurance coverage haha but yeah independent wholesale owners are the only way to go for diamonds
churning,not_removed,yup i pretty much pay for domestic flights since i have the csr and transfer for international flights can get pretty good value especially for offpeak flights to sweet spots
churning,not_removed,thanks found the citi post one thing that was missing do you happen to know if the month rule applies to business cards as well in other words if i recently signed up for a regular aadvantage plat can i still get the bonus for the citibusiness aadvantage plat
churning,not_removed,we had a preapproval which is why i applied then talked about lots of travel need for so many cards how we had tried a few out but wanted to stick with chase long term kind of stuff like that i didnt need recon for mine despite it being a day message just verification that it was me who had applied
churning,not_removed,you can be my loan officer forever if you think theres only months a year
churning,not_removed,yea thats the downside haha doesnt translate to too much more out of pocket but it was a nice ego boost for sure
churning,not_removed,you can still get the bonus it is perfamily the business family is separate
churning,not_removed,ok great thats really helpful i had preapproval for every card except csr and the banker told me to give it a shot i definitely need it for travel personal and business so i can utilize those talking points
churning,not_removed,good to hear might want to add that to the doc things to know about citi post its an important point that is ambiguous when looking at the citi offer tc page
churning,not_removed,its like theyre purposely helping churners opened this card and canceled open it again for even more points
churning,not_removed,i had the amtrak cc with chase before it got converted to a freedom not sure if links are multiuse or single use hence didnt post it
churning,not_removed,i wonder if this will become a public offer i was planning to apply for this card this weekend but now im not sure has the public offer ever been higher than even when it was was chase
churning,not_removed,nice amtrak is if you can value them at eg california
churning,not_removed,i jumped at but this one looks like a nobrainer if youre targeted and ride amtrak a lot
churning,not_removed,i would jump on this if they emailed me or if a link became available
churning,not_removed,definitely can be an excellent value for people including me hoping this becomes public
churning,not_removed,can you post the link after you apply was this through email
churning,not_removed,amtrak was my jam in my spectacular redemptions from clb to florida or new york not quite as strong when im vacationday limited and an hour from the nearest station especially when i had csr to go afterbut man with that out of the way this might be worth getting back in the game
churning,not_removed,me too
churning,not_removed,yes it was through email
churning,not_removed,no
churning,not_removed,httpwwwdoctorofcreditcombankaccountsisopeningabankaccountasoftorhardpull
churning,not_removed,i believe but am not certain schwab did a credit check when i opened a joint account
churning,not_removed,for chase no but some banks rarely may do a hard pull you can stay on the safe side by asking before opening
churning,not_removed,schwab which is awesome will do a hard pull on your credit and has been notorious for doing hard pulls do some research on it a quick google on checking hard pull will pull up all of the information you need to know what is important is your chex report which is separate from your transunionexquifaxexperian credit report
churning,not_removed,correct answer some banks do hard pulls which will affect credit score also all banks will do a chexsystems inquiry its only relevant for bank accounts though
churning,not_removed,to add to this i think the hard pull is for opening the brokerage account which is required to open the investor checking account although you dont need to ever use the brokerage acct
churning,not_removed,also all banks will do a chexsystems inquiry incorrect although its true that httpwwwdoctorofcreditcombankscreditunionsdodontpullchexsystems decent bank account opening bonuses that pull neither cs nor credit reps are gold
churning,not_removed,i mean with it being a onceinalifetime bonus unless you really need the starpoints now i would wait a few more months and see if the offer comes back
churning,not_removed,ive both spg card so ive every reason to sell you on get it now and hope for a referral but nope unless you need it now i say you wait you wait at least until the free night offer expires thought process for why you should wait amex might offer offer when free night offer expires amex isnt exactly easy to get a match with it isnt like you can hurry up and churn this card multiple times before it phases away once in a lifetime restriction should force you to attempt to get the best possible signup bonus worst case scenario offer is still around in few months best case scenerio you get something better churn some other cards till then rumors say chase spg in rumor also says that amex spg will be gone a year from now im gonna speculate that new applicants will be allowed at least till december now if you dont want to wait then go ahead and use the referral thread for personal or business spg card edit edited the whole thing
churning,not_removed,no reason to wait unless you are trying to avoid for future chase apps also use a referral from the links to the right from other folk here
churning,not_removed,was planning to hit the spg biz and new amex rumor thing at the same time figure spg will def be around atleast until as that is when the nights promo ends
churning,not_removed,back in early january amex announced renewal of their contract with starwood so i think it likely their contract is renewed on a calendar year or multiple calendar year basis based on that i would expect to see the end of the amex spg either at the end of or perhaps the end of if it takes longer to switch things over unless marriottstarwood goes with cards issued by multiple issuers like hilton with amex and citi source
churning,not_removed,can someone explain why the amex spg is better than the current marriot personal card with the new transfer options spg marriot but the marriot offer is for which spg
churning,not_removed,i was hoping to jump on this with an updated bonus last week but the two free nights instead of an increased point bonus killed it for me was really hoping they match the offer from earlier this year before they potentially discontinued
churning,not_removed,wait for the hypothetical new amex premium card due to release in next month
churning,not_removed,should i close it though im not sure
churning,not_removed,id say use one of the old spg referrals and sign up before this is neutered
churning,not_removed,is the spg amex going to be discontinued like if i have the card and its the main one i use will they actually prevent me from using it and cancel it on their end
churning,not_removed,my only fear is the spg points offer going away forever or the card being discontinued before i can apply
churning,not_removed,its probably a safe bet to apply for them if it doesnt interfere too much with other churning plans people have posted when they think amexs contract is up and merger deadlines but nothing concrete no reason not to get them dont forget to stop by the referral thread assuming you are going for points and not the night offer
churning,not_removed,on what do you base the idea that worst case scenario will still be around in a few months in my opinion the worst case scenario and the only argument to jump on it now is that it wont be around in a few months
churning,not_removed,the chances of coming back are close to nil they just did their typical end of summer promo and it was free nights not
churning,not_removed,i got the offer a few weeks ago i went through the process of booking a room all the way to the payment page then the offer came up as an ad already hit minimum spend and points posted
churning,not_removed,the offer is terrible right now
churning,not_removed,i think the worst case scenario isnt that the is still available its that they will end it and the free night offer becomes the new standard
churning,not_removed,as far as i can tell there are two milestones coming up with amex and the day the night offer expires considering the amex once in a lifetime bonus rule and how theres no guarantee theyll match offers i see jumping on the offer today as unjustified unless you have immediate plans for the points people argue the offer could go away at any point but ive cataloged dozens of landing pages and application links pointing to that offer so i have faith that even if they start pulling a bunch of them there will still be some zombie links around for a while and im not talking about referral links because i dont trust those in the past amex has retroactively modified the offer on referral links so my current plan is to wait until october but keep an eye on the links ill apply for the only if we dont have a higher offer by october or if the links start being worryingly sparse by then
churning,not_removed,why no reason to wait what if it increases on
churning,not_removed,it ends
churning,not_removed,per the motley fool the deal is up for renegotiation in which means its likely up for renewal in or the delta deal that amex closed at the same time as the last starwood deal was for years if these deals were done on a yearly basis the lawyer fees would be astronomical
churning,not_removed,good point
churning,not_removed,the merger was approved days ago
churning,not_removed,marriott is restricted so many here cant get it
churning,not_removed,depends partly on category of spending right both bonuses trigger on spend so spg spend spg marriott marriott spend marriott spg on the other hand if your spending comes on marriott bonus categories marriott hotels restaurants etc marriott gets better if you can spend at starwood hotels spg is much better
churning,not_removed,marriot isnt year no af
churning,not_removed,spg is superior for spend beyond the minimum as well as for a transfer youre effectively earning on spg so its one of the most appealing noncategory spend options currently
churning,not_removed,my main concern is that the spg is going to disappear from amex offerings because of the merger while the marriott should be around for the foreseeable future
churning,not_removed,the marriott card has some great perks too not sure if the spg does still
churning,not_removed,agreed i was excited to apply for both but the nights seems far less useful than the points that would eventually transfer to marriot and combine for the nightsmiles packages
churning,not_removed,they usually will offer you a pc sometimes with points incentive and sometimes not the costco example of forced conversion is a rare one
churning,not_removed,httpiimgurcomqvyaqwlpng saying referrals are now the free night at cat offer instead of the so it might be gone already lol
churning,not_removed,im pretty sure referral links being generated today dont expire for at least a year and are still generating offer for new applicants
churning,not_removed,this is my sentiment what is the reasoning that any sort of spg point offer will be coming back if marriott is looking to merge the programs into one point system years down the line then i dont see them continuing to offer two point systems id honestly try to get the spg personal and business now
churning,not_removed,would be pretty terrible if they phase out the and make the free nights the new standard offer
churning,not_removed,maybe im just an optimist at heart the nights offer expires in a few weekswho knows what will take its place for all we know this night offer was a way to test the waters i think its premature to say a offer isnt coming back hell just this year spg launched a offer when no one was expecting it well after their typical end of summer promo all hope is not lost
churning,not_removed,personal or business card
churning,not_removed,tempting but i already basically get for my wife with a referral from me a referral or public would swing it for me
churning,not_removed,thats exactly what i thought so i applied and was approved yeah its a gamble but you win some and you lose some i rather huca for the additional points than have to apply for the free night offer
churning,not_removed,youre right but imo the odds of that happening are so minimal that i simply wrote it off
churning,not_removed,the amex site lists the night offer to last until
churning,not_removed,i think its reasonable to assume that as with the barclays usair cards theres some point at which the old cards are discontinued for new applicants and a new product is released in which case especially being amex its a rare opportunity to double up on points within the same program
churning,not_removed,agreed the time and money it takes to make these deals is ridiculous so they definitely dont do it every year
churning,not_removed,smart calculations
churning,not_removed,this youd be paying for points
churning,not_removed,pc like an offer from the new card company to switch with benefits basically
churning,not_removed,old referral links are still giving the bonus my wife is still missing the spg personal on the fence as to whether to go ahead and grab it with my personal referral link or wait
churning,not_removed,they could make all the referral links redirect to a new offer though couldnt they
churning,not_removed,what is the reasoning that any sort of spg point offer will be coming back amex is hurting in their cc division this year and needs some good news their spg card is going to get decimated by competition from chase marriottritz proactively acquiring customers now appears to be the smart thing to do offering amex and marriott ccs is not the same as having two separate point systems us and aa merged and i still have cards for both barclays and citi for the new merged airline
churning,not_removed,free nights off expires
churning,not_removed,free nights offer expires my assumption is that it will change back to at that point it would be awful if it changed to free night or some bs like that
churning,not_removed,personal amex spg
churning,not_removed,so basically the best bonus ever would swing it for you
churning,not_removed,me too same same i picked up both personal and biz then turned around and applied for delta gold targeted personal and biz both of those went to pending i wonder how it will go so soon after but it was the last day of the offer
churning,not_removed,mhm and there are solid rumors that is bringing something big from amex
churning,not_removed,product change they might suggest or offer amex everyday preferred or similar with or without a bonus
churning,not_removed,like the shit night
churning,not_removed,my thoughts precisely
churning,not_removed,its such an awful offer
churning,not_removed,but again its all speculation and id be even more worried since spg deal went through and they will ditch amex for chase next year im also debating whether waiting is worth it for an extra when the alternative is losing and getting two nights that have a yr expiration only problem right now is that i have other cards to ms and i want the csr and the new amex plat is coming too
churning,not_removed,i barely nabbed the offer and am so glad i did because free limited time nights is horrendous
churning,not_removed,i mean we had it in what january so i dont think thats too much to ask for the referral is certainly not the best ever
churning,not_removed,nice im going to pick up the personal spg very soon as well trying to plan things to get the ink also curious about the amex rumorschase spg rumors but well see
churning,not_removed,four cards in one day wow
churning,not_removed,i dont think will affect the spg because the new offer lasts until weeks after
churning,not_removed,does that do a hard pull on your credit so is it basically a guarantee that the spg amex is going away this is so sad if so
churning,not_removed,such a terrible offer imo
churning,not_removed,i agree it is speculation but so is assuming chase will win the deal barclays and citi share aa although barclays couldnt do new cards for awhile theyre releasing a new aa card soon iirc likewise hilton exists through both amex and citi
churning,not_removed,no no they were about five days apart each was two in the same day i waited until i was approved for both spgs and then i applied for the deltas i didnt want to break their computers
churning,not_removed,its not any guarantee they could offer existing cardholders a new card with awesome benefits not available for new applicants like the aadvantage aviator silver or united presidentialplus cards
churning,not_removed,product changes dont typically do a pull on your credit
churning,not_removed,be curious to see how that works out given
churning,not_removed,this would be awesome lets hope for this lol
churning,not_removed,apps days
churning,not_removed,yup amex credit but not charge cards weve seen some random and inexplicable exceptions but nothing consistently repeatable im not sure how personalbusiness interact visavis
churning,not_removed,is there an easy way to liquidate them
churning,not_removed,i wish there was a way to get no fees and free shipping cvs has fee free amex gcs this last week plus you get back with chase freedom at drugstores this quarter
churning,not_removed,does using an american express card to buy these amex gift cards earn you points for example using amex spg card to buy a gc will it earn points
churning,not_removed,hm purchased a gift card with my chase ink preferred i got an email saying the purchase is pending review anyone seen that before first time ever buying an amex gift card and have never done any ms with gift cards
churning,not_removed,does anyone have a good liquidation method for agcs this and the cvs deal sound great in theory but what are people doing with thousands tied up in agcs
churning,not_removed,staplescom has a visa gift card for with free shipping amex also has an offer for off staplescom on purchases
churning,not_removed,wow ordering a gift card from am ex is a horrendous experience pages that time out they open a new tab when youre trying to redeem the offer then log you out of the prior one addresses that cannot be imported from the profile all sorts of usability issues phone numbers arent idented properly dob has a separator between day and month but none between day and year infinite redirects being detected by the browser internal server errors sorry we encountered a problem importing the address or phone number associated with this payment method please reenter your payment method information by choosing new payment method from the drop down below or you may choose to use a different payment method i never would have imagined that its possible to fcuk the experience so much definitely not worth the modest reward horrible horrible horrible i have no idea why people claim that am ex offers superior service im yet to discover it
churning,not_removed,if i use the am i eligible for topcashback
churning,not_removed,is it safe to order a personalised gift card should i get a personal or a business one im thinking that its better to have my name on it as staples would often require to match your name from your id to your card so having a personalised card should probably be easier
churning,not_removed,any dps regarding how the purchases are coded i used my arrival which has a ca limit set to received an email from amex that the agc was shipped the purchase is pending on barclays end as amex gift card would this raise a flag with barclays are they known to clawback points just purchased for now but it would be awesome to knock out the ms in one go
churning,not_removed,i did this and also can confirm that you can use amex gift cards on venmo to send money to friendsfamily for no fee venmo has a card limit per months but you can get an amex gift card with up to so you can still basically do per month indefinitely ill report back if they ever close my account or anything i will say that when i ordered a gift card i had to call chase to confirm that it was me and amex also called to confirm my address very simple though no grilling me about it fyi amex also sent me a code as a thank you for purchasing which is another no fee deal thats good until the end of february
churning,not_removed,httpwwwdoctorofcreditcomnewkrogergiftcarddeals sign in required select coupon required
churning,not_removed,thanks i ended picking up some cards for christmas and got a slight discount on them appreciate the post
churning,not_removed,great just picked up a few for gifts
churning,not_removed,any insights as to whether itll be okay to buy a amex gc to reach min spend with everyday amex not a huge sum of money but dont want them to claw back points either
churning,not_removed,i was wondering if we buy a gift card from amex can we use this to count towards minimum spend for sign up bonus anyone ever accused this as mfg spend
churning,not_removed,thanks for the reminder still good thru this weekend no purchase fees on gift cards with promo code plus free expedited shipping on all orders up to purchase fee promotion and free shipping offer expire
churning,not_removed,not sure if is still working nut just got an email saying that through you can get amex gcs with no fee and expedited shipping using the code can and should be combined with the off gc amex offer
churning,not_removed,i read on another post and this one that you can liquidate via venmo however has anybody else actually tried this besides the op of that post
churning,not_removed,what is the best way to monetize the amex gcs venmopaypal vgcs mos
churning,not_removed,basically this is for the off agc then just use the agc to get a vgc
churning,not_removed,i read on another post that you can possibly use venmo for free and transfer money to a friend
churning,not_removed,wipes out the activation fee gets you expedited shipping its exactly what youre looking for
churning,not_removed,i see there is free shipping today thats pretty good news
churning,not_removed,yes
churning,not_removed,yup buying gift cards is a simple way to manufacture spend
churning,not_removed,are people not worried about having a clawback msing this with an amex or do we only need to worry about that when meeting minimum spend
churning,not_removed,buying vgcs lol mainly just used amex gcs for at drugstores and free from amex offer but now im wondering if this will stack with topcashbacks offer
churning,not_removed,that was oos soon after it was released
churning,not_removed,is there a way to get targetted for staplescom amex ive tried looking for that offer all the time never found it
churning,not_removed,that has been out of stock since before the crack of dawn
churning,not_removed,man are you a qa tester
churning,not_removed,its terrible i had it timeout on me as well and now my purchase wont go through just went on hold for minutes and rounds of verification through chase and it still wont go through
churning,not_removed,odd i just purchased gift cards from their site for the holidays and experienced none of these problems maybe its a browser issue
churning,not_removed,yes its listed as acceptable promo code
churning,not_removed,cant purchase mos have to purchase vgcs then mos
churning,not_removed,i read on another post that you can possibly use venmo for free and transfer money to a friend
churning,not_removed,same here thanks op for the heads up appreciate it
churning,not_removed,got a cvs near you they are offering fee free amex gcs codes as drug store purchase
churning,not_removed,got a cvs near you they are offering fee free amex gcs codes as drug store purchase
churning,not_removed,i did it last night and there werent any fees sent money to my wife and had her deposit it in our savings account
churning,not_removed,i did a few hours ago worked great
churning,not_removed,or use your gc to buy an mo and pay rent with the mo
churning,not_removed,gcgift card
churning,not_removed,gift card
churning,not_removed,in this thread amex gift card gcs gift cards gcs can be visa vgc or mastercard mcgc or store gcs like kohls gcs or amazon gcs whatever httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiglossary
churning,not_removed,do you have to buy the vgc in store to use multiple agcs or is there an online option if so where can you use multiple agcs to buy vgcs online i am assuming you mean a variable load vgc which you purchase with agcs otherwise you lose of your if you purchase vgc with agc and only have profit edit for example i have the offer on cards buying agcs and then using each to buy vgc for fee isnt particularly enticing otoh buying a vgc something vgc for net profit may be more worthwhile
churning,not_removed,its worth noting that venmo is strict about the number of cards you can add last i saw it was cards in a rolling month period and very strict same parent co as paypal about shutdowns so tread carefully with venmo imo its not worth it and should only be used as an absolute last resort for hitting min spend that being said banks dont seem to consider venmo a cash equivalent so you shouldnt have any issues with clawbacks cash advance fees etc
churning,not_removed,i dont think it would be free cc fee in venmo is edit not sure what im missing here
churning,not_removed,yep i realized that after i posted my comment christmas is saved
churning,not_removed,they dont the replies are off topic
churning,not_removed,they only do this for their cards that earn mr points as far as i know someone else can chime in
churning,not_removed,are you suggesting using agcs acquired from amex or cvs to purchase vgcs from an office supply store during a promo seems like a lot of work
churning,not_removed,oh i got it when it first came out and held onto it for black friday cyber monday
churning,not_removed,amexstaples at the time but that maxed out quickly not available anymore you have to act quickly
churning,not_removed,lol no but i am a software engineer and also have an interest in usabilityaccessibility amex did really poorly using the tab you get from first address field to city then second address field they also amazingly have the middle initial placed after last name which is like the dumbest way to place it ever
churning,not_removed,unable to reproduce bug rejected
churning,not_removed,why would you purchase one with chase you do realise its just a nonpin debit card that can only be processed as credit getting a gift card at face value only makes sense if youre doing a conversion from credit to pinbased debit so that youre one step closer to completing the ms cycle
churning,not_removed,looks like max of is eligible if you go thru topcashback
churning,not_removed,this should process as credit though meaning it would be a fee
churning,not_removed,just got burned using square had my mom sign up so we could both get the bonus i ran my new alaska card she got an email the next day stating that she needed to refund the money
churning,not_removed,oh i do thanks it codes as drugstore for amex cards
churning,not_removed,excellent
churning,not_removed,did you have to call amex to register a zip code
churning,not_removed,mos cant be purchased using amex gc since it will run as a cc and not as a debit card this is assuming that the store doesnt allow mos using cc which is the case in most places
churning,not_removed,i just did a split payment at bbb yesterday no issues i think ill probably save mine for when the next odom promotion will be running in turn ill probably get five back and save those for when the next bbb promotion will be running eg buy a gift card with a gift card to get a gift card to cash at walmart
churning,not_removed,the nice thing with the amex gift cards though is that you can put up to per card i used this method to pay rent to a friend via venmo had no problem and there was no fee you could theoretically do card per month at and stay within the rolling months people routinely send large sums on venmo so i dont think thats a red flag the amex gift card thing may eventually be but for now it works i would just recommend not ever sending money to yourself im using it for rent i am considering playing with sending money to a relative and having them write me a check back to avoid sending money back and forth within venmo i guess ill report back if they penalize me
churning,not_removed,they said in the ms weekly make sure when you add the card that you check the box that says to use this card when there are no funds in your venmo account it will clearly say no fee
churning,not_removed,gcs generally process as debit cards which do not have fees i assume this is the case for amex gcs but do not have personal experience
churning,not_removed,ms is a game of cents
churning,not_removed,i had no issues using drug storeno activation feefreedom purchased amex gcs at both omod just run as a cc in my case the omod both were less than mile off course i do not have ink
churning,not_removed,fyi pretty sure the oos is referring to the staples visa gc deal
churning,not_removed,i thought id give gift cards instead of cash for christmas since it would help meet my csr ms
churning,not_removed,i did it last night and there werent any fees
churning,not_removed,omaha nebraska
churning,not_removed,was under the impression this is the norm everywhere who buys gift cards in cash
churning,not_removed,no just purchased the gc waited a few hours and then added to venmo using billing zip code of the cc i used to buy it
churning,not_removed,interesting can you put up to on an agc without a fee at cvs right now or is there some limit
churning,not_removed,just checked this and its only for when purchasing using venmo in apps so the send money to trusted friend and they send it back method which im assuming is the venmo ms people are discussing wouldnt work here
churning,not_removed,amex giftcards dont have pins and run as credit at pos i dont use venmo but i dont see how they could work as debit
churning,not_removed,good catch
churning,not_removed,oh cool thanks
churning,not_removed,would this count towards amex spend
churning,not_removed,was it amex gift card you used or regular cc
churning,not_removed,yes hindsight im still new to this i charged twice yes i know
churning,not_removed,so different name and address im guessing still trying to find a friend to do this with i have of free funds
churning,not_removed,limit at cvs on the amex website also with no fee but the cvs gets you points with freedom so use cvs with freedom for maximum points but i used the amex site for minimum spend also keep in mind that venmo has a card limit per months if youre using that what you could do is buy cards at cvs for the max on points then larger amounts on the amex site to get the absolute maximum amount of points total if you use the fu card even better
churning,not_removed,i did send it to a friend with this method and it was no fee
churning,not_removed,so you bought a no fee amex gc and loaded it to venmo and then sent the to a friend or relative
churning,not_removed,i used an amex gc to send money to a friend over venmo and it worked as a debit card no pin required
churning,not_removed,it would count but your points may get clawed back i wouldnt recommend it
churning,not_removed,amex gift card
churning,not_removed,thanks for the comprehensive reply its extremely helpful i only have cf and i maxed the at dept stores this quarter that being said i may pick up a few large agcs with to help hit some min spends and liquidate through venmo down the road thanks
churning,not_removed,well in that case i guess im wrong looks like the venmo description is incorrect
churning,not_removed,were you able to successfully use venmo without fees
churning,not_removed,i did not get the offer and using as a code doesnt seem to be working
churning,not_removed,anyone notice though that booking through the ur portal seems to be way more than booking through say travelocity even with the increase of rewards towards travel they seem to be more per night
churning,not_removed,ugh no targeted offer for me instead i just got an email saying my ur points are no longer points its now points at amazon
churning,not_removed,just got the same offer doesnt seem to be targeted but rather open to all csp cardholders as the hotel promo on freedom was
churning,not_removed,can i book a hyatt standard room and still apply a diamond suite upgrade cert
churning,not_removed,did not get the offer code did not work
churning,not_removed,got the same offer
churning,not_removed,awesome i get my csp in the mail today too hopefully i can get my bonus points preexpiration
churning,not_removed,did not work for me either
churning,not_removed,this seems kind of a strong competitive move to the targeted amex off would love to see more from chase like the amex offers
churning,not_removed,didnt work for me or so either i have sapphire so has ink
churning,not_removed,will this work if i have a chase ink
churning,not_removed,when booking the the ur portal do you still earn points with the hotel or is it like booking through a site like bookingcom
churning,not_removed,sadly no offer for me or husband
churning,not_removed,can this be stacked with the freedom promo
churning,not_removed,same using csp for total booking in hkg
churning,not_removed,what if you try over the phone
churning,not_removed,ur portal includes taxes for hotels travelocity and others dont does that account for the discrepancy
churning,not_removed,its variable for an upcoming trip to phx i found a rate on an omni that is lower than even booking direct and at least cheaper than thirdparty travel websites
churning,not_removed,hence the offer
churning,not_removed,thats weird because i just brought a bunch of stuff from amazon using points and it was
churning,not_removed,were sorry but this promotion code isnt valid please review and try again seems targeted to me in stl in aug
churning,not_removed,can you provide a link i havent received an email nevermind
churning,not_removed,me too
churning,not_removed,even if you dont you can choose to apply points towards your hotel and pay on your card for the full amount and it should qualify
churning,not_removed,nah you have to pay on your csp
churning,not_removed,for travelocity yes for hotel rewards no for instance using a cheap hotel like americas best value inn is on ur on travelocity including taxes and with vantage rewards the biggest thing ive noticed is airfare though i have a feeling taxes do play a big role in that ive yet seen a deal better than aer lingus via expedia to london now they are part of bas card rewards system so now might be the best time to get one before i visit my family
churning,not_removed,you know i worked at a large hotel i was always amazed at how much the rates would change daily i was amazed also at the fact the hotel would book at
churning,not_removed,ah sorry it changes september
churning,not_removed,ah my mistake thanks for the dp i assumed it was open to all csp cardholders because usually theres language like this offer is open only to cardholders receiving an email offer but this one didnt say that do you have the sapphire or sapphire preferred
churning,not_removed,no link necessary just enter as a promo code when youre booking
churning,not_removed,what if you enter the promo code but pay with freedom
churning,not_removed,all airfare marketed in the us is required to be all inclusive of taxes and fees per dot regulation
churning,not_removed,ah wow that sucks though thats one of the main reasons i use my csp card
churning,not_removed,yes tried booking this through csp ur travel redemption portal glad you were able to get it working on yours though
churning,not_removed,right just realized that thanks
churning,not_removed,it does say you need to pay with your csp so im guessing they do reserve the right to take it back if you use another card but you need to book through the chase freedom ur portal to get and you can only use the code through the csp portal
churning,not_removed,i find my discover it card has better rewards
churning,not_removed,with the discover card i can just use those rewards to pay off my balance anyway no waiting for deposits
churning,not_removed,ah really i did not know that well in the very end ill just add my discover is lower interest either way its not an amazing loss on my part
churning,not_removed,i got the same response and then found a number by searching on here sadly i was still declined despite a score but oh well
churning,not_removed,i was autodenied the mlb card w fico and no bofa history i got an automated call a few days later that appeared to be from a credit specialist who needed more information from me i was approved not sure if this number will help but this is what i got
churning,not_removed,i was rejected for their travel rewards card so i sent a typed letter to their office stating why i should be approved the card showed up in my account about a week later might take a little of your time and a stamp but it worked for me
churning,not_removed,fwiw i called boa recon to try to reverse a decision yesterday the new number to call is the call was simple but they didnt budge even on a score denied for too many recent inquiries also the csr checked my bank acct with them and said you dont maintain enough balance with us in the bank account fyi you get days from the date of the initial credit pull for the application to call recon your application can be reactivated within days of the initial credit pull in recon if youre calling recon days after the initial pull theyll do another hp im going to move more money over to the acct and try again in a week
churning,not_removed,try this
churning,not_removed,im trying their executive line today if anyone gets to it before me let me know your outcome im only reconning the regular cash rewards but damn theyre tough
churning,not_removed,i did both and got nowhere
churning,not_removed,had applied for two cards and got denied for both called recon and they saw two mlb cards i told them that one of them was duplicate analyst went over the same questions came up with a no for too many inquiries in the past months
churning,not_removed,weird as someone just starting out and establishing their credit i got denied for a freedom as my first card even though ive been banking with them since i was a teen but bofa approved me
churning,not_removed,wont work worst bank ever
churning,not_removed,there is another number you can call but either way for some reason their recon has been tough lately
churning,not_removed,this is the number i successfully used for my alaska card recon i called a bunch of numbers and theres some info in
churning,not_removed,i tried this number and was declined again the representative said i had too many new accounts in the last months cards and specifically mentioned my amex gold from and citi aadvantage from posted this as a data point a few days ago and the mods removed it
churning,not_removed,oh thanks for the number i will try it later
churning,not_removed,this number worked great to get me a credit analystunfortunately it was regarding a alaska airlines application the first was approved and i called recon for the they stated they felt one card was sufficient i dont think they understand i need for business class to asia mwahaha unfortunate but my fiance was approved for the aa biz about a month after getting her alaska personal second was denied as well does anyone know the cooldown between alaska airline personal cards to allow autoapproval
churning,not_removed,thanks for the dp i was going to say i dont know why they wouldnt want you with that kind of cs i guess they dont want new customers unless they pay an af like alaska p
churning,not_removed,thanks for this info i thought i was denied for the two mlb cards i applied for last weekseems as though they flagged one app as a dupe and cancelled it and the other was in recon due to my experian report being frozen they were able to pull my tu insteadso now i at least get one of the two approved data point no prior relationship with boa fako and approved for a limit on the lone mlb cardodd side note no mention of which team card ill actually receive
churning,not_removed,great thanks for the dp did you send it to the el paso location
churning,not_removed,hmm interesting dp on the days so even after the days they wont do another hp when you call in asking to be reconsidered i dont have an account with them but might as well open one up to run mos through
churning,not_removed,if you dont mind answering how much is enough balance i use my bofa account as my main checking account but i usually move the money into other accounts a little later
churning,not_removed,ive always heard them as being super easy so i dont know what the big change was the last couple months and last couple weeks especially
churning,not_removed,i did both and got another hard pull for my efforts they didnt process the letter until after days from application
churning,not_removed,i guess bofa is getting tougher thanks for the dp
churning,not_removed,should show up on your online profile no
churning,not_removed,tell that to the folks who got mlb cards
churning,not_removed,there is no mystery about them suddenly getting hardass it happened a little over a year ago and coincided with a certain bowtieclad blogger who bragged on his popular website that he got as cards approved on the same day exhorting his braindead minins to go do the same a few days later another popular blogger who has regularly published his weird longstanding obsession about sleeping in richard bransons bed bragged about getting a halfdozen ba cards over the course of a few days providing detailed directions for his followers for some reason everyone was shocked shocked to discover a few days later that bofa didnt enjoy being openly mocked and having their noses rubbed it it they appear to have noticed that they were the laughing stock of bloggers and their zombie followers and seem to have decided they were not going to played for chumps anymore suddenly they tightened up in multiple ways this all went down in early june of last year when lots of people were reporting no more easy instant approvals an overall decidedly chilly reception from bofa surly rejections and lectures by the previously friendly bofa reconsideration agents why is anyone surprised at this business professionals do not enjoy seeing themselves mocked as suckers and they dont see that as good for their careers they let everyone have a nice long free ride but eventually the exposure caused them to take action you would too
churning,not_removed,for some reason which probably has nothing to do with people getting cards in a single day
churning,not_removed,did you have to persuadeexplain at all after trying and i finally got a substantive explanation from a person at this number and the rep said that i was being denied for accounts being too new and not being used the first reason sounds like aaoa which is fine but the second reason makes no sense and neither of them is a reason ive seen mentioned in the recent threads about denials for alaska and cash rewards cards
churning,not_removed,read the wiki i just put a section in there last week
churning,not_removed,no problem im not sure either dont know if it has to do with banking history or cc history i couldnt believe it was a straight up denial that was followed by a phone call
churning,not_removed,no problem did we overlook the team selection i swear that should be an option when you apply for the app but i must have missed it too
churning,not_removed,yep that was the only location the rep told me to send it to i used httpmilestomemoriesboardingareacomcreditcardreconsiderationletter when i composed the letter
churning,not_removed,my bad i forgot about that part your application can be reactivated within days of the initial credit pull if youre calling recon days after the initial pull theyll do another hp at least thats what the credit specialist told me yesterday
churning,not_removed,no idea the csr just used that phrase when talking about my bank account with them during the call and i only keep the minimum to avoid fees in there its not my primary bank
churning,not_removed,maybe because of number of people trying to apply for more than one card a day
churning,not_removed,just a followup i tried this number and got nowhere i ended up using the number at the top of the thread had a minute recon and got denied i want to open a bank account with them but it certainly wont get used as a daily driver so im unsure if that will establish the history theyre looking for im wondering if the letter is worth sending in or if im just pushing my luck at this point
churning,not_removed,yeah my fico from amex was reported as and from tu by discover was earlier this month no idea what the deal is they want me to get a secured card with them
churning,not_removed,prime example of their system being flawed once you are denied gl theres a reason this bank has a our of star rating
churning,not_removed,lol
churning,not_removed,ya i remember that happening i guess it all makes sense
churning,not_removed,recon not the auto approval call recon and see how it goes
churning,not_removed,the second reason makes sense they want to see you using existing accounts before issuing new ones you dont have to like it but its not like its a crazy reason
churning,not_removed,the rep said that i was being denied for accounts being too new and not being used do you have other boa accounts my alaska cards were my first interaction with boa so they had nothing to look at in terms of me not using their products i had to recon card because it was marked as duplicate
churning,not_removed,you rock lumpy
churning,not_removed,sorry i was unclear what i meantsince im only getting one of the two mlb cards i applied for and the csr didnt inform me which app got cancelled its a toss up which of the two teams i will get on my lone approved card
churning,not_removed,great link thanks for the dp
churning,not_removed,confirmed i sent a letter they got it inside days but didnt do recon until after got a new hard pull at least on a different bureau
churning,not_removed,gotcha thanks for the info i think ill still go ahead and apply for a few of the mlb and another bbr next week
churning,not_removed,based on my experiences i think bofa is pretty easy if you have an established relationship with them my parents opened an account with them for me over years ago and they gave me the best offer for an auto loan rate and theyve never denied a card for me yet im probably going to try to get mlb cards and another bbr in a week or so
churning,not_removed,lol im not salty its that it doesnt make sense because ive been in this hobby for two years already as well as having a card that is six years old and i put spend on my cards regularly and that has been enough to be considered a good history ive never been denied
churning,not_removed,i dont i asked because neither do you yet you were approved
churning,not_removed,boa is kind of tough on recon while some people are able to get things overturned a lot of people have no luck they really do look over everything thoroughly and sweet talking seems to not help much
churning,not_removed,okay will post there instead thanks
churning,not_removed,i would assume not all companies would send you a check
churning,not_removed,i worked at state farm it is a law they have to send a refund state farm only does checks
churning,not_removed,thats a good way for them to blacklist you
churning,not_removed,definitely possible done it twice before i ever new about ms when shopping around and because my old agent pissed me off got about in checks from them and mortgage company escrow for house and two cars doubt they blacklist you unless you get out of control with it the old agents still send me stuff every month trying to get me back
churning,not_removed,also they might run your credit when you apply so that should be an extra hard pull not sure though because i have not changed carriers in a while
churning,not_removed,definitely super scalable
churning,not_removed,ms discussions are only allowed in the ms saturday thread removed
churning,not_removed,possible probably scaleable not really as you point out and probably not worth the extra troubletime above the vgc mo route that costs
churning,not_removed,state or federal law
churning,not_removed,state law insurance companies are specifically regulated by state statutes governed by each states department of insurance
churning,not_removed,definitely state law but state farms company policy is to issue a check for any overpayment if you ask tell them it was a mistake if you cancel state farm will prorate you down to the day you cancel and they can cancel and can backdate up to days back in all states granted no agent will like you cancelling but they always send a check because it is to much of a pain to call company and have a cc transaction reversed just tell them you got a better deal they do not have a limit to the number of times you can do it however they will investigate if you cancel one day next day open another and then cancel best to keep it to one every months or more they have a fraud department that investigates and they go as deep as possible into your info and will pull and pay for all sorts of investigations i worked a customer who insured a few different luxury cars fraud department investigate and paid each car for a title search so they could cancel him since they were all under different names
churning,not_removed,heights of being optimistic thanks bro initially i thought it wont thrill most ppl other than churners bcoz of af but looking at the data points it has attracted so many etc
churning,not_removed,how should we reflect a pending approval change in the survey as of now i only see instant approval pending and denied as options would you consider adding an approved after pending choice
churning,not_removed,thanks for the reminder i had called recon since i filled out the survey but completely forgot about fixing my responses in the rage after my denial
churning,not_removed,just approved added data point
churning,not_removed,status changed to approved today after being pending for a week this is the whole update
churning,not_removed,thanks for this feeling much better about the odds of applying for my so after seeing a good number of high getting instant approvals
churning,not_removed,just got my card the documents indicate that they used the score pulled when i opened my chase freedom a week prior i applied and was approved on the is it known that they will use a recent pull rather than pull again
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,received my card yesterday i had applied last monday and got approved on wednesday they had some issues with the ssn listed on the application somehow and that held up my card i called in on monday morning and got that fixed the customer support person said that they were overwhelmed by the applications and they are not expediting shipping my request to reconsider the expedited shipping was denied but like its mentioned in the wiki all cards are being sent out on rush i got my card through ups on day shipping in a plain white cover stats approved for my chase card chase csp freedom hyatt and now reserve totalling from chase alone income total cards applied for thanks to community for all the info
churning,not_removed,i think its because essentially af for ppl like me who will use global entry im a and you are correct if it was flat out with no credit i wouldnt have looked twice
churning,not_removed,im fairly new to churning and taking it one step at a time i was and about to start looking for a new card and was eyeing the csp some of us are just baby churners lucking out
churning,not_removed,did you recon out of
churning,not_removed,agreed i doubt i wouldve applied for the card without the travel credit im also generally has to be a really good bonus for me to bother signing up now if i can just get them to approve my application applied last monday and still pending at two weeks
churning,not_removed,agreed id have been hesitant to apply for a card that i only wanted to churn for a year and then definitely drop i probably wouldve done it anyway that signup bonus is just too juicy but it has to be a really amazing signup bonus for me to think its worth the time i like churning in concept but im also lazy so it has to be pretty impressive for me to bite i was at cards i actually wanted longterm though ironically the second legitimately supplanted the first but i did intend to keep the quicksilver longterm until the fu was unveiled and the southwest cards which i totally churned and dropped because yeah cp was worth the hassle unless they nerf the csr though it is keeping a longterm spot in my wallet im not just churning that one though i might get my wife to churn a second copy of it next year if they keepbring back the bonus
churning,not_removed,csp multiplier csr multiplier minimum free money not rocket science
churning,not_removed,could you give some details on your background and approval i might be in a similar situation as you and might apply if you got approved
churning,not_removed,cool thanks for clarifying ill update now
churning,not_removed,no they denied me hard core so i huca and got a more pleasant chat but still a denial gave up after that second recon call will try bank when i can to see if i might luck out with pre approval sorry if i made it seem otherwise i went pending on application filled out survey that day called and got the to whatever day on automated line so i called a couple days later denied thats when i was blinded by rage and forgot to update survey to a denial
churning,not_removed,no email just showed up on my account page called the number after that to double check it was approvedsame thing happened with my mpe
churning,not_removed,woot woot finally
churning,not_removed,applied cst last monday in branch pre approved weeks still on the phone congrats on your new card hoping i get the approved tmrw morning
churning,not_removed,pst monday for me i was literally holding the banker from closing the doors and was approved this morning when i logged in at pst
churning,not_removed,applied late monday night and mine just changed to approve i had a day message when i applied
churning,not_removed,applied at monday and still have weeks message
churning,not_removed,call recon i did and got an instant approval just by verifying my name
churning,not_removed,csp has a ur multiplier fyi
churning,not_removed,i was approved and received my card yesterday heaviest piece in my ever shrinking wallet reported income actual about with bonus and ot crédit according to report in the mail they sent with the card lower than the on ck cards chase discover citi the chase are really old though got in college so i was previous cl with chase was total about approved with limit after getting pending and calling recon
churning,not_removed,thanks for the full data point good luck with trying for a preapproval
churning,not_removed,same for me pretty much applied in branch sunday the was pending two weeks all last week and saw the card was added to my account on saturday
churning,not_removed,thanks man fixed
churning,not_removed,approved called in min ago thanks for your help
churning,not_removed,i just referred dh for this card today would be nice if he would be targeted for this since well be meeting the minimum spend on it anyway wonder if its just targeted to those who have had the card for a while
churning,not_removed,got the offer not sure what all categories qualify exactly might need to get creative to get close to the max spend
churning,not_removed,would be nice but my cable is paid though august from the amex blue cash back offer
churning,not_removed,tried the link no dice
churning,not_removed,no luck with the link either
churning,not_removed,targeted at you or through the provided link
churning,not_removed,targeted
churning,not_removed,what are you targeted through disney chase visa
churning,not_removed,came via email from a chasecom domain email address
churning,not_removed,cool thanks
churning,not_removed,every time i go to the grocery store i get a little preemptive nostalgia
churning,not_removed,this is a big blow for me but mostly because all my local target and walmart stores code as grocery i will plan to just load up on gcs when categories suit it or use my ink to buy gcs at office stores amazoncom chase credit card is now paying for az purchases which is a card i already have and when you account for the credit card rewards ebay bucks and portal earnings you can easily get a discount on them its important to note youre a bit outdated here while getting the gas cards on ebay may still be the most lucrative way and the one i personally prefer you can only get the discounts and cc rewards few maybe none of the portals pay in gift card category anymore and ebay doesnt give bucks on gc purchases
churning,not_removed,i would long for those days one card can do three cards job
churning,not_removed,what about the fort knox visa for gas httpwwwfortknoxfcuorgvisahtml i dont see any recent dps on it but it seems like a no brainer unless im missing something is it just too hard to get approved i suppose i can otherwise stock up with my chase freedom for ur i dont love the idea of floating so much on gift cards already doing that with my discover right now
churning,not_removed,do i need to redeem my points before april or can i wait till that last statement posts
churning,not_removed,as a certain political figure would say tweet sad ive already zeroed out my rewards balance i dont plan on even activating the card they will send as a replacement i think a combination of discover it amex blue cash everyday and chase freedom will mostly replace sallie mae but it was definitely an excellent card i may consider getting boa cash rewards at some point for on gas
churning,not_removed,because i use ccu for their high interest checking i applied for their card and i will try to meet the or monthly spend targets to get the increased interest on money saved there i have costco card for on gas and i guess ill fill up amazon reloads with a discover card when the category is up edit i just did the math on this if you naturally spend on groceries at an average of card you are getting back tax free at its if you use ccuil for rate you get that plus an additional after interest taxes and opportunity cost of yield elsewhere if you ms another on the ccuil card for rate you get another net on top of the previous rate this assumes tax bracket that you already have the extra available and would otherwise be getting return on it
churning,not_removed,is anyone planning on racking up points and then using them toward a student loan
churning,not_removed,just maxed out my amazon balance and plan to do the same next month to get me through the nuclear winter i am not going to eat or fill up my car until i get a suitable replacement wish me luck
churning,not_removed,i thought it was march
churning,not_removed,is there a concensus list for replacement options in terms of combined gasgroceries i looked over the two lists from doc and it seems like the bce might be best bang for the buck if you want a single card
churning,not_removed,just a thought on gas i stock up on exxon gc when theyre on ebay figure im saving plus getting pts any reason cb beats this
churning,not_removed,edp for groceries edp for gas and edp for amazon for me now
churning,not_removed,i dont think there are replacements that count sams club gas as gas stations and targetwalmart as grocery stores like the sallie mae did
churning,not_removed,i still have not received anything from them regarding removing bonuses and it says nothing about it in the statement where do you see that the bonus is actually going away ive seen a bunch of posts on this site about it so i believe it but just any to see it with my own eyes
churning,not_removed,i dont understand the thought of opening multiple cards to max categories that dont offer ms techniques stick with bonuses imo those that ms hard already have any and all cards posted in the links you provided
churning,not_removed,ive seen commentary in the daily threads about this change possibly creating a hardpull or a new line of credit as someone well under this is concerning is there any validity to this if so would you pc or just close entirely it doesnt look like barclay has much to offer for a pc but id prefer to keep the aaoa up if possible
churning,not_removed,so i redeemed all my points for a statement credit but then i had to return one of the items now im at like points how will this effect me as i plan on never using the card again as for alternatives i think ill just use my freedomink cash for gas amazon and fu for grocery stores as the freedom doesnt count target as grocery store and they dont sell target gift cards at the office depot near me
churning,not_removed,haha well said i just decided to order a replacement card so i have a shiny one to hold when im feeling nostalgic xd
churning,not_removed,oh i hadnt noticed the ebay bucks changes from october because i had already maxed out my ebay bucks for the quarter when i placed my last gift card order not that it matters much anyway considering its only outside of bonuses now for portals my very recent experience has been that several ebay categories that shouldnt track actually do i wouldnt necessarily count on it but it doesnt hurt to go through a portal regardless of what youre buying you might be surprised at the results edit shopathome is actually advertising even though the fine print says cashback is not available on any gift cards
churning,not_removed,that walmart was huge definitely going to miss this perk
churning,not_removed,im told walmart often codes as grocery on the boa cash rewards card
churning,not_removed,from the letter they sent out on march any points earned but not yet redeemed under the old sallie mae rewards mastercard will be transferred to your new commence mastercard account
churning,not_removed,i zeroed out mine as well trying to figure out how to give this card a heros funeral going to use discover it for gas and probably bce for groceries unless im working on new cards minimum spend
churning,not_removed,im thinking about cards will replace the one freedomdiscover rotating for blue cash everyday for on groceries running the numbers on bcp but its close chase amazon for on amazon costco visa for at on gas i dont spend so much on gas that is a big deal
churning,not_removed,ditto
churning,not_removed,maybe im going this path ive been ccu user for a while but only with debit card and the lowest reward tier i still dont like the idea of using my slot with ccus credit card but if i do mild ms to hit spending it probably worth for long run
churning,not_removed,the points you have will be converted to commence cashback and the new card will have a minimum redemption so if you have less just wait out the new card
churning,not_removed,thats exactly what im doing havent redeemed any if my points since the letter came out announcing the end of the card once my points transfer over ill redeem to pay down my student loan to take advantage of the bonus and then toss the card in a drawer to never use again
churning,not_removed,amazon has their own card
churning,not_removed,just checked the letter i received from barclay and youre correct its march fixed thanks
churning,not_removed,nope unless you can buy cheaper gas from other gas stations
churning,not_removed,i was heavily considering the bcp for groceries as well as gas because i dont have a better gas card ive been tempted by the umb simply rewards visa because it would offer on restaurants and fast food as well as groceries gas and discount stores ill probably go with bcp because spend justifies it having done the math but im leery about the af full disclosure not a churner just into maximizing conventional cashback i dont really amazon enough year round to benefit from a standalone chase amazon but might get it anyway especially now that its due to having prime
churning,not_removed,im single and so dont spend enough on groceries to justify a bcp i have a bce and a boa cash rewards which gets me on both but i have to weigh those against the cfus ur for me thats really close in value and i might just start putting groceries and gas on the fu it also takes me a long time to buy enough groceries and gas to get to the redemption threshold on the bce and the boa cr and the cfu route doesnt have that hurdle if i had any love for mr id use my amex ed for groceries i guess
churning,not_removed,bcp for groceries amazon gcs bought at grocery store for amazon gas gift cards bought at grocery store for gas i get double fuel points for amazon gc s so another plus
churning,not_removed,blue cash preferred for groceries amazon chase for amazon and penfed cash rewards for gas
churning,not_removed,bcp for groceries ink for store cards amazon ebay
churning,not_removed,i am planning on using the amex edp for all regular spend going to be replacing my double cash i am sure i could sneak out a bit more with multiple cards but reaching the transactions a month on one card said and done will be nice if you have done the math on the edp with bonus its very nice once my amazon credit balance runs out probably in a year i am highly considering wasting a slot on the amazon card
churning,not_removed,edp for amazon by buying gc at a grocery store
churning,not_removed,yeah ive been grappling with this as well target redcard will give on target another mastercard with grocery bonuses would probably work with walmart and target but i dunno what fits amex doesntwould visa
churning,not_removed,sams club does have its own gas card i was planning on getting that at one point but it requires a same club membership which i cant say for sure i would keep for life
churning,not_removed,same here ive been waiting for some communication from barclaycard on this but havent seen anything im planning for the worst anyway
churning,not_removed,my lifetime earnings from the sallie mae mc without any ms far exceed any signup bonus ive ever received this is not the only card that i opened without a signup bonus yet i ended up massively profiting from sometimes you have to consider how a card can be useful in the long run and of course many of the cards listed can be converted from some old unused cards you dont necessarily have to open a new account specifically for this
churning,not_removed,if you have high organic spending its not really one or the other you fully optimize both i love opening a new card that includes a bonus but i know i will also be spending heavily on if i didnt have businesses with high expenses i probably wouldnt bother with the category rewards as much on groceries and gas a years is nothing compared to what i would spend on postage with the ink preferred that card is a godsend
churning,not_removed,it will not be a hard pull nor will it be a new line of credit the account isnt changing lenders you are just getting a nerfed version of the old product i would assume the account number may change but the history as far as the credit bureau will not be touched
churning,not_removed,new line of credit is feasible although its hard to say whether or not the credit bureaux will see it like that hard pull is not going to happen consent is mandatory for hard pulls and youd have very easy grounds for getting the pull removed from your report
churning,not_removed,buy something with it to get your balance back to or close to zero
churning,not_removed,i will try to get a dp for ebay gc cash back i am planning on buying a month of ebay gcs so i will be trying to max out every facet of this plan
churning,not_removed,cool glad to hear theres still some options ive been going through lots of the portals since the change and all the ones ive tried list the transaction and show earned
churning,not_removed,discover it has on gas for this quarter plus if its your first year youll get all the cashback you earned over the year again on your anniversary so gas would be back in that case
churning,not_removed,if im not mistaken the costco visa only provides but is only redeemable in a costco voucherreward is this correct
churning,not_removed,this is a great tip thank you
churning,not_removed,im really curious to see how they implement it but it could still be worth it to put utility charges on the card after it changes
churning,not_removed,theres a bonus for redeeming it towards student loans
churning,not_removed,if you are close to but dont quite meet it organically you can buy amazon g c s at the grocery store and save the hard pull for another c c it works out for me esp because i get fuel points for gift cards at my kroger brand store when i had both active sallie mae mc and bcp i also did a lot of category transfer by buying metabanks and spending them on things like auto insurance and jet dot com purchases they count as debit cards on jet and so get you extra off which cancels the activation fee
churning,not_removed,boa cash rewards is on groceries
churning,not_removed,im thinking along these same lines except probably the blue cash everyday for groceries i dont buy enough to justify the annual fee on the preferred ill try awhile living off gift cards though because i dont want to waste all three of these on slots i used to have the amazon but closed it ages ago before i knew anything about credit cards im until next march ouch still debating whether i want to wait for the ink preferred until then or focus elsewhere
churning,not_removed,yeah not a big fan of prepaying gift cards maybe ill get the new chase amazon card its a metal card anyway
churning,not_removed,my lifetime earnings from the sallie mae mc without any ms far exceed any signup bonus ive ever received our experience differs i cashed out my sallie mae card for the first time since having it and only had or so in cash rewards i suppose may be larger than a single signup bonus ive received in the past but its possible to do far less work and get darn near it capone spark business is a few months ago boa mlb cards were each and you could do of those in one shot for in sign up bonus i really liked the sallie mae for groceries but bcp is a decent replacement you want to talk about the best card bonus that would have to be the chase aarp visa card which gave cash back on every purchase for months man i miss that card
churning,not_removed,very good points thanks for the response will have to look into product changes on some of these unfortunately some of the best seem to be no longer be available
churning,not_removed,i think this post was focused on msers not on casual people that neither churn nor ms
churning,not_removed,personally i combine ill churn bank accounts but credit cards i generally will skip unless its something i already know ill use like united mp points or the card itself is something that has cashback that ill use as a regular card
churning,not_removed,sounds like a pretty intense strategy
churning,not_removed,yeah i just missed the cutoff for that as i had gotten the card the year before and didnt qualify oh well i dont use my discover too much but they really do have the best customer service website and app
churning,not_removed,yes but you can bring that voucher to customer service and get back cold hard cash rather than needing to use it on a purchase
churning,not_removed,yeah you get a bonus on your points if you use them to pay down a student loan its the only new benefit on the card worth mentioning and combined with the current earning rate makes the effective
churning,not_removed,fyi you can also actually churn the jet dot com off new user account promos only the single use ones for first purchase not the ones for first three orders which seem tied to shipping address but i would avoid overdoing this as i am sure they catch on eventually
churning,not_removed,that thought also occurred to me as well as potentially buying gas gift cards although ive read that can be hard to manage my natural grocery spend is high enough that id come out on top by getting the bcp versus bcesome other grocery card but still probably more than short of the cap unfortunately no kroger around me so no extra incentive to buy gcs but thats a sweet deal essentially the situation i want to avoid is not having enough grocery spend to cancel out the af and make worst case scenario bcp equal to the bces and being faced with downgrading which would forego the signup bonus on any future bce app i recognize that this fear is irrational though by making my so an au on bcp this should never be a concern provided that i dont move to an area where the grocery store doesnt take amex
churning,not_removed,correct bce gets gas and boa cr gets groceries
churning,not_removed,not like youd ever really want to carry it but yeah it looks nice ill get one if after i drop below and pickup some nicer bonuses
churning,not_removed,to be fair if your lifetime earnings on that card were only then you grossly underutilized it if you had maxed it out youd have gotten per year if you already had options for or more on gas groceries and or amazon then opening a sallie mae mc probably wasnt the best idea to begin with you mention the boa mlb thats another good example of how signup bonuses arent necessarily the number one reason to pick a card you could open boa mlb and get a onetime lump sum or you could instead open boa bbr and get every months when youve been churning long enough there comes a point when you realize that you cant keep opening cards at the same pace as you were when you started and you instead have to work with what you already have
churning,not_removed,only problem with bcebcp is that several grocery stores in my area dont take amex
churning,not_removed,a new account without a hard pull still keeps you under
churning,not_removed,got it i lost my information so i had no idea for the bonus ill have to wait until after march to redeem it correct
churning,not_removed,thanks for your clarification i have definitely read some threadsposts here and elsewhere about vgc fraud which is my biggest fear with vgc s but thankfully hasnt happened to me yet i do have a drawer where i keep all vgc receiptspackagingetc in one zip loc per vgc until i have completely used them also btw i have noticed different vgc products are very different metabanks in my experience are by far the best for actual offcategory spend you set a full billing address using online site set pin using number and are good to go amex gift cards are ok but have to set billing address via phone call with actual person also any returns take one week to post which is a long time finally you can cash them out via venmo but i got my account frozen pretty quickly doing this i am not a venmo user otherwise and have to provide driver s license pic bank account statement and promise to never do again before they unfroze i had an experience buying one five back g c online with significant discount and then used it to buy onevanilla at cvs the onevanillas are horrible for actual off category spend you can only set a billing zip code and a lot of legitimate online stores will rejectdecline one vanilla s due to no billing address basically avoid these at all costs for actual off category spend vs people who buy m o s which i have personally not donenot part of my strategy
churning,not_removed,to be fair if your lifetime earnings on that card were only then you grossly underutilized it if you had maxed it out youd have gotten per year if you already had options for or more on gas i have better options than on gas groceries which is what i used it on exclusively and or amazon making amazon purchases on this card is a waste of good spend buying amazon gift cards as grocery back on sallie mae and getting at least and sometimes back in free fuel then opening a sallie mae mc probably wasnt the best idea to begin with it was the best card for groceries with no annual fee when youve been churning long enough there comes a point when you realize that you cant keep opening cards at the same pace as you were when you started and you instead have to work with what you already have i guess i havent hit that yet and ive done a moderate amount i dont ms i just make legitimate expenditures medicaldental procedures home improvements college tuition and the like life has many expensive spending needs its not difficult to pick up a card for the sign up bonus then close it out later
churning,not_removed,a year is the best card around that is better then signup bonuses sure there are cards that blow signup bonuses out of the water but they have to be capable of generating more than a year to get that qualification in my book
churning,not_removed,yikes i havent run into that before that would definitely present a problem for the benefit of others in your position which is your preferred nonamex grocery card
churning,not_removed,that was my understanding
churning,not_removed,interesting i appreciate the insight although i was only really talking about buying amazon gcs i have a lot of respect for those who are effective at getting vgc purchases via cc to be worth it via various means but im just not up to the task i also just dont have a need to ms as im not a traveler so not into the cspcsr cards with the large min spends
churning,not_removed,thats on gas not groceries categories to me are basically meaningless since a double cash fidelity etc pays on any purchase
churning,not_removed,getting at least and sometimes back in free fuel bruh you get gallons a fillup do you even gas cans btw did you see docs post on fuel points also funding cell phones if you spend enough it could be worthwhile
churning,not_removed,probably the citi doublecash or a new card if im going for its signup bonus
churning,not_removed,risky are the points still to for cents
churning,not_removed,ah ok got it thanks for the clarification that you were talking about amazon gcs
churning,not_removed,we have a what card wednesday for this
churning,not_removed,the spend is less than the net of with sc but the real question is why are you applying for a offer just get the plat you should be able to get a temp number when you do it another question why pay for a flight when youre getting points
churning,not_removed,they both seem pretty meh honestly try again
churning,not_removed,removed ask in what card wednesday or moronic monday
churning,not_removed,do it plat is one of the best offers out there and not everyone is able to get it dont pass it up
churning,not_removed,so the standard plat offer get a damn sapphire reserve though son
churning,not_removed,father in law just got that hes so cheap he will never pay the annual fee though what a waste
churning,not_removed,how do i get targeted for this exact offer i only have amex spg for less than a year
churning,not_removed,i just got this in the mail too seems like spend is the best it gets ill probably do it and you should too
churning,not_removed,good that you could get the amex and the chase bad that you dont have the knowledge yet so read as much as you can and learn
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,i didnt read the fine print or the details do these offers expire soon also can you help elaborate on sorry new to this
churning,not_removed,usually not having an amex card helps
churning,not_removed,i would like to tell you that this is the greatest youtube video ever
churning,not_removed,bad to open both at the same time also if reserve offer is as a start would it improve or go down in points as time goes on
churning,not_removed,what he means by is that you should try to apply for chase cards first before going for other cards because they dont allow you to open more than credit card accounts within a month period if you have any other questions about this feel free to pm me
churning,not_removed,maybe read the fine print then youll find that folks here are generally against spoon feeding instead of asking the sub find the info yourself its literally in the mailer just read it
churning,not_removed,if you are talking about the mpx reimbursement there is currently another thread discussing this very thing apparently there have been no reimbursements since nov
churning,not_removed,i must admit im laughing pretty hard over here thank you sir
churning,not_removed,csr will likely decrease sometime soon id open both at the same time if you can stomach the min spend
churning,not_removed,awesome thank you for that breakdown much appreciated
churning,not_removed,fair enough just didnt know if it was a standard thing for this card
churning,not_removed,there should be a date on the mailer saying when the offer expires
churning,not_removed,i love when they feel the need to give you a chart of back values or like at a store when something is off and they have a chart up of retail price vs sale price it makes me sad for the average persons math skills honestly
churning,not_removed,damnit i used my free night award instead of points for my recent stay
churning,not_removed,old news try using the search button next time
churning,not_removed,is this for card members only
churning,not_removed,does it apply to cash points redemptions
churning,not_removed,is this confirmed for all cardholders i never got an email and the tc mentions needing to be targetted it did allow me to register though
churning,not_removed,im using points this upcoming week is it too late for me
churning,not_removed,im sure way too much thought went into the psychology behind showing the of x saved when a discount is offered instead of making it easy to calculate just put the number there for instant gratification
churning,not_removed,yup
churning,not_removed,i had reached out to hyatt on twitter as well as a few others on here all signs point to getting the bonus as long as you register
churning,not_removed,i just redeemed a stay this past weekend noticed this option after i made the reservation so i reserved my room registered for this promo stayed in that order so far i have not seen the credit ill give a couple more days and then contact hyatt to see if i can get it credited
churning,not_removed,yes i do have it
churning,not_removed,i just registered and it mentions nothing about having to book your stay after registration all it says is that if you register and use points between these dates then you will get back i took screenshots of this
churning,not_removed,i had a stay and got the email today i called and they said that if the stay was before it will credit regardless of when you register
churning,not_removed,the promotion landing page says it credits weeks after your stay
churning,not_removed,how do i sign up for this through chase or through hyatt
churning,not_removed,i had a stay booked two days before the promo started confirmed via email its eligible so i have something in writing
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,invalid promotion code after click register
churning,not_removed,do you have the chase hyatt cc this promo is for people with that card
churning,not_removed,might want to delete and resubmit rule direct link to blog links to blogs must be submitted only as a part of text posts with enough content that clicking on the actual blog is optional this means that links to either individual blog posts or blog homepages may not be submitted as link posts or as standalone comments this rule is here to prevent people using our sub to generate clicks to blogs
churning,not_removed,you could look at bank of america cash backtravel credit cards they have intro offer for months or the amex blue cash cards they also have the same intro apr offer and also have a bonus on restaurants up to currently
churning,not_removed,rshittychurning
churning,not_removed,chase freedom amex ededp amex blue cash discover it
churning,not_removed,if youre making a significant purchase like that id recommend using it to hit a major sign up bonus and then doing a balance transfer to a nofee card for example you could knock out the whole minimum spend for the spg and then transfer that balance to the chase slate or barclay ring and let it sit there at until you can pay it off youll need to open two cards instead of one but youll end up with a legitimate bonus for your purchase
churning,not_removed,sounds like youre not ready to buy an engagement ring then
churning,not_removed,carrying balances is not really a good idea try to avoid it if at all possible it is always better especially with chase if you can be what they refer to as a paid in full customer
churning,not_removed,could also look into quicksilver from capone and wells fargo cash wise theyd get you flat cash back and apr for and months respectively
churning,not_removed,blue for business was pretty good and has for months
churning,not_removed,and the balance wont show up on your personal credit report
churning,not_removed,wow literally minutes late to getting bucks haha
churning,not_removed,sent
churning,not_removed,try posting in the newbie thread next time theres no af downgrade option
churning,not_removed,close and open the business card if you need the checked bag or points no downgrade i am aware of
churning,not_removed,excel spreadsheet and i use a mouse getoffmylawn
churning,not_removed,mint
churning,not_removed,ynab
churning,not_removed,ynab and auto pay
churning,not_removed,i just use excel for my monthly spendingbudget credit card tracking and bonuses i used to update it daily when i was cycling cards but now its once every week all of my user accounts are handwritten in a notebook because i dont trust my laptop it could fail anytime
churning,not_removed,google sheets which httpwwwdoctorofcreditcomtoolscreditcardbankbonusspreadsheettrackinginformation
churning,not_removed,i have a gigantic excel that i update almost every day track all credit cards with limit open date statement date payment history have another tab for all current balances checking savings investments all cards then another sheet to get monthly snapshots of that and also net worth tracking another for points tracking all bonuses received redemptions referral bonuses and current point balances and when they expire there are like more tabs but those are the important ones
churning,not_removed,mint spreadsheet mrs origwirehead takes care of bills travel is managed in trips which are managed in a separate spreadsheet each trip i track flight hotel transportation entertainment i aggregate up the numbers to main spreadsheet for the year that give me total costs for flights hotels etc etc so pretty much mint and a bunch of spreadsheets for points awardwallet
churning,not_removed,ive used quicken ever since microsoft money got the axe
churning,not_removed,love mint been using it for years
churning,not_removed,i have a few spreadsheets one for credit cards one for budget i only use one card at a time most efficient use of spending is to not have daily spend everything goes toward a min spend req apart from brand cards for reserving rooms and such remembering to pay is much easier when theres only i use mint for highlevel tracking but ive long since stopped trying to track exact numbers in each category
churning,not_removed,i put every expensetransferincome into a spreadsheet and mark which cardaccount the money camewent to so it tracks the balance i have in each of my checkingsavings accounts the balance on each credit card as well as a breakdown of expenses by type etc
churning,not_removed,ynab for daily spending an excel sheet for monthly expense tracking cc offer tracking and tracking mint for net worth tracking
churning,not_removed,ynab daily i input monthly expenditure into a google sheet along with monthly point valuationredemptions net worth etc theres a day ynab link floating around somewhere if you cant find it let me know i have it saved somewhere and if youre a student you get a year free they stack so sign up using day link then email them for the year credit
churning,not_removed,iosmac app called money pro syncs over icloud so its nice when putting in purchases on my phone and reviewing my budget on my computer
churning,not_removed,budget mintcom i dont own much relatively speaking so its not too much of an issue for me and cc companies are stepping up their security game imo its good enough for spotting something i dont recognize and immediately calling to have it resolved doesnt cost me hours of work bills all on auto dont even pay attention to and whenever i visit bank site to view points i pay off we is on each card typically everything is paid off within a week of the actual spend all cc info including apps cancellation dates points excel travel tabulations excel
churning,not_removed,ynab mint i have set all of my credit cards so the due dates are all on the same day and on autopay all my bills are usually the same day so thats also a scheduled transaction in ynab also honestly having the ability to input transactions on my mobile device and have it automatically sync and the convenience it offers me is worth the price of admission to me even if i could make a spreadsheet i dont feel its worth the approx dollars a month to me to bother figuring out how i had the buy one use always and was fine with paying the fees for nynab aka the online subscription based one mint ive never really thought twice about because i feel they are secure enough and are from the same company that does turbo tax so they have a lot to lose if a security issue occurs
churning,not_removed,i use google sheets as well that way i can update whenever i want
churning,not_removed,mint and spreadsheets mint is more for big picture keeping track of accounts and to catch if anything weird spreadsheets i keep track of data by hand with some formulas just a one place to find everything
churning,not_removed,mint monitoring bank fees and watching for fraud would be a pain in the ass otherwise i world legitimately limit the number of accounts i open if it wasnt for mint have everything on auto pay so not worried about dude dates
churning,not_removed,bills everything on auto pay as a backup i usually pay all ccs twice a month ccs spreadsheet duh expenses personal capital travel wife
churning,not_removed,changing all credit card due dates to the same day and autopay helps
churning,not_removed,in my experience mint is terrible it always messes things up i deleted it
churning,not_removed,last pass calendar reminders
churning,not_removed,quicken to handle all accounts and payment records mint as a day to day transactions and to keep track of current balance google sheet for account openingclosing info points balance ms and others
churning,not_removed,to answer the question about tedious billpay since i may several cards with i cant rely on autopay each month it takes about an hour or so to login to every account copy balances choose whether to pay statement balance or include payment for recent purchasespending choose which bank account will pay which credit bill and pay them for managing or so accounts across or so logins
churning,not_removed,on my pc ynab classic app on phone and lastpass i reconcile every weekend what i really need to organize are all the paper documents i have from new cards and banks accounts
churning,not_removed,windows notepad for purchases at first date merchant amount card used after a week or two depending on how often i use my cards ill transfer that information manually into google sheets to add up total spend i log into my credit accounts everyday to monitor activity so a mental note of statement cycle end date is good enough
churning,not_removed,bills due dates and payments easy make all cards have the same due date then either pay them once a month or twice before and after statement posts if you want to lower due balance on statement for large balances
churning,not_removed,unless i have a specific reason to stagger my dates for cash flow reasons i like to line up most of my cards to have the same due date for example all of my chase cards have the same date so i can knock off everything with one login ill stagger a second major spender like my amex stuff to be set off two weeks though
churning,not_removed,anyone using httpswwwtillerhqcom it looks useful if youre willing to maintain a spreadsheet but its
churning,not_removed,if your employer offers it hellowallet is fantastic and their support responds very quickly i probably wouldnt pay for it myself though
churning,not_removed,seeing so many people using spreadsheets that they update daily or a handwritten log make me so glad i was born in the and avoided that kind of mindset mint all the way with all my accounts on autopay never have to worry about tracking anything myself and never had any issues i cringe every time i see my mom pull out her checkbook or keep her receipts for restaurant purchases
churning,not_removed,kind of related does anyone know if mint and chase still dont get along last i read is that chase wont protect your account if its attached to mint
churning,not_removed,oo that sounds like a lot of work do you do account for deprecation taxes and amortization what about cash
churning,not_removed,was microsoft money decent i work at a mid sized bank and got bitched out the other day because re qif file my banks site downloads would no longer load properly in the customers microsoft money needless to say i wasnt amused
churning,not_removed,dynamics is great just be the one using it not the one supporting it
churning,not_removed,i dont care if they sell my data mint so goooooood
churning,not_removed,i dont use mint for my bills but its the only way i could keep track of my expenses i travel for work a lot and couldnt imagine keeping track of all business expenses without it unless of course i only used one card for business but then id miss out on all the sweet points with mint i can use one card for the hotel another for flights food others then i just see all the expenses from that time period in one spot
churning,not_removed,how safe is it
churning,not_removed,i do something similar but amex has a cool feature of tags i use that extensively to tag each purchase to its purpose so cvs rent mortgage etc are all tagged direclty there so no need of tracking them seperately as long as the deductions are legit and the bills are paid and auto pay is set for those cards which again amex is good since you have enter that info only once and it auto picks up for all acccounts then there is not much work post that max possible automation
churning,not_removed,for restaurants you keep itemized receipts for places youre worried might pull shit like fraudulent tips i keep the receipts until the transactions post and then i dump the receipts even just having the customer copy of the credit card transcript receipt saved me once for instance when a restaurant stuck a fucking surcharge onto my bill
churning,not_removed,spreadsheets also allow additional analysis
churning,not_removed,they made up source
churning,not_removed,to be fair i get why chase does that if something happened to mint chase customers would be affected chase can only do so much to protect you unless something happened to the party you give your chase login credentials to
churning,not_removed,ive never encountered show stopping bugs mint is a shitshow though
churning,not_removed,ill second that ynab bugs arent common for me whereas i had a lot more with mint but the real reason i like ynab is because of its different budgeting model compared to mint budgeting cash you have now versus projecting and budgeting future income then again my income is probably more variable than most peoples i also prefer manual transaction entry that later get confirmed with imports versus just importing because it keeps me more aware of my budgets but thats just me
churning,not_removed,yeah its a decent amount of work only tabs i update regularly the rest are maybe a couple times a month probably spend minutes a week on it for taxes i keep track of taxed paid and estimate how much needs to be paid the rest of the year we live in the city with a car we dont care about and dont own so no depreciation i do keep track of student loans though how much paid that month current balance as those go into net worth also estimated payoff date
churning,not_removed,oh and yes cash is on there as part of my balances cash accounts investment accounts retirement accounts card balances loan balance all get tracked
churning,not_removed,i used it from to so i liked it pretty well its been gone for years so they need to move on
churning,not_removed,its funny money and quicken used to be great then starting in the early every update made them worse
churning,not_removed,i would pay mint for no ads and the ability to export data on quicken format i want to long term back up my data offline
churning,not_removed,time will tell of course but ive had zero issues in using it since with quite a few accounts they also have twostage authentication for unknown devices where theyll have to text me i do recommend it it takes a little while to set up and get used to the format but it very quickly becomes incredibly useful
churning,not_removed,hmm thanks for the clarification when it comes to student loans do you have a way to calculate the payoffroi for a certain payment amount each month i always try to model that but its difficult to calculate the opportunity cost of a larger payment
churning,not_removed,lol yea they said we were losing customers over it even though we never supported it to my knowledge
churning,not_removed,its not your data httpswwwmintcomterms
churning,not_removed,well i just consider my roi as the interest rate every dollar of principal im no longer paying that in interest so thats my return i basically have investment and cash targets then dump the rest on loans rates arent low enough to make an investment vs payment decision i also track my balance and what payments are required for target payoff date but because im always overpaying i make sure i hit those cash and investment targets as my primary goal
churning,not_removed,some customers are worth losing the juice isnt worth the squeeze
churning,not_removed,my dad still uses it on an old windows xp laptop im sorry on his behalf
churning,not_removed,yea that hes using both of them
churning,not_removed,i might do this it would be nice to actually have decent conversation about credit cards and not be looked at like a fico score killer edit im in
churning,not_removed,interested
churning,not_removed,out of town again sigh
churning,not_removed,wow ill actually be in town that day maybe ill stop by barrel republic sells wine too that place is the best
churning,not_removed,whoa cool im in north county but might make the drive i am still new to churning and would love a little guidance or at least thoughts on my plans would this not be the occasion for this
churning,not_removed,hmm worth it from la let me think
churning,not_removed,nice i live nearby so i might bike on over
churning,not_removed,lll be in la otherwise id join in next time
churning,not_removed,sure everyone is welcome
churning,not_removed,im in north county as well and would have loved to carpool with you if i were not working that day
churning,not_removed,i used to do gift card redemptions with chase ur i know and probably of the time i would not receive the envelope with the gift cards and would have to call in and have them send it via fedex instead of regular mail this happened with two different addresses in different states so it was something on chases end i have no doubt there is serious theftfraud going on with gift card redemptions my guess is someone in the fulfillment department
churning,not_removed,capital one customer service is a joke they had a promotion for that they let you sign up for and tells you everything is ok and then they dont actually pay you the money just a scam customer service they literally spent god knows how long to deny me seems like a poor trade off for them
churning,not_removed,not sure if it is related but i saw an article on the hackernews a few days back that said there is currently a huge botnet effectively brute forcing gift card numbers
churning,not_removed,i just had this issue today i received the gift cards in the mail a couple weeks back and just got around to redeeming them tonight and found that of the had already been redeemed good to know they refunded the points but what a hassle edit called this morning and they told me that points was the maximum a supervisor could refund at the time i asked for cash credit to my statement reaching i know and they said no i told them i didnt find the points adequate they gave me the same miles for inconvenience and started some other bs process which ill hear the result of in days im assuming they will only offer the same points refund she offered to have the amazon gift cards resent and then had no answer when i asked how do i know the same wont happen again and what will capital one do if it does they actually tried blaming amazon too which i thought was funny
churning,not_removed,im not sure it is but could be related
churning,not_removed,if you dont want to deal w the gift cards just make a refundable booking with hotelscom wait for the charge to post to your card balance then cancel the booking the charge will come off your balance but should remain as an eligible travel charge in your reward portal cash out for the full value of your points without tying them up in gift cards
churning,not_removed,so much cap one hate in this thread but my experience with them has been phenomenal super easy redemption and great customer service
churning,not_removed,had my venture for years now always been treated well got second venture today miles might downgrade first to cash
churning,not_removed,i have to say cap one customer service is a joke i sent an email requesting they reduce my credit line and they responded with an email we have closed your account as requested wtf
churning,not_removed,i just discovered this problem today when i tried to use one of my gcs none of the cards i have worked not happy about that ill be calling tomorrow
churning,not_removed,i know this is an old post but i stumbled upon it via a google search i was trying to find out why amazon gift cards were no longer offered and if they ever will be again capital one venture card besides the missing amazon option i have not had a negative experience with redeeming points for gift cards
churning,not_removed,im currently irritated with cap one about their lack of secure message capability im in japan for weeks and my autopay didnt process dont feel like calling them from here
churning,not_removed,how do you get amazon gift cards from these days i have the points just dont see the option
churning,not_removed,yes i traded in points for over of used amazon gift cards co just sent me a check im contacting the attorney general
churning,not_removed,theres your first problem having a product
churning,not_removed,curious what is the best value for their miles redemption is it using the travel credit for purchases or actually booking travel through their portal
churning,not_removed,lol cap one sucks only bank that has ever denied me a credit card since i got into churning screw their hard pulls will never do business with them ever again
churning,not_removed,only tangentially related had some gift cards on our wedding registry someone sent us two but they never arrived amazon cs was not helpful at all
churning,not_removed,ive had the same thing happen with cashiers checks with chase never trust chase to send you anything in the mail
churning,not_removed,it may be in the post office as well at work a bunch of checks that were mailed to our po box went missing over a period of several months last year opened a case with the nypd and low and behold there was is a pretty intricate ring of people involving postal workers and bank employees that would take these checks and deposit them into accounts that were clearly not ours fbi is involved and trying to gather info to take down the whole ring
churning,not_removed,heck when i signed up there was a crazy error where i received the card but my online account would not work and in their system i was pretty much in limbo as a guest account took phone calls and many promises from them to clear it up and call me back never heard from them even when i tried to ask them to close the account and cancel the cards they sent me they were of no help is capital really this much of a mess
churning,not_removed,dp sorry about your luck i actually tried to cancel and still got paidafter applying in jan i noticed the bonus language disappearedno mention in email so i called in like an idiot csr said that it was targeted and i wasnt eligible i asked to close account and cancel funding transaction got the card in the mail a week later almost chopped it up but put it in my safe forgot about it logged in days later after recent success with wf and amazon reloads ach load amazon reload chaching
churning,not_removed,i just did this promo interesting data point file cfpb complaint
churning,not_removed,hmm that is clever
churning,not_removed,my experience is purely anecdotal but capital one failed to send me my quicksilver card in september i called in and asked them to send a replacement card to my office that one never showed up called in again asking them to send it via fedex or ups with signature required for delivery that one never arrived either took months to get my card to show up and by that time it was too late to earn the bonus in my experience capital one is entirely incompetent whereas ive found american express to be pretty sharp
churning,not_removed,rtotallylegitnotashill
churning,not_removed,i decided to go ahead and call tonight i have to say it was painless and the cs rep was super nice and helpful total time on the phone was and all point will be refunded to my card in days rep said the problem was only with amazon gift cards no rant here great experience so far
churning,not_removed,they used to be there i was looking earlier today and couldnt find them
churning,not_removed,the two sparks cards have a combined sign up bonus of freeze one bureau and theyre strong sign up bonuses when youve maxed out other banks
churning,not_removed,agreed was a noob first card years ago
churning,not_removed,is there another card besides quicksilver with no foreign transaction fees and cash back on purchases
churning,not_removed,not sure but the value i got and the card cash in was a penny a point you can probably get better buying flights etc but i figured id just give the gift cards out as gifts glad i tried to cash one before sending them out would have been embarrassing
churning,not_removed,seems like they are the ones that decided not to do business with you
churning,not_removed,yeah theyre pretty inquirysensitive on their venture card they denied me in feb
churning,not_removed,i had a spark when i first started my business when i was they froze my account because i added an employee wanted me to call them back to say it was me sent me security codes on mobile and email to prove it was actually me
churning,not_removed,try telling that to my parents who refuse to do direct deposit seriously though the only thing id ever rely on a bank sending me on time is a bill or a card
churning,not_removed,there was a massive bust for mail theft by usps in southern california recently
churning,not_removed,it works for barclays arrival boa travel rewards discover it miles etc most any travel rewards card that works on a reimbursement basis other folks say that buying refundable airline tickets also work but thats a larger purchase and i think there are some strings attached theres a difference bw refundable and fully refundable for example i find the hotelscom trick is much simpler
churning,not_removed,does freezing one bureau allow you to get
churning,not_removed,easy to get spark flavors
churning,not_removed,they have to pull bureaus correct cap cant pull just one
churning,not_removed,keep the card reload amazon gift card balance every month forgives small balance profit
churning,not_removed,if it was your first card you really shouldnt close it you should consider product changing to a noannualfee product if capitalone allows that then keep it in your sock drawer and use it once a year it will help your credit in the long run keeping your oldest card open
churning,not_removed,lol my first card as well years ago
churning,not_removed,arrival but the redemption process is pretty lame
churning,not_removed,bank of america travel rewards although the cash back has to be redeemed against qualifying travel expenses for statement credit and must be so its not just an automatic statement credit of
churning,not_removed,nah it just blocks capone from pulling all three which theyre prone to doing freezing one wont affect approval though apparently freezing two will
churning,not_removed,i didnt have any problems about months apart i believe both were instant approvals
churning,not_removed,technically all but yeah you can only freeze one of them and except to still get approved
churning,not_removed,whats the largest balance they will forgive
churning,not_removed,discover forgives up to
churning,not_removed,i buy a cheap nasty burger from mcdonalds
churning,not_removed,well that was the plan to pc to quicksilver but the whole experience left me disappointed with them i may reconsider if i check the impact it will have on my score
churning,not_removed,also has an annual fee that kills it for me no way id have enough in rewards to offset that
churning,not_removed,as someone who doesnt really travel enough to redeem rewards for travel that doesnt sound super useful
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,discover forgives
churning,not_removed,i dont think youll find a single person who will tell you to close your first cc unless it has a huge af i know youre pissed at capitalone and your pride makes you want to close the card but just think of it that from this point forward you are benefiting from them and not giving them anything in return ie using the card as little as possible thats how id look at it to make myself feel better about the situation
churning,not_removed,yeah a is by far the worst af card out there zero recurring benefit to offset it
churning,not_removed,fair enough
churning,not_removed,dumb just dumb
churning,not_removed,you should post this in rshittychurning
churning,not_removed,rshittychurning for sure yeah you can take advantage of this without going crazy and trying to minimize everything probably not worth the effort anyway
churning,not_removed,dont expect any status perks when you book through priceline or any other third party travel agency
churning,not_removed,i wouldnt expect it this is why i make it a point to book on the brand website if the price difference is that large submit a best rate guarantee claim
churning,not_removed,daily discussion thread
churning,not_removed,i also recommend waiting for tomorrow to post your questions youll get a lot of information from the what card wednesday thread
churning,not_removed,first this would be a question for what card wednesday i would suggest posting there tomorrow second we need more info where are you wanting to travel whats your home airport when were your current cards opened basically everything wcw asks for third for referrals please look on the sidebar for links to the official referral threads theres a thread for each card that allows referrals fourth check the spreadsheet for the current best offers to see if those offers are the best that can be found for the card youre looking at right now
churning,not_removed,due to chase consider their cards first since you already have csp and freedom for help on picking the right chase card you might not be a perfect candidate for the southwest companion pass only because travel doesnt mix with residency ink would be a good addition if youre willing to take out a business card outside of chase if youre a student id guess that cash back would be much more important than hotel and airline points if you do want points id steer you to another transferrable program like amex or citi if you are looking for points imho youd be better off with citi prestige than gold delta especially since you know youll be flying youre already spending the in airlines anyways plus another in january and youre getting paid to keep the card for a year the bofa mlb card is a pretty great deal essentially off in increments a lot of people on rchurning have been getting autoapproved for or of them which can net you or more my personal experience was two pending applications that were approved within hours also dont forget about amex blue cash preferred when i was a student a large majority of my spend was at the grocery store and adds up quick frat social chair has its perks anyways bottom line is dont just get points for the sake of points often cash transferrable points nontransferrable points for more on the concept of transferrable points
churning,not_removed,use the what card wednesday post also need more details on what your goals are
churning,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiccreferrals referrals can be found there always use them off the list and do not respond to pms
churning,not_removed,hilton sign up bonuses give you a lot of points but you gotta look into the value of those points spg points are worth more than and probably hilton points especially if you are traveling for residency interviews as you will likely be in towns with lower level properties and points will go further personally i would go after the ink then ihg spg and maybe hyatt for hotel cards
churning,not_removed,because you are under youll likely want to max out your opportunities with chase before applying for amex cards heres a few chase cards that are currently under for you to look into southwest cards at have a good value even if a companion pass is unimportant to you and they offer quite a few flights out of your home airport atl marriott has a great point offer right now that could be upwards of hotel stays you should check the areas you are planning to travel to see the point cost of the hotels available united has targeted offers of up to available check to see if you are targeted though this may be less useful as there are limited flights out of atl with amex cards you want to be sure to apply when the bonus is high because they will not match point offers whereas chase is more willing to match offers so i would say the hilton is a no go because it is a low offer and offers have been available recently the delta gold at is good but has been available recently earlier this year the delta platinum at is a really good offer i picked up the personal and business versions
churning,not_removed,hey man fm resident here recommend getting sw for interview flights since they are relatively cheap you can go for the sw plus and premier to net you points good enough for rt flights ive tried telling my underclassmen but man they dont like credit cards
churning,not_removed,not churning but use the website skiplaggedcom since several of your interviews will be on short notice and airline points redemptions within a few weeks of travel are expensive skiplagged is all about hidden city travel which is where you book a flight to a destination thats not your intended destination but your flight connects whatever city you are trying to go to and you intentionally miss your connection you have to do carry on bags dont use your frequent flyer account and you have to book one way tickets the website has saved me hundreds of dollars for same exact flight i would have been on
churning,not_removed,hes a medical students with a bunch of upcoming travel what more details could you possibly need geez uvtcapsfan
churning,not_removed,if only there were a podcast where he could get the information he needs
churning,not_removed,i was mostly just interested if he was looking for airlines with friendly stopover rules or wanted a purely distance based carrier
churning,not_removed,its also fine to post today in last weeks thread or ask a question in the monday sticky thread
churning,not_removed,yeahpeople are stupid
churning,not_removed,ha so because i dont want to spam the sub with show content i havent posted anything quite yet i think i am done with my trial period with the live meetings i will keep a live meeting going but its likely going to be a minute convo every couple weeks maybe an hour long show the last monday of every month to recap the month i get a good bit of watchers on the recordings but the number of people tuning in live was decreasing outside of that i think ill do better video work and podcast in a nonlive format it wont bore the regulars since they wont have to listen to it and new people will more clear content to follow at least thats the plans as is its been a crazy summer too and time hasnt been on my side i will have some more time starting next week to get creative and finally get some stuff done
churning,not_removed,none of that is relevant nor is it important to know if he plans to stick to one airline for status reasons what his home airport is airports he will be frequently visiting if hes more of a budget hotel kindda guy i mean med school cant be cheap or even what op considers a lot cuz i have a feeling his version of a lot and version of a lot is probably pretty different joking aside every one of those factors and what uvtcapsfan mentioned above are all relevant when determining a cardairline you should think about using uvervii post all that information on what what card wednesday thread on the sidebar and im sure someone will help you out and please it will save you from downvotes in the future
churning,not_removed,this is good for moronic monday

churning,not_removed,would it really be surprising if citi just decided they didnt care about being competitive
churning,not_removed,the prestige is scalping their rewardsbenefits
churning,not_removed,i dont think this will have great possibility if they do strengthen their partnership with aa they wont let the red aviator card come back alive they just give me the feeling that the only thing they care about is costco
churning,not_removed,i was so hoping this would be an early new years present so disappointing
churning,not_removed,i think citi doesnt give a shit about their customers theyll probably do something when they bleed out
churning,not_removed,seems citi keeps scalping benefits after getting costco thats sad
churning,not_removed,i learned recently that some benefits are less than advertised when trying to book air travel only a few of the flights i found on airlines websites and google flights were available on their travel site when i tried to use points for hotels i found them to be about twice the price of other travel websites
churning,not_removed,even if aa would be added as an option the ratio will not be maybe
churning,not_removed,costco aa
churning,not_removed,this has been a yearly thing that never goes anywhere why would they make typ transfer to aa and have the aa personal cards and exec card aa points are easy enough to get anyways
churning,not_removed,no but ive called multiple times to complainthreaten to close the card due to its lack of competitiveness but the agents who handle the phones seem clueless about the game anyway
churning,not_removed,this is my primary complaint i dont care if they add benefits but taking them away is what really irked me about the changes upcoming in maybe if the fee was dropped it would be worth it to keep
churning,not_removed,but chase has ua card and ur points can be transferred as well if citi wants to retain customers from going to barclays then they should add aa transfer capability but i highly doubt it
churning,not_removed,they dont care lol
churning,not_removed,maybe the average reader of this subreddit has a different definition of competitiveness than citi has and they also have to run a business and cannot randomly increase perks of the cards without additional revenue what should the purpose of a card be that has incredible sign up numbers but is a loss in citis books if you threaten to close the card and it is still open then citi considers its card competitive i do not even think that every wish for additional card bonuses constitutes enough reason for a whole thread here
churning,not_removed,clueless is a good assessment on citiyou honestly think they would know how to be competitive
churning,not_removed,theyre just the first line of defense per se they arent decision makers or even influencers
churning,not_removed,feel for these csrs who you somehow think made the decision and can reverse that decision
churning,not_removed,taking things away is a bad move in my opinionif the upcoming changes were the standard and was and is how it always was its one thing but i cant stomach benefits being taken away while other cards have benefits added
churning,not_removed,what hes trying to say is citi doesnt know or care that its a bad move i believe youre right unless citi does something major or i get a significant retention offer i intend on dumping the prestige come next summer
churning,not_removed,not sure if these were posted seem to have only run into targeted incognito before delta gold public not quite as good as the targeted but looks live until july

churning,not_removed,anyone holding out for targeted looks like its is the highest in recent history theres also a from which requires spend on delta but who does that
churning,not_removed,sweet just got approved went to deltacom clicked through to buy a ticket selected departure and return flights and the ad to apply was at the bottom of the page score thanks
churning,not_removed,thanks much better
churning,not_removed,can you get this for business too
churning,not_removed,i assume this works with a delta gift card purchase
churning,not_removed,newb question how often can you get this bonus
churning,not_removed,what is dummy booking
churning,not_removed,oops i forgot to record the min spend and annual fee info for this offer though the dummy booking anyone
churning,not_removed,delta is awful skypesos not worth the hp stick to other airlines
churning,not_removed,historically no
churning,not_removed,it did for me
churning,not_removed,you would not be eligible you have to have never held the card to get the bonus or it has to have been long enough for amex to have forgotten youve had it you could consider the delta platinum offer but that has a nonwaived annual fee
churning,not_removed,i received the delta gold bonus two years in a row from listening to everyone else it sounds like this was a mistake but its been year since i received my second bonus and nothing bad has happened yet
churning,not_removed,amex limits bonus to once per lifetime
churning,not_removed,just go through the motions of purchasing a flight you have no intention of going on when you get to the payments page the offer will pop up dummy booking just means a fake booking
churning,not_removed,from lax i can frequently get and greater with dl miles that makes this bonus worth to me please dont overgeneralize
churning,not_removed,you would think that i did but then i realized moving closer to a partner hub really helps they are very useful where i live currently
churning,not_removed,get good redemptions where i live got last year to europe economy class miles and fees each ticket for open jaw my dinky airport atl msp amsterdam madrid atlanta my dinky airport was a ticket taxes and fees if i had purchased it skymiles may not be the best but for some of us they actually work out quite well domestic trips ive gotten pretty good redemptions at times as well flying from east coast to lax
churning,not_removed,atl
churning,not_removed,sad day
churning,not_removed,from lax too theyre pretty good got euro redemptions
churning,not_removed,and in delta lounges theyre worth cpp s
churning,not_removed,where do you fly im near lax
churning,not_removed,is there a way to get the credit for the busines version
churning,not_removed,he was asking about the statement credit on the gold which historically you have been able to get on the personal and not the business the link you provided also shows only on the business gold
churning,not_removed,i currently have charge cards and credit cards with amex i just got accepted for the personal gold card not sure if charge or credit do you think id have any trouble getting the business cards right now could i possibly get all gold personal gold business plat business during this promotion period are any of those three cards charge cards
churning,not_removed,thanks for that link
churning,not_removed,its only not the end of the world if you want the do both 😀
churning,not_removed,east coast primarily ny and fl
churning,not_removed,thats what i was asking it appears the answer is no
churning,not_removed,none of these are charge cards theyre all credit cards with credit limits
churning,not_removed,this article is focused on charge cards rather than credit cards but everything still applies thought in particular the section charge accounts are costly was especially interesting offering charge accounts has a cost but since customers expect the same prices whether or not they used a charge account the cost is builtin to the price of goods which means really customers paying cash are paying for the credit and by corollary prices should be cheaper at places that only accept cash whats the cost of credit at the time remember each store had its own card theres the cost of maintaining a credit department the interest lost from the money outstanding fraudulent charges and the opportunity cost of using the capital to expand
churning,not_removed,you applied for the doublecash at ouch
churning,not_removed,you could post something like this in the daily discussion thread if you are looking for suggestions on what to do it doesnt warrant its own post but id recommend you start with the newbie weekly thread and read everything in the sidebar multiple times

churning,not_removed,im new to this subreddit what is everyone keeps talking about
churning,not_removed,been aware of this sub reddit since mid june after i made a few mistakes so hoping to make better choices amex gold merrill lynch csp amex hilton honors cf csr wife has multiple cards including hyatt targeting transferable points hilton hyatt not really loyal to any airline ur mr hilton hyatt ba aa smaller amounts for other airlines and hotels austin first followed by dfw or iah amsterdam in the next months or so additional info a i know that chase business cards will be suggested but my wife is not fully on board yet we have a little trip to san diego in march with car and hotels covered by points so hopefully she is coming around b we dont ms but have natural spend over a month c also i received a targeted mailer for personal united mileage plus for after spend sorry if too much info but wanted to be thorough
churning,not_removed,i would suggest csp ink spg biz marriott spg personal csp because it is under and gets you a lot of ur points ink cards also get you more ur points you will need a business but search through the sites and you will see that a lot of people have businesses or businesses business cards do not count towards so it can help with extending the time you can get chase cards since you are looking at the spg points i would suggest getting the business one first for because it doesnt count towards then you can apply to the chase marriott card which transfers to spg points spg then the personal spg card for another finally you can apply for the marriott business card which is not under for another spg this will give you over spg points once you are done obligatory reminder to use the referral links on this sub to pay it back to the community plus it is the only way to get the ink httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiccreferrals
churning,not_removed,i love the spg card but finish your first you already have two slots blown on the boa and citi cards so dont waste another get csp inkpref and marriott if youre interested in getting spg later once youre beyond grab that spg card remember to use the referral links when appropriate
churning,not_removed,very tough but maybe worth trying
churning,not_removed,id go for ink preferred while under even if just for the bonus id also pc cs to fu or another freedom depending on ability to max quarterly categories
churning,not_removed,i got the business preferred somehow pretty sure i was over too worth a shot
churning,not_removed,fellow tall guy here the one thing churning is missing for me is the ability to gain status delta status ending this year pray for my knees i just got the ink preferred and would say thats a good start chase points are just so damn flexible its hard to turn them down also i know you dont use hotels much neither do i but i was able to get to ihg points and to elite status in traveling with work they have good accelerate programs and you can buy points packages with your stay that are good value for points sometimes and some places have nights for i prefer airbnb too but that many free nights could certainly come in handy at some point
churning,not_removed,how much flexibility do you have on your flights to africa to get flying blue status could you fly delta and credit the miles to afklm even if you dont redeem for hotels the marriott and spg cards are a good option to build up points that could be transferred to flying blue for award travel or upgrades especially if you can favor marriott or starwood hotels on your compd work trips
churning,not_removed,for what its worth you can pc your cs to f or fu today they wont let you go from csp directly but can do csp to cs and cs to fu the next day i did this two months ago and got both my sapphire and freedom unlimited cards in the mail on the same day while youre under id look at the ink preferred and maybe the freedom as well ultimate reward points can be valuable with the csr especially if you max out the quarterly categories depending on your spending habits id consider opening both the freedom and freedom unlimited on the same day then pc your sapphire to another freedom again if you can easily max out the quarterly categories
churning,not_removed,how about the chase sw cards youre under and you could get the cp and fly to many of those baseball stadiums with a companion also i would recommend grabbing a referral link for the ink before they disappear you could ms at instead of cringe
churning,not_removed,i love the spg card but finish off your chase first most point transfers to car rental programs arent worth it but you could stockpile urs and rent in cash at cpp through the ur portal i find that the ur portal often has cheaper rates than youd find elsewhere to begin with
churning,not_removed,mileageplus explorer and marriott while youre under or sw and go for the companion pass if baseball stadiums are your goal amtrak might be a good option for day trips to philly dc boston and baltimore you could combine the pull with alaska for trips between west coast cities
churning,not_removed,according to doc it is not under
churning,not_removed,just weighing inspg hotel redemptions by points tend to be rough if all you have to spend is the bonus obviously theyre super valuable due to the per lifetime bonus and then the extreme airline flexibility butif your goal is to use them to stay at spg properties you might want that free nights bonus spg was approved for me after many recently opened cards so save it for later
churning,not_removed,the other southwest if you want to get the companion pass but if you want more international flexibility id get the chase united or the ink if you are comfortable claiming you have a business
churning,not_removed,get an ink through the before it goes away
churning,not_removed,easy to get chase business card hard to get multiple get ink then get amex biz gold amex bix plat and any other business cards you want
churning,not_removed,chase biz cards do count under biz cards from other banks do not
churning,not_removed,id definitely go for the ink preferred there are other options for hotel cards that would work in se asia ihghyatt that are not effected by that you could grab if there are marriott hotels you were dying to stay at you could get the spg amex link your accounts and transfer the spg points to marriott for points pretty close to what youd get by just getting the marriot chase card
churning,not_removed,theres a big chance that aviator red hasnt hit either i have the hunch that chases info tends to be a few months behind
churning,not_removed,hyatt and spg biz are good hotel cards ritz is exempt but its perks are mostly duplicative of the csr citi aa and delta amex are the obvious airline cards but i dont know enough about san antonio flights to tell you whether there are other options that are better remember to use referral links when appropriate
churning,not_removed,for hotel points get the spg business and marriott business to add to your spg pool ihg could also get you one night somewhere too and it is a nice card to hold long term because of the anniversary free night i dont think hyatt will be too helpful for the region you are looking at
churning,not_removed,my thanksgiving plat still hasnt shown on my credit reports you might be able to squeeze one more chase card in before it reports so the csp or marriott card might be a good fit
churning,not_removed,if youre new start with chase cards you can only have five new accounts in the last two years and is the main reason many people here cannot open new chase cards this is strictly my opinion but i recently helped my friend accumulate chase ultimate reward points in weeks by opening the chase sapphire reserve chase sapphire preferred and chase ink preferred once you have a good option for redeeming points reserve open other cards that will help you earn ur faster like the freedom or freedom unlimited thatll get you started let me know if you need help i or others will be more than happy to lend advice
churning,not_removed,check out the free vacation for newbies on the sidebar its a great way to start i envy your clean slate so much potential and make sure to use the referral threads
churning,not_removed,start off with the csr excellent bonus that will more then cover the annual fee also all the travel benefits will get you a huge start to the hobby
churning,not_removed,csr chase sapphire reserve has absolutely the highest value highest rate of points earn for travel and dining higher than buying delta on a delta card and they apply to almost any airline if you happen to find a better deal on another airline you get a bonus with this card the sign up bonus is worth on travel theyre just sooo flexible you can book using them as cash with a bonus or you can transfer to any airline if rewards nights are cheaper and if youre missing points you can fill that gap its just the best card for so many reasons to me the csr would be a nobrainer for you
churning,not_removed,youre doing well with csp and csr while youre still under id definitely go for the ink the united mpe and either the marriott or a fu after youve cleared out chase move on to the other banks
churning,not_removed,csp if im reading correctly you are at and you want airline miles another ur should help towards your first class aspirations
churning,not_removed,march isnt really high season in paris id guess they have space but you shouldnt take my word for it you can always call hyatt right now to ask them if they have availability the park hyatt vendome is one of the nicest hotels in the world and definitely a good use for hyatt certs also a pretty huge step up from airbnb too and likely to be very much appreciated
churning,not_removed,ph vendome is an awesome place great location looks like they currently have availability end of march for award nights you can check your exact dates online just look for the award nights those can be booked with the free night certs once you have them have her apply right away and meet the min spend as quickly as possible to ensure you dont miss out on availability
churning,not_removed,are you over if so you wont be able to get more ur cards for hamiltonamex you should get a platinum card either wait for the next leaked link or a targeted mailer if you have no amex cards you are more likely to receive the targeted mailer
churning,not_removed,csr and an ink card
churning,not_removed,csr and ink to combine pulls
churning,not_removed,are those dates monthday or monthyear with a typo assuming its the latter you are at so fill in chase slots before moving on definitely csr inkpref requires you to be under but might not count toward so do that second last can be marriott united or sw unless theres another chase card out there that you really like my favorite is marriott because it transfers to spg which transfers to airlines but you may have different preferences the exception to the above is if you really want the sw cp your next two cards should be sw
churning,not_removed,csr would pair nicely with your existing ur points towards a redemption to thailand
churning,not_removed,amex maybe
churning,not_removed,under good credit easily csr first need more info on account dates to know if shes far enough under to do more than one card
churning,not_removed,frankly the most useful thing for you will probably be a card with no foreign transaction fees discover gives you that but going to europe with just a discover is definitely playing on hard mode since you have a relatively limited credit history id try the csp before the csr if you get approved for the csp meet the min spend and use it for a couple months then go back to try for the csr both of these cards have no foreign transaction fees and both give lots of ur points as signup bonuses which is nice
churning,not_removed,csr and an ink card if you do not want a business card then grab the csp instead of the ink
churning,not_removed,there are often cash sales between those cities for roundtrip you could get the chase sapphire reserve points worth cents each
churning,not_removed,csr would be the best card for you you might want to able for a csp or an ink card at the same time chase will only use one hard pull for two cards on the same day
churning,not_removed,citi dc is a card you pc to not a card you apply for its utterly useless as a new card because it gives no signup bonus start with a better citi card then downgrade to dc after a year
churning,not_removed,your best bet is still the csr because of the signup bonus use the calendar year travel credit in and in early then downgrade it to a freedom or freedom unlimited
churning,not_removed,if you have other natural spend get a card with good sign up bonus my personal recommendation is to get the csp for easy ur worth statement credit or on travel if you spend in months it has no annual fee the first year and once you get it you can pc to a non af card so you do not need to close it if you really do want to get into this community everyone will tell you to get csr for that ur bonus for the same spend but it does have a annual fee that is not waived it does have plenty of benefits to outweigh the costs but that is up to you if you want to know more just look in the wiki
churning,not_removed,ink pref with a business will be tough because you already have the ink and chase is very stingy about giving out biz cards you could try two sw but might only get approved for one due to the ink being so recent dps on how ink gets treated are very mixed so its tough to be sure if a single sw is useful go for it if sw is cp or bust for you meaning you need its a risk and up to you whether to try it the safer choice in that case would be marriott or united marriott transfers to spg so i usually prefer that over united but its up to your preferences
churning,not_removed,you already got the ink recently i dont think chase will give you the ink preferred there are data points for being approved for southwest cards on the same day at so you could go for that but youre hitting chase pretty hard in such a short span its hard to say
churning,not_removed,more as miles that means bofa as cards both personal and biz also citi aa is a good option look for a big amex offer like the plat as well dont start in on amex until you get a big offer after that you can also do spg and transfer to as
churning,not_removed,you might want to start with amex
churning,not_removed,if you fly out of msp a lot the amex delta is probably going to be your best bet
churning,not_removed,united mpe for more ua miles
churning,not_removed,i dont like the marriott offer especially in your shoes you already have spg which is marriott points everywhere the promo is only an extra points everywhere over spend an extra total points on the other hand the only requires spending its when you include points on the actual min spend as well now if you had kept the spending on your spg you would have gotten marriott points meaning you come out ahead by points this way so already better than the other option and with only spending instead of easy answer to me
churning,not_removed,non chase hotel cards that you dont have would be marriott biz ritz and fairmont you could also try amexciti hhonors
churning,not_removed,so you want your central america or europe trip in summer to be the premium redemption one person or
churning,not_removed,chase hyatt might work depending on destination on the amex side ed or edp bonus
churning,not_removed,this is where dates really start to matter since the delta plat hasnt hit chase thinks youre at but theyll only give you in days so if that was in early october id wait until days after it was issued and see if delta plat is still off your report if it hasnt hit yet id sneak in a chase
churning,not_removed,looks like youre i would say that the plat is worthy of one of your slots hitting chase for the ur until youre is a good strategy as well
churning,not_removed,get the amex plat the mailer is a golden ticket for all of us take advantage of the bonus travel credit too then downgrade after if you want to avoid the af
churning,not_removed,lots of options since youre only depends on how quickly you want to proceed and how easily you can meet the spend requirements the plat offer is solid and amex usually takes a couple months to report you might want to apply for the ed offer at the same time as the plat if you go that route and are not planning to keep it chase options csp united ewr hub southwest pluspremier for companion pass are you planning to keep the csr
churning,not_removed,all of these recommendations are good for asia transferring will likely get a better value and the amex to ana transfer will likely be your best option just wanted to add that if you are looking for just economy flights get the csp currently airfare tickets from nyc to europe are cheap enough that they cost less on the chase portal through the csr at than transferring to partners within europe ba transfers or budget airlines will get you around fairly quickly and cheaply for business and first class redemptions use the transfer partners check out the point values at awardacecom to see how many points you will need and through which card currency
churning,not_removed,id try the ink if you get a denial dont call recon and just let it slide your score is high enough that the extra hard pull wont kill you theres a chance that your plat hasnt reported yet so chase might think youre only you should be able to get two chase cards if youre lucky and maybe if the ink shakes out right for you
churning,not_removed,if youre only a month from being under that seems like the easy choice csp or marriott depending on how you value marriottspg can pc the csp to the freedomfu later
churning,not_removed,as long as you never plan on being back below some of the best cash back cards are through boa they regularly have on and sometimes do on and theyll let you get several copies of the same card at once in a day usually seems safe plus you can sometimes convert to bbrs when done and keep getting cash forever remember to use referral links if appropriate
churning,not_removed,before the amex reports you are only if you are getting extra chase cards consider the ink for ur points which goes really nicely with that csr afterward you can look into cards like marriott and united marriott does double duty because it gets you hotel points and through spg lets you transfer to many airlines if you need to top up point balances after youre done with id go amex spg to pair with the marriott card and then look into hotel cards with free nights like hyatt and ihg not sure how either of those chains do in eastern europe though so do your homework first remember to use referral links when appropriate
churning,not_removed,use awardmapper to find hotels in the cities you want to stay that might inform what chase cards you apply for next it should be a chase card bc then you probably want something like the barclay arrival for other travel expenses
churning,not_removed,maybe do the ink or csp and then change either that or csr to a chase freedom unlimited or a chase freedom that way you can maximize your daily spend business cards are now according to b of a alaska airlines card might be a good option for award flights to dc and orlando if theres no harm in leaving the account open it can make your average age of accounts longer
churning,not_removed,and if no af keep the card open but put small spend on it periodically so the card doesnt get closed for lack of activity
churning,not_removed,spg via vpnincognito would help only min spend you didnt list the ihg card so that can be another one and get it matched to via sm
churning,not_removed,there are many good cards for citi and amex if you dont want to wait for amex plat then amex plat prg spg are good options citi aa platinum and citi prestige is also good for atleast first year for hotel cards amex and citi hilton can help you build up ton of hh points
churning,not_removed,depends on your options you could do business cards only for a while to keep you at business cards are pretty easy to get you can churn for a so if you have that option as well
churning,not_removed,as you still have one more slot for chase go for chase united card or chase ink preferred after you can diversify and look into amex and citi cards
churning,not_removed,some cards that come with free nights and arent restricted by chase hyatt free nights no restrictions chase ihg bonus but yearly free night chase ritz free nights barclays wydham the points offer gives nights at any property amex spg there is an offer for free nights or up to points all those ur can get you plenty of nights at hyatts as hyatts range from cat to cat per night personally i plan on keeping the ihg card forever since it comes with platinum status and a free night for only af
churning,not_removed,looks like youre so perhaps consider chase mpe or marriot csp first then move on to non chase cobranded cards
churning,not_removed,ill assume youre well above but your post is confusing because you dont list the cards you actually have no amex for days ill assume thats because youre days into but which two amex cards doesnt help much if we say the prg is good and you say already have it guess again
churning,not_removed,if you have no credit cards the usual recommendation is to go after the chase cards due to and because you have no credit cards you may want to see about starting with either the freedom or freedom unlimited and using those for about months before applying for csp or csr if chase denies the freedom for not enough credit history you may want to try a discover it or perhaps a credit card for with your bank use it for about months to show that youre responsible and then try again
churning,not_removed,you can probably sneak in one more chase right now before amex reports the plat and prg id do the marriott to pair with a future spg card would probably take the delta and ignore the everyday not hugely valuable compared to public offers after those two you might have a better sense of where youll be staying but if not the cards to look into generally are amex spg personal and biz chase hyatt and chase ihg remember to use referral links when appropriate when you arent using targeted mailers
churning,not_removed,assuming you are finish chase bwi is nice for southwest if you want the cp otherwise think about ink and united once youre past good hotel cards are pretty easy amex spg since you already have marriott chase hyatt chase ihg remember to use referral links where appropriate
churning,not_removed,personally i would forego the freedom unlimited application and just downgrade the csp or csr if youre going to do sw its generally recommended you do both so you can get the companion pass otherwise you could do both marriott cards and have nearly enough for a flight and nights package and still a cp if you see a use for the hotel nights
churning,not_removed,freedom and freedom unlimited have ftf so keep that in mind when looking at hitting a min spend other general europe notes from my experience using american cards is often difficult in the netherlands for example you cant buy train tickets from machines you have to wait in the line for person at an attended train station american chain hotels seem more like theyre only for international business travelers with corporate accounts than for people that live in europe i often get a good value on hotels by choosing a small local hotel and emailing directly instead of booking online cash fares on nonstop flights within europe can be very very cheap train options can sometimes be faster and cheaper than flying especially when you consider the time and cost of getting to and from the airport
churning,not_removed,its possible youd get approved for csr another option is csp then csr a little later but i do think csr is possible
churning,not_removed,youre done with chase and only want flights but havent named your home airport that means the citi aadvantage and boa alaska cards should be in play not sure how much more we can help with airline cards if you dont indicate which airlines are good for you
churning,not_removed,can you put line breaks in your text so its easier to read hit enter twice if youre not going to be traveling much in the next two years then why do you want travel points you could try cashback cards like from boa or us bank
churning,not_removed,absolutely csr first
churning,not_removed,if youre going to pursue this hobby you should start with chase cards csr csp sw x ink and one other one read up on the rule you can use the ur points as cash or transfer them to airlines like british airways to book aa flights to ireland the us bank flexperks might also be good for you airfare up to can be booked with points which is great since flying into reno for tahoe can be expensive
churning,not_removed,the first question is why is your score so low youve got at least months of account history what gives
churning,not_removed,any reasoning to avoiding chase as your last of unless you are already
churning,not_removed,i envy you and your plat offer so much start with two more chase cards that arent limited by the best ones are csp ink united marriott and the sw cards although if you have other travel preferences you might choose something different note that sw isnt going to help much if you want to go first class to hawaii keep in mind that chase wont give you more than cards in days after those chase cards make sure you get that plat before it expires once youre done with that see if the plat has posted to your personal report yet if it hasnt chase doesnt know you have it and you can go back for more chase cards at that point youre done with have a boatload of points and should come back for advice on next steps remember to use referral links when appropriate
churning,not_removed,you were denied the sw plus because of the rule let chase cool off and try again in another couple months
churning,not_removed,if youre a frugal flier out of atl you might consider the southwest combo to get a companion pass if you have a travel partner otherwise the standard advice will likely be get premium cards for sign up bonus and travel credits downgrade at year after repeating the credits but avoiding af repeat
churning,not_removed,sealhr in avios on ba is avois in fees ba doesnt allow you to choose seats before checkin without additional charges this isnt usually an issue but one time i was faced with only middle seats left at check in i flown ba quite a bit only used miles once for seattlelondon before these high taxes existed but through alaska mileage plan not directly though ba the ba flight earns a lot of alaska miles which is what i do virgin is starting a nonstop from sea lhr with a this summer economy is delta sky miles same flight is virgin atantic miles in taxesfees
churning,not_removed,ink preferred and united mpe you are months since your last bonus so youre eligible for another im not an award travel expert so if united miles arent useful for you home airports swap out the mpe for the marriott you can add those to your spg balance
churning,not_removed,spg biz hyatt and ihg are all nice hotel cards that would fit your plan
churning,not_removed,if youre thinking about the spg offer get the chase marriott marriott points exchange to spg and vice versa at spg is valuable for flights because it transfers to a large number of airlines at a ratio of airline and special bonus for airline if youre only going to do one of the edp or spg id say do the spg card spg points are worth much more than edp points remember to use referral links where appropriate not for the spg because referrals are to

churning,not_removed,i dont know how high or low your organic spend is but if you finances allow floating spending money now that you would otherwise spend later some extra money you really should consider hitting chase while you still can i would recommend starting with the csp and then do csr afterwards hoping for the high bonus to stick around long to more easily take advantage of double dipping on the travel credit assuming you have an organic spend of per month to get to the what you could do is organic spend amazon gift cards if you ever buy stuff on amazon prepay your gaselectricityphone bill visa gift cards or store gift cards if you regularly use the same stores after months are up you can take a month or to consume the gift card balances effectively making the window to meet minimum spend as long as you need feel free to pm me if you need additional clarifications if you do decide to go for chase please consider using a referral link from the thread
churning,not_removed,maybe huca for the ink you should have been find for applying for cards in days for future reference doesnt mean it is a denial anymore maybe try for the ink preferred if you do not get the ink after trying recon a few more times you definitely do not have too many cards recently good luck since you are under apply to business cards from amex in particular i would suggest the spg business because it is valuable for transfers and wont count towards
churning,not_removed,if you can meet two min spends then the ink preferred first then the csr same day if only one definitely the csr
churning,not_removed,there are dps showing inbranch preapprovals can bypass yes you can have multiple freedom cards so dont worry about having to pc the csr and csp plenty of people here dont have a business just a business whether or not you are comfortable fudging that on an application is up to you
churning,not_removed,amazons credit card offers cash back from amazoncom purchases
churning,not_removed,creditkarma and discover score card are free for credit score updates with a purchase like that you can bump out minimum spends easily if you get approved for a premium card such as csp or csr both have the same spend in months and get and ur respectively worth or more in travel
churning,not_removed,chase sapphire reserve is points back after minimum spend it has a annual fee but that is off set by travel reembursments totaling for and for you can take the points called ultimate rewards and cash them out for cent per point total thats for your purchase you also get at least point per dollar total earned in cash with csr however i dont know your credit score try creditkarmacom that should provide you with a ball park score
churning,not_removed,csr definitely i have already gotten in travel credit back and i just got the card in october also got global entry value also has primary insurance for rentals the card looks awesome annual fee but i profited already plus im about to get points
churning,not_removed,chase freedom is cash back for spend and same with chase freedom unlimited both have no annual fee the only difference is the rewards structure regular freedom has rotating back while the fu has flat note that the is given as ur which is worth as statement credit or you can save it when you get a more premium ur card such as csp or csr remember to pay it forward using referral httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiccreferrals if you are interested these two are easy to get into the game but there are more lucrative offers with higher minimum spend
churning,not_removed,do you intend to pc the card right now before earning the bonus that wouldnt be a good idea i dont believe its possible to pc from a csp to a cobranded card like mpe or marriott you can however pc to the regular freedom card that has no annual fee so you wouldnt have to cancel the card
churning,not_removed,csr and an ink card the ink if you ms or the preferred if you want the big ur bonus
churning,not_removed,csp and an ink card the ink if you ms or the preferred if you want the big ur bonus
churning,not_removed,csp is probably the best option for your travel plans to europe or asia because it can add to your ur pool and you are under another way to bump up your points is to get the spg cards the business spg doesnt count against and you can get the regular spg they can transfer to marriott and vice versa and have a lot of airline transfer partners for lounge access amex platinum is best for delta lounges because it give you complimentary access to delta and centurion clubs the delta plat gives you lounge access for a visit which isnt the best option the united card gives you club passes per year
churning,not_removed,csp in branch for offer or hoping for match is the obvious answer here
churning,not_removed,seems like you are at base on your goals i would suggest getting marriott for the spg then the spg business because it does not count towards and add to your spg pool then the chase ink preferred to stay under i dont know if you have a need to stay under but it doesnt hurt you could use it to get the mpe to get your priority boarding free checked luggage and lounge passes which would make up for the lose of united silver after you are above apply for the marriott business to keep adding to your spg stash this might be hard because you will already have business cards if you get the preferred i dont think the amex blue for business is high priority at this point did you get the off offer when buying spg points
churning,not_removed,you said we have a big euro trip so im assuming you have a so you can each get the chase hyatt card it isnt under rule and have free nights each at any hyatt and transfer ur for additional nights the hyatt zilaraszivas are all inclusives in warm weather
churning,not_removed,to be honest you might have a hard time getting approved for more chase cards if you got in months but if you want to try hyatt card is great and so is ihg for good luxury hotels in mexicocarribean
churning,not_removed,barclays has both aa aviator red after first purchase and and jetblue jetblue plus business cards otherwise you could go after another amex maybe schwab platinum has a method to generate the personal platinum offer those are my best guesses maybe someone can give you a better plan
churning,not_removed,boa alaska cards for air travel to asia on cathay is ok better value in business but economy is good too top off with spg if needed or get the barclay aviator offer
churning,not_removed,ouch you used slots of your on the fu and quicksilver i think there are dps of people having success getting approved for one more chase card while sitting at you could try the ink preferred or the unite mpe
churning,not_removed,i would say you shouldnt have any problem applying for both on the same day apply for the ink preferred first the csp should be easy for you to get also its probably better to apply inbranch for the csp and try to get or request a match over sm if they dont offer it to you
churning,not_removed,alaska miles redeem on cx business to asia
churning,not_removed,you should be good to go with chase max cards in days is the only other chase rule besides get the ink first then the marriott the ink wont count against your edit hit up the chase hyatt later for your honeymoon the hyatt isnt under the rule
churning,not_removed,this question is impossible to answer without you saying what you want to do with the points all else being equal marriott united are probably more valuable but it depends how you use them
churning,not_removed,you want to go to hawaii over christmas in first class forget it first of all first class to hawaii is not worth it on most airlines hawaiian does have nice planes but because it is one of the few with a good first class product to hawaii it is ridiculously competitive let me repeat this hawaii over christmas is perhaps the single most competitive route one can imagine if you want a destination without good options this is it so with that said you need to book airfare asap hotels should be your afterthought get a csr as the points transfer to both singapore travel on united ba if you are ok getting to west coast and flying blue flying on delta then book as soon as the calendar opens february at the latest trust me if you dont book asap you will not find any availability
churning,not_removed,you might be able to swing the southwest cards as you will be wait at least days and preferably days since your csr app
churning,not_removed,go for the chase ur cards first csr then csp etc etc
churning,not_removed,that is a lot of ms but i suppose its possible unless you mean using points through churning for churning and bonuses i would get the csr and csp first as they are versatile points that can be used for flights hotels or cash in a pinch the csp has referral links in the sidebar after those two cards i would take stock again to see where your goals are at and possible locations you want to go to

churning,not_removed,i think your advice of csr and csp is still sound you can check httpswwwawardhackercom to see how many points they need for flights from clt to italy
churning,not_removed,since you have csr yes ur will usually get you more than hotel points plus with ur you can book any hotel you want and are not limited to that chain csp sounds like a good deal how the heck did you get million united miles
churning,not_removed,option first class on jal citi aa this will put you at aa miles you need miles to one ways so you need spg points you will likely have enough aa miles from your work travel though option cathay get x boa alaska cards total you need alaska miles for one way tickets to ny with a layover in hong kong so you need another spg points to transfer in you have marriott spg so you can go that route obviously same trip can be done much more cheaply in business and you will enjoy business on both cathay and jal option ana you cannot book ana one way awards but you can book united star alliance one way and fly on ana for two one way tokyo to new york you can do this instead of either of the above first class will be ur for two one ways using united miles and much harder to find now there are other options united first class etc but they are not as nice if you want first class i assume you do not want shitty first class

churning,not_removed,might as well grab more cards your next cards should be the inkpreferred csp united mpe and marriott probably in that order as you can swing the minimum spends obligatory reminder to use referral links where possible to pay it forward to other members of the sub httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiccreferrals
churning,not_removed,both are risky since its often very hard to get a ink biz card if you already have one personally id guess that the highest probability of success is to apply for both personal sw cards in one day though youd probably have to call recon for both
churning,not_removed,id grab the citi aa and then you can move on to other banks id hit up amex for the amex spg and spg biz cards and combine both those apps with charge cards for more mrs brg prg green gold etc you have a lot of options there you can also go back to chase for hotel cards not under ihg hyatt ritz fairmont theres also the ba card avios can be really handy for getting around europe obligatory reminder to use referral links where possible to pay it forward to other members of the sub httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiccreferrals
churning,not_removed,definitely do aa first bonus also boa alaska will be a good one for using on their partners bonus is then move onto amex cards and be careful with amex bonusesthey are once per lifetime also people here mention using referrals a lot which is always nice to give back but oftentimes the referral bonus is lower than the best bonus you can get incognito also if you are gonna travel in the summer book flights asap award availability dries up really fast
churning,not_removed,the auto loan does not count the freedom was probably a waste of a spot because your credit score is high enough to get a csr easily next card should be csr after that probably inkpref or csp you may be able to get both the ink and csp on the same day but keep in mind the rule at chase
churning,not_removed,most airline cards have a business version united american delta alaska spend ranges from youd need preapproval for united since youre over since theyre not flexible miles id recommend picking an airline that you use frequently or whose flies a large number of flights to a location you want to go to the basic reading section list some of the best current cards offers you could also check for a targeted delta offer that might be higher than the standard offers several cards have referrals httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiccreferrals
churning,not_removed,the logical progression would be csr for the so many things qualify as travel theyre instantly discounted once the charges post youd get one global entry free i used this for the first time coming from overseas and it literally took longer to get an uber than to get through customs youre under chase ur points are really great to convert even more so with csrs higher value
churning,not_removed,us bank cash has category on bookstores which includes amazon you get to choose another category each quarter in addition to that but groceries and gas are not going to be them fast food is an option so you can do that discover it also has rotating categories although lately they seem to mostly overlap with the ones on the chase freedom i would stay away from amex everyday as the earning is not gonna be great get a citi doublecash and use that for everything and a us bank cash for amazon
churning,not_removed,id recommend for cash back consider the amex blue everyday or everyday preferred you should cover the annual fee if you buy more than in groceries or gift cards both also have promos for amazon and most grocery stores you can buy amazon gas or airline giftcards bank of america would be another option discover has rotating categories that dont always overlap with the freedom if you wanted an airline card delta is big in atl southwest is great anywhere domestically if you have a significant other the companion pass can be huge alaska should work well depending on where you want to fly several cards have referrals httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiccreferrals
churning,not_removed,csr or csp amex plat will net you points for airplane tickets but the catch it that it will only apply to your own ticket tickets you bought for your friends will only net you mr i would apply for csr and pay for travel with it and find another way to meet min spend for the amex plat
churning,not_removed,start with chase cards csr csp inkprefered and then x sw if you want the sw companion pass or the united mpe and marriott if you dont in a year you can keep one of the csrcspink cards and pc the others to noaf versions of the cards obviously the above is a multimonth plan only after you have those chase cards should you move on to other banks id then recommend a citi aa can be pced to a doublecash in a year and a citibiz aa days after that then on to amex obligatory reminder to use referral links where possible to pay it forward to other members of the sub httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiccreferrals
churning,not_removed,i only count you as unless you have another card not listed here either way you should stick with chase id recommend the csp united mpe and marriott if international destinations are what youre after i dont think the freedom is worth its own signup bonus you can pc the csr or csp to a freedom in a year obligatory reminder to use referral links where possible to pay it forward to other members of the sub httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiccreferrals

churning,not_removed,the ihg and hyatt cards are pretty good but are not affected by so you should wait until you have gotten other chase cards such as the two that you mentioned the ur points from the ink preferred ink plus or csp transfer to hyatt so you can still stay at those hotels for free before getting the hyatt card
churning,not_removed,pc that csp to a freedom or fu if it has been over years and pick up a new one for the ur bonus also pick up the united or marriott card at the same time
churning,not_removed,because of i would wait until june to apply for the swa cards and hope to get lucky if you would use it a lot amex spg if u can find the offer is nice maybe try to stick to non chfase biz cards for a while
churning,not_removed,your are so your best route is to follow the that has all the info youll need for a while
churning,not_removed,
churning,not_removed,did you get a csp in the past two years if not the obvious answer is get a csp a chase marriott and an amex spg and dump all points in korean air with korean air miles you can book rt business class on the direct flight bosfco on alitalia in business expect close to in fuel surcharges for two people
churning,not_removed,csp is the natural choice here look if the in branch offer is still available if so go that route if not apply online for and consider using a referral from our sub for all those destinations youll most likely do best by simply booking on the ur portal if traveling in economy for first class to europe i would say forget it very few airlines operate a true first class product to europe i would say consider flying business instead transfer ur to ke and book rt to london on delta one for points and a few hundred dollars in fuel surcharges
churning,not_removed,how much natural spend all bills groceries etc can you do in months once we know that then we can make a better suggestion also if youre willing to pay a fee ie for each you pay you can charge your mortgage each month through plastiq but you may not think thats worth it just compare the to what youll get from the bonus
churning,not_removed,something straightforward to break into this hobby would be either the chase freedom or the chase freedom unlimited cards at spend a month youll likely benefit from the regular rotating freedom more but you should do the math these cards will allow you to build revolving credit and a relationship with chase and then you can get onto more serious travel cards use someones referral for applying if fiancee has the card she can refer you otherwise use a referral from someone here in this sub there is a dedicated page here httpswwwredditcomrchurningwikiccreferrals
churning,not_removed,amex spg seems like a good option since the points are very flexible and will be good to bank for the future
churning,not_removed,i mean even if you redeem the ur for cash csr and csp are still the best deals in town in that order
churning,not_removed,if you are staying in the same brand of hotel regularly you might want to think about a card that would give status with that chain
churning,not_removed,csp is the obvious choice here for your last slot i say give it monhts since your csrcfu apps also when you app look if the in branch is still available at that point if so go that route if not apply online for and consider using a referral from our sub good luck
churning,not_removed,ink preferred then csp then spg business is what i would do
churning,not_removed,probably a chase freedom or chase freedom unlimited should be your next app give it months from your first app most good travel cards require a significant income so you cant get most of them unfortunately
churning,not_removed,if youre over you can include your tuition and some income from parents as your income giving you access to a lot better travel cards i would go for the chase sapphire preferred first and put at least as your income
churning,not_removed,for portals check cashbackmonitorcom as the rates constantly change and probably best to stick to the few major portals instead of having spread across many portals for the card are you looking to churn for bonuses or just a card that earns good cashback on purchases bonuses are much more lucrative
churning,not_removed,csp and ink are the two you should get next ink preferred is the new one no but sign up no af first year apply in branch other option is try a referral link on here for ink af not waived but has the categories
churning,not_removed,get chase sw plus then get chase sw premier use referral links for a bonus instead of and the two combined cards will get you close to companion pass sw is great for your destinations and even if you dont have a companion in mind for the cp i would still recommend the sw cards points in sw flights id also recommend the chase sapphire reserve csr as an obvious choice for ur and the ability to redeem at towards flights through chase great for economy flights
churning,not_removed,an ink card ur and possibly the marriott or united card
churning,not_removed,ink card ur and the united card ua would be toe top choices for your needs
churning,not_removed,with the gutting of the marriott vacation packages i dont see much value in marriott points tbh i guess you can transfer them to spg and then get some airline miles out of it united is definitely the better offer also realize the united offer was a one time thing and there is no reason to believe will be a recurring bonus
churning,not_removed,csr is the obvious choice dont let the af scare you the x travel credits more than make up for it min spend in in months
churning,not_removed,because the signup bonus is essentially restricted to being applied to travel purchases the signup bonus for the csp can be worth a lot more that that as in as much if transferred to travel partners for the right redemptions also the csp is under so you have to get it early in your churning journey while you can pick up a capital one venture pretty much anytime
churning,not_removed,you havent provided dates so i am unsure of your status if under get the mpe if over mr or spg transfers to ana would be best target either the spg biz or any amex mr cards
churning,not_removed,no other devaluation to the marriott vacation packages other than sw cp spgmarriott is still one of the best hotel cards
churning,not_removed,if you have good credit history and a high fico score go for the csr and get the bonus you can also apply for either freedom or freedom unlimited do the math and figure out which best fits your spending after a year id downgrade the csr to either the freedom or freedom unlimited whichever you didnt apply for earlier and then go for the csp downgrading keeps the credit history on that card so i wouldnt worry about that
churning,not_removed,you should get the csr asap the point offer will expire jan this card is worth keeping too
churning,not_removed,wait until january to be safe on the then finish off chase either sw for cp if it would be useful to you or get marriott united if youre willing to fly out of ewr once youre back past in feb look into chase hyatt ritz and amex spg for some nice highend hotels remember to use the referral links
churning,not_removed,looks like you are you should grab an ink card if you are comfortable with applying for a business card
churning,not_removed,if what you want is transferable points hilton and hyatt there are a few easy options for you chase hyatt not limited by citi hhonors citi typ cards amex mr cards biz plat etc wait for a high offer for regular plat also out there is amex spg and chase ritz not points transfer to spg and are transferable from there but high af and benefits mostly duplicative of csr make sure you use referral links where appropriate
churning,not_removed,yeah my biggest regret was using a hard pull to get the citi dc when i had a ty preferred i never used i was unaware you could pc from the typ to the dc
churning,not_removed,great just was approved for the csp so ill start on that before looking at the spgmarriot cards once i finish with it my ur should be up to around points
churning,not_removed,i plan on launching a website soon so i think i can convince them that i want it for the google adwords cashback the old ink didnt have that right
churning,not_removed,i dont go crazy with ms so its not a big deal i mostly just go for cc signup bonuses and do a small amount of ms on my ink to pay for the annual fee
churning,not_removed,immediate approval or did you call recon i just called recon for ink pref and talked to the agent for a long time im atover with some recent apps he seemed to be trying to understand but was very incredulous about too many inquiries said he wanted to approve but after looking at credit report he couldnt wondering if there are some magic phrases i could use
churning,not_removed,yeah im perhaps being a little shortsighted on the hotel front id be interested in learning more about highvalue redemptions with spgmarriott any idea if theres a good resource for this
churning,not_removed,while i do have some flexibility when choosing flights my selection has to be within of the cheapest fare which often ends up being limiting on a recent trip the cheapest was a delta codeshare but i got approval to take the more expensive united flight as i was gunning for at that point thats a good tip on marriottspg air france option i can stay wherever i like during work trips and have been opting for the marriott recently
churning,not_removed,yes soon after posting i went ahead and called chase and they agreed to pc the cs to the fu main post now edited to reflect this thanks for your other suggestions
churning,not_removed,thanks going for it
churning,not_removed,do you think ritz or marriott maybe which would bring me to or another ihg etc
churning,not_removed,looks like your sw card hits its year in feb after that you could reapply for both sw cards for the cp i would finish chase off and hit before moving to another provider please use referral links
churning,not_removed,i had already gotten the companion pass in and wont be traveling much in the upcoming future due to having our first child i had gotten the ink in and downgraded it to the regular ink to avoid the annual fee sometime in also i dont even see the ink available anymore on their site just the ink premier i am hoping for some nonchase options
churning,not_removed,thanks already got ink and ink preferred im thinking get all other chase biz cards first or mixed in with other personal
churning,not_removed,dont want to get any amex since i have none got the citi biz aa and planning ba as biz and chase biz cards any other good alternative
churning,not_removed,op my spg showed up on my credit report yesterday and was opened on oct this year i think you have at least another couple weeks at most a full month before the plat shows up
churning,not_removed,thanks for the reply
churning,not_removed,the plat puts me at though even without it id be at until at least the middle of march by which point it will probably have shown up on the reports and ill still be at
churning,not_removed,thats a good idea beyond that i like the idea of getting the aa cards asap since it seems like you may be able to get them multiple times after some time passes may as well get that started
churning,not_removed,this is definitely the answer
churning,not_removed,why am i at i thought inks dont count
churning,not_removed,i wasnt looking for another ur card i might have already received the mailer but thrown it away since i received a bunch of other cc offers and wasnt looking for a new card at the time how would i know if i received one and can apply
churning,not_removed,thanks ink cash or preferred
churning,not_removed,fixed typo i am looking into the csr now and trying to figure out exactly how everything works with the annual fee and travel credit thanks
churning,not_removed,if you do get the csr pc the csp to the cs and then pc to fufreedom this can be done in two days works nicely to accumulate urs at a quicker pace
churning,not_removed,didnt make it clear enough all the cards except that closed sw card are at least a few years old shes at until maybe marchapril of this year then will be and yeah thats what im going to try to get her sold on but its a tough sell as she wont value the travel credit the same as most people here do and balks at the af and i havent even told her about manufactured spend yet that will be an interesting conversation
churning,not_removed,thanks for the response so heres my question lets say i hit the point in csr in travel csp and this wont expire so this is essentially travel money i could spend in the next however many years right then i could downgrade to csp right after the only other major caveat for me is with rent bumping up after a move next month im not looking to do much else by way of heavy spending im looking through the wiki to see how people do rent now also i dont travel enough to make the csr worth it in general but it makes sense for the signup bonus and downgrading after i suppose what do you think
churning,not_removed,makes sense and sw would be cp or bust would it then make sense to earn the marriott points hold onto them for earn more with the spg cards and transfer for the cp and week hotel stay later this year or early hopefully still available
churning,not_removed,these all seem like good options and things ive thought of but do you have a recommended order for getting these amex aa and as cards i know the as is churnable whereas the amex arent i think i have the offer and hopefully it hasnt expired i remember being a bit timid about it cuz of the steep annual fee when i recently got the csr the airline credit for the amex didnt seem nearly as easy or natural to use as the csrs
churning,not_removed,go into amex if they have a target card that you really want but note that the downside is youll never get a targeted plat offer after that
churning,not_removed,thank you
churning,not_removed,thanks ill stay away from chase as im hoping for csr preapproval ill probably need to go for hhonors going forward
churning,not_removed,people if central america economy is preferred so actually lets assume europe
churning,not_removed,so the csr from was on so days would be youre thinking as long as the delta plat hasnt hit yet i should go for my chase on that date
churning,not_removed,chase is amex is for credit cards
churning,not_removed,sounds good i dont plan on ever being below tbh the only thing i can think of that might make it happen is if i take a break because i want to buy a house even though the chase cards are amazing there are too many opportunities that id miss out on boa is one the the banks that ive never really looked at theyre the ones that give a relationship bonus though right where if you have an account you get extra cash back thanks for the advise btw i didnt ever read up too much about cash back because travel bonuses are so lucrative but since i wont need the miles for a while i might as well get some extra cash
churning,not_removed,thank you
churning,not_removed,business cards are now this is misinterpreting the rule chases business cards inkpreferred appear to be subject to other issuers business cards such as capitalone biz spark do not count toward chase couldnt possibly count them because they dont hit the personal credit report op should check on the credit report to make sure the biz cards arent reported there but i suspect op is at assuming its a business costco
churning,not_removed,are they still matching to on the ihg ive tried to find a dp about it but everything i find is almost months old
churning,not_removed,thanks thats an awesome list researching the cardsbenefits now
churning,not_removed,i think i might be at planning on going with the united if i can find a offer i ink business can suffice right
churning,not_removed,id go for the companion pass but ill be living in europe the next year so i wouldnt get to fly southwest now i could get the two sw cards anyways and pad my southwest points and then reapply for both in years after i have the bonus and just get the companion pass then
churning,not_removed,yea i dont think ill be redeeming points for airfare with cash option being so cheap
churning,not_removed,how do you pay for a europe flight in cash obvious answer seems to pay when you show up at the airport but i prefer getting something online early when its cheaper
churning,not_removed,whoops poor formatting just fixed it
churning,not_removed,gf will finish her phd in years so were gonna plan a long trip that summer was hoping to start saving up points now
churning,not_removed,wow yes please edit instant approval yea
churning,not_removed,why so many cards points advantages for different kinds of purchases
churning,not_removed,my first card is actually a capital one from thats still open but i had a missed payment and a collection both from nothing negative since and low utilization waiting for those to drop off
churning,not_removed,denied for ink preferred with a legitimate business for too many recent accounts and a missed payment in which wasnt an issue for the cspcsr but wasnt sure id get approved for another card
churning,not_removed,can i see targeted offers if i called in to not give me offers through the mail
churning,not_removed,i think my goal would be to do the csp and the ink which should help set me up for some man spend any idea what the best offers are for those two
churning,not_removed,yeah i got a bit ahead of myself in the mean time would it be better not to apply for any other cards
churning,not_removed,what about flights for end of year any cards i should look into
churning,not_removed,thanks yeah i was just checking out this week i think i might go with that too
churning,not_removed,ah got it i might be able to handle the for csr not so sure about the for ink right now and dont understand manufactured spending enough to pull such a large amount ill look into csr for now thanks
churning,not_removed,i know he has an ink card already it may be worth going for the ink business pref earn points per on the first spent in combined purchases on travel shipping purchases internet cable and phone services advertising purchases made with social media sites and search engines each account anniversary year youre in an interesting spot with the amount of spending you could also aor amexs cards to knock out a bunch of minimum spends for each of them i just did and only had to recon a branded card ink you have may save you on shipping supplies as well if you buy through an office supply store points on office supplies and cabletelecom services up to spent annually edit inkbp could net you ur ink could net you if you mr
churning,not_removed,thanks for the tip as i understand it csp has a maybe fee is it possible to get this waived for the first yera
churning,not_removed,for the annual fee when do they charge it as in should i wait for the beginning of the new year or apply before the end
churning,not_removed,for the travel credit when does that get posted to your account wondering when i should apply for the cardnow or at the beginning of january
churning,not_removed,shouldve mentioned that i just tried to apply for the freedom unlimited was denied for having too short of a credit history months ill update my comment
churning,not_removed,sorry im not explaining myself well i ended up being approved for the csp and the fu i have and intend to use the csp until i get the bonus that was my original goal im stuck with the fu and id like to hopefully pc the fu to a co branded card right now by my count these cards put me at so id like to take advantage of it would it be better to call the cc line sm or go into a branch to request the pc
churning,not_removed,unfortunately my spending in a typical month is only a couple hundred bucks for my business as such i wont come close to hitting the required in the first three months any other ideas thanks for your help
churning,not_removed,i was thinking of the ihg i am now interested in hotels can i still get a southwest companion pass if i cancelled the sw plus personal a year ago i cant even find sw business plus
churning,not_removed,i got off is worthwhile i opened accounts for two housemates but no dice
churning,not_removed,dont forget about the fairmont cards another nights between the two of them
churning,not_removed,do you think there is a better chance after the new year or is it a rolling time frame for too many cards not
churning,not_removed,this is not true that only happens if one of the cards hasnt reported yet or if you are and put in two apps or if one of the cards you have is a business card or a store card op did you book tickets to kenya and austria already or are you looking to do that now
churning,not_removed,i used on the quicksilver as i wasnt aware of this world yet however the fu was the because at the time i put apps in the same day you suggested united mpe but i am and i am pretty sure this card is under the rule
churning,not_removed,unfortunately there are no chase branches nearby the closest is in trenton which would take about two hours to get to i thought if i applied online i could get approval for two cards on the same day did that also work if i apply for one in branch also does it work for a business and personal card i do have an ein and a registered llc but its only a few months old and not very profitable as of yet
churning,not_removed,thank you i had read on the wiki that it might be tough to get more than cards in months but i think im going to give it a shot definitely going to go for a pair of hyatt cards later now im just debating whether to apply today for the ink or wait two more weeks and apply for both on the same day when im out of to combine the pull seen a few dps that amex takes two months to report but i dont know that its worth the risk
churning,not_removed,i dont have any immediate plans for the points thats why i like the versatility of ur and marriott also offers a lot of options with ability to convert to spg
churning,not_removed,thank you for your postreality check i edited my original post i traveled to europe over christmas a few years back and it was cheaper because it was offseason for some reason my tiny brain just went yeah its off season everywhere so thats a good time to go obviously not hawaii doh
churning,not_removed,here is my question what about the af do i just pay it or do i cancel and make a new card every year or do i whine and ask for it to be waived
churning,not_removed,im over until next fall but i also only travel once a year and have points banked up should i wait until fall to get csr also my wife and i both have csp and afs are coming due should i keep one of them open
churning,not_removed,shes preapproved for freedom slate and csp does this bode well for approval
churning,not_removed,is apps in day pretty much guaranteed not to work im at and considering trying chase united mpe chase marriott and chase ink business preferred simultaneously not sure where to search for relevant data points other than reading through these threads which is why i saw your comments thanks
churning,not_removed,thanks for the advice we may very well indeed try for two csrs my wife does have a legitimate business so we may try for the ink also
churning,not_removed,was already denied ink preferred for too many new accounts should i try marriot anyway
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,thanks for these suggestions citi aa plat is probably a good call then i will definitely use a referral when i move onto the amex cards
churning,not_removed,thanks for the suggestions just grabbed aa plat do you think it matters if i do boa alaska or all the amex first
churning,not_removed,thanks for the info i really appreciate it i initially had a hard time getting over the csr af but after a little more research it definately seems worth it i might try for the csr first thing come the new year hopefully they could expite the process as i have a trip on the and it would be nice to have the lounge access options
churning,not_removed,perfect i didnt realize there was another card that offered back on amazon thanks for the recommendations
churning,not_removed,since chase is a bit anal about multiple business cards with ink preferred csp i will be at what else should i go for to hit that thanks for helping out
churning,not_removed,in june ill be down to how would i go about applying for both swa cards without triggering
churning,not_removed,any dps recently of people getting the spg offer to appear ive been trying incognito mode but no luck
churning,not_removed,i got a csp but then recently pc to csr seeing as i dont have a particularly long credit history i didnt want to cancel csp but also didnt want to pay for both annual fees but i guess that was kind of dumb because i lost out on the got it amex spg was definitely on the list didnt think about the marriott thanks appreciate it
churning,not_removed,natural spend is kind of variable probably no more than a month excluding big purchases i do have a hobby that allows me to produce a good bit of spend and get it back once every month or so i buy vintage guitars that regularly cost and sell them for a small margin so thats an option our mortgage is a month so plastiq might be a good idea
churning,not_removed,great thanks for your input what are your thoughts on getting an amex such as the spg or the marriott card instead of the csp if i were to get an amex would you suggest i still wait at least months
churning,not_removed,will i be able to get the ink preferred and the csp since i am already at when would you suggest i get these cards
churning,not_removed,just a note that including your tuition as income is not allowed by any bank you of course can do that and they likely wont catch you but it is no different than lying about your income in any other context
churning,not_removed,i can begin opening a new card every three months thats the best way ive seen for people especially new people but i still have questions like how it would affect my credit score to open new cards downgrade a card if i got that chase one or just cancel a card what would happen if i cancelled my year old card from the sunglass but or can i just leave it and let it expire
churning,not_removed,if you get csp make sure to apply in branch for the ur offer i along with many others on this sub that applied online for the csp prior to the public in branch ur in branch offer were not able to match and only ended up with ur
churning,not_removed,i do have a companion so that works out perfectly thank you
churning,not_removed,csr and an ink card would be two solid choices ink preferred has ur bonus or the ink ur with the ability to ms at
churning,not_removed,thanks i dont have a business so i dont think i can get ink but perhaps the others i do like lounges and i could get the united card that gives unlimited lounge access
churning,not_removed,thanks so much would you recommend applying for bit at the same time and manufacturing spending or doing one at a time organically thanks again
churning,not_removed,i just got approved thank you
churning,not_removed,thanks i just realized that i am now exactly at so cant go for the mpe just yet will take a look at boosting my mr or spg and transfering to ana
churning,not_removed,its not for everyone meeting the required spend can be difficult for some people also if hes not interested in traveling the card can actually be a liability with the annual fee
churning,not_removed,would it make more sense to do ink business preferred unitedmarriott if so which of the latter would be more beneficial thanks for your help
churning,not_removed,eh mistakes happen and this is a relatively painless one seeing as you got the csr much better to learn that way than to get locked out of a csr because of it
churning,not_removed,congrats good luck
churning,not_removed,i got approved instantly for all i know i may have just gotten lucky
churning,not_removed,it seems we think similarly prefer airbnb and its cheaper but itd be nice to have a free hotel if in a bind or if i got sick etc overseas unfortunately im deep in hiltonihg but dont know a ton about any other chains but im sure someone else can chime in
churning,not_removed,save ihg for post im well over the limit was denied by chase for another card but was approved for ihg statement credit
churning,not_removed,rookie question but does chases only apply to their own cards or will other companys cards count towards it
churning,not_removed,as long as youre not over you should do the chase options before the nonchase options united would be a good one or the new ink
churning,not_removed,nice you can try for more chase biz cards not sure how far you can make it getting other banks biz cards keeps from pushing you over if there are enough biz cards to keep you occupied until you fall under again then do that
churning,not_removed,amex cards take longer to show up in my experience both of my barclay cards showed up within a couple days of applying while all my amex cards have taken at least a month
churning,not_removed,i see in that case i lean towards spg thats what ill be going after next
churning,not_removed,i dont think they would in this hobby the number one rule is it doesnt hurt to ask if you got rejected you could easily call their recon line and be approved
churning,not_removed,anyone can correct me if im wrong but chase can see chase biz cards that they have given you other banks business cards dont count towards though
churning,not_removed,technically no but in practice you might be able to the trick would be reserving your two nights in your name but adding her to reservation as the additional guest and noting that she will be checking in first this works for only two nights but paired with the other two nights in her name they might catch on especially at a high end property like this where they offer very personalized service
churning,not_removed,from doc call choose option apply for a new card youll be redirected to a customer service representative you hello id like to apply for the american express platinum card a few months ago i received an offer but it has since expired im wondering if its possible to still get this bonus them do you remember what your rsvp code is you no but i do remember the offer was for membership rewards them ok im able to extend this offer to you as a one time courtesy you will earn membership rewards points when you spend within three months
churning,not_removed,plus if you want to ms if not then the preferred for the ur bonus then pc it to a cash later if you want please remember to use referral links
churning,not_removed,depends on what categories you think you will spend money on they are both business cards that have different categories i recently went with the cash because i would never have spend on categories with the preferred however the signup bonus is tempting on the preferred
churning,not_removed,sorry what does pc mean not sure i can meet the min on two cards at once
churning,not_removed,youre right i agree with the comment from uilessthanthreethis
churning,not_removed,does not expire if you have a ur earning card and the travel is through csr portal just like a travel is through csp portal people use plastiq with a fee for rent also for the csr you get a year to reimburse any travel expense and you can always double dip that so essentially you can come out ahead
churning,not_removed,sure you can also get marriott biz to help with that marriott min spend spg personal min spend in spg points spg biz marriott points which is just a small handful short of the sw points package just put another spend on the spg cards and youre there you should expect that this package will disappear in though its always possible it sticks around but with the programs merging in nothing is certain at all play it safe and get it in as soon as you can
churning,not_removed,look through the flyertalk forums about how to use the airline credit on the amex plat
churning,not_removed,what do you mean by that
churning,not_removed,you already have enough united miles for in j to europe assuming you transfer your urs to united if i were you id plan the actual trip now flightswise and then apply for hotel cards to fill in the lodging gaps on your itinerary ps dont forget to use your free stopover
churning,not_removed,id give it a shot as long as you arent super sensitive to hard pulls worst that happens is you wait weeks longer than you would have otherwise and then they deny you
churning,not_removed,the hard rule is but the rchurning wiki actually recommends no more than chase cards in months so if theres any basis for our wiki then op might be out of luck until april which means out of luck entirely with chase
churning,not_removed,thanks for clarifying
churning,not_removed,thanks for that awesome bit of info
churning,not_removed,likewise not able to find any recent dps that it hasnt worked these can be ymmv but id say its worth a try for what its worth it worked for me back in may httpswwwuscreditcardguidecomchaseihgcreditcard link has a screenshot if you need to provide one
churning,not_removed,just found this in a different thread hope it helps points with spending was the latest offer sent to emails there is no identifying one time use code in the link
churning,not_removed,sorry i misread absolutely csp is priority
churning,not_removed,i suggest just one of the two freedom cards you dont want to blow two slots on the different freedom flavors if you get approved for one consider applying for the csp later the same day to combine hard pulls id save the csr for a few months down the line once youve established a history
churning,not_removed,i think your question got a little garbled but to interpret what i think youre asking you should be able to get both ink and united on the same day although its not guaranteed
churning,not_removed,cash vs mileagepoints redemption
churning,not_removed,rules and redemption prices can change a lot in years i would wait and ask this question in a year are your point balances taking into account the csr or will you soon have ur if you fly economy is enough for to go to south america is enough for to se asia
churning,not_removed,to accumulate points haha thats what this sub is about
churning,not_removed,ok you can roll the dice and see what you get you were able to get a csr and plat so issuers must not be that scared why are you avoiding chase still some very good cards from them that you havent touched yet id recommend marriott and united then amex spg cards to build up an spg balance
churning,not_removed,did you do more than cards within days thats the only other contributing factor i could think of for a non business card
churning,not_removed,the sidebar has
churning,not_removed,if you want biz cards from other issuers knock yourself out in my opinion since youre under right now and there are still many valuable chase cards out there sw csp ink marriott united etc its not worth wasting a slot for a card you can get just as easily weeks from now
churning,not_removed,united is off the table because of amex delta plat is an option but delta doesnt do a lot of good flying out of bos there are cards for more minor in the us airlines such as jal but id suggest figuring out which route you want to fly and how youll get the points before going down that rabbit hole major us airlines have the advantage that you can always use extra points for domestic flights when they come up but having a bucket of korean air points or similar isnt always as helpful
churning,not_removed,make sure you read the fine print i believe pnc is not available to hi
churning,not_removed,yes i think ive read it is getting more difficult to pc the csp before the end of the first year i think its ymmv however once you hit a year and your af posts you have days to request a pc and receive a full refund of the af
churning,not_removed,csp af is for year after very easy to pc to a freedom or freedom unlimited csr is no luck getting af waived
churning,not_removed,annual fee is posted at the end of the first statement so basically immediately the points for spend is the current deal no one knows how long it will last edit heres a link for you to look into it
churning,not_removed,it seems like it is instant after the purchase gets posted also i am now dipping into the travel credit which mean you would probably be doing the same if you got the card now
churning,not_removed,maybe try for a discover it card it is similar to chase freedom
churning,not_removed,you cannot pc a fu card to a cobranded card this is a hard rule also book your trip to hawaii now if you want to go this summer award seats to hawaii go fast
churning,not_removed,yes you can still get the southwest companion if you had the card more than years ago i would still agree that the csp is a good card to get to increase your ur points ihg is not under the so i would wait on it until the after the other three cards the marriott card is under and can be used to transfer with spg you could get the marriott card and two spg cards to get the flights and nights package for the sw cp the two sw cards are probably easier though obligatory reminder to use the referral links to pay it back to the community
churning,not_removed,you can get the cp if its been more than years since you got the bonus on any southwest card and you close you close both of your southwest cards first
churning,not_removed,is ok why are you thinking about buying points if not for the
churning,not_removed,rolling
churning,not_removed,i havent i am trying to figure what will be the best way to do it do you have any suggestions thanks
churning,not_removed,two cards in one day wont really work with a business card being one the two business cards always go to manual review and the app usually gets around weeks to go through for this reason some people who tried this got denied because they had just gotten approved for a personal i would say get the ink pref and only after being approved for that go for a csp dont worry about combining hps
churning,not_removed,so i am assuming that you used aa miles because that was indeed a good use of the miles even that is closed now as aa redid its award chart generally speaking award travel is really hard around the holidays airlines release very little availability and a lot of people want to travel around those times think about it like this if its around a holiday a lot of people have the day off and they want to fly around that time there is no way around this other than to get a transferrable point card and book as far as possible in advance
churning,not_removed,csr af can be offset by using the travel credits in and travel credit for a af the csp is waived first year both of these cards can be downgraded after one year to freedom varieties
churning,not_removed,for csr you pay it first year credits of each offset it completely second year you pay a net if that is not worth it to you you can cancel it for csp you can ask to have it waived if not cancel it
churning,not_removed,depends how many cards you would be getting between now and the fall can your wife get a csr if so that might be the best option you should probably keep one csp and cancel the other unless youre getting a csr
churning,not_removed,uhhhh yes chase preapprovals are generally solid i would try to have her go in to a chase branch first to see if she is prequalified for the csp offer as well as csr and the freedom offer if so that would be the way to go if you cant make it to chase or if she does and isnt prequalified then i would use a referral link from this forum guys in this case with these scores do you think that its wise to use a referral link in my mind i would think it would be better to use the prequalified offers intead of referrals with these scores fyi my friend who had scores similar had no issue in getting the csr and csp use household income at least i would strongly encourage to go in branch check for csr csp and freedom chase has a limit of apps per days so it would be cool if you could get the csp via in branch prequal if the csr didnt show up then immediately apply on phone or laptop for csr some people might say her scores arent good enough for the csr so its a tossup she should have no issue going in branch at getting the csp and freedom offer though if shes targeted but in checking in branch if it showed the csr then definitely do csr and csp
churning,not_removed,apps in one day is pretty much a guaranteed denial for at least one of the cards though there may be someone somewhere who managed it id definitely not try more than however
churning,not_removed,i actually think you should just book hotels with your csr valuing csr points at cents travel portal that gives you cents per dollar spg would be maybe cents per dollar and marriott would be like cents remember you can book with spg card get spg per dollar and transfer to marriott and get marriott points so actually booking with the marriott visa makes no sense at all given the cents per point value csp is still the next best card csp might still have a offer in branch if preapproved so i would try that online offer is only but still worth more than marriott bonus if you go the online route consider using someones referral from the thread we have
churning,not_removed,when were you denied the ink for that reason and i assumed you tried to recon and were shot down in recon as well
churning,not_removed,citi prestige has night free which could be huge for you depending on how expensive the hotel is
churning,not_removed,i would do boa first amex will approve anyone with a pulse
churning,not_removed,united or marriott card would be a good choice for your last spot
churning,not_removed,theres data points both ways if applying for gets u past
churning,not_removed,some guy was days ago and couldnt find it someone else said its gone dont know where i read that though i just tried times and did not see any
churning,not_removed,if you got the csp in you are eligible to apply and get the bonus again now so i would definitely do the csp first there was an offer for bonus for in branch app although that might have expired look if that is still available if not then the bonus is still worth getting at use a referral link if applying online also remember to look for highest offer for spg right now you can get incognito or vpn to chicago i think so dont use a public link or a referral link as those will only get you bonus points in the future though this may change so double check when you apply more of an award travel issue but business class to europe is insanely competitive especially italy which for whatever reason is popular with americans and especially in the summer there are more americans in rome in july than there are italians probably so book as far in advance as possible days ideally
churning,not_removed,chase sapphire preferred may be good for you since you should be able to meet the minimum spend quite easily with the guitars ur worth cash travel through chase possibly more if transferred for spend over months actually more like days and waived af first year after
churning,not_removed,chase freedom andor discover it are both cashback rotating category cards the discovery it will match your cashback for the first year for new cardmembers giving cashback in the rotating categories for a lower spend around one or both of these cards could be good options
churning,not_removed,you can get an amex after you fill your last slot with chase theoretically the marriott card could replace the csp but generally speaking the csp bonus is worth more however if you have a specific plan for the marriott bonus points then go for it
churning,not_removed,there are conflicting dps what it seems like is business cards dont count against unless they manually review it not confirmed just seems that way based on dps the minimum spend on those is so if you cant meet that in months i would do ink preferred first this is for reasons ink might not count against and af waived on both but ink is a better bonus vs
churning,not_removed,since its a no af card activate it and purchase something with it every months it will help your credit signing up for a new card every months will ding your credit in the short term but in the medium and long term you will see your score increase realize that this hobby is really lucrative mostly for the travel rewards there are substantially fewer cards that give cashback that said the standard first two choices csr and csp are still very much worth it even if you redeem the ur points for cash
churning,not_removed,do both if you can swing it
churning,not_removed,fair enough
churning,not_removed,so the dps on this really arent clear at all but the best guesses seem to be that the ink cards are limited by but dont count toward if youre interested in the ink i would make that one your or and save either united or marriott for later i personally would put off the united card for last because its only points and you can transfer urs at in other words ignoring the airline privileges the card gets you the ink is basically the united plus extra points
churning,not_removed,all ccs
churning,not_removed,thats my current plan what do u think about ink cash ur is not big but not too bad either
churning,not_removed,i think all things being equal id go for spg but because citi might be more inquiry sensitive ill probably go for their aa first
churning,not_removed,under business cards not reporting chase biz cards dont currently count towards
churning,not_removed,product change basically you move from the chase sapphire preferred to chase sapphire that doesnt have the annual fee then after that is updated on your online account you can product change again to the freedom or freedom unlimited i had to call to make the changes usually takes about a day for the change to show on your account
churning,not_removed,when you say double dip the how exactly do you mean just got approved for my csr so dont want to miss out on any added bonuses thanks
churning,not_removed,amex has a onceperlifetime rule on sign up bonuses you can only get the bonus for each card type once their best card is the platinum it sometimes has a bonus offer of mr points but its very rare for that offer to go public only twice in once by accident normally the offer is only half as good at around points amex will send you targeted ads and if your credit is good theyll target you for the sign up bonus but theyll stop sending offers as soon as you get your first amex card of any type
churning,not_removed,so i think my best bet is go for it in january and if i get declined wait until april sigh get back to and then move on from chase does this sound reasonable
churning,not_removed,thanks
churning,not_removed,oh i see thought you meant literal cash lol
churning,not_removed,this is including csr but the csp points i think will be added in the next month or two i was thinking about going for an amex or citi advantage just to build up more points
churning,not_removed,thanks ive been eyeing the mpe maybe ill shoot for that first
churning,not_removed,no the csr was months prior to the ink preferred app and csp months prior to csr
churning,not_removed,fair point so youre saying its a decent strategy to use my for a few other chase cards first then move onto other issuers without that rule afterwards
churning,not_removed,are you sure can you direct me to where you see that i can find a list of eligible states for the bonus offer but i dont see anything for just opening an account without
churning,not_removed,thanks for your help im looking at for my cs
churning,not_removed,alright cool hopefully they dont say the same thing
churning,not_removed,i appreciate the advice i am not a hardcoring churner i use this sub to identify cards a year my focus now is identifying a card i will use only for business to help me keep track of business expenses if you have some ideas for someone like me id appreciate it
churning,not_removed,i just wanted to stockpile spg points i guess is just ok so not worthwhile i thought business cards count toward the number of cards i have open so i would be at if they do not my opportunities just expanded d
churning,not_removed,if you want to travel in summer to kenya you should probably book awards right now before you get other cards united and af are both rt but i dont know what availability is like might be best to just book through the ur portal for austria you would also like to use united and fly on their partner austrian or book on the portal otherwise fees will kill you in europe as for cards you have enough ur to cover flights to kenya and austria so you can get hotel cards and such a friend of mine stayed at the hilton vienna for and he said he loved it so you can for example get the citi hilton public i think still and the amex hilton no af through referrals and stay for almost a week there the hotel might be more points in august but even so should give you at least days there
churning,not_removed,ah ok that helps thank you i applied and was approved for the csr on will i be able to apply for the ink tomorrow or should i wait longer
churning,not_removed,there are plenty of dps of people getting autoapprovals for business cards even first business cards and just as many dps of the reviews taking far less than weeks i applied for the ink preferred last week and was approved after days after calling recon for a simple identity verification in regards to cc apps there are very few cases where you should make broad generalizations like business cards always go to manual review
churning,not_removed,thanks for the information i know my questions are newbieish so i appreciate the patience my original thought is that my vacation days are more limited than my ability to churn for points maybe that isnt the case on this one and i just need to be willing to burn an extra vacation day specifically thanks for the info on transferring ur to singapore and booking united that seems like the best valueeasiest to get from my location any reason you wouldnt recommend two csps for getting the ur points i like the idea of a waived annual fee and since i wont be booking through the chase portal the csrs redemption doesnt really matterright also how exactly do you book united through singapore visiting httpwwwsingaporeaircom i see dallas tx as an airport option when i select book flights but not when i select redeem flights
churning,not_removed,but if i am not going to have travel expenses then what and what can these travel expenses be used for
churning,not_removed,if i know someone who has a uber car can i just charge my cc on their car for and then have them give me the money
churning,not_removed,nah were both in the same boat i dont really need any between now and then unless they have a better offer than csr i figured wed both get them in the fall i suppose since we mainly use chase points with united i could just empty both into united and wait until we get the csrs instead of paying the csp af right
churning,not_removed,got message originally weeks ago when i applied then denial in mail a week later havent called recon as i dont have any sort of legit business
churning,not_removed,agree with this united for flights marriott if you are looking at spg it is a good alternate transferrable currency or to redeem at spg hotels for good value
churning,not_removed,how often does the offer appear if its not often then im just going to sign up for the one because i need a business card asap
churning,not_removed,i cant seem to get the spg to appear im signing up for business spg is there a trick to it ive been trying incognitio mode
churning,not_removed,yeah i can tell this is mostly for travel lol but at the very least i can get started this way also i gotta dig up that website for bank account openings that seems pretty straightforward open account meet requirements close account
churning,not_removed,ink cash is back not points i believe marriot business might be good
churning,not_removed,ah got it i actually did receive a offer i wanted to get my last chase card so i havent used it but i dont think its expire i also have the delta offer you would suggest i take the platinum though and then hopefully get another offer for the delta one in the future also is there a maximum to the number of amex bonuses you can receive as in if i get amex cards over a year or two can i receive a bonus for each new one or is there a limit thanks
churning,not_removed,dont do chase just for the purpose of reaching but if there are valuable chase cards you want then yes note that you can still get biz cards from other issuers in the meantime because they dont count toward your
churning,not_removed,exactly
churning,not_removed,ah that might be true never really bothered with opening bank accounts without also getting the bonus but i guess it might be worth it to get the cc funding option dont know how pnc is but i definitely wouldnt do that with citi that took way more work than i expected to open an account with them online and wouldnt be worth the hassle
churning,not_removed,youre in a similar situation that i was when i applied for the card if you decide on it id think you have a pretty good chance of getting it
churning,not_removed,definitely discover it similar to freedom but better in my opinion because of the double cash back for the first year be sure to use referral links to get a sign up offer that doubles to at the end of the first year ive seen reports saying that the direct links on the discover page dont have a sign up bonus
churning,not_removed,business cards do not count towards i would buy spg for but not really and not to stockpile i think many would advise against stockpiling because you never know when points will get devalued at off you are buying spg points at cents per point while they are often valued at cpp
churning,not_removed,i will explore these options thanks for a great answer
churning,not_removed,you can certainly apply for an ink tomorrow of course the longer you wait the higher your chances of approval
churning,not_removed,for chase business cards i dont think so amex and citi yes but that is not what we were discussing here the point of a generalization isnt that there are no exceptions excetions do exist but when you plan your actions it is the rule not the exception that you should keep in mind the other day someone said they got an alaska signature card with a credit line and recently got the bonus interesting but not very relevant to how someone should look at boa alaska apps
churning,not_removed,you need to call singapore to book partner awards online you can only book sq metal you cannot get two csps you can get one and your so can get one if you have a so if you want to go that route go for the in branch offer only if you cannot access that should you go for online and if you do apply online consider using a referral link from the sub the csr is an all out better card though with x credits that offset the af first year lounge access etcv also the travel portal can in fact be a better value than transferring to partners and would allow you to book flights at popular times when award flights are nonexistent
churning,not_removed,i would imagine at least something you use would fit in there
churning,not_removed,no you cannot do that that is not how uber works
churning,not_removed,depends if you travel economy csr ur portal is often a better value but since you only have csp maybe not a bad idea
churning,not_removed,gotchya id normally advise always calling recon as you dont have anything to lose if youve been denied but if you dont want to call recon then maybe you need to lay off chase for a few months if theyre denying you in that case id pick up a citi aa card and then go back to amex for an spg and maybe a brg and a gold
churning,not_removed,i think might be only for spg personal then try using a vpn and setting it to chicago
churning,not_removed,like cfu and cf its ur even though it said cash back
churning,not_removed,id definitely take the offer the delta is nice too but without trying to be patronizing the difference between and is obviously less than to no limit to amex account bonuses as long as theyre for different card types but most dps say you can only have about amex cards total at any given time so that puts something of a cap on it
churning,not_removed,you can get both on the same daysame hard pull since the plat is a charge card and the delta is a credit card
churning,not_removed,the amex plat offer from earlier today was too good to pass up i got shut out of on thanksgiving so i jumped at this one thanks for the advice of min spend between that and csp should keep me busy for a few weeks at least
churning,not_removed,any thoughts on how long i should wait to reapply for the sw plus
churning,not_removed,approved got a credit limit
churning,not_removed,oh nice ill definitely do that
churning,not_removed,i guess its time i redeem some points thanks for the help i guess i should apply for marriott premier visa soon
churning,not_removed,for safety i agree and will just apply for the ink to start then days after that i will apply for two personal cards with on being the csp if somehow the ink application gets auto approved i will attempt the csp the same day otherwise i will wait which additional chase personal card should i be targeting
churning,not_removed,i really appreciate the response do you think i can apply for those now or should i cool it for a while
churning,not_removed,ive never used a vpn before is there a tutorial somewhere
churning,not_removed,i think meeting that extra large ms would be the main issue there think that would be in months right ive never tried msing though so maybe that would be the right time to try it out
churning,not_removed,for what its worth amex usually takes a couple months to hit credit reports so chase wont know youre past until probably february you can still give it a shot in january
churning,not_removed,absolute minimum so that youre past the rule imo it cant hurt to wait a few days or weeks longer depending on how desperately you want to get into it
churning,not_removed,congrats
churning,not_removed,probably united since you said you wanted to go to india air india is star allince so united miles are good to redeem to go there also for csp i know you said you dont have a branch nearby but if the offer is still around it might be worth planning to app in branch while traveling if you have the opportunity ur is still great of course so if not it is still a good plan to go forward and app online do consider using a referral link from someone if you go the online route
churning,not_removed,if youre at or fewer inquiries in the past months you can go for the citi aa you probably need to wait months before doing another round of amex applications then you can go for the citibiz aa at least days after the citi aa for an additional aa miles in my experience citi has less stringent business verifying than chase
churning,not_removed,i am sure here is but i dont know any
churning,not_removed,the delta is a spend dont know what your plat offer is for plan out the spend requirements and see if its doable can always do plastiq depends how you value combining the hard pulls
churning,not_removed,thanks for the advice i was actually approved for the chase marriott just now so that worked out also picked up the citi aa and barclays arrival perhaps a bit ambitious but i wanted to take advantage before those amex applications show up maybe ill try calling chase recon about the ink preferred and see if i get lucky there as well
churning,not_removed,i seem to have stupidly lost platinum mailer i received but i dont think its expired yet do you know if its possible to call in and still get that offer and if so who exactly to call edit never mind figured it out
churning,not_removed,awesome congrats on the new card id definitely recommend calling recon nothing to lose at this point
churning,not_removed,i received a similar yet less lucrative email from chase marriott marriott points in addition to earned points after spend from
churning,not_removed,would love to get this on my card since im at a hyatt for nights next week
churning,not_removed,i got this offer on the chase ihg card and did it but the points havent posted yet granted the spend period ends june so i expect it will come next month
churning,not_removed,heres a screencap from my email
churning,not_removed,i got the for the chase marriottdont think im going for it as i feel like i can get more points value from other spend other points
churning,not_removed,i got it for the hyatt card also which i use more often in general nothing on my ihg card though
churning,not_removed,damn id love to get this
churning,not_removed,got ba after spend not going to do it would have done it for hyatt though
churning,not_removed,not target i have a large purchase coming could really use the offer
churning,not_removed,i need to spend less on these chase cards
churning,not_removed,is there something you have to do to get these emails
churning,not_removed,when is your anniversary date i got targeted and my first year is up in august so it falls right in the middle of the promo may just be a coincidence in timing
churning,not_removed,end of the second quarter is upon us watch for a ebay bucks deal etc
churning,not_removed,off topic question for chase hyatt holders i am going on a trip to london next year in july i want to open the chase hyatt to get the free nights when should i open the card i dont want to wait too long and have the hotel be booked even though the trip is a year from now however i would like the anniversary night you get per year to have an expiration date at the end of august i always take vacation in either july or august so having the anniversary night expire at the end of august would be great
churning,not_removed,got the same offer but for the chase ihg card
churning,not_removed,anyone got the bonus points yet
churning,not_removed,lol like the spg offer not worth it imo better places to put that spend
churning,not_removed,i got this too dont think im going to go for it i think its better for me to put spend elsewhere what are you thinking
churning,not_removed,me too
churning,not_removed,also just got a similar email from the chase ritz card for
churning,not_removed,truth probably just have them and dont use them i dont think ive spent more than ok either in months
churning,not_removed,august or september most hotels arent booked a year out but if it happens set up an alert at hotel hustle and itll alert you when the room is free did it last year with ph tokyo as room opened up days before our trip a call to hyatt was able to shift our reservations to gh tokyo to the park so maybe use the certificates as soon as you get them to book any room if the one you want isnt available and switch if something opens up keeps you from being stuck if it never materializes
churning,not_removed,not if youre waiting for a mortgage too bad i wasnt targeted for either
churning,not_removed,not terribly interested in this one i already have a bit of spend to do on some other cards if i could ms more readily or i needed the points i might go for it
churning,not_removed,i spend a massive bucks a month on my ihg card netflix and was not targeted for it at all the hyatt card i spend from to a month on and yet i was targeted for an offer on it odd as i too would have expected the opposite
churning,not_removed,ill be getting a mortgage sometime within the next years how long are you suspending any new credit card apps before applying for your motgage
churning,not_removed,plan is only cards max in the two years prior
churning,not_removed,thanks thats around what i was thinking
churning,not_removed,or no inquiries days prior to mortgage app
churning,not_removed,this doesnt deserve its own thread moronic monday for op and frustration friday for the readers
churning,not_removed,tips read the sidebar read the sidebar again read rule call and cancel that chase app if you want or dont bother calling and hope they cancel it for you you need to read about csr csp and how they can be downgraded to freedoms a year later go back again and read the sidebar know that amex will take about billing cycle to report new account in your credit report in other words can squeeze about chase cards by then each month assuming you decline freedom read the sidebar in the future ask questions in the question thread on top of this subreddit
churning,not_removed,probably verification that you applied if you applied for the chase card last they probably saw the hard pulls
churning,not_removed,unfortunately your user name fits you just threw away thousands of chase points sigh
churning,not_removed,this would be a good question for the newbie thread at the top of the page
churning,not_removed,im just wondering what your strategy is youre at and getting a freedom arrival and delta card 😳🤒 my head hurts
churning,not_removed,rekt
churning,not_removed,i dont have the card yet mind providing an alternative its why im asking
churning,not_removed,this
churning,not_removed,i just really dont have time to figure out how to manufacture spend like these people want me to do when thats almost how much i spent the entire last year i dont even know if i could possibly do that this is just something i wanted to try im getting a masters and working full time this isnt my life like some of the people here are acting this is my first experience in a community like this on reddit im just so surprised
churning,not_removed,are they gonna ask me why i applied for more than one what do i reply to that
churning,not_removed,thats why im asking i guess i could talk to her tomorrow and not go through with chase freedom seeing as how i dont have it yet and they called me could you please provide an alternative my goal is miles for free trips
churning,not_removed,my goal is miles for free trips i dont have the card yet thats why they called me i guess im on hold for acceptance what is a better alternative
churning,not_removed,you gotta do a lot more reading of the wikis on the sidebar but one important rule is the chase rule csp or csr are both cards you should at least start with amongst others
churning,not_removed,im going to have some large medicalconstructionother expenses in the near future and for recordkeeping purposes id like to keep them on separate cards
churning,not_removed,as the above user mentioned probably just verification theyre verifying you are who you say you are and you did in fact apply for that particular card
churning,not_removed,first read the all things chase wiki ditch the freedom application call and product change your csp to the freedom then apply either for a chase sapphire reserve or a new csp then pick two more from the list usplattersack gave you
churning,not_removed,y would you apply for the freedom instead of the csr the csr comes with ur points😡😡
churning,not_removed,here everyones goal is to get free trips when you are at so why apply for other cards other than chase did you read about rule please read the wiki and the side bar for more info on this
churning,not_removed,well only you know whats good for you but the general consensus is to exhaust your chase cards ie csr csp ink etc first then wait for a platinum offer to start amex are you familiar with
churning,not_removed,i already have a csp also i looked at all of those already and they have really high spends lastly i dont understand i dont have the chase freedom they called me about it cant i just call them back and be like nevermind
churning,not_removed,i did research my big mistake was not realizing is for all credit cards not just chase ones still not a mistake that even has to do with my original question people were getting mad over unrelated things and mad enough to report my post enough to be taken down talk about a toxic community rbuuldapc or roptions or even rwallstreetbets would never do that
churning,not_removed,thats a good point thanks
churning,not_removed,thanks for the clarification i appreciate it
churning,not_removed,thanks this was one of the more helpful comments ill downgrade tomorrow
churning,not_removed,its dollars annual fee not waived the first year why would i pay that
churning,not_removed,nope
churning,not_removed,because ur points is worth at a minimum because you get a total of in travel credits to offset the fee
churning,not_removed,most people would suggest that the travel credit global entry reimbursement points csr bonus when redeeming points through the ur portal and other perks of the card out weigh or help balance out the fee
churning,not_removed,this cant be real
churning,not_removed,i get that these are dumb questions but you dont have to be so hostile never ran into a community on reddit like this its really surprising and ive asked dumb questions before elsewhere thanks for the info but manufacturing in spend for all of these cards seems like a pain in the ass that i dont really have the time to spend on
churning,not_removed,thanks makes sense i was just thinking in terms of money right now all these fees are expensive even if they pay off later
churning,not_removed,you know what you guys can stop being so rude this isnt life or death its getting a few free flights right now im kind of leaning toward just paying for those flights instead of dealing with you assholes all i did was politely ask you a question
churning,not_removed,like oh no instead of getting points and a companion pass ill only get points now get over yourselves edit updated points to what i calculated
churning,not_removed,space them out over the span of a year then downgrade one of the sapphire cards to a freedom
churning,not_removed,that sounds like a good plan thanks
churning,not_removed,its from here
churning,not_removed,i see so i did miss it still thats a good post thanks for pointing that out and it seems like i can still fulfill all of it
churning,not_removed,yes thats why the post specifies that its for noobs
churning,not_removed,ok
churning,not_removed,this is a referral link isnt it
churning,not_removed,so
churning,not_removed,ya done goofed
churning,not_removed,yes i tried to post in the csp referral link
churning,not_removed,what ever happened to the idea of having a separate what card thread for those who are over that should be a thing
churning,not_removed,that awkward moment when youre checking your preapprovals in branch at chase and the banker asks if you churn lmao
churning,not_removed,considering this community travels a lot and stays at high end hotels with first class flights does anybody have a cool celebritypublic figure story or interaction i am not good at recognizing celebrities in public but i know they must be all over the places we travel
churning,not_removed,currently in chicago with my so just for a night booked the loews chicago for night using amex fhr for so for a tax were getting checked us in at w room ready and upgraded to a pretty awesome corner suite food and beverage credit breakfast voucher guaranteed checkout pretty awesome deal
churning,not_removed,what happens to your points when you die can these be left to someone else in a will just a random thought
churning,not_removed,thanks for all of the dps on the citi mile bump to the offer after the last got bumped to message showed up in one of the discussion threads i started making the requests for the four new aa cards between wife and me so far were successful on the match for with one email waiting a response and another to go out once that one hopefully gets the match felt like id do one at a time on each account nice possible aa bonus for a few sms thanks edit today to say that received confirmation on the last of the for mostly verbatim text in the responses its like theyve got a standard merge response ready for these
churning,not_removed,anyone ever gotten the same rep on a huca it was quite awkward the second call since the first time the rep was not the sweetest
churning,not_removed,dp created a kimpton rewards account a week ago received an email today for off best available rate on my next stay before end of year with promo code cheers which doesnt look like a targeted code
churning,not_removed,long story short my father is very stubborn to take out more credit cardsi got him to take out the csp but he doesnt want to take one out for my mom my mom has a good credit score but doesnt have her own bank accountshe always had my dad take care of the account my plan is to use my dads csp referral link to sign my mom up for a new card and just ms the spend for her im a bit confused on how i should help her ms since she doesnt have her own bank account could i just take the pos from the vgcs deposit them into my bank and pay her credit card through my checking account any problems here after she meets min spend they should have roughly ur points enough for nights at the hyatt zilara cancun my dad loves all inclusives so if he sees what points can achieve i think it will change his mindset thoughts
churning,not_removed,any chance chasevisa get level data from safeway i hit min spend on a sw card by buying some netflixamazontarget gift cards as christmas presents didnt quite hit total min spend by closing date in early jan but now ive got a trip coming up right after my feb closing and id kinda like to have that cp before hand
churning,not_removed,interesting dp regarding csr jan was on chase already with chase sw plus and chasing comp pass hence applied first for chase sw premier asked me to call to verify resident docs told them sent same recently approved then immediately applied for csr on the same day denied with reason too many recent cards with chase called recon same day denied same reason jan th called recon denied again after asking few details and pulling transunion reason not a long credit history with chase only months they would lilke to see how i am doing over a long period jan called recon again denied with diff reason not long credit history was told it started only from sep which she said not long enough i mentioned i never missed a payment and ended thanking her and wished a happy weekend jan logged in chase checking my dues and balances suddenly saw something strange a new card in my acount csr did i really got approved d d
churning,not_removed,i want to downgrade my csp as i got the reserve card is there a reason not to go directly to the freedom unlimited card is there a benefit to step down to sapphire first i do not plan on using the unlimited card but dont want to cancel the account
churning,not_removed,reposting so more people can see just a heads up some weird shit is happening with some of the spg referral links generated recently i generated a new one for my spg biz yesterday double checked it to make sure it had the language before i posted it then heard from a friend that it was linking to the two free nights offer tried generating two more tonight through the link on my amex account and both the page and the email referenced the offer but when i click on the link its the two night offer again i finally got the damn language to pop up by using the referral generator link from the spg site that had been down the other day long story short might want to double check your spg link because aint nobody applying for the card to get two free nights and no starpoints
churning,not_removed,odd data point found out usaa takes credit card payments for my car loan however there is no autopay option for cc and i can only pay hours after the due date however i can do this monthly with no penalty how bizzare
churning,not_removed,pause for appreciation i didnt know ink plus was going away until i saw the thread on this sub applied at once for my real business got the well be in touch and two nights ago the card appeared already was in staples last night getting the vgcs for the rebate which i also wouldnt have known about because who honestly hits staples on the regular and i plan on many more visits now that i think i have a liquidation strategy the flythegirlfriendupforvisitsonpoints fund thanks you all very much
churning,not_removed,better to ms on the prg or the spg or will i be fine doing both
churning,not_removed,does every body worry about the credit lines on their cards for whatever reason i want my lines to be high even though in the grand scope of things it doesnt really matter im just curious if people like having their lines lower to or up in the five digits
churning,not_removed,my vgc from the september hancock bank promo arrived today

churning,not_removed,chase put a freeze on my csp for some reason and i had to call them and answer a bunch of questions about my employment history and previous addresses so they could supposedly verify my identity then they asked if i was the one who added the au to my account which i think is the real reason for the freeze didnt know id get interrogated for it
churning,not_removed,asking out of curiosity why do you guys value hotel stays so much while traveling isnt the idea to go visit places of interest and explore popular local spots you go to your hotel only to put your bags sleep and shower does it really matter if its cat or do you guys ever consider airbnb i understand that its a matter of personal preference but id like to understand others point of view
churning,not_removed,im in the process of looking for an engagement ring what is the best card to put the purchase on in regards to purchase protection for this particular item im thinking amex since their process is smooth for making a claim but im thinking any card will do right any tips would be nice
churning,not_removed,gotta love citihilton just received a mailer offering to upgrade my no af card to the surpass the bonus for upgrading nothing i understand that the surpass edit meant to say reserve has better benefits and higher rates of point accumulation but they cant throw me a borderlineworthless points as an incentive to upgrade outside of avoiding a hard pullnew account opening i cant imagine why someone knowledgable would take this offer
churning,not_removed,psa for chase rc holders be on the lookout for your annual points premium i totally forgot about this small bonus just got points for those that dont know rc card gives you a points dividend based on the points you earned in the previous year my statement was and it showed up on that statement

churning,not_removed,is it a viable strategy to have all spend go towards minimum spend for signup bonuses or is it ever better to point spend towards regular rewards or category bonuses
churning,not_removed,i know this is a pretty unique situation but has anyone else found themselves with amex credit cards all of my cards are very old years so i can only assume i got in before the limits were instituted however now i am trying to find any dps before i go about getting some new ones my assumption is just dropping one will not help me due to the max rule but if anyone else has found themselves in the same situation and has dps i would appreciate the feedback i wont be doing new amex for a few months but want to plan ahead if i need to move cls points etc before closing some im also considering taking the bonus to upgrade to surpass assuming it will bypass the limit without dropping any cards current list is blue blue spg spg biz hilton noaf and platinum business credit card yes this is not the charge card which i also have this is the credit card which i dont believe is even available anymore and no i am not including aus
churning,not_removed,is it normal for experian to send you your credit report when you remove a security freeze just unfroze mine and received my credit report in the mail saying dispute results our investigation of the dispute you recently submitted is now complete i never opened a dispute i just unfroze my credit report tried calling experian and cant seem to talk to an actual person about it i get stuck in the automated system
churning,not_removed,question about citi aadvantage platinum language i applied for the aadvantage bonus last week with no language just got my account approval notice in the mail not the actual card but the approval notice this notice also mentions the spend with no mention of months i should be good right i remember there was some sort of worry about some who got notices without that language
churning,not_removed,i have an interesting data point on how soon you can transfer points out from chase ur to airlinehotel partners after adding an au tldr as soon as you add an au to chase you can transfer in the persons name to a travel partner when researching this i couldnt find information anywhere so hopefully this is helpful if it is not worthy of its own post please let me know and i will move it to the daily thread so i was calling into british airways to book a trip via aer lingus and due to the slight devaluation instead of trips of less than miles being avios each way they are now either or depending whether it is peak or off season i was two thousand points short the spouse has a csr card but we never added me as an au because why waste the per year when i can use the card via android pay anyways however to transfer from chase ur to a travel partner the information on the travel partner account has to match specifically to the chase cardholder or au the ba account was in my name so while on the phone with the rep spouse logs into the chase account adds me as an au to the csr goes over to the portal to transfer points and my name instantly had shown up as an option for transferring to travel partners was able to transfer to my ba account immediately and had the rep refresh and the points were in the ba account within seconds
churning,not_removed,i am prequalified for the citi aadvantage platinum select world elite card i dont and have never had a citi card but the prequalified offer doesnt appear to have any information regarding the month rule what would be the best action to take on this could i apply for a different aadvantage card now and then apply for the prequalified offer a couple weeks later and effectively bypass the month rule

churning,not_removed,how else do we afford it lol the people who actually pay to stay there think were assholes and dont deserve to stay there
churning,not_removed,mainly because there are no hyatt credit cards outside of the us and having been to the maldives its way too far for people in north america to go for a beach resort turks and caicos st kitts or bora bora are where the wealthier acquaintances i know go instead
churning,not_removed,does the hotel get money for points stays from the loyalty program
churning,not_removed,i was there last week can confirmed met quite a few people staying on points there
churning,not_removed,depends a lot on the program nothing is guaranteed
churning,not_removed,my mom died with some us bank points my sister and i each got a gift card with them and donated the rest to st judes also when my dad died ten years before my mom she logged into his delta account and transferred his remaining miles to herself before she even received the death certificate he would have wanted her to have them
churning,not_removed,my husband died in august he didnt have many points he didnt particularly like churning and preferred cash back but he did have some hyatt points i contacted them and told them the situation and sent them a copy of his death certificate and they transferred the hyatt points to me like any other digital asset its going to depend on the issuer though having all your information with your will or provided to someone you trust can only be a good thing
churning,not_removed,have a plan my wife knows the passwords to the accounts and to contact my churning buddy to get help with managing the points when that time comes if something were to happen varies by program what you can do with them though
churning,not_removed,they can be left to descendants my fatherinlaw had a sizable stash of usair points earned the hard way that my motherinlaw inherited on his death i guess im not sure if spouse is a special case though but i doubt it
churning,not_removed,i wrote out instructions last week for my wife on what to do with our credit cards and pointsmiles if i were to die i would recommend doing something like this so they dont go to waste
churning,not_removed,im working on the spend for my fourth lifetime aa card i had never asked for the match before as i didnt want to draw attention to myself however i decided to ask for it via online message for this newest card and they gave it to me no questions asked
churning,not_removed,how long did it take to post
churning,not_removed,i would hang up immediately hahaha
churning,not_removed,i would try disguising my voice and see if theyll take any of my bullshit
churning,not_removed,yes wwwdoctorofcreditcommerrillchurnableprobably
churning,not_removed,speaking from having worked in a call center not credit card though there can be a system in place that tries to automatically route you back to the same rep if they are available ie not on another call or logged off the phones this exists for a couple reasons if you were disconnected they might be able to continue right where you left off they already spoke to you and call centers are definitely aware that people will huca seeking a different answer so this will contain that a bit now i dont know for sure that whatever company you called has that built into their system but they might
churning,not_removed,mom is cool with it if not this is identity theft as long as the payment of her card always comes from your account going forward until dad takes over ie dont use billpays and your account isnt with chase they dont care about what name is on the paying account
churning,not_removed,you should probably put some organic spend on the card as well
churning,not_removed,it doesnt matter buying gift cards is legitimate
churning,not_removed,buying store gift cards is fine
churning,not_removed,once points posted to qualify me for companion pass was able to sign up for it the same day and add my companion to existing reservations
churning,not_removed,that is very lucky for you
churning,not_removed,dont forget to generate a fresh referral link it could still earn you points even after the downgrade someone correct me if this is not true
churning,not_removed,how old is the csp the reason to go to sapphire is because you cant downgrade directly to fu in under a year if its more than a year old go right ahead
churning,not_removed,usually not an option to go direct to freedom if the csp was opened less than months ago
churning,not_removed,that is strange have you tried going directly to americanexpresscomrefer and sending the referral link from there curious if youre having the same issue there just checked both my business and personal spg referrals and they both show up as point offers when i click through
churning,not_removed,luuuuuuuucky
churning,not_removed,my car loan at regional acceptance takes credit cards as well
churning,not_removed,have you tried making that payment wouldnt that affect your credit score if youre paying late
churning,not_removed,i would do spg since they are way easier to use compared to mr
churning,not_removed,you will be fine with both
churning,not_removed,no issues with spg so far
churning,not_removed,cards that are in my wallet i like to be high so that utilization on them is low i want my aggregate credit to be high as well again so utilization is low sockdrawered cards i transfer credit off those and on to cards i use because for them it doesnt matter
churning,not_removed,i like my lines high but there is no point of being over if you arent carrying a balance
churning,not_removed,i like to try to keep one card above comes in handy for the periodic purchase of lets say new windows in my case the deposit was and i forgot my limit was thankfully chase took it and i paid off part of it move cl around
churning,not_removed,depends on your needs really ive had a need for in purchases in the past higher cl may help with a better credit usage score if that matters to you but there are dps that lower cl on citi cards eg will help with auto approval
churning,not_removed,to the extent one is worried about utilization or credit limit at a certain bank
churning,not_removed,oh wow when did you meet the requirements i did mine in september also abd got mine early december
churning,not_removed,also used mine last night anyone that hasnt done this yet should get on it the app indicated my credit was going to expire february
churning,not_removed,my bf and i even when traveling love to sleep in and have lazy morning or two staying at properties that are clearly above our social status feels fun
churning,not_removed,i think the goal for a lot of folks is to make the travel the exploring the experiencing as free as possible airbnb is rad and i probably prefer it but there are less options out there to get free airbnb whereas there are a ton of hotel cards were churners man we love the deal
churning,not_removed,free hotel airbnb also with elite status you sometimes get free breakfast it is a matter of preference im not gonna throw my points on a rc but a nice marriott is worth it imo
churning,not_removed,the hotel is part of the entire visit experience when you can afford to pay for a or less generic room that youve seen a million times before getting it for free is just saving money but it isnt providing you with any kind of new experience the cheap stay becomes a tool that allows you to enjoy something but it also becomes isolated from the experience whereas staying in a several hundred dollar suite that you would never ever pay out of pocket for is opening you up to an experience that you would otherwise never see and will never forget
churning,not_removed,i totally get where youre coming from as i often feel the same way i have lots of points stashed up but find myself saving those points for flights more so than hotels ive tallied many more nights at airbnbs and campgrounds than i have at hotels that said it ultimately depends what you want to get out of a trip hotels themselves can be an awesome experience sometimes ill splurge using points on a hotel because i want to be uber pampered theres an awesome feeling i get staying at a really nice westin or hyatt that i just generally dont get from airbnbs other times the hospitality and local flavor of airbnb hosts is what im looking for and its just as special of an experience airbnbs allow you to really dive deep into the local vibe and you can learn a lot from hosts if you both happen to be somewhat talkative i always tell people that with airbnbs it feels like youre living there as opposed to just visiting fwiw if youre more of an airbnb folk make sure you take advantage of discounted airbnb gcs when theyre available i nabbed a few from amazon last time they were off and dont forget that you can earn skymile for every dollar spent on airbnbs too deltaairbnbcom
churning,not_removed,hotel stays can be redeemed through essentially free points while airbnb would always cost you some money at least
churning,not_removed,internationally that shower can be a big deal and may not be available at an str additionally some international properties are amazing like park hyatt buenos aires that are built in former palaces in these places the hotel itself is a point of interest you can see the history and culture as well
churning,not_removed,in big cities hotels are expensive if you want a central location even the cheaper hotels are gonna cost you why not get them for free when its so easy to do so
churning,not_removed,free benefits from status cleanliness admittedly not always history of a place service less risk of cancellation safety hour checkin engineering service etc usually a central location this summer so and i are going to rc half moon bay fairmont sf and the andaz in napa these are experiences namely the two former hotels that cant be replicated
churning,not_removed,even if you do just want a cat many people wouldnt normally be able to afford for a few hundred bucks for a weekend i get that youre saying you see the hotel as not really important and i understand that but you have to remember there are people of different income levels here
churning,not_removed,ive wondered whether most of you all go for the crazy awesome suites for more points or more of the free ones awesome room costing points or generic free room i personally dont care about hotel experiences but my so is the opposite
churning,not_removed,read the terms not sure if jewelry is covered
churning,not_removed,consider blue nile i think they are available via ur portal or tcb or something
churning,not_removed,james allen for the win
churning,not_removed,it shouldnt matter since you should get insurance on it mine was cheaper through my renters insurance than through a jewelry insurance company most jewelry stores will appraise it for more than you paid our for more which is good if you lose it but bad since you pay more to insure it im sure you could tell them to only do it for the paid amount if you want
churning,not_removed,as others have said but ill put it more succinctly use the purchase to hit minimum spends then immediately take out a personal items policy on it
churning,not_removed,what sort of purchase protection are you looking for price protection or return protection edit sorry just reread that its an engagement ring so prob not return protection p amex does not do price protection anymore and discover does not cover jewellery check up on chaseciti perhaps
churning,not_removed,not sure about which card but just wanted to make sure you check out costcos selection for value and quality
churning,not_removed,jewelry is excluded practically of the time oops misread what exactly you meant see below an engagement ring purchase is what got me into churning eventually d my recommendation is that you use a cc where it will net you a very nice signup bonus i used the csp for an engagement ring and a nea merrill plus for wedding bands but my jeweler didnt offer a discount for cash and any discount probably wouldnt outweigh a signup bonus anyway if youre just doing it for the rewards you want to explore a cash discount instead nonchurning advice talk to your insurance agent renters or homeowners whichever applies before you buy and make sure it will be covered from the moment of purchase and be very clear about what is covered my renters insurance policy is great and covers accidental loss but many do not i have tons of random advice available via pm if you have any burning questions
churning,not_removed,i would find a diamond broker you knowtrust through family or friends then put it on whatever will get the most points and take out insurance i found jewlers mutual was the best for me until we got on usaa which was far better
churning,not_removed,i used to work for desk claims we handled jewelry claims flawless process for loss of jewelry i usually paid same day oh you looked down and were missing a tennis bracelet do you want direct deposit sir
churning,not_removed,as mentioned by another commenter blue nike is available in the chase portal when you factor in the fact that you will be foregoing a discount for a wire transfer you get about ¢dollar back if you spend it trough the csr travel portal
churning,not_removed,citi offered an upgrade to the surpass wouldnt that have to be amex
churning,not_removed,citi is known for offering upgrades that are simply ridiculous they offered me to spend on a card to get admiral club passes that cost
churning,not_removed,thats good for us when other people took the offer let citi keep on doing what it does best
churning,not_removed,same got about points
churning,not_removed,i like the weight and construction of the ritz carlton the color of the csr and centurion and the aesthetic of the csp if chase made an allmetal sapphire that had a dark blackandnavy faceted look like the csp i think that would be and im using the technical term here a pretty dope card
churning,not_removed,honestly gotta say the amex centurion but just a fan of metalmetal like cards like cspcsr wish the csr wasnt such a dark color
churning,not_removed,spg color scheme is so vibrant just wish the materials were less flimsy and the card was a bit less busy i do like how some cards like the dc and the csrcsp have moved most info to the back of the card
churning,not_removed,i wish the amex zync was around still favorite design
churning,not_removed,i really like the design of the amex plat but its probably more so the feeling i get when i use it versus the actual look of the card
churning,not_removed,the merrill it is the most beautiful welldesigned card i own by far and its plastic its amazing how far behind everyone else is on card design if such a work of art is possible p
churning,not_removed,wf propel world black with the gold stagecoach and horses edit pic shown at docs review httpwwwdoctorofcreditcomcreditcardsrewardswellsfargopropelworldamericanexpresscardreview
churning,not_removed,love the look and feel of csp not so much with csr huge sucker for the amex bce it was one of my first cards and i thought the seethrough plastic with the shiny blue square was so cool the novelty has worn off a bit though also liked the whitegreen citi forward design back when the card was actually available
churning,not_removed,trusty ole csp
churning,not_removed,merrill lynch batman colors
churning,not_removed,csp metal and really cool color simple design if spg was a little darker purple and metal that would pretty hard to beat
churning,not_removed,csp
churning,not_removed,i like the discover card that looks like an audio tape i have kept my old one without a chip for nostalgia
churning,not_removed,what happens when you try to recover your passwordaccount
churning,not_removed,for unbonused spend it generally makes sense to be putting it towards a minimum or a retention spend bonus if you can however for bonused spend eg gas groceries one of the freedom or discover categories its not the most optimal decision to use the card youre meeting a minimum on if you have another card that will earn on the transaction and you will not be maxing out that bonus category with another card this is because all things being equal i can do unlimited couch ms if im willing to pay a fee and so using the card im trying to hit a minimum on instead of a card i got say a bonus on will put me worse off by on that transaction for example lets say im trying to hit the minimum spend on the amex business platinum and i have a purchase at sams club i could use the amex plat and get mr or i could use the discover it thats still in its first year and so will give me cash back on that transaction assuming this spend would make the difference between me hitting the spend goal or not and i have no way of cheaply msing then i put the purchase on the it and put through venmosquare cash to hit on the plat my net from that transaction is mr and so im ahead of the scenario in which i just used the plat so basically for bonus spend categories ill just always use whatever card i get the highest bonus on for nonbonus categories i will use a card im meeting a minimum on if i have one
churning,not_removed,id almost always prioritize min spend think of it this way youre at a gas station you have a freedom that will earn ur or an amex plat with a min spend of with the plat youre earning effectively mr thats pretty hard to beat the only exception is if you know youll hit the minimum spend on non bonus categories alone at that point use the rotating card where applicable and the min spend card in non bonus spending
churning,not_removed,worst case scenario for meeting min spend for me is using venmo at if the category spend is better than such as chase freedomdiscover etc i use category card for usual categories id likely use min spend card unless i have no problem meeting the min spend
churning,not_removed,as others have said it depends on how much you spend normally and how much min spend you need but also how quickly you want to hit the minimums for the csr i put everything on it so i could hit the minimum early as i had an upcoming need for the points now i put dining on csr groceries on bcp and have enough nonbonus spend to hit the minimum on other cards while still maximizing those categories it takes me nearly the whole months to hit minimum but meanwhile im maximizing my other earnings
churning,not_removed,it really varies person to person i think someone who has low monthly organic spending and isnt able to ms will probably put everything towards the card theyre trying to meet min spend for if you are able to ms then youd really get much higher utilization if you spread the spending amongst cards thatll get you the best rewards
churning,not_removed,spend towards signup bonuses tend to have substantially higher roi than regular spend that earns rewards assuming you arent going for cards with really lame signup bonuses the problem is that you can only sign up for so many cards and theres a cost associated with that hard pulls on your credit file eventually youll run out of cards to apply for issuers will be reluctant to give you the more lucrative ones and youll almost certainly have wrecked the relationship with a few by pumping and dumping youre costing them a lot i think its all about finding a balance be smart about prioritizing the cards you get optimize your spend when you do and dont have signup bonuses to earn and be mindful of what issuers care about
churning,not_removed,all towards minimum spend unless you would hit minimum spend without doing so then you would put bonused spend on your best bonused spend card whatever else you need towards minimum spend nothing is higher roi than a signup bonus
churning,not_removed,yes its viable its easier if you prepay your bills obviously you cant set up autopay if youre changing a credit card every month to save time just pay months at a time to limit the number of times you get bills in the mail or log in to pay your online bill further advice prepay your really small bills months in advance and your bigger bills months in advance so you arent floating so much money our water bill is per month so we just pay like at a time
churning,not_removed,gonna be hard to find someone with six different yr old cards in a churning sub but good luck
churning,not_removed,i believe ive seen dps of old amex cards getting the bonus again years
churning,not_removed,i doubt youll find many others in the same situation but i dont think theres any harm in applying if you see an amex credit card bonus you like amex generally doesnt do a hard credit pull if they dont approve the application so theres not a downside i can see if your application is rejected you can call them for recon and offer to close one of the old cards if that makes a difference they might tell you that youd need to close more than one of the old accounts to get a new one
churning,not_removed,in their dispute results did they change anything on your report
churning,not_removed,it is normal
churning,not_removed,notice also mentions the spend with no mention of months i should be good right yes
churning,not_removed,should be good dont forget to get matched to
churning,not_removed,ba has household accounts she could have transferred to her own account and you could use the miles that way
churning,not_removed,you could apply with the prequalified link first then apply with the link from reddit after days
churning,not_removed,no they dont care i mostly only use mine for spending check out buying gift card from gyftcom using the ink via paypal they have a better selection than staples and you dont have to leave the house
churning,not_removed,a business expense is whatever your business you wants it to be
churning,not_removed,give me a few minutes to apply for an amex and hope i get the card number on autoapproval
churning,not_removed,if it was an online purchase it could also be that your computer has a virus might wanna get your computer checked
churning,not_removed,same thing has happened to me with i card i never use i think its more likely that the breach is on the amex side or that they just randomly picked your number and got lucky
churning,not_removed,i really hope you dont get charge back by somebody using venmo venmo is nice for friends but could be very expansive with total strangers be warned
churning,not_removed,im proud of you
churning,not_removed,careful you are going to hurt your shoulder reaching around to pat yourself on the back p
churning,not_removed,just do it via secure message eg id like to reallocate of credit from my card ending in xxxx to my card ending in xxxx ive done it a dozen times and its super easy
churning,not_removed,kind of strange try a different rep or just send in a sm ive done both sm and called in before for this never had an issue never needed to speak to a specialist
churning,not_removed,hang up dont call back and use sm d
churning,not_removed,when youre delayed youre eligible for reasonable expenses like hotelfoodtransportation up to that
churning,not_removed,amex hands out business cards like the rich neighbor hands out huge candy bars on halloween try amex next
churning,not_removed,much harder for a second chase business card ive heard amex is easy
churning,not_removed,so they didnt forget about that
