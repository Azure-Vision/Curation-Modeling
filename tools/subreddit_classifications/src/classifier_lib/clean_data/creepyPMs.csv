creepyPMs,removed,but you come off as the asshole in this conversation big time

creepyPMs,removed,he wasnt really that bad compared to most creepy pms
creepyPMs,removed,unless he followed up with a dick pic or kept requesting your snapchat i wouldnt call this a creepypm
creepyPMs,removed,sounds more purposed trolling
creepyPMs,removed,a girl that j confessed to in the form of saying hey i like you told everyone in school that i sexually assaulted her that im sick and should kill myself and said the latter multiple times to my face now im eager to see what you come up with for this specimen school sucks
creepyPMs,removed,oh he is one of those
creepyPMs,removed,you can tell he was trolling and for that he just comes off really pathetic rather than creepy
creepyPMs,removed,ah no sorry its more like i got this for a perfectly normal question and im eager to see what this guy will get for his extraordinary and quitewell weird creepy etc question
creepyPMs,removed,im not one to kinkshame but this crosses the line i wonder how well that opener has been working for him
creepyPMs,removed,why arent we allowed to kinkshame anyway this guy should be sterilised
creepyPMs,removed,well jesus op are you going to help him or what
creepyPMs,removed,tell him though are forwarding to his mom dont really do that though just make him worry
creepyPMs,removed,this honestly sounds like a family member or dumb immature friend got on his facebook n started randomly messaging people stupid shit without thinking about the consequences
creepyPMs,removed,so thats how you attract women
creepyPMs,removed,well that takes all the fun out of it
creepyPMs,removed,one of my friends has a diaper fetish i doubt anyone else is using this guys account to send that stuff i know you didnt put caw but id personally ask him to stop and if he didnt or gave me shit for it id block him
creepyPMs,removed,report for harassment guys clearly a dick
creepyPMs,removed,ask him irl maybe someone made a fake account
creepyPMs,removed,he could be trolling
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i mean not the worst
creepyPMs,removed,time to delete
creepyPMs,removed,this is the first legitimately creepy pm ive ever seen on this sub reddit
creepyPMs,removed,lol
creepyPMs,removed,youre joking right
creepyPMs,removed,please go back to tumblr
creepyPMs,removed,his friends are using his account ive had the exact same thing happen
creepyPMs,removed,he has a thing for you and his friends or siblings are fucking with him
creepyPMs,removed,are you sure his account hasnt been hacked or taken over by his friends
creepyPMs,removed,so obviously someone else doing stupid shit on his account
creepyPMs,removed,says someone is on his account family members can be dicks haha
creepyPMs,removed,even if there are also decent people like you found a keeper
creepyPMs,removed,yeah it was more meant like a fml type of thing sorry if it didnt come across like that
creepyPMs,removed,kinkshaming is my kink
creepyPMs,removed,he may have gotten hacked maybe ask if nothing else hell at least lie and never bug you again about it
creepyPMs,removed,im confused he used a bad taken copy pasta but you were the one who called him a rapist out of the blue
creepyPMs,removed,no kink shaming here you might trigger the mods
creepyPMs,removed,hes probably on xanax rn
creepyPMs,removed,dont egg people like that on its easier to just ignore once they get creepy
creepyPMs,removed,so are you just being an asshole here
creepyPMs,removed,im calling shenanigans youre a hamplanet who is seeking validation
creepyPMs,removed,fat is beautiful bby
creepyPMs,removed,you mustered up the fucks to give a reply i dont want to see your picture thanks though
creepyPMs,removed,you m or f
creepyPMs,removed,definetly indian he also asked for a belly pic lmao
creepyPMs,removed,i hope you gave him a good punch in the face cuz that shit aint okay wtf
creepyPMs,removed,dear i would have called the police right away i can smell a bad situation from miles away after living in baltimore for years as a skinny white girl in her twenties id definitely suggest you carry a taser pepper spray or a gun with you fuck humanity
creepyPMs,removed,do you know of the stun gun laws in your state i lived in ny up until a few months ago and had become so paranoid from very aggressive street harassment that i always had a knife and pepper spray in my purse at all times i really would love to have a stun gun but that was totally illegal there i hope wherever you are you can get your hands on a legal portable form of self protection mace at the very least be safe
creepyPMs,removed,hey tyrana you left your name unblocked on image and i just wanted to make sure youre aware of itive taken the post down in case it was accidental
creepyPMs,removed,seriously
creepyPMs,removed,you left your first name in the second to last pic fyi
creepyPMs,removed,tell me this guys name doesnt start with a b i have a cousin i dont talk to and this guy sounds exactly like him
creepyPMs,removed,mkay slut
creepyPMs,removed,so thats why you didnt censor when they called you brianna seriously though those were all different people thats fucked up how often does this happen
creepyPMs,removed,im not sure what state you are in but if this was ny this is clear cut extortion you make it worth my while not to send them new york penal law section defines larceny by extortion as a person obtains property by extortion when he compels or induces another person to deliver such property to himself or to a third person by means of instilling in him a fear that if the property is not so delivered the actor or another will v expose a secret or publicize an asserted fact whether true or false tending to subject some person to hatred contempt or ridicule do yourself a favor and talk to a detective
creepyPMs,removed,so this is illegal please go to the police obviously this tactic has worked for this guy before turn his ass in before he does this to someone else again what an asshole
creepyPMs,removed,you missed your name in the second to last image
creepyPMs,removed,why would you even entertain this asinine moron for so long op karma
creepyPMs,removed,oh god that keyboard my eyes if only i knew that was coming i would have fucked off long before i reached the last image
creepyPMs,removed,pure shit this
creepyPMs,removed,what ended up happening did you raise your voice to call attention to yourself and yell hey could you stop bothering me thats why id do draw attention to them
creepyPMs,removed,isnt asexuality having no sexual interests
creepyPMs,removed,haha im pretty sure that second ones a dunkey reference gave me a giggle
creepyPMs,removed,picture got a name in it dunno if thats your name
creepyPMs,removed,he is a rep for alcon labs and a higher up in the company
creepyPMs,removed,reading this made me want to punch him in the face take a hint my god
creepyPMs,removed,can you post more attempts
creepyPMs,removed,not sure why you havent brought this up with your ex or the dues wife
creepyPMs,removed,that is a terrible try at negging give the boy a sticker
creepyPMs,removed,i see your last message was deleted before i replied but you should send the message of the pic to him if you know him
creepyPMs,removed,try id rather give you cancer let me do some research and ill get back to you
creepyPMs,removed,i was quoting the last guy
creepyPMs,removed,wait i dont see the turning it around on you unless im missing a cap also why not just block him
creepyPMs,removed,triggered by facts
creepyPMs,removed,is it textured or have unusual shape assuming for healthy vaginal elasticity and lubrication there shouldnt be discomfort if youve warmed up for it or are aroused enough im assuming that youre pacing yourself and arent just trying to jump on something bigger than youre used to at the start of a session but youd know your body best i have some bigger toys that are definitely not my goto bed buddies and would totally cause pain if i tried using them first thing but they definitely see use when im rarin for it i commented before because i think its important that people not bodyshame as a kneejerk reaction to creeps may be uncommon and need extra accommodation but the guys that have them cant help what theyre equipped with and it doesnt make them more or less deserving of sexual acceptance than any other person deriding even just the idea of an actual penis is like the creepshaming version of real women have curves i apologize if my frankness is offensive this type of discussion is literally the entire point of this account
creepyPMs,removed,i think the statement he was trying to make is that women are objects and not worth a mans time this its cheaper and better to pay them for what we want and be done with it nowthe real amusing part is that he pays a prostitute to sit in his face so basically his mouth is just a breeding factory for other mens seminal fluids and stds good job there bro
creepyPMs,removed,would you bang a prostitute unprotected if the answer is yes then we have a fundamental disagreement here my friend
creepyPMs,removed,go fuck yourself
creepyPMs,removed,men hating cunts
creepyPMs,removed,this is only seems creepy in the context that youre not in a relationship with this guy otherwise this sounds romantic as fuck
creepyPMs,removed,why you called him a loser you dont know him
creepyPMs,removed,why did you block out his info
creepyPMs,removed,but youre one of them
creepyPMs,removed,it wasnt unsolicited you asked for it you dl wanted to see the d
creepyPMs,removed,why not just not message back and block
creepyPMs,removed,i feel like the is more sketchy than creepy so its a little out or place of this subreddit i was expecting a sporadic sext or something
creepyPMs,removed,going online to make friends sure
creepyPMs,removed,you guys are both weirdcreepyannoying
creepyPMs,removed,sorry this is happening to you but im gonna use you as an example this is why you dont send pics like this kids the internet is forever
creepyPMs,removed,now if you look to your left youll see a really bad comment
creepyPMs,removed,hey well at least you can go back and have sex with him sometime nsa
creepyPMs,removed,the whole say hi to reddit thing is eh
creepyPMs,removed,he asks for nudes you reply with yea dick he sends you a dick
creepyPMs,removed,fuck this sub ban me you cunts
creepyPMs,removed,overcompensating at its finest though to be fair if someone says i want to judged and complimented on my intelligence not my outward appearance they damn better do something intelligent cause i can see someones outward appearance easily i cant see someone is intelligent until they do something intelligent where i can see it
creepyPMs,removed,you sound like a pedo trying to draw attention away from yourself lol but yeah hes messed up
creepyPMs,removed,im just messing with you man
creepyPMs,removed,exactly i mean why the hell would i even care if i have weird earlobes men are weird
creepyPMs,removed,what did it say
creepyPMs,removed,is your account newish and fairly unused because the last one got found on here or is it just a case of a new thing to do with the messages and you dont want to use your regular account for that reason interesting that you have new serious creep issues literally every day though and by interesting i mean sickening
creepyPMs,removed,all i can think when i look at it is why is it carrot shaped
creepyPMs,removed,but wait are you signed up to a dating site or is he chatting shit
creepyPMs,removed,the combination of asking if she had her period and him saying see you again made me think op banged this guy and is now giving him the cold shoulder could be wrong
creepyPMs,removed,fuck you
creepyPMs,removed,go ahead ban me i really dont give a fuck op wants to be told what she want to hear grow the fuck up
creepyPMs,removed,oh the i have respect for myself was to be in reference to how else the word could be used whore can mean sex worker permiscuous woman or a woman that will do anything in sex because they dont respect their body people got to make a living and i dont look down on those who use sex as a career
creepyPMs,removed,yikes have you had an sti check recently
creepyPMs,removed,im not trying to understand his side of the story im trying to understand the story as a whole as not a lot can be gleaned from one screenshot without further explanation
creepyPMs,removed,same i was expecting some colorful lumps that kind of resemble a bag of melted skittles and just got an weird looking dick
creepyPMs,removed,valid response
creepyPMs,removed,thats actually a really good picture bright lighting good background no peekdownthepants view and his dick looks really clean had this been solicited but it was not so go fuck
creepyPMs,removed,awwwnow i feel bad for the rapist
creepyPMs,removed,just a guy who watches way too much porndeep throat porn
creepyPMs,removed,you wot fuck you i am drunk real men are irish
creepyPMs,removed,i dont believe you
creepyPMs,removed,finish him are we not doing phrasing anymore
creepyPMs,removed,oh shit clinically diagnosed excuse me i shouldnt have been so callous you poor person everyone has depression and anxiety from time to time and you can be clinically diagnosed by checking some boxes on a piece of paper you cant think your way out of a real mental illness even with techniques as specialized as mindfulness lol again read my original comment i didnt suggest she rekindle any sort of relationship with her abuser if you think i did i dont know what i can say to help you understand
creepyPMs,removed,lowkey want to see the ass that inspired this exchange now
creepyPMs,removed,you know that sti tests can actually break the bank for some people right i get that he was completely out of line but causing someone enough fear that they may possibly be giving up necessities to get tested when it isnt necessary at all isnt exactly a great solution
creepyPMs,removed,i think op clarified a lite further down in the comments but it got downvoted
creepyPMs,removed,lol ok i recognized signs of a person spiraling toward doom and suggested that his life is probably worth saving you rode in with your glistening white armor and created something out of nothing id like to explain further but you have no intention of understanding what im saying
creepyPMs,removed,i cant wait for true gender equality and women start sending out pussy pics to everyone maybe im the only one not getting pussy pics 😢
creepyPMs,removed,are you going to be ok read comments that op posted she wants him to be ok too
creepyPMs,removed,you have no compassion greybunnyrabbit if anonymous internet posting can make you this angry maybe you should take a break
creepyPMs,removed,because id rather pay once every years than a huge tax increase some people would benefit from socialized medicine some would lose there are far more people who would lose
creepyPMs,removed,this has fake written all over it to be honest
creepyPMs,removed,its a risk we take my dad is and has never had to have an expensive medical procedure it works out for some doesnt for others that is just the way some of us prefer it
creepyPMs,removed,the small weird indent in his junk near the top was bad enough for me
creepyPMs,removed,it is what it is
creepyPMs,removed,i have insurance that wouldnt let this happen
creepyPMs,removed,i wish i didnt read all of your reply though
creepyPMs,removed,tldr
creepyPMs,removed,everyone here pretending like this dude doesnt have a pretty decent dick hell i would be pretty happy having a big like that
creepyPMs,removed,once is understandable but twice
creepyPMs,removed,thank you this i in no way meant to equate sex worker to whore i feel personally attacked here and this shouldnt be allowed
creepyPMs,removed,i feel rather attacked because i was misunderstood so thanks
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,thats definitely a joke though
creepyPMs,removed,you mods are pretty big assholes
creepyPMs,removed,a creeps words affect you so insecure lol get therapy
creepyPMs,removed,you seem very hostile and on the edge op why so unhappy
creepyPMs,removed,hes a indian guy
creepyPMs,removed,rejecting friend zone makes you an automatic creep and accepting it makes you a beta
creepyPMs,removed,what a complete retard this guy is gonna die after a lonely life
creepyPMs,removed,vcc vancouver community college
creepyPMs,removed,dont accept friend requests from people you dont know is an excellent rule to live by save yourself the trouble of dealing with idiots
creepyPMs,removed,isnt i have a boyfriend always a lie though
creepyPMs,removed,are you polyamerous you mentioned a girlfriend and a boyfriend just curious
creepyPMs,removed,come on this has to be faked right no one can be that lacking in self awareness right right
creepyPMs,removed,shouldve blocked him about pages of texts ago men like that are fucking ridiculous and with the whole im going to ruin your life shit i might want to bring that up with your group of friends since he seems to know at least some of them
creepyPMs,removed,just ignore hes an insecure douche
creepyPMs,removed,lol i will bitch to my fellow redpillers and cry myself to sleep later
creepyPMs,removed,my comment got removed because i pointed out a negative about srs sometimes i forget the circlequeef goes so far not many places outside of srs and teh denold will remove critiques when they arent even directly on the sub in question
creepyPMs,removed,i mean i have a black friendrelative is like the oldest line in the racist book that doesnt mean you are or arent racist
creepyPMs,removed,sorry youre getting downvotes men are scary tbh
creepyPMs,removed,can i send my application in a very creepy pm or do i have to be formal
creepyPMs,removed,you sound like an angry black woman
creepyPMs,removed,not really that creepy kind of stupid tho
creepyPMs,removed,i think its kinda weird she hasnt blocked him is part of her enjoying it i mean i enjoy reading it obviously the whole sub does
creepyPMs,removed,unosefetish way to go full nazi
creepyPMs,removed,sorry i dont think i was addressing you like what you saw on my post history im the most interesting man in the world right
creepyPMs,removed,you are just am angry little thing maybe you should go back to smoking
creepyPMs,removed,i can see why he is a virgin
creepyPMs,removed,i think these dudes hear that confidence and stating what you want out of relationship is a good thing thats why they say dumb shit like this
creepyPMs,removed,for once i actually kinda feel bad for the other guy i dont think bad response warranted that reaction
creepyPMs,removed,as a male individual who only got harassed once because they wanted to harass a female friend i will admit that most submissions here trigger an im sorry you went through that but its not that bad is it moments which is wrong i know this however triggered a what the fuck is his problem reaction ͡° ʖ̯ ͡°
creepyPMs,removed,youre kinda mean arent you
creepyPMs,removed,well i hope you have a wonderful day and i want you to know that youre a rose in a field of daisies
creepyPMs,removed,cons everythings pros asked your permission before sending nudes i mean objectively he has something going for him that a lot of creeps here dont
creepyPMs,removed,what intentions i didnt break the rules and i wasnt trying to be malicious my username is ironic at best but i know when i dun fucked up ͡° ʖ̯ ͡°
creepyPMs,removed,jeez and here i held it with my gyrados for two weeks through it mainly was because which retard would be stupid enough to climb that fat ass mountain points at myself
creepyPMs,removed,thats a bizarre thing to say i cant be a racist because my sibling fucked a black person
creepyPMs,removed,id wager that hes never spoken to a woman irl before either that or he may be on the spectrum
creepyPMs,removed,set its privacy to friends only
creepyPMs,removed,i would change that font to something i can stand to read
creepyPMs,removed,canada doesnt consider sorry to be admission of guilt and neither should anyone
creepyPMs,removed,hello are you into dirty talk
creepyPMs,removed,its a tinder douche get over it
creepyPMs,removed,i think the font is even more offensive than that pathetic guy how is glasses or hair dye even an insult though
creepyPMs,removed,thats kinda trying too hard though
creepyPMs,removed,lol no for many common sense reasons
creepyPMs,removed,just curiouswhy are you talking to this guy at all in the first place
creepyPMs,removed,dumb question ive never heard of imgur what is your kik
creepyPMs,removed,retardsand what app is that
creepyPMs,removed,is english your language
creepyPMs,removed,its used as the term for idiotits not making fun of actual disabled people its just like if i were to say thats gay if someone told me about something stupid that happened
creepyPMs,removed,reverse search his profile pic
creepyPMs,removed,you are the worst commenter too
creepyPMs,removed,these generations coming up now are too pussified and sensitive they have no back bone its not my fault if someone gets their panties in a bunch over a word that has multiple meanings
creepyPMs,removed,i dont mean to push buttons here but i thought i saw on reddit that theres a relatively well accepted dialect that is associated with urban working class african americans i believe its called aave or aae or something like that at least thats what wikipedia says ive seen it thrown around recently on reddit but id never heard of it maybe thats what the other person was referring to i didnt see the original comments though so i dont know exactly what was said and how again i dont mean to push buttons or take a side or anything like that i was just curious it seems to me that theres some controversy surrounding the legitimacy of the dialect and of course well at least to me it seemed strange to classify a dialect with respect to a race that is so diverse and spread through out all parts of the us
creepyPMs,removed,if you really want to bust him create a fake account with a cute girl as a profile and friend request him decently high chance he will accept
creepyPMs,removed,you dont owe anyone anything but it takes you literally minutes to let him know that you have no interest in conversing with him and to leave you alone if he persists after that then you have something to post about but someone just saying hello is hardly creepy
creepyPMs,removed,this dudes got some balls lol
creepyPMs,removed,while i completely agree that this is an overreaction and that he was an ass dont you see it as kind off rude to ditch in the middle of a conversation like i always tell people that im off for a while if i was talking to them even if its just half an hour to do some silly little things not many things sting more than being ghosted with no apparent reason
creepyPMs,removed,creepy why remain fb friends if you dont want to talk and he obviously wasnt getting the hint just curious i would have deleted him after the first few creepy messages you must have so much patience
creepyPMs,removed,only source i would have would be a study by okcupid and statistics provided by tinder but its easily observable how women are way more picky than men
creepyPMs,removed,op just a little advice never let them in your private life they dont need to know you have a daughter
creepyPMs,removed,op is from thailand
creepyPMs,removed,so freedom of speech isnt a thing here your point for taking my comment off was that im arguing and im not so whats the problem
creepyPMs,removed,not respecting boundaries is not ok he shouldnt do this neither is ageism ok though age really is irrelevant to who a person is you are entitled to your preferences but not to shame others for theirs
creepyPMs,removed,cringe op
creepyPMs,removed,looking through your post history why the hell do you get so many weird pms what social media are you on to get this
creepyPMs,removed,meetme very classy
creepyPMs,removed,i was only asking because you would expect it way more on a dating app or something like that just asking op in particular seems to get a higher than average amount of creepy pms and unsolicited dick pics
creepyPMs,removed,i understand you can get creepy pms on basically any form of social media but i guess it makes a lot more sense on an app like meetme
creepyPMs,removed,this is pathetic moreso then creepy
creepyPMs,removed,weird arab guys have such a distinct way of texting
creepyPMs,removed,if nobody is interested in his dick why screenshot it and post it on reddit for everyone to see
creepyPMs,removed,its really really really easy to make out the blacked out name on this
creepyPMs,removed,op youre bad a censoring
creepyPMs,removed,am i the only person who can clearly read the username
creepyPMs,removed,thats a pretty good recovery attempt
creepyPMs,removed,kinda douche of you boobmouse but he was also super creepy after the douchey comment
creepyPMs,removed,i mean that wasnt so bad until suddenly lol you must do crazy sex
creepyPMs,removed,because its clear that the idea of actually giving then what they asked for is hilarious they dont expect you to take it seriously
creepyPMs,removed,youi need to saiuy to him that he should stop or youill block him
creepyPMs,removed,tbh you were deadding the convo too with your i dont like music sure being hyperbolic is a type of humour but that soon in a conversation to be that colloquial with someone you barely know is a little far fetched not condoning what the guy asked though youre just both jarring
creepyPMs,removed,you sure he wont
creepyPMs,removed,why use okcupid to look for friends in the first place this will continue to happen given he fact that most people are looking for dates
creepyPMs,removed,how in the hell is this creepy this looks like you showing off that youre an ass hole
creepyPMs,removed,op youre a troll
creepyPMs,removed,my opinion is a virgin
creepyPMs,removed,lets stop worrying about who is and isnt a creep ok we get nowhere that way lets just have some fun and start posting pictures of our feet is what im saying
creepyPMs,removed,youre in violation of rule
creepyPMs,removed,am i not seeing the creep aspect here someone saw you and then sent a friend request and thus are creeps im confused on how you meet new people
creepyPMs,removed,what is lord buddhas name is a male car was it one of those people who was like i identify as a car specifically a male car you need to respect this otherwise i will report you to the police yeah no need to talk to that person xd
creepyPMs,removed,maybe if she lowered her standards she would get laid more often and not be quite so angry
creepyPMs,removed,all those reasons are fine and all but you just dont need to come off as so short tempered
creepyPMs,removed,tall blue eyed surgeon must be code for short fat unemployed guy
creepyPMs,removed,whoa is super old now
creepyPMs,removed,im sorry what the fuck are you talking about it was a crappy joke not some implication that op should be ok with year old men no matter what calm your shit
creepyPMs,removed,just block him its the best thing you can do hes just trying to manipulate you and make you feel guilty
creepyPMs,removed,playing devils advocate i can almost feel pity for the guy i was in kinda the same position but being a desperate pig is only going to make it worse i learned that the hard way
creepyPMs,removed,so was the goal here to see how hed react to being called a creep
creepyPMs,removed,get offended we just see two sentence interaction with you and the creep fuck this subreddit is toxic
creepyPMs,removed,im super cereal you guys someone will get offended by my question report the comment and some rando mod will ban me with some passive aggressive message tacked on to it never questions a ciricle jerk i suppose
creepyPMs,removed,he was way out of line you were incredibly unnecessarily rude for no reason its a wash
creepyPMs,removed,at what point do you stop using these apps i mean you seem to post something here weekly is it still worth it to you
creepyPMs,removed,im probably missing something but why were you so rude to him after he opened up with a compliment
creepyPMs,removed,you dont what the fuck was that you may not be looking for a relationship but at least dont be a cunt
creepyPMs,removed,okay thanks great positivity in here
creepyPMs,removed,babe i swear im sorry take me back
creepyPMs,removed,wow really creepy op probably one of the creepiest creeps on this side of the internet im not sure what was creepier the fact that he made a terrible mistake at some point in his life or that he couldnt spell very well that pos doesnt deserve to kiss the ground op walks on let alone have a child good thing you set him straight op s
creepyPMs,removed,fake
creepyPMs,removed,fake
creepyPMs,removed,feminist with male submissive fetish shocking
creepyPMs,removed,so you got real hott didnt you
creepyPMs,removed,cant say he didnt give fair warning though
creepyPMs,removed,ok so what i dont get is you called him a creep before he did anything he only called you gorgeous only after you called him a creep did he actually turn into one or is it being a creep to call someone gorgeous if it is then id understand that completely just genuinely curious you know
creepyPMs,removed,this is hilarious your text not the creep obviously however i had to scroll backwards through the images to read it on mobile and it was kind of difficult is there a way you might fix that quality creep material otherwise
creepyPMs,removed,this is hilarious your text not the creep obviously however i had to scroll backwards through the images to read it on mobile and it was kind of difficult is there a way you might fix that quality creep material otherwise
creepyPMs,removed,well i will try and comment more often i am suprised i didnt recognize your user name the altgonewild is one of my top at the moment well just keep posting pics of that gorgeous body and talking shit to all the creeps on here
creepyPMs,removed,likes
creepyPMs,removed,how big is the rock you crawled out from
creepyPMs,removed,so are you gonna let them run a train on you or not
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand why you didnt block him straight away you continued to engage with him further provoking him more he got exactly what he wanted from you which was attention and you kept being manipulated into giving it in fact hes getting more of it because youre dwelling about it on reddit you dont have to answer his questions you dont have to give your view point to him all you need to do is focus on your studies and do well without creeps like him you dont owe him your time even when hes trying to force it from you he broke the friendship and youre worth more than what hell ever give be in control here screen shot block report move on family and friends should do the same the police will speak to him about harassment and he may need this to stop completely if you need emotional support then seek out a student counsellor to speak to asap to keep him out of your current relationshiphead document everything as best you can for the police then chill with your boyfriend class a ahat you had there been there sadly worst part was looking back and seeing how long id spent on worrying about a person like that made me an emotional wreck until someone said i had to take back control
creepyPMs,removed,he keeps accusing you of breaking the law are you
creepyPMs,removed,why is that creepy more like racistpm if anything
creepyPMs,removed,thats a stretch guy says hes not comfortable unless he can see the person he is chatting with not that its required on whisper personally i can see his side of things i know a number of people who have ended up talking to girls a lot younger than they thought they were through apps like that also when you said no he didnt hassle you about it or act like a dick clearly you both wanted different things out of the conversation he has no more reason to conform to your position than you have to his so it seems sensible to just end it there
creepyPMs,removed,because hes retarded
creepyPMs,removed,op is a sensitive snow flake
creepyPMs,removed,what an idiot i love that you followed through and sent the screen shots
creepyPMs,removed,youre living my dream of enacting justice upon creeps a also hello creep if you want to figure out what went wrong i suggest bringing in all these screenshots to a therapist and going from there have fun
creepyPMs,removed,well there are a lot worse words and swearings in romanian thats pretty light what app is that
creepyPMs,removed,harassing you where on the dating site that has a block feature or did they spend their time tracking you and your family down on facebook too
creepyPMs,removed,the malicious intent is there i wonder if dating sites have a block feature to block people you dont want to speak to no i think they have a lets post all their info button because im petty and simply cant block someone and walk away dont get me wrong im all for rcreepypms but this is childish on both parties
creepyPMs,removed,you both need help
creepyPMs,removed,supporting and promoting malicious behavior got it ill see myself out i see a user fully in control by the way not needing any support this sub used to be about support laughs and such but has now turned into dox them and expose them over words what difference does it make your not so subtle attempt at victim blaming is transparent go back to trp or kia im not victim blaming i am simply stating what i see as a blatant instigation and im aware the guy started it this isnt a support sub anymore lol what discussion your victim blaming mra trolling get fucked youre probably the douchebag that was stalking her using a different account grow up slugger or should i say heel the discussion around what is illegal you know the whole basis on this comment chain are you paying attention
creepyPMs,removed,imo you should have just sent it to all of them at the first this is slightly extortion i truly hope you dont get in any trouble
creepyPMs,removed,thats not any better are we supporting people here for experiencing creepy inappropriate bizarre awkward or offensive pms or supporting their maliciousness in an unjustified way you cant simply do that every time someone upsets you im not victim blaming here just not condoning poor behavior
creepyPMs,removed,correct i didnt say it was illegal just stating how its poor to condone
creepyPMs,removed,youre both pathetic and immature as hell
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt say you did lol dont let these things get to you
creepyPMs,removed,youre free to go somewhere else i am and i mentioned above got it ill see myself out its been fun i guess while it lasted i just find breaking their page rules is disrespectful i usually dont but this was the tipping scale so i rather go out with at least speaking my mind even if it does get deleted
creepyPMs,removed,he needs to die
creepyPMs,removed,one of your replies hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha you seem like an antagonizing cunt and he seems like a desperate insecure bitch again refer to my original comment
creepyPMs,removed,where did i say op was stalking im saying its morally wrong when youre in full control at that point to then go ahead and expose them op already had the upper hand but continued to toy with them purposefully and maliciously the guy blocked her when she could have easily done the same but i need them upvotes for being petty and confirmation from others that my interaction with a person on the internet deserves an overreaction of ruining their life
creepyPMs,removed,you do but it doesnt help your cause you replying how you did makes him think he still has a chance because your giving him attention its stupid but its how it works youre better off blockingreporting him on whatever u communicate to him with and if he continues harassing you threaten a restraining order
creepyPMs,removed,as he is perusing rshemales getting up the courage to admit he likes cock im sorry he was a cunt to you
creepyPMs,removed,youre acting like one what is sending screenshots going to do piss him off which in turn makes you happy makes you feel like you won again pathetic and immature and accomplishes nothing grow up
creepyPMs,removed,removed for abelism
creepyPMs,removed,i felt bad about bullying you except now that i know your gender im going to bully you even more because my sister hasnt been letting me fuck her enough and its peng up rage inside of me translated
creepyPMs,removed,why do you bait so many people
creepyPMs,removed,h damn id like to see that
creepyPMs,removed,thus should have ended up on rprorevenge
creepyPMs,removed,because latent homosexuality seriously people like that are secretly gay but because of their environment family religion culture etc theyre taught that being gay is the worst thing ever so when they start to have thoughts towards being attracted to their own gender they lash out with hate the harder they fight against gays the harder they are fighting the gay thoughts they have themselves im way oversimplifying it and using gay as a catchall before anyone starts whining
creepyPMs,removed,finds you attractive and then for no reason whatever other than his own smalldicked prejudice proceeds to display his asshole being then used a derogatory word for homosexuals toward you for no reason what a piece of shit
creepyPMs,removed,accidental revenge is the best revenge
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think anyone is irrationally afraid of trans people its just gross
creepyPMs,removed,you have a mental illness get help
creepyPMs,removed,i really fail to see how that was creepy he made a joke in bad taste like calm the fuck down there big girl
creepyPMs,removed,ew
creepyPMs,removed,new plan bite his dick off and run
creepyPMs,removed,id be outraged if this was real
creepyPMs,removed,missed opportunity imo should have lead him on a bit pretended to agree to a date or something then stood him up jk i guess you shouldnt have been an asshole
creepyPMs,removed,lmao
creepyPMs,removed,confirmation that it was a good change if homophobe here thought you were hot before scaring himself you know youre lookin goooooooood
creepyPMs,removed,that means you pass well enough to make homophobes uncomfortable this is a positive thing
creepyPMs,removed,i think you got a shot with him i daresay love is in the air
creepyPMs,removed,thats so disgusting trannys are disgusting faggot
creepyPMs,removed,i so want you to say you wanted to fuck me whose the f now bitch
creepyPMs,removed,jesus christ what a cunt sorry you had to deal with that
creepyPMs,removed,i would put that dude on blast soooooooo hard
creepyPMs,removed,i wouldve just gone with the flow and made him fuck me then tell him who i really was
creepyPMs,removed,sorry you had to deal with this ass op but this honestly made me laugh he clearly contacted you cause he thinks youre hot and tried to use the reformed bully line to win points with the sister of the person he tormented so he could bang her then realizes it is actually his victim and freaks out showing his bigotry lol what an idiot this is a great unintended revenge story
creepyPMs,removed,why didnt you block him by the way
creepyPMs,removed,who ever said it doesnt exist is an idiot but its way way over blown
creepyPMs,removed,it is clearly fake
creepyPMs,removed,new user one post over the top ridiculous conversation i smell a fake post
creepyPMs,removed,heard of occams razor if this was just someone bring insulted itd be believable but the whole sister thing is clearly bullshit thats not how people act which pushes the chance of this actually happening lower than the chance someone bothered to fake it
creepyPMs,removed,im not trying to be rude but is anyone else struggling with this title
creepyPMs,removed,hey he thought you were cute work it girl
creepyPMs,removed,i feel like theres plenty of ways you could have and should have fucked with him
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think he learned anything here either ruining someones life doesnt really humble them just makes them more bitter so this was done on principle not like an emotional reaction to abuse
creepyPMs,removed,my shits getting removed because this is a support sub this doesnt look like someone who needs support to me have fun being vindictive for fun i guess
creepyPMs,removed,my comment was consistently referring to sex not gender which is very relevant to the discussion i should have pointed that out and jesus christ im tired of people trying so hard to be offended i have no problem with calling a someone by their preferred gender but when referring to someones sex like in this case youll just have to deal with it plus how in the ever loving fuck can it be rude when im not referring to anyone
creepyPMs,removed,trans are disgusting just be a flamboyant fag
creepyPMs,removed,looks like an exchange between mac and the tranny on iasip lol
creepyPMs,removed,to quote one of the top posts on this sub too late youre gay now
creepyPMs,removed,just tell him he likes you and now he has the gays
creepyPMs,removed,im responding to your flair but theres also some frustrating sexism
creepyPMs,removed,jesus christ some people are seriously deranged i dont understand how anyone could think thats a nice thing to say to somebody not to mention saying it to a total stranger
creepyPMs,removed,i dunno he was a creep but feminists are also creepy torn on this one
creepyPMs,removed,heres a sneak peek of rokcupid using the httpsnpredditcomrokcupidtopsorttoptall of the year httpgfycatcomloneshoddydevilfish im a bot beep boop httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetosneakpeekbot httpsnpredditcomrsneakpeekbot
creepyPMs,removed,i mean at least he stole from a decent one i guess crazy stupid love for anyone wondering
creepyPMs,removed,its because this isnt ops picture
creepyPMs,removed,id say hes not wrong about the respect part for a man to marry a woman usually they take on the mans name to continue his families name and lineage so not taking that name it will hurt or cripple the chances of the children having the fathers last name especially if they get a divorce for where i live in a divorce of the time the woman gets the kids so this does things for a man secures his lineage feels more trust towards his wife or husband taking on a last name is a big deal but it can go both ways for woman may want to continue their family lineage too yet as its been for a long time usually the mans name is continued yet by doing so you can show more commitment to joining your partners family
creepyPMs,removed,block him op this guy probably thinks like if i kept texting her for the next years shell eventually fall for my charm
creepyPMs,removed,question for the op why did you go on two dates with him if you werent interested in dating anyone yes the guy acted psycho after you told him you werent interested anymore but why go on a date in the first place if you werent interested in dating anyone
creepyPMs,removed,gotcha just curious he seems like the type that you should have just been blunt with he cant take a hint haha
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think its fair to go labeling the guy a psychopathic murderer just because he blew up your phone i mean yeah hes kinda clingy and pathetic but theres no evidence hes dangerous
creepyPMs,removed,the sex must have been terrible
creepyPMs,removed,she said that most of them suck if i said most black people suck isnt that disparaging then
creepyPMs,removed,i meant blunt as in i dont think we clicked etc something that lets him know that he is the problem i would never do what that guy did and i think hes a bit crazy but it confuses the fuck out of guys if a girl goes on two dates then tells them they dont want to date anyone for all we know the two dates went awesome and this guy is incredibly confused even though his spamming her with messages is still messed up most of the posts on rcreepypms are weird messages from perverts who have never met the op but this is different as in they actually met had two dates etc so more context would be great especially if he is going to be publicly called a psychopath
creepyPMs,removed,it might have helped to repeat your statement a couple of times after the first one i might be wrong but thats what id do i tend to think that if you leave someone build up frustration eventually theyre going to come for you because while getting rejected hurts getting ignored hurts a lot more and i dont think this guy is a psychopath just really really sad
creepyPMs,removed,lots of guys think it is flattering to women that they will cum all over their pics that word tribute meaning he wants to worship honour her with his cumbecause to him it is so precious she should feel happy that he has cum for her by looking at her pics in his mind sadly he is not the only ma l e who does thisit is frighteningly common so any women here should start feeling charmed pleased turned on that a guy wants to cum on our pics and show uslike a dog dropping a dead bird at their masters feetgross
creepyPMs,removed,i assume it is common knowledge so i assume you did know but if youre gonna put it in the title even when you know thats not the case ill call you out on it guess
creepyPMs,removed,this guy is a smooth talker im using these lines
creepyPMs,removed,weight insults judgy comments on my relationship im halfway to winning reddit bingo
creepyPMs,removed,weight insults judgy comments on my relationship im halfway to winning reddit bingo
creepyPMs,removed,youre lucky he didnt keep his real age until his dick was in your mouth
creepyPMs,removed,ha i agree penis and vaginas are pretty gross looking to me i still lick it tho
creepyPMs,removed,i would but i dont speak idahoan
creepyPMs,removed,never trying black cock again it was a really bad experince additionally he keeps trying to get with me again but i keep saying fuck off stepdad im not even gay anymore but he doesnt stop
creepyPMs,removed,used to work for a bank just got released from jail for embezzling or something i call it making my own paycheck why does the world punish you for being an independent entrepenour
creepyPMs,removed,link for investigative purposes of course
creepyPMs,removed,curious what happened here
creepyPMs,removed,yeahthe pictures im talking about are sexual in nature lol there are super old creepy men having group sex angles on some really weird and disturbing positions some very open very exposed anuses and some have needles and cacti put places they shouldnt be stuff that disturbs the average individual lol
creepyPMs,removed,big deal the guy said youre nice to look at get over yourself how traumatic for you
creepyPMs,removed,he didnt say he wanted to bend her over the cook top for fucks sake if he text her something along the lines saying she was pretty her response would be the same
creepyPMs,removed,come on the school shooting pick up line is a classic
creepyPMs,removed,my ex is bi and she did say shit like that but shes a whore with a whores name
creepyPMs,removed,you win this subreddit congratulations
creepyPMs,removed,you seem to have jumped the gun on this one im not seeing anything that indicates he was trying to reel you in unless all it takes is a guy speaking to you to think hes creepy and hitting on you
creepyPMs,removed,really thats a shame i completely empathize with the purpose of this sub but a post like that which is obviously tongue in cheek should not be deleted
creepyPMs,removed,forward and unwarranted but i dont know if id go so far as to call it creepy its very clearly a tongue in cheek intentionally cheesy pick up line
creepyPMs,removed,thats actually a really popular common pickup line youre just a dumb bitch
creepyPMs,removed,ohhh congratulations you just won the good person of the year award for being a stuck up bitch its a joke laugh dont take everything so seriously
creepyPMs,removed,woooahhh soo creepy someone complimented your looks this is the dumbest fucking sub full of stuck up bitches ive ever seen
creepyPMs,removed,tbh i giggled theyre a terrible way to actually try to get a date but dumb pickup lines really amuse me
creepyPMs,removed,yet he didnt and he still gets called a creep there is no evidence that he was hitting on her but just go ahead and report him for harassment because you think he will
creepyPMs,removed,thats not even creepy
creepyPMs,removed,what victim are you serious op lied and and assumed he was going to be creepy before they even spoke with that mindset of course hes going to come across as a weirdo at least give him the chance to actually prove it you cant catfish someone and then act like the morally superior being
creepyPMs,removed,its not my responsibility to supply you with an imagination in fact antispeculation is my entire point you cant assume motive from two lines of text thats not evidence of sexual harassment thats ops assumption speculation is inadmissable because there are too many factors that cant be known measured and accounted for if this was a court case it would be dismissed because there is a clear lack of evidence my point is you shouldnt accuse someone of sexual harassment unless they actually sexually harass you
creepyPMs,removed,feelings arent evidence if op you and everyone else on this thread go around making assumptions like that it stands to reason that it doesnt take much for you to feel threatened this leads to a lot of issues like false accusations and a lax rape culture if you run around crying every time a man looks at you sideways its hard to take you seriously when something actually goes down there are a lot worse things than being chatted up on a game app block him and move on but dont pat yourself on the back for being such a brave little victim nothing even happened get over yourself
creepyPMs,removed,that actually made me laugh gonna try that line later with my fiancé
creepyPMs,removed,she quit aka not a coworker also it was one mild comment and not harassment
creepyPMs,removed,wow a cheesy pickup line on tinder very creepy
creepyPMs,removed,yeah this was less creepy more amusing
creepyPMs,removed,he must be hot
creepyPMs,removed,as crazy as it is hes ranting to a stranger theres a couple valid points in there
creepyPMs,removed,pretty sure its just light hearted banter and you and op are taking this a little personally for no reason
creepyPMs,removed,unless comments have been deleted no one has said anything about it not being sleazy or being okay because of the app
creepyPMs,removed,men do typically get fucked over in divorce and women have a much easier time on eating by sites meeting people even the generally unattractive ones didnt say everything he said was brilliant
creepyPMs,removed,how do you not realize thats a lil kidi know im gunna get hate for that but its true
creepyPMs,removed,i think ill just unsubscribe i dont respect the culture the mods are enforcing
creepyPMs,removed,nah not really its just shitty pickup lines through an app basically dedicated to that sort of thing never say it to a random person in the street but in that medium its expected tldr stop being such a fucking pussy
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt really count that many chances
creepyPMs,removed,i dont like how she took out part of their text convo at first glance it looks like she just took out his picture but she obviously gave him some kind of compliment because he saysthank you some smiley face so do you have a bf i mean this dude is definitely a loner and he doesnt have any social skills but i think its telling that the pms were edited
creepyPMs,removed,its obvious he didnt say anything about a haircut before and she coulda shut him down a lot more clearly imo just tell the guy straight up im not interested in you that way at all
creepyPMs,removed,jesus dude just cut him off youre torturing the poor bastard hes a weirdo but thats doesnt give you the right to do this to the guy seriously you reply and then abandon the convo over and over again
creepyPMs,removed,are we just posting consensual sex rp stuff here now
creepyPMs,removed,really makes me uncomfortable when people try to include beings that cant consent to this kind of activity into sexually charged conversation wut
creepyPMs,removed,a fantasy dog isnt a being
creepyPMs,removed,why do people even bother replying and entertaining people like this
creepyPMs,removed,needs shot
creepyPMs,removed,should of pretended to be here and set up a meeting then took care of this fucker when he shows up
creepyPMs,removed,i think its more likely you are fucked up about kids and dont like the idea of being mobbed mob rule shouldnt win but perverts like you are disgusting
creepyPMs,removed,starving pigs dont like lye douse him in honey and sweet spices
creepyPMs,removed,holy shit👌👌 dude ✌🙏🙏😢calm tell us something more😱 obvious dayumn thats so u dont say 💯💯man lit🔥🔥
creepyPMs,removed,ill keep a lookout
creepyPMs,removed,please understand that i am not defending or condoning pedophiles who act out their fantasies in any capacity it is important to note that the great majority of pedophiles understand that their fantasies are horrible and wrong and do not act on them from everything that i understand pedophilia is effectively a sexual orientation be it from some sort of chemical imbalance there have been plenty of people who have done amas on reddit its pretty clear that nobody but the most depraved would actually chose to be a pedophile however its also one of the most stigmatized problems in our society and rightfully so far beyond that of other mental health problems its because of that stigmatization many feel like they cannot go to a therapist or seek support from anyone that it becomes a deeply compartmentalized piece of who they are sorry to write you an essay but its something that really does make me sad on any side of the issue it is tragic and speaks to the need for genuine mental health services
creepyPMs,removed,i cant even believe this is real what kind of pedophile would say this over text lmao
creepyPMs,removed,ok so i really dont want to agree with you because your grammar is painful to read however after reporting a pedophile to the authorities and having them manage to let the man know i was the one who said something i mean they even refused to provide any sort of protection after i reported that he was harrassing me multiple times a day with meticulously thought out death threats all because they royally fucked up their job in hindsight instead of doing the right thing and reporting him id much rather have set up some horrible vigilante justice type of shit this man is still on the streets even though i provided them with incredibly specific evidence so yes if you just tell me which alley well be meeting in ill sure as shit be there
creepyPMs,removed,whydont you have to bring politics to rcreepypms
creepyPMs,removed,a bit much
creepyPMs,removed,it already ended when nobody could explain their moronic accusations against me i suppose i shouldve advocated murder instead of being rational as long as im in this sub
creepyPMs,removed,that person needs to have his nuts cut off and thrown in prison for a long time
creepyPMs,removed,sigh i volunteer as tribute
creepyPMs,removed,if a guy has to tell you how big his worm is its basically the equivalent to fishing bait
creepyPMs,removed,id say you sound like a miserable bitch lighten up
creepyPMs,removed,super creep update
creepyPMs,removed,that might be legitimately the case you knew the person i dont and im not aware of all the details but otoh the registry is often weaponized against queer young adults especially if theyre nonwhite i have read some really fucked up stories things like a and lesbian consensually sexting turned in by parents sending the to jail and ruining her life sexual predators are a real problem but law enforcement biases are a mess
creepyPMs,removed,this is the kind of racism so obsessive it looks like they are just unable to admit they have an interracial cuckolding fetish
creepyPMs,removed,this is the kind of racism so obsessive it looks like they are just unable to admit they have an interracial cuckolding fetish
creepyPMs,removed,the piece of shit says he wants to rape a helpless teenager he is the bad guy not me i just want him to suffer a lot
creepyPMs,removed,he would pay a prostetitue to peg him
creepyPMs,removed,hi sexy little slut
creepyPMs,removed,sounds like a good offer to me
creepyPMs,removed,i wont to fuckim stick you does anyone else get an old era politically incorrect native american stereotypical speech feeling from that statement
creepyPMs,removed,what was the username please
creepyPMs,removed,block that dick
creepyPMs,removed,smack the cunt violence isnt usually the answer but sometimes a real good smack in the mouth from a good friend is enough to make people pull their head in
creepyPMs,removed,youre both either horrible at texting or just unknowingly butchering the english language this reads like a dr seuss book translated to french then translated back to english again
creepyPMs,removed,is he by any chance british and youre black sorry no offense it just seemed so clichetype of writing
creepyPMs,removed,who said anything about being offended i said its hard to read or even comprehend what you two are saying not that it hurts to read or disrespects me lol
creepyPMs,removed,round of ad hom not surprising
creepyPMs,removed,thats not a personal message sad and pathetic yes but creepy pm no
creepyPMs,removed,former imgur user here can confirm their toxicity theyre literally turning into
creepyPMs,removed,this is the creepy pm where i agree with both sides of the convo
creepyPMs,removed,this is the creepy pm where i agree with both sides of the convo
creepyPMs,removed,i think this belongs in cringepics purple was pretty bad in this lol
creepyPMs,removed,wont make any excuses for the creep at all the person with the name blocked by green was definitely a creep and i feel terrible for the poor sole that messaged it hoping to have a friendly conversation
creepyPMs,removed,not that creepy yet
creepyPMs,removed,fool everyone one knows to ask for anal on ones birthday
creepyPMs,removed,at this point you might as well just suck the dick for some peace and quiet
creepyPMs,removed,not a big fan of steak well there are other meat options to fill your craving
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,oh could i get banned too id rather not be on a subreddit that discriminates based on other subreddits
creepyPMs,removed,sorta makes the pretty and shallow part seem to fit though for op
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know the rules to this sub very well but why didnt you just block him on the msg seems like the rational thing to do the whole time i was reading this not only was he making me uncomfortable and cringe but i was also wondering what was wrong with op just block the creepo before he goes full time stalker on you
creepyPMs,removed,lol is this a joke me thinks he is trolling no way he isnt doing it to get on your nerves maybe because you told him to back off this is his passive aggressive way of getting back at you
creepyPMs,removed,seems dangerous that your encouraging interaction with this creeps some of them might even be mentally unstable
creepyPMs,removed,please do the needful and check the handwritings
creepyPMs,removed,i dont agree with the attitude of entitlement he has but you cant really speak for all of women like that there are plenty of people of any gender who enjoy pleasuring others without anything in return its probably nearly an even split
creepyPMs,removed,sodo you have skype
creepyPMs,removed,he started off kind of cute and at least realized when he fucked up i rate him as a creep still a salvageable person
creepyPMs,removed,i dunno it kind of reads like a naive akward kid who took dating advice from his douchebag brother most creeps i see commit to that act he almost immediately apologized when he realized what he was doing
creepyPMs,removed,this has got to be fake no ones using allo
creepyPMs,removed,now forgive me if im wrong im a bit new to this meme but i believe the origin was tumblr as theres a trigger or content warning for anything from eyes to cats to raw meat to gore people started picking on people who claimed they were triggered by these things and hence we now have the triggered meme source fine meme connoisseur
creepyPMs,removed,live action bdsm porn often portrays way less consent and way more violence than shades and men are far more likely to be interested in live action porn than to read shades so if he got his ideas from porn id imagine it was from live action stuff but its only cool to make fun of the type of porn women like
creepyPMs,removed,as a member of the bdsm community this guy deserves to be murdered
creepyPMs,removed,wow why am i subscribed to this fucking circlejerk
creepyPMs,removed,trigger warning reminds me of my ex when he wanted to sleep with other people so we broke up and i slept with other people
creepyPMs,removed,good news is that he wants you to cum too wow just wow
creepyPMs,removed,mind your dam business oooh actually your the big mouth who keeps having his comments removed dont ever reply to me ok
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,idk studies have shown that rape has nearly efficacy in getting in peoples pants
creepyPMs,removed,you really need to report this person to the police he might not rape you but he will rape someone
creepyPMs,removed,war is pretty fucking traumatizing people didnt know about ptsd back then they just repressed i dont think its funny to make fun of a traumatized veteran losing his shit the fact that he went to talking about seeing shit in nam and just kill me now instead of the usual u fkn whore pay attention to me im a nice guy suggests maybe something triggered him just saying
creepyPMs,removed,why do you bother with responding just dont
creepyPMs,removed,i just want your opinion on this do you think its wise to respond to texts like that
creepyPMs,removed,when it comes to facebook always name and shame
creepyPMs,removed,i read it i wasnt defending my first post in violation of the rule i asked you for your opinion i didnt see anything mentioned about not asking mods about their personal opinions i think that giving advice of not responding to messages like that is the essence of being supportive
creepyPMs,removed,i imagined my boyfriend saying this and got all hot
creepyPMs,removed,the dude just wanted to talk about his dick he probably feels like a real stud now
creepyPMs,removed,i just cant fathom why the person would keep responding after that
creepyPMs,removed,not to be that guy but technically its not inches
creepyPMs,removed,too true it is really best to demonstrate to them firsthand
creepyPMs,removed,downvote cause astrology
creepyPMs,removed,am i the only one who would rather read the creepypms where they dont know they will get posted online lol
creepyPMs,removed,shes not much of a friend imo if she posted this online before talking to her friend let the downvotes rain
creepyPMs,removed,because rather than getting it off her chest to her friend she did it here instead notice how he started with i passed the fuck out she probably text him before he even woke up
creepyPMs,removed,harhar were all so proud of you for kissing your dare officers weiner
creepyPMs,removed,say what you will but this would have been an interesting unsolicited dick pic the age is creepy but atleast he wasnt messaging creepylike like most of the message on this sub from a year old that would have been much more troubling i would have lost a little faith in humanity
creepyPMs,removed,being explains your anger towards the world
creepyPMs,removed,this is a disguised ad for att fiber isnt it
creepyPMs,removed,nothing ventured nothing gained
creepyPMs,removed,well they were very polite about it lol
creepyPMs,removed,never understood people who were into the breeding porn and stuff like its one thing for a person to be like i want kids someday but making that your fetish then forcing it on someone else extra creepy
creepyPMs,removed,it actually works a fair bit indian women are extraordinarly repressed and socially incompetent
creepyPMs,removed,who is they i dont am i an outlier in your vapid generalization
creepyPMs,removed,you cant win if you dont try
creepyPMs,removed,confirm what guys usually white knight girls on runescape they dont type that shit only retarded horny olds do
creepyPMs,removed,you said youre a girl on runescape right ok let me put it in simpler terms so that you can understand people on video games tend to be overly chivalrous toward female gamers
creepyPMs,removed,go suck your mum
creepyPMs,removed,even my friends didnt believe i was actually a nasty fat man pretending to be a prude
creepyPMs,removed,listen right when someone comes along and tries to insinuate that the majority of males that play runescape chat like that it takes the piss so im going to talk condescendingly when giving an explanation to that person but tbh its just reddit so who cares right
creepyPMs,removed,oh come on thats got to be a year old girl
creepyPMs,removed,idk why you think youre on some level above me talking down on me like some cunt bag im talking how i want to talk if i come off as sexist so be it im not just going to change the way i speak because someone is a girl but if youre too dimwitted to understand that youll understand it sooner than later
creepyPMs,removed,i have something that is very rare in the land you spawn from its called common sense do you ever get sick of getting cunt punted by internet strangers
creepyPMs,removed,its amazing to me how scared so many guys are of this i never understood why for most guys its like threesome with two girls im there threesome with another guy and a girl no chance
creepyPMs,removed,gladly i think i developed down syndrome just by reading the replies
creepyPMs,removed,op is a liar girls dont play runescape
creepyPMs,removed,dont ejaculated with that not all men am i doing this right
creepyPMs,removed,people are so sensitive just block him if hes bothering you shits none of your business otherwise oh but wouldnt you want to know id figure it out without someone on the internet tattling that my fiancee is shitty
creepyPMs,removed,confirm in what way you can check my post history if youre looking for the post that led us here
creepyPMs,removed,you actually showed the other person the texts sorry but thank god finally someone on this sub went through with it and did it so many people on here should do this yet they always make up excuses not to thank you op seriously you delivered
creepyPMs,removed,this may be an unpopular opinion but i dont think you should have sent the fiance the screenshots
creepyPMs,removed,oh man herpes guy he sent a bunch of pms to my main account after that rbadwomensanatomy thread arguing that his obsession with herpes is healthy and that hes just trying to educate people women and have casual conversations about sexual health which is all fine and dandy when that isnt the only thing you ever talk about context be damned
creepyPMs,removed,my ex and i dated for years one day he left me out of the blue and had a new girlfriend a week later a month later shes pregnant they broke up a few months later and she messaged me on facebook about how she fucked him on my couch and conceived their child in my house and would be fucking when id call on my dinner break i work nights i was blown away she seemed proud of herself like she had somehow still won against me even though they were no longer together fuck people who choose to become the other women your all a bunch of fucking assholes and karmas gonna get you have fun raising that baby on hour own slut
creepyPMs,removed,inch ftfy
creepyPMs,removed,can you pm me a link
creepyPMs,removed,sorry im kinda stoned my bad
creepyPMs,removed,ofcourse he needs to be a white male powerlifter with multiple stem degrees to be even worth amirite
creepyPMs,removed,decaf is not my style im not victim shaming here but why does the dude has to have redeeming qualities and not the person here
creepyPMs,removed,that guy must be borderline retarded
creepyPMs,removed,with the reply sorry youre outside of my age limit i didnt know friendships had age limits
creepyPMs,removed,im not saying about the reasons op has but more the like the white knight a few comments above saying that the self importance of a male is based around looks and what not oh yea i shouldve just typed out the same comment calling the guy creepy and what not do you also start shouting and plug your ears when someone criticizes you grow up
creepyPMs,removed,why are you wasting your time responding to the guy in the first place once a guy violates your rule you know hes not someone you want to get to know anyway
creepyPMs,removed,whats wrong with a compliment tho smh
creepyPMs,removed,i disagree im not saying she should be friends with this particular guy but to say you dont have things in common with those outside your age range is just not true
creepyPMs,removed,paging unosefetish
creepyPMs,removed,oh ok makes sense u would be upset tho still compliments dont really need consent its a nice thing
creepyPMs,removed,power tripping mods at its finest
creepyPMs,removed,its not pedophilia to like a it is fucking creepy to act on it though
creepyPMs,removed,i want weekly you should have heard him out
creepyPMs,removed,triggered s
creepyPMs,removed,are you guys seriously picking apart the scientific accuracy of this childish insult hes not literally saying he left semen or children in a woman and they should still be there hes just making a dumb joke
creepyPMs,removed,suck a fat black dick cunt
creepyPMs,removed,those messages are practically identical to the ones i get sent everyday on fetlife now im not saying kill all men just that one day they will all die
creepyPMs,removed,you should watch that vulgar language
creepyPMs,removed,fuck you nigga i dont want no ravioli
creepyPMs,removed,this has to be the most stereotypical black creep pickup line ever he mentions a list of sweet desert foods and mentions fried chicken
creepyPMs,removed,when you get triggered by copypasta top kek
creepyPMs,removed,its some dork from the internet ignore it
creepyPMs,removed,since when are stepdaughters illegal i seriously dont think that should be illegal i mean theyre not bloodrelated at all
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,she has definitely moved on op you need to move on as well this isnt healthy
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,as someone who talks like this normally and know people that do hes probably religious whats creepy about this
creepyPMs,removed,well i mean the stepdaughter could be of age so
creepyPMs,removed,gross year old with no concept of respect and decency got rid of the redundant parts
creepyPMs,removed,god he was an asshole but then he is fifteen you handled that well op hopefully in a few years hell post this on rcringepics and talk about what a prick he was to a hot neighbour
creepyPMs,removed,did you just assume their gender
creepyPMs,removed,well he seemed to think u were but then he is fifteen 😀
creepyPMs,removed,triggered
creepyPMs,removed,so i was wondering
creepyPMs,removed,should of fucked her honestly crazy bitches fuck like well crazy then send her a message say it wont work out win win
creepyPMs,removed,things like this make me rethink my opinion on arresting those hot female schoolteachers who bang their students
creepyPMs,removed,you didnt block him because you wanted attention on reddit
creepyPMs,removed,it wouldnt have hurt to explain to him why you dont want to date any longer hes right when he says it is weird to date him and the claim youre not ready for dating and then being active on okcupid
creepyPMs,removed,im male and ive done this as well when heartbroken or scared to lose someone maybe after only two dates the reaction is a little over the top but not abnormal he didnt demean you
creepyPMs,removed,i personally think he is owed more of an explanation than this its like the girl is trying to make him act like this by not resolving the issue
creepyPMs,removed,i understand that he should take the hint he should but why isnt he owed an explanation if i were to do this id feel bad and feel like i owe a bit more of an explanation
creepyPMs,removed,its obvious by the messages that they had sex though he knows theres a vagina there
creepyPMs,removed,the question in his mind is why or where does this turnaround come from this is a legitimate question imo
creepyPMs,removed,he doesnt meet the criteria for psychopathy but he does seem deluded and a bad use of your time
creepyPMs,removed,lol yes i did i realize my folly now
creepyPMs,removed,op youre a useless cunt probably fat too
creepyPMs,removed,you clearly have daddy issues let him be daddy now
creepyPMs,removed,using that same logic theres no reason he should stop texting her
creepyPMs,removed,if you thought he was a psychopath why didnt you block him on text andor facebook
creepyPMs,removed,but feet
creepyPMs,removed,you should feel bad for him i think i mean she slept with the guy then dumped him thats okay no more explanation needed but he never got mad or mean or hateful he was never asked or told to stop hes pretty insecure lonely but i think calling this creepy is a stretch
creepyPMs,removed,it seemed like he was answering questions or statements that werent even there because its pretty clear that she deleted a bunch of her replies before screenshotting pretty standard in this subreddit
creepyPMs,removed,is it seriously not obvious that she deleted a bunch of her replies before posting
creepyPMs,removed,yeah he seems mentally ill
creepyPMs,removed,the dude has in his account and in credit card bills maybe e literally has no money
creepyPMs,removed,jeez just tell him you dont want him to message you anymore or block him
creepyPMs,removed,thats very dismissive and inconsiderate imo
creepyPMs,removed,maybe we should learn something different is this yet another reddit who has fallen to the extreme leftist safe space opinion that stifles free speech if i engage in a relationship with someone however insignificant and young it may be i owe at least a small amount of time to that person proportional to how significant that relation is this is what i was taught by my mother im sure that most women do not like never hearing from a person they had sex with and felt that that created a bond i condemn such behaviour from all sides this explanation is not proportional with two dates imo it is clear that the man already had a significant emotional investment
creepyPMs,removed,reading this makes me angry somehow i hate these shit tests pity fest negging and backpedalling crap and of courseblaming feeeeeeemmmaaallleeesss for being a colossal retard himself
creepyPMs,removed,while the guys obviously a piece of shit anyway look at the date of the first message
creepyPMs,removed,she never once asked him to stop or said she didnt want to communicate further he was super desperate persistent toward a lost cause but imo this is far from creepy
creepyPMs,removed,why dont you block him on facebook along with any other social media looks like hes the type of guy to show up in the middle of the night at your house just to make sure that chad didnt bother you at that date
creepyPMs,removed,urgh grow some fucking balls that dudes self esteem is pathetically low
creepyPMs,removed,from his message of thinking you met a guy that is rougher in bed i take it you slept with him within those two dates the guy is clearly crazy i honestly cant wrap my head around someone being this cringy but it definitely doesnt help that he has the impression that his persistence might get him laid since you are somewhat easy not saying you dont have the right to do or not do whatever you want whenever you want just saying it didnt help the situation of him being batshit crazy
creepyPMs,removed,i think youre the asshole for not giving him a reply m
creepyPMs,removed,this is more sad than anything i skimmed quite a bit because there was so much but it seemed way sadder than creepy
creepyPMs,removed,insisting yeah creepy nah
creepyPMs,removed,i dont get it creepy because hes old its not like you arent an adult anyway
creepyPMs,removed,and he also wasnt rough enough it seems
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair you are kinda lame if all that info is true nothing wrong with it but dont engage him anymore i guess
creepyPMs,removed,why even engage someone this long youre just feeding the insanity
creepyPMs,removed,ill give you my honest thought process and philosophy im all for people bettering themselves and sometimes people need a little motivation maybe on the harsh side for him specifically being an author is a fine line of work but at his age without a high school degree or literary agent it isnt conducive to a successful lifecareer i wasnt harsh but some truth can push people into reevaluating their situation striving for bigger and better things my dad has said much worse to me out of love that has only toughened me up and helped me set high goals i get some people arent in favor of that type of motivation so i do understand
creepyPMs,removed,i know right he knows he was at fault nothing to fire him over or anything just a lame pick up try
creepyPMs,removed,lol
creepyPMs,removed,inappropriate yes creepy not really a guy finds your number texts you anonymously that he thinks youre sexy and wants to hang out you tell him hes being inappropriate and he tells you hes sorry and stops not that creepy compared to what i usually see in this sub
creepyPMs,removed,damn people are hard on other people online granted he might be a creep but he also may just be a little socially awkward seeing as some technical issues might make op seem to be online even if she wasnt id assume that he felt rejected when he sees online but no answer not taking any sides or trying to offend you but this might just be someone who is just not very experienced and maybe has a damaged selfesteem adding to that he didnt insult or make any creepy statements from my point of view he just jumped to conclusions please try to see cases like this one from the other persons point of view as well
creepyPMs,removed,just to play devils advocate here he listened to you and stoppedapologized immediately not saying its okay in this case especially but he wasnt really a douche about it
creepyPMs,removed,that shit makes my skin crawl but to be fair it doesnt look like youre exactly discouraging him
creepyPMs,removed,it couldve been a wrong number
creepyPMs,removed,i dont get the issue with age gap of the older man and younger gal relationship automatically thinking sugar babygold digger considering the average couple is the dude years older than her older dudes and younger gals seem to be the norm and way more common than the inverse older gals and younger dudes doomed failure in my opinion and that is way more suited to be a sugar baby to me
creepyPMs,removed,why do people reply to these messages
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know how you could have gone on without posting thismost abhorrent behavior i have ever seen
creepyPMs,removed,damn thats almost as sad as making gw posts
creepyPMs,removed,ill admit it turned me on
creepyPMs,removed,thats a really weird subreddit i am still unclear how it isnt basically a mental disorder despite what the faq says or people just messing around but they seem pretty serious
creepyPMs,removed,i dont agree i would much rather people knew i tried something like a total creep like he did then have them send naked pictures of me to my family that is just me though
creepyPMs,removed,i wasnt going to go there but what he is doing technically isnt blackmail he is just misinterpreting her posting naked pics online and thought that meant she was some kind of sexual deviant who would respond to his crazy message there isnt any intent to blackmail her in that message but if she sends it to his familywell that is what will make him possibly send her photos around one thing though if he was stupid enough to think she would want to hook up with him after that terrible message he might not even be smart enough to think of sending the photos around as revenge if she outs him
creepyPMs,removed,that sucks nothing worse than someone shitting all over you on the internet for no reason the character attacks are the worst though my heart goes out to everyone here
creepyPMs,removed,i absolutely agree there is a little more to see a few posts down though
creepyPMs,removed,let your friend handle it bonus points for fucking the friend
creepyPMs,removed,what what the actual fuck i like to consider myself an open and accepting person but what tf did i just read
creepyPMs,removed,i honestly dont care either way
creepyPMs,removed,its not very interesting to explain so rocket league is a game where you play soccerfootball with flying cars the community is pretty decent as far as gaming communities go but still its a gaming community predominantly male predominantly geeky shed posted only really gw photos shout to a sub designed to bring players of similar erm not sure if you play games you have a hidden number attached to you which roughly is your skill level and a rank that symbolises this number this is a team game so its good to have people i was just imagining quite geeky guys seeing she was a hot female then i made a joke bb the short for baby gc my rank eu is my region so we couldnt actually play together because the ping would be too high then i semi joked i was actually ranked sc semi joked as i really did just drop in rank either way i obviously made a poor job of the joke or its just inappropriate to post that joke so if i offended i apologise
creepyPMs,removed,i know theres some site that you can use to look at older posts on reddit that got deleted so you can see what they wrote if they were old enough or just freshly deleted but i dont recommend it more than a few times ive read some of these posts and felt that little part of me that still believes not everything is terrible die a bit more
creepyPMs,removed,plz take this down im not a creeper and my message dont belong here for people to see
creepyPMs,removed,im not going to beg for u but plz take this down i dont want other ppl seeing it
creepyPMs,removed,lmfao hit a nerve
creepyPMs,removed,this is just unfair i see a lot of white people who try very hard to be sensitive to others to be clear not all on the other hand a few of the the most offensive racist things ive heard in my life were said by nonwhites about other races it seems like sometimes not always or even often people think that if theyre not white so not in the oppressor class so they get a free pass to be unpleasant to others
creepyPMs,removed,ooooh big man on campus you sure showed me
creepyPMs,removed,the only cringe is you acting like creepypms is your private army
creepyPMs,removed,here ya go mods i took out the name dont worry
creepyPMs,removed,indian
creepyPMs,removed,op im really sorry but im going to need you to remove the link youve provided in your post while creepypms is a lovely place filled with lovely people there are also trolls and people who want to hurt others i worry that they could try to hurt you thank you for trying to provide context but we dont believe that it is necessary
creepyPMs,removed,you like drama
creepyPMs,removed,you do sound preety racist
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair looking at your post history you seem to ask for it
creepyPMs,removed,just a tip to avoid creeps
creepyPMs,removed,i just delete them why bother
creepyPMs,removed,probably because thats what works in india andor they have no clue how to interact with western women because of their little interaction with them
creepyPMs,removed,um why the fuck is katie trying to spend time with this douchbag
creepyPMs,removed,i dont see the creepy i just see someone who was respectful heshe has a weird fetish sure
creepyPMs,removed,yeah if you have to ask creepy questions and if this person has a fetish and not just a kink meaning he needs that to get off and doesnt just enjoy it then they do have ask this is probably the best way to go about it i honestly think this dog should create some psas for guys covering basic etiquette on sending messages and what is and isnt acceptable
creepyPMs,removed,seems like you guys have a pretty healthy and friendly relationship going on there
creepyPMs,removed,sometimes i wish we didnt have to cover up the user names these assholes should be outed
creepyPMs,removed,are you moving because of him fuck him learn self defense and destroy him save his future victims
creepyPMs,removed,negging goes both ways he has a tiny penis but still has time to write
creepyPMs,removed,i mean to be fair youre not making this easy hes asking you for sexual favors and yet you still bring up wanting to hang youre giving him false hope by still asking to hang out he clearly isnt trying to just be friends smarten up
creepyPMs,removed,uhh why would you still wanna hang with him im confused
creepyPMs,removed,kind of clever actually hahaha but im a prince fan so that wouldve won brownie points with me
creepyPMs,removed,maybe shes the creep and this is his way of getting her to leave him alone
creepyPMs,removed,wow im sorry you had to endure a conversation like that he was extremely rude sometimes people never cease to amaze me as a male sometimes i am embarrassed by the things other low life neanderthals do to disrespect women sounds like he needed a better male role model when he was growing up on a personal note i dont think you have posted anything here to warrant such remarks i think youre pretty awesome myself
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,not to defend him just pointing out that age of consent varies between countries and in some places it is indeed as low as though in finland it is so but yeah this guy is an embarrassment to all finns viking manga sex doll
creepyPMs,removed,wow what a cunt lol i read these sometimes and there are quite a few posts on here that are pretty stupid but this one so far has me laugh the hardest
creepyPMs,removed,ugh so shady
creepyPMs,removed,this whole conversation is cringey
creepyPMs,removed,i have a inch koch is really difficult to have the right aspect ratio of picture to have atheistically pleasing conk pic but my feet not imchie so its easier so i can send a pic
creepyPMs,removed,gaia doesnt allow users under the age of and this is one of the reasons why the guy was definitely wrong to send the pic obviously but you also need to abide by website rules when you sign up for them theyre in place to help protect people like your year old daughter
creepyPMs,removed,everything youve said sounds like a terrible idea
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think it applies here since op mentioned she used her own birthday rather then the year olds birthday
creepyPMs,removed,youre an imbecile
creepyPMs,removed,i feel like im taking crazy pills right now the female was the biggest douche i have ever encountered okay he cant make up his mind and probably wants to hook up with her but hose are just assumptions because he never even said anything like that he was never even close to being as rude or abusive as she was
creepyPMs,removed,its always guys speaking broken english
creepyPMs,removed,i suck because i prefer long hair on women
creepyPMs,removed,what im a moron now maybe he didnt know what she looked like before they metblind date or women get haircuts between their profile pics and meetingmissed a dose of your meds again and just out or curiosity would you date a man much shorter than you
creepyPMs,removed,yeah sure agreed there just not sure why he sucked for not liking short hair on a woman guess its the good ol reddit hive mind at work
creepyPMs,removed,better question why dont you just unmatch this person instead you have fun playing with people like this
creepyPMs,removed,not totally relevant but i know a girl who dumped a guy because the dude has a a big cock and this dude is totally not me wink wink
creepyPMs,removed,earlier he is a mate of mine so i take it personally later i do not give a shit about him earlier he is the one reporting op later asks what are you going to report me for earlier im going to smash your head at some point i hate scrum i will get you later im not gunna do shit says he isnt stupid calls op a moron breaks sim card thinking that is equal to being untraceable stupid ignorant obnoxious and bipolar at its best
creepyPMs,removed,i laughed
creepyPMs,removed,stop being a wanker about fake internet points and educate yourself most of abusers are cold and calculating about it and this might have well been a preemptive measure to discredit op which seeing the judges reaction at ro sentencing worked
creepyPMs,removed,riceists
creepyPMs,removed,over the rine
creepyPMs,removed,you realize in your effort to fight racism your saying something racist god your dumb
creepyPMs,removed,im retardedthat never even crossed my mind
creepyPMs,removed,im currently in the middle of a giant roast on yikyak people just cant handle it when yah bang girls
creepyPMs,removed,this is definitely racist but i have this feeling the guy is so out of touch that he actually did think this would be something you would find funny i think he was looking for an ice breaker and went with oh she is asian ill say something in an asian accent and she will laugh at me
creepyPMs,removed,i know there must be women out there that fly by the seat of their pants risking everything to accept random sex requests from strangers i know that they happily go to a strange mans house with little thought for possible consequences or fear i know that they invite strangers to their home and do not worry that their lives are in danger i know that these women both write casual hook up ads and answer them but honestly i will never understand the mindset of either the man or woman who engages in random sex with complete strangers i find it completely confusing as to why someone would risk everything but then they are answering their primal instincts and urges
creepyPMs,removed,you miss of the shots you dont take
creepyPMs,removed,darrel banged her
creepyPMs,removed,ya thats real racist thats worse than dogs being used on children during a peaceful rally for goodness sake
creepyPMs,removed,not defending creep but whats you evidence that hes white and isnt bringing up his race also racism
creepyPMs,removed,racism is hating another race right so you really think he hates koreans its like if someone did a pompous british accent ohh hellooooo i ggord save the queen yes id think they were silly but i wouldnt think that they hate the british an idiot sure but racist maybe i dont understand racism
creepyPMs,removed,lol fuck you cunt
creepyPMs,removed,how many times is this gonna get posted here
creepyPMs,removed,well if a black person beat up someone in a ghetto and i said why am i not surprised its a black man im pretty sure i would get called all kinds of racist or if an asian man won a math award and i said why am i not surprised its an asian man etc
creepyPMs,removed,i dont find him creepy in particular just incredibly stupid
creepyPMs,removed,over the rine you mean
creepyPMs,removed,but i find that funny id think she had a sense of humour i guess its about intentions if they want to offend then yes its harsh but if its being silly then its different i guess she was abit over the top in the video but i guess thats what the guy did in this comment its meant to simulate a response like pulling a girls hair on the play ground but i guess thats assault these days maybe it is neanderthal way of thinking acting
creepyPMs,removed,i read that as somewhere different a little macabre for my tastes though a rather effective end his advances
creepyPMs,removed,its true 😅
creepyPMs,removed,thats what you get for being a whore
creepyPMs,removed,just hint at him you are going to do that we man need time to learn and this poor basterd im giving him the benefit of the doubt how old is he no need to use the nuclear option right away
creepyPMs,removed,if theyre doing shit like this then odds are his parents arent the greatest and will probably get mad at you similar to how a girlfriend would get mad at the girl her boyfriend cheated on her with thats her little angel
creepyPMs,removed,holy shit checking your post history hot photos and a shout out to some rocket league players to play with i doubt any of them checked your post history but im just imagining their little brains exploding hahaha
creepyPMs,removed,i was only kidding about the hit on we dont play the same region i stand by the rocket league friends some really would go mental im not saying its right
creepyPMs,removed,come on let him cum down your throat
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,arrogant much
creepyPMs,removed,why dont you read them to me you retarded cunt
creepyPMs,removed,freddie got fingered
creepyPMs,removed,on the one hand i know suicide is horrible and sad on the other hand the world is better off without guys like this in it
creepyPMs,removed,his message was creepy not sure recognizing her by the dress is creepy let alone next level
creepyPMs,removed,rtulpas is a thing
creepyPMs,removed,you want creepy pms posting on gonewild thats how you get creepy pms
creepyPMs,removed,honestly its so good that would actually make me feel sorry for him
creepyPMs,removed,ugh what a cunt worst thing is hes gonna get worse as he gets older😒
creepyPMs,removed,as someone who lived on their own since years old such an age break is horrific if they live with their mother no matter the age outting him can ensure this behavior stops and he doesnt contact you again but if he does not live with her all you are doing is acting petty and vindictive you are essentially hurting an innocent person his mom simply to make the dude feel embarrassed it will not change his behavior or stop him from contacting you it will just temporarily make him feel awkward while forever changing the impression of a mother about her child seriously not cool
creepyPMs,removed,deleted comment is something along the lines of give him time to learn dont drop the nuke right away and everyone was like lolwtf dude
creepyPMs,removed,i mean google searching your username reveals both your given and surname on the first page
creepyPMs,removed,whoops forgot what sub i was in sorry for using logic my b
creepyPMs,removed,this is hilarious you should tell his family thats creepy af thou youre completely covered in most of your pics howd he know it was you from anyone else
creepyPMs,removed,as if shes gonna tell ppl she posts her vag online for everyone to see
creepyPMs,removed,really how does that end in any other way the guy taking the pictures she posted and send them to her mother or fb friends i mean its a great idea for revenge but he seems like the type that would retaliate
creepyPMs,removed,tbhthis kinda points to you being an attention whore i mean youve already done the gw posts and now this to get people to go look at your history to find those gw posts just sayin
creepyPMs,removed,something sluts do for validation
creepyPMs,removed,fuck you nigger hows that
creepyPMs,removed,i think it was supposed to be a joke
creepyPMs,removed,why the ban
creepyPMs,removed,can yall just save me the trouble and ban me right now
creepyPMs,removed,op why didnt you call him out on the his cringey narration how do you just let that go text after text
creepyPMs,removed,shouldve told him his penis is small thats probably where all that hate and insecurity is coming from
creepyPMs,removed,i am this close to blocking you but really i dont mind your messages since i can use them for karma
creepyPMs,removed,honestly he might just be a really lonely really shy guy youve already told him youre in a relationship but that doesnt stop him from being infatuated its been a little strange to me seeing how many people immediately jump to omg carry mace you probably arent in any danger tell your supervisor if he approaches you outside of work head straight back in or to the nearest coworker firmly tell him that you are not interested and you do not want him to give you any more gifts poems or letters and that you need to keep your relationship strictly professional as you have no interest in him if you dont feel comfortable doing it ask your supervisor or a coworker to assist you he probably isnt going to hurt you you will certainly hurt his feelings but thats just the way it is a lot of us have been through similar situations and there is a professional sane way to handle it if is escalates waiting by your car at night showing up on your door step threatening you or your coworkers then call the cops until then youve just got some lovelorn sap whos just a little delusional that the person he is attracted to might feel a little something back for him oh and dont feel too sorry for him either that will just encourage him be honest be firm and dont drawn it out trust me it wont be the first time someones been let down certainly wont be the last
creepyPMs,removed,what a delusional racist fucking prick op on the other hand looks like a cute nerd who should maybe consider seeking help for his unfortunate and misguided selfhatred
creepyPMs,removed,ill find him and ill make him wish he wasnt alive to say that shit
creepyPMs,removed,this update makes it seem fake for sure
creepyPMs,removed,i feel like posting whisper conversations on here is basically cheating
creepyPMs,removed,oh im saving this that dude is a savage motherufkcr
creepyPMs,removed,yea my spelling can be bad when i type sometimes haaa
creepyPMs,removed,this is going to karma conspiracy
creepyPMs,removed,kill yourself
creepyPMs,removed,wow what a savage as a proud white man i am going to save this and show it to everyone
creepyPMs,removed,this is the same person with two accounts i dont know how anyone else cant see it
creepyPMs,removed,so ive stopped posting over there but ive continued perusing the threads and it seems like the majority of folks over there are genuinely baffled as i was by the autobans i dont know if it reflects very well on this sub i mean obviously rca has more than its fair share of stuff that reflects poorly on them but this seems like it has a lot of potential to fan the flames especially considering the usual online activity of the folks over there who actually do cause problems
creepyPMs,removed,as a white guy dark skin is beautiful and that guy should go kill himself for the sake of humanity
creepyPMs,removed,send this shit to his employer
creepyPMs,removed,i am so sorry this happened to you he is hateful ands is wrong for the record you are so handsome in my opinion screw what bitter people with too much spare time post on the internet
creepyPMs,removed,lol this looks fake as fuckthe guy in the pictures looks quite attractive and self secured in himself to not make this kind of post this looks like some bad tumblrsjw strawman propagandanotice how he says white men in person like sjws on tumblr refer to evereything thats wrong with society in their eyeswhy not say white people instead of men if youre a white supremacist because they obviously have women who are white supremacist as welli also noticed this account was created a day ago probably for the purpose of this post
creepyPMs,removed,please cite a source to those anecdotal evidence by whos researchyoure the racist here generalizing white men and assuming every user you ran into is a white man which is redicolus considering not many people put on profile pictures of themselves especially on your reply is the typical sjw bullshit reply trying to twist my wordsfirst of all i dont care about his feelings i dont even know himsecond of all im not trying to negate anything im saying op is a fake account spewing out strawman propagandaits just shows how stereotypical sjw you are when you try to call me a racist for making an argument against op and the fact that if i dont agree with those sjws make me a racist automaticallygo find a space bro
creepyPMs,removed,does the carpal tunnel in your wrists stifle your handjob abilities serious question
creepyPMs,removed,witty girls are so cute good job op
creepyPMs,removed,good life advice
creepyPMs,removed,if im an asshole for having an opinion and you having no counter argument then color me asshole
creepyPMs,removed,what rule did i break
creepyPMs,removed,hahaha probably true but for the sake of research are wrist braces involved
creepyPMs,removed,i love how they call us sexist i would say this is one of the more respectful toward women subs that wouldnt hesitate to turn on its heels to defend a man if he were the subject of a post unfairly
creepyPMs,removed,i dont really see how this is creepy though annoying certainly creepy not so much
creepyPMs,removed,i mean if you say youre interested in casual sex i dont really see the problem
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,have you triednot being a shrekasslooking stalker
creepyPMs,removed,yeah sorry no ive been civil but im not going to be blindly supportive i shouldve known better than to subscribe to an srs sub bye now
creepyPMs,removed,this is definitely a creepy thing no doubt about it but i dont think we should classify it as rapey
creepyPMs,removed,im pretty sure if someone threatens to kill me im in the right to call them just about whatever i please
creepyPMs,removed,so where was the rapey part
creepyPMs,removed,i dont really think this is bad i was a socially retarded moron at sixteen
creepyPMs,removed,fucking a kid doesnt make you a pedophile s
creepyPMs,removed,he literally gave you a compliment and then you fucking go after him i swear to god this sub is just filled with people who arent happy enough being completed they have to go after people fucks sake
creepyPMs,removed,i think you were being rude in the first place you cant be rude to someone then call them creepy for being rude back why even respond at all if theyre not what youre looking for
creepyPMs,removed,sharing is caring op
creepyPMs,removed,lmao what kind of reaction is that would you have berated just about anyone who pays you an unsolicited compliment even in person
creepyPMs,removed,honestly i would just go break his legs but im a victim of abuse who feels the need to have violent retribution against people who attempt to harm my loved ones perhaps pretending to be the feds looking into an internet harassment case and say his ip was tracked back to a post on a forum for the purpose of harassing an individual after a user reported the post to officials inform him that this is a serious offense and as a nation we are working towards creating harsh punishments to reign in internet crime and that he should expect to be contacted by local law enforcement within the next months regarding the case you can use the burner app and pick a phone number to more believably belong to a member of the fbi or you could just be the bigger person and let it die so your gf probably wont be bothered ever again
creepyPMs,removed,i mean i definitely wouldnt do what ugreybunnyrabbit suggested id let it go it was a while ago and he hasnt personally harassed her since then and it seems that the crew didnt either seems to have gone decently well
creepyPMs,removed,no not everyone but there has been numerous times ive thought someone looked beautiful and told them so sometimes it was a friend sometimes an acquaintance others neither i have never once been handled remotely like this woman handled this man
creepyPMs,removed,even if this did work on someone i wouldnt want my dick in their mouth just imagine how many gross ones have been in there
creepyPMs,removed,did you even tell him you were messaging his wife
creepyPMs,removed,damn bitch
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know this kind of seems like you overreacted i know this will be an unpopular opinion but you could have simply said thanks but i dont appreciate being objectified like that please dont contact me again you exploded on him though its not like he started off with a dick pic like half the other guys as a guy if a woman stopped what she was doing to tell me how handsome i was then id be flattered do women really find this that offensive is it that hard to just block the guy and leave it at that
creepyPMs,removed,well you did respond like a total bitch at first
creepyPMs,removed,not super creepy maybe you have to know the dude who probably is creepy but i kinda feel bad for him awkward weird dude with a big crush sprinkle in some social anxietynervousness maybe he just really likes her but im assuming shes out of his league if i liked someone i would appreciate someone else cockblocking them too though you werent actually trying to or succeeding in that i would tell him to try talking to her casually like in a group setting and for him to see how she seemsacts because you can usually gauge someones interest that way i would also advise him not to read the explicit poem like a poem is one thing a wordporn from a stranger is another but im an advising kind of person perhaps not your thing the cat thing is weird but some people are bad at poemssocial etiquette cats eat fish fish is a euphemism for lady bits lady bits get eaten maybe its siamese just to make the syllabic flow work maybe he thinks a girl wants to hear that he wants to eat her out in the same way he wants to hear that a girl wants to suck his dick that or he eats cats lmao sorry for your situation but good story i also might warn the crush
creepyPMs,removed,this guys obviously a creep but you know you couldve ignored him and avoided this entire conversation its hard to care when someone says this guy was bugging me for hours when you kept feeding into his bullshit and egging him on
creepyPMs,removed,ftfy
creepyPMs,removed,but saying that dude is pathetic isnt a simplistic observation
creepyPMs,removed,so if hes not up for the dildo i can be made available
creepyPMs,removed,woah whoever purple is needs to back off
creepyPMs,removed,i dont really see a real explanation there i only see this is what happened after we put it on and this is kind of responses we got while i do respect that it is your choice to do this i really feel it isnt a good one it really just invites mockery and derision of both you and the groupsideas you represent youre also stifling the backlash towards the people you disagree with since people will either be discouraged from engaging in conversation with them because they dont like the idea of getting banned whether or not they ever comment here or more likely people will view the other side more favorably because theyre not engaging in draconian censorship all in all i really fail to see the positive side here you get extra work unbanning innocent people as opposed to just banning brigadiers as they come it gives both the sub and groups represented bad press it gives the alt right easy ammunition to use against you what is there to be gained here
creepyPMs,removed,hey can you ban me from this shitty sub
creepyPMs,removed,curious you want to active discourage people from engaging with people that have different views than their own
creepyPMs,removed,stale hivemind circlejerks are not welcome the irony
creepyPMs,removed,perhaps because auto banning based on what subs you post in is ridiculous or are you just scared of opinions that differ from your own
creepyPMs,removed,uhh no not particularly pushy just a kid most likely lets be honest guys that typing probably a young person that discovered pornography
creepyPMs,removed,yea hes got issues with the ladies but you did remember the conversation and thats when it got creepy lying is creepy man someone obviously lying to your face is creepy as hell
creepyPMs,removed,i cant believe how long that ecchange went on for
creepyPMs,removed,this made me laugh more than anything he wasnt even being that creepy just weird
creepyPMs,removed,what a petty mod you are
creepyPMs,removed,we are feminist and womenfriendly you know your just giving woman a bad name you dont like some people that wander into your sub ban everyone yall are acting like a more mild the donald
creepyPMs,removed,actively ban people for simply posting on a subreddit that you disagree with this will surely gain public s
creepyPMs,removed,i said public support not my support frankly i couldnt care less what an sjw mod does on their subreddit their choice ultimately i just felt like pointing out how this is likely to cause some backlash from regular members of this subreddit just look at the replies to this comment
creepyPMs,removed,support group my ass you could easily just block these fuckheads but you choose not to for those sweet internet points
creepyPMs,removed,you seem like the type of cunt that feeds off this type of attention
creepyPMs,removed,kill yourself fat fucks
creepyPMs,removed,just going to wander by and mention id be receptive to this
creepyPMs,removed,on my profile on okc the looking for box says im exclusively looking for women not trying to justify that guy as this is a very different situation but okc has this problem that when a woman identifies herself as bisexual but is only looking for women they will still show up when you search for women interested in men it happened to me at least once that i messaged a bisexual woman who was only looking for women because of this issue i later realized about it and had to apologize i wish they would fix that its awkward
creepyPMs,removed,i wonder what the success rate is for this kind of approach is it like a law of averages deal ask enough people and someone is bound to say okay
creepyPMs,removed,hey i wasnt trying to antagonize anyone i was just making an observation i wasnt sure who op was
creepyPMs,removed,honest question i dont mean to be rude are you using meetme even though you have a husband also what is with that guy its like he doesnt even know what to write
creepyPMs,removed,pizza rolls are social currency for tumblr and buzzfeed types its a marker or being a cool introvert
creepyPMs,removed,lol
creepyPMs,removed,actually seems like a good convo to me you were up front he was up front you mutually decided it wasnt going to work upvote because he brought up sex and it seems it was unsolicited
creepyPMs,removed,im not defending the guy hes an asshole but isnt op at least just a wrong here what does his penis size have to do with anything why try and insult him for something he cant control i mean why even give him the satisfaction of a response
creepyPMs,removed,i just dont get this why not block such a person immediately pretty sure this is extremely annoying
creepyPMs,removed,thanks for the explanation
creepyPMs,removed,i was being sarcastic
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand why did you even reply in the first place
creepyPMs,removed,my autobiography bitch
creepyPMs,removed,op started it
creepyPMs,removed,send a dick pic thatll teach it
creepyPMs,removed,ive had two guys fill my penis with cum before one right after another its called my left hand and my right hand weve been in a strictly closed relationship for over years now
creepyPMs,removed,racism has no color
creepyPMs,removed,im fucking chill bitch sit on my face
creepyPMs,removed,from my perception they seem to originate from different places the following is just my opinion the insecurity about blacks taking white women comes from the porn industry it is a very prevalent fetish there due in no small part to reinforcing stereotypes and playing on the taboo even though today an interracial couple is far less novel on the flip side black men in general have a victim mentality whether its justified or not i think that extends to their rejection as well its like race is their fallback answer in some ways they are kept back for it but not every way despite this any sort of rejection on a personal level feels like an attack on their race i could definitely be wrong i cant read every mind but thats how it seems to me
creepyPMs,removed,i dont mean to be rude but i just started frequenting this sub for laughs and had no idea demisexualasexual was that common a thing and these seem like dating sites soyou date someone but no sex like cuddles im lost
creepyPMs,removed,once you go white you know its right right
creepyPMs,removed,i dont get why women humor these types of people do you just want to keep getting compliments and saying no a guy in another country said he liked you and wanted to get to know you and you called him unattractive and said you werent interested riveting i mean yeah he shouldnt have been that persistent but if you really arent interested just block the guy i guess if you do that though you cant show off that someone was hitting on you for fake internet points so
creepyPMs,removed,im not trolling im a woman and i feel like a lot of the posts on cringepics are just ew look how creepy this guy is hes hitting on me so much he wants me so bad how creepy get the fuck over yourself dude i dont get hit on constantly by creepy guys online because i dont constantly go places online where i know that will happen if you dont want to be followed around by a creep parade its pretty fucking avoidable
creepyPMs,removed,fuck off
creepyPMs,removed,noted
creepyPMs,removed,just dont reply
creepyPMs,removed,you must be fun at parties
creepyPMs,removed,reply whiney little bitch
creepyPMs,removed,did u charge ur phone op
creepyPMs,removed,maybe he is bipolar
creepyPMs,removed,some but not all unless you believe christians spread islam to the east
creepyPMs,removed,thats actually untrue universities are required by title ix to earmark funds for the purpose of dealing with sexual assault and harassment and many universities even have special courts set up with a lower burden of proof specifically for investigating sexual assault and rape dont make claims you cant back up
creepyPMs,removed,that is unbelieavably creepy of him glad you shut him down firmly but not rudely family and all that must say though it kind of sucks to see a trans person use the slur tr especially to someone such as your cousin wgo obviously doesnt have a lotany interaction with trans people hearing someone else use that word in a negative way to mean any person who identifies as trans could normalize the usage for him and he really really shouldnt say it
creepyPMs,removed,actually that mattress story turned out to be total bullshit literally just horrible factchecking on the part of the rolling stone when the burden of proof on campuses for punishing students for alleged rape is lower than the standard for criminal prosecution that shows that rape is taken seriously on campuses and sometimes we even believe rape stories that are totally untrue like that of mattress girl
creepyPMs,removed,a true asian gentleman there on a side notefrom whatever little experience i have had working with asian male clients many of them really arent very respectful towards females if theyre second generation americans then yeah they are buy many first generation or immigrants are not at all
creepyPMs,removed,women shouldnt feel so entitled with their bodies
creepyPMs,removed,looking good there nikki adrien
creepyPMs,removed,ive never understood why people keep responding to creepy pms online its literally the simplest thing ever to just ignore them
creepyPMs,removed,women r stopid
creepyPMs,removed,but gurls r infior lol dood
creepyPMs,removed,dude youre borderline retarded for biting bait that obvious
creepyPMs,removed,i dunno if he was angry or confused for i am confused to a point where my neck started getting sore from tilting my head left and right to figure out what your belief is whites are blind to the negative impact of their existence for they are greed and lust and rage with no room for such weak useless things as empathy and decency i dont defend the creep in any way but does anyone want to enlighten me in regards to op
creepyPMs,removed,well yes but that doesnt in and of itself prove her story to be true i think a lot of people tend to take a guilty before proven innocent view when it comes to rape accusations which is why someones life can be ruined even if theyre found not guilty i believe that unless we know all the facts which would be impossible because we arent a court of law we cant independently judge someone to be guilty even if they werent convicted of any crime anyway im just glad youre rationally discussing this with me rather than mindlessly downvoting what i write because it conflicts with your worldview its very much appreciated
creepyPMs,removed,honestly youre as cringey as each other
creepyPMs,removed,i have no idea wtf is wrong with them other than being white baby fascists justice is not the only right in this world someday they will understand
creepyPMs,removed,heres another unpopular opinion you can compliment somebodys appearance regardless of whether youre interested or not though i doubt this guy wasnt what i fail to see is how hes acting like hes entitled to sex
creepyPMs,removed,why fake a post when there are so many real examples i dont get it
creepyPMs,removed,first of all why are you giving our personal cell phone number out to strangers seems like youre asking for stuff like this to happen
creepyPMs,removed,id tell him to end his
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt even bad jesus christ
creepyPMs,removed,hi megan this is robert i hope you dont think it strange but that black tank top dayum
creepyPMs,removed,meh doesnt bother me i was more pointing out that she left her name and his name in there this is literally my first post in this subreddit i could care less about the silly rules
creepyPMs,removed,you woke up to a message from july
creepyPMs,removed,ill never get over the way these people revoke their compliments like theyre a privilege then forget it lol girls you tried this on had already forgotten it retard
creepyPMs,removed,wow thats a lot of drama for work its the reason recommended not to mix business with pleasure at the workplace because crazy can be mixed up in there like this guy he his is desperate and his life is empty so he is looking to fill that void block him forever
creepyPMs,removed,get a life hahahahahhh damn
creepyPMs,removed,you posted the same thing days ago
creepyPMs,removed,see the beauty of reddit is theres no telling who is who you can ban my account but i always have more i am legion you cannot kill me
creepyPMs,removed,repost
creepyPMs,removed,theyre both awful
creepyPMs,removed,what the fuck did you mean to post this in cringe for yourself
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,the only thing creepy is what the op posted lol
creepyPMs,removed,and women actually request it which makes it worse i suggest blocking him on facebook
creepyPMs,removed,wow really impressed with how you handled the scumbag kept it really classy way different from what usually gets seen 👍
creepyPMs,removed,k
creepyPMs,removed,sigh unzips
creepyPMs,removed,you definitely dont recognize red flags but at least tat the end of the day you ended it i hope guy is a psycho
creepyPMs,removed,hes definitely a dick but a part of me thinks hes probably very lonely i kinda feel sorry for him in a round about way i dont think anyone with a decent social life would act like this
creepyPMs,removed,though you are correct he is a fucking douche anyone who types like that when theres no character count with unlimited texts these days the x thing is really really common here i know when ive fucked up and made my mrs mad if she stops putting xs at the end of texts
creepyPMs,removed,nah hes just a troll and this isnt real life its the internet
creepyPMs,removed,why did you even give him a second chance
creepyPMs,removed,everyone gets those messages
creepyPMs,removed,also check out fatuglyorsluttycom we make fun of these idiots there
creepyPMs,removed,lmao ah true my bad ya got me
creepyPMs,removed,i mean they might have thought you were a guy and still sent this
creepyPMs,removed,yeah obviously and i have no doubt that these messages wouldnt have happened if not for op being a woman but shit like this isnt exclusive to women i cant count on my hands and feet how many times i was asked to send nudes online when i was using a mic around i didnt mean to incite argument just kind of saying everyone gets those messages
creepyPMs,removed,make gamers get all kinds of offensive messages too its not a sexism thing its a gaming thing
creepyPMs,removed,its not about you being a girl gamers are just like this to everyone but whatever makes you feel special
creepyPMs,removed,ive had all these insults thrown at me too im a man
creepyPMs,removed,so i dont mean to be that guy but these messages dont really seem any worse than any ive gotten and im a man dont get me wrong theyre messed up and shouldnt have happened but i dont think it was because op is a woman
creepyPMs,removed,rthatsmyfetish
creepyPMs,removed,i suspect this guy is a douche to everyone not just you
creepyPMs,removed,heh i was waiting for the whole you see yourself in this guy thing although this is only reddit and it doesnt matter irl i would like to clarify by saying i would never act like that and im not a lonely loser honest im engaged and have a massive group of friends also id like to add that empathy doesnt need to be based on your own experiences you can have empathy for someone going through a situation youve not been through yourself aaanyway youre conflating how hes acting in this instance with empathising about his personal situation once again i caveat this by saying it does not excuse his fuckhead behaviour but it doesnt mean you cant have empathy for someone for having a shitty existence should that be the case if you cant separate the two and have defined him entirely by one shitty act then youre looking at it in a very black and white way no offence i dont even know for sure if he does have a shitty existence but as i said before i think behaviour this excessive is indicative of genuine despair and as a human being i naturally empathise with how horrible that might feel i could also be totally wrong and he might just be a massive asshole in which case the ambiguity disappears and ill grab a flaming torch with the rest of you
creepyPMs,removed,not even because youre a girl gamer im a guy and get these too its a sign that you really owned him in whatever game you met in
creepyPMs,removed,no offense but everyone gets these kinda of messages some angry child whose irresponsible parents let him play call of duty online doesnt give a shit what your gender is he just hates you because hes a dumb little shit
creepyPMs,removed,tldr people on both sides of an argument in this case one about ethicsaccountability in game journalism later broadening to include a bunch of other issues in gaming for no real reason act like the radical nutjobs on their opponents side represent the whole group like thotprophet basically
creepyPMs,removed,why are you still on the old ios
creepyPMs,removed,come on man you can take it its only though for girls poor girls
creepyPMs,removed,name one fucking place i made an excuse for him
creepyPMs,removed,nah getting that message just means that they accept you as one of them
creepyPMs,removed,at least you gave yourself plenty of attention over it with a pity post
creepyPMs,removed,what everyone gets this shit everyone boys and girls its called year olds on the internet
creepyPMs,removed,theres this guy on youtube named xboxaddictionz who trolls kids in games like gta v and minecraft some of them can say quite disturbing stuff
creepyPMs,removed,you just proved his point by using a gendered insult
creepyPMs,removed,yeah that must be it despite the numerous times i stated i wasnt defending him and that his actions were inexcusable and that i wholly believe it was a completely dick move i was definitely defending him and of course saying that you can empathise with someone if they were lonely is totally making up a fantasy realm in which im compassionate yep youve really got my number what a terrible person i am im really wounded by this sudden realisation that im a nasty wicked creep defender oh yeah and coddled like a child because that also has everything to do with this
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair that sounds like a pretty unisex insult
creepyPMs,removed,this could easily be sent to any player not just female players
creepyPMs,removed,ummm what kind of chips do you lesbo broads stock like doritos or what reqs
creepyPMs,removed,i think youd be surprised this happens so often to me that if i were to screenshot it save it archive it etc id not only be wasting my time but id likely be wasting gigabytes of hard drive space bodily dismemberment body part fucking rape and death threats are just standard issue internet threats not even worth acknowledging if the guy in the op was posting her address or showing an original photograph of her housethat would be bad but this is just some asshole kid being obnoxious
creepyPMs,removed,if it makes you feel any better guys send guys those same ones except maybe the slut one
creepyPMs,removed,so because they have a pussy somehow harassment is more serious welcome to the fucking internet go look at any youtube page and read the comments then try to say its not the same
creepyPMs,removed,shhhh youre not fitting the narrative that only women get harassed online
creepyPMs,removed,what does girl gamer have anything to do with this
creepyPMs,removed,by your very own logic every single human trait is being singled out online how can you read a comment saying everybody gets shit online and take you admitted women are specifically targeted away from it did you have a stroke while reading
creepyPMs,removed,i get the same responses and im a male gamer
creepyPMs,removed,the first message is boilerplate internet trash talk
creepyPMs,removed,because thats literally what you said got it you refuse to use an ounce of logic when you think and substitute it for mindless outrage im done here i try not to argue with the mentally handicapped
creepyPMs,removed,i personally think its fairly equal because everyone gets shit from both genders if your bad at the game or someone is salty its just that the insults range in severity
creepyPMs,removed,sounds hot except for the baby part
creepyPMs,removed,rpedofriends its a fucked up site were in
creepyPMs,removed,you literally put a question on askreddit about inappropriate questions anyone would like to ask girls i mean it doesnt mean they should dm you but come on now
creepyPMs,removed,masses of white men blame whitey
creepyPMs,removed,is banned and pedofriend is a support sub
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know about but pedofriends is a support sub discussion of children is not allowed there
creepyPMs,removed,this guy is an absolute freak however please do not let him colour your opinion of pedofriends that sub doesnt even allow discussion or children reporting the comment will get that sorted
creepyPMs,removed,psst his number is at the top
creepyPMs,removed,forgive my ignorance but wouldnt that be more of a mental handicap such as downs syndrome or autism than a mental illness such as anxiety or depression
creepyPMs,removed,got his now i can find out if he wants to hang out w me
creepyPMs,removed,sorry but im more upset that youre at battery thats just nuts
creepyPMs,removed,what is it with guys fetishing female feet my lord
creepyPMs,removed,i have not seen until today a female into this fetish and a schedule of care shared responsibility
creepyPMs,removed,not going to lie but that turns me on haha 😎
creepyPMs,removed,wait dont burn this bridge when birth control for men comes out next year you will can finally be the trash truck to her cup dumpster bust reload repeat
creepyPMs,removed,am i the only one that thought he had a valid question
creepyPMs,removed,i think he was asking about your statement on brain responses to stimuli and how you mentioned people who identify as male have the same brain responses to the same stimuli as bio males even if their sex was female so now im curious in your response based on what you said above if a trans identifies as female but their brain doesnt respond to stimuli in the same manner as bio females do are they illegitimately trans why or why not ps dont down vote me simply because you disagree that makes you a bigot
creepyPMs,removed,best solution is always to block although they tend to make another account sometimes
creepyPMs,removed,it makes me sad to see a jericho shirt used in this way
creepyPMs,removed,lmao people with fetishes on da are out of control at least it wasnt a diaper fetish
creepyPMs,removed,honestly despite the fact that i agree with your underlying cause i really find that your use of what can at best be considered the inherently highly questionable findings from one singular popscience fmri study at best does a disservice to both your cause and science itself and at worst is just flat out irresponsible if you want to be taken seriously then you need to put a lot more thought and skepticism into how you interpret and subsequently choose to communicate scientific findings you should really be ashamed for conveying those findings as fact seriously you should automatically be skeptical of any sort of science especially fmri thats thrown your way and heres why
creepyPMs,removed,the trick is to wear a mask so she cant identify you later
creepyPMs,removed,i know people dont always like to read but immediately trying to shut someone down should be a nice hint to just stop
creepyPMs,removed,best reply is no reply they want attention they need acknowledgement no interaction with them while you continue to participate in other threads drive these nutcases crazy
creepyPMs,removed,a beard is the term for a guy that a lesbian is with to hide her sexuality if you know that it makes the initial convo less creepy
creepyPMs,removed,mmmkay this is creepy and hes an ass but forcing your sexual fantasy upon me come on how much tumblr do you use
creepyPMs,removed,just started following your snapchat and i actually would love pics of your cat 😺
creepyPMs,removed,can you make a new account and use someone elses pic that way he wont find you and you can still talk to people
creepyPMs,removed,report to police so they can track them down
creepyPMs,removed,i rarely if ever comment on reddit posts that being said like and like i double liked this post im pretty great i have comment karma and im years old and still on a dating app pm me if youre interested no bs
creepyPMs,removed,im sorry for giving a different opinion from all those but why not just tell him in a friendly way
creepyPMs,removed,can you report it
creepyPMs,removed,says who
creepyPMs,removed,its hard to take shit like this seriously when the woman in question continuously responds i dont have time to put effort into talking to you talking to him lol the best way to keep loser fuckboys away is by not responding at all in the first place
creepyPMs,removed,name and shame at least report them to local authorities seriously
creepyPMs,removed,omg just tell him to fuck off and dont reply after that sounds like an indian fresh from his homeland they seem to lack understanding of our cultures boundaries
creepyPMs,removed,it is the problem that comes whenever someone try to look at thing from a different light a lot of people end up taking the other extreme because middle grounds are for cowards because you can feel that it should be easier for pedophiles to get help without being punished for crimes they havent done yet and not feel it is totally fine and we should just give it a thumbs up
creepyPMs,removed,why even waste time talking to him he cared less than you did
creepyPMs,removed,the thing being out of order is confusing but so is the back story they bought a table from him but he doesnt have her contact info that he tried to get from the sis but he clearly does have the info and where is the actual creepy part where hes trying to get at the sis or op very confusing on the creepy scale
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt see the post but going by the replies im guessing the removal could be justified as no armchair psychologydiagnoses i dont agree with it either downvoting removing posts because the content is controversial will be the nail in my coffin but any mod petty enough to remove a post out of personal disagreement will be petty enough to justify a halfassed reason like the one i quoted
creepyPMs,removed,no matter how small
creepyPMs,removed,still not an okay way to respond
creepyPMs,removed,im not saying being a pedophile is a good thing but if you dont act on your urges and realize theyre an issue then you arent a monster you just need help
creepyPMs,removed,always missing out on the bees and flowerstards did i miss something important
creepyPMs,removed,i think what he means is its too small for anyone to see what he does
creepyPMs,removed,hey in fairness the child was so maybe it was like s
creepyPMs,removed,i mean as cringy as that is would it have really been that hard to just tell him youre not interested or to unmatch him dude messaged you times on different days lol
creepyPMs,removed,pretty sure this comment is going to be deleted but before it is i can kind of understand somewhat why the guys angry about getting no response i mean it sucks to be rejected but it loses its sting somewhat when the other person simply tells you that theyre not interested in you or that theyve realized that it simply wont work out thats fineplenty of other people around but i lost all sympathy for eddie after augustno excuse dudeno wonder youre single
creepyPMs,removed,dropping four messages to you over consecutive days with just radio silence to follow should be a message in and of itself but you have to admit your reply to him was pretty terse
creepyPMs,removed,soi think i might know this guy know anything more about him
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt say he was owed i said i understood partly dudes frustration given my own experiences i then stated that his reaction was completely inappropriate
creepyPMs,removed,i already stated that dudes response was inappropriatei just said i understand the frustration with just being ghosted its not every guys fault that other guys are immature and cant handle a simple no thank you
creepyPMs,removed,ive rejected women i wasnt interested inthey always accuse you of having a small penis or that youre gay immature people are just immature
creepyPMs,removed,why do you think it wasnt terse the definition of terse terse tərs adjective adjective terse comparative adjective terser superlative adjective tersest sparing in the use of words abrupt a terse statement synonyms brief short to the point concise succinct crisp pithy incisive trenchant short and sweet laconic elliptical
creepyPMs,removed,were not victim blaming and dudes response was terrible but just ghosting people like this is kinda rude too
creepyPMs,removed,why was he on your snapchat
creepyPMs,removed,im not blaming the person from recoiling from dudes commentstrust me i get itim just saying that i understand the frustration but not inappropriate responses to this frustration guys feel when a woman just simply stops responding without letting them know theyre not interested obviously there are creeps out there but that doesnt mean all men deserve the same treatment i read feminist material frequently and understand from a purely academic perspectivei dont share the same experiences and am not making that claim the reticence to respond in circumstances under which they know dude is going to have a meltdown but please try to put yourself in our shoesif you were a guy and were talking to some woman on the internet and she suddenly stopped all contact with you for reasons completely unknown to you how would you feel
creepyPMs,removed,this is so stupid either stop ignoring him or block him you have no right to complain about him when youre being extremely childish
creepyPMs,removed,my eyes cant resist you immaculate venus can i send you some pics of my inadequate penis ftfy
creepyPMs,removed,how does this violate rule i did not blame the victim i criticized the person who went off the rails and simply shared my own experiences how do any of those violate this subs guidelines
creepyPMs,removed,reading the comments i had to put in my cents yeah that guy was certainly lame and rude when he didnt get what he wanted he sucks that being said ops reason for losing interest comes off as superficial and kinda lame i dont really see how this should be on creepypms since it came off more a nice guys its possible for lame people to match
creepyPMs,removed,lol this is exactly what im talking about and you only find the creepypms and nice guy and cringepics posts that revolve around weight im def calling you a fatty but in reality youre probably obese what are your body statistics if you are not

creepyPMs,removed,dont you have no control over your hairline but you can choose to not eat garbage all day
creepyPMs,removed,im pretty sure hes joking i would find this hilarious if i received it but i totally admit my sense of humour is pretty fucked up i refuse to believe this is anything but satire
creepyPMs,removed,no body shaming uh read the fucking ops comment it has body shaming in it to the guy she responded too do you even lift referring to his bodyshape in a negative way bald shaming being fat is a poor life choice it shouldnt be encouraged
creepyPMs,removed,not that creepy tbh seems like a random thirsty dude
creepyPMs,removed,when you say crazy sounding things people are going to assume youre crazy if you had worded your comment differently it wouldnt make you seem so crazy i would have thought the same thing if you were a guy equality feminism
creepyPMs,removed,gay bear porn that sounds tots hawt
creepyPMs,removed,i was talking about how that line worked in real ife saying im looking for something witj no strings attached and added some more i followed the rules
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,men were telling women this in the process is likely a turn on
creepyPMs,removed,k
creepyPMs,removed,so it goes without saying that this is purely fictional so nobody get triggered just let me know if i get too dark huh insert title here always looking for title ideas had none lol halloween and he was alone again it didnt make sense he was the picture of masculinityhis greasy beard was full and bushy he drove a dodge neon why he even had manly pets he even had an iphone all these evil sluts in the world what is their problem anyway he thought bitterly as he rubbed his red beady eyes he hit ctrlshe was having a hell of a time finishing his friday the fanficit was prolly his best work but all he could think about was how those hollywood sluts kept rejecting his script for son of vorhees keys clicked softly as he opened up tumblr he was the greatest catch that had ever lurked in a neckbeard hell he could find some one to talk to he itched the stump at the end of his leg where the diabetes had taken his foot that bitch doctor she could have saved it but she was jealous and threatened by his raw sexual magnetism his unibrow raised in surprise as he came across hitrecordhensons blog who is she he thought with his tiny penis oh just look at these pics shes just asking to be taught a lesson he thought of all the things he could do with heri mean why would she dress like that shes obviously easy and just waiting for an alpha male to make her decisions for her he grunted as he thought his unibrow scrunching in concentration a thin line of drool leaked from his halfopen mouth and he wiped it away negligently he was breathing a little harder now thinking about how he would approach her should he send her commands with a picture of his dick or should he try some of his fantasies out on her if he played this right shed be sure to come over and share his twin bed he grunted again and thought about how hed always wanted to try a devilsthreeway with his greatest creation jason an oily smile slithered over his face and he began to type
creepyPMs,removed,hey its me tom you havent answered me yet
creepyPMs,removed,theres a pretty high correlation between mental disorders and paraphilia eg fetishistic sex fantasies it may be why so many of these people dont know when to stop
creepyPMs,removed,it seems like he might have an actual mental disorder judging by the way he arbitrarily repeats phrases
creepyPMs,removed,he probably did know based on your username and picture and was pulling your leg
creepyPMs,removed,either hes blind or hes really old or both
creepyPMs,removed,do you feel a tingle in your little privates
creepyPMs,removed,he kind of sound like hes trolling
creepyPMs,removed,how do you guys respond to this stuff you know hes wacking off to you responding at all right
creepyPMs,removed,why dont you report him
creepyPMs,removed,put up their contact info on the social justice approach i like it
creepyPMs,removed,i think the year old sounded like a bot lol
creepyPMs,removed,troll i smell a troll
creepyPMs,removed,why should she its obviously no issue to him
creepyPMs,removed,honestly kind of funny but in all reality you need to report this fool everyday hes around is another day he could talk to an actual year old my ex was the assistant da and every pedo she prosecuted was like addicted to it with tons of material and a long string of attempts no one tries just once
creepyPMs,removed,rindianpeopletinder
creepyPMs,removed,this doesnt really seem that bad to me ¯ツ¯
creepyPMs,removed,you can block him out of sight out of mind
creepyPMs,removed,why didnt you just block him you wanted it t
creepyPMs,removed,probably satire
creepyPMs,removed,wait how is the word mansplaining not sexist
creepyPMs,removed,so petty what a bitch accept you are weird and move on
creepyPMs,removed,why didnt she just block him
creepyPMs,removed,if hes bothering you tjat much why even humor him with a response and not just block him
creepyPMs,removed,why is that women are so stupid but please dont assume that i mean all women
creepyPMs,removed,she said mean things he is doing mean things you are saying more mean things i dont see the difference
creepyPMs,removed,but wait why is this harassment he blocked your name didnt he surely having someone take your comments and show them to other people isnt that big of a deal i know plenty of people who do that irl and although it might be mean and distasteful it isnt harassment
creepyPMs,removed,what a jaded way of thinking whatever
creepyPMs,removed,i dont agree with every one of its objectives and methods and so forth and the term they use for it does bother me so i guess im weak in that case it didnt sound snarky though i just always feel the need to make sure someone isnt mistaking what i mean which pretty much always happens and is the reason for my obsession with using the exact word for my exact meaning words are kind of a very very very big thing neurosis of mine youre good to go
creepyPMs,removed,hey op really nice work on the countertroll just out of curiosity had he bought you pizza and let you eat it alone would you have done anything sexual with jethro you sound almost game
creepyPMs,removed,youre no less guilty of creepiness here than he is youre literally fishing for creepy messages and then posting it to reddit to make fun of him for messaging you exactly what you wanted to hear srsly i want to copy this post and post it but emphasize you as the creepy one
creepyPMs,removed,well then no offense but youre being creepy here too and encouraging his behavior
creepyPMs,removed,why wouldnt you just stop talking to him if you were so mad someone like the attention a little much whether its from him or us
creepyPMs,removed,plot twist youre the creepy one
creepyPMs,removed,no offense but whatever im about to say is going to be deeply offensive
creepyPMs,removed,guys for every single girl lol k
creepyPMs,removed,how was any of that creepy
creepyPMs,removed,can i suck your clit
creepyPMs,removed,i have a strong feeling that hes one of those indian or middle eastern guys that have just discovered social networking and constantly try picking up girls that theyve never met before the broken english and misspellings are the culprits that or hes just an idiot
creepyPMs,removed,damn daneil good one bro ski man ddd xd
creepyPMs,removed,ah yes the creepy grandpa the whole daddy thing is gross enough without positioning prostitution
creepyPMs,removed,this does not belong here and also i disagree with you racism against any race is unacceptable no matter what love each other okay
creepyPMs,removed,can i suck your clit
creepyPMs,removed,i get why it was done its just the irony will be lost on most maybe even us
creepyPMs,removed,whats up with the seinfeld font and the vpn
creepyPMs,removed,why didnt you just remove him instead of talking for an extensive amount of time im dont know fb that well so maybe removing someone is hard in that case sorry
creepyPMs,removed,i decided when i was that if i had a daughter id name her persephone because we were learning myths and i loved that name also that person is an idiot
creepyPMs,removed,id honestly respond as if he is asking you to do a progressional photography job basically in a really formal manner say that unfortunately you just cant take such a large job for such a small price say shit like youd need to pay the models and your hourly rate as well as printing and travel costs like quote and see how high hed offer for lols or just get together twenty guys and see if they wanna fuck with the dude and pose in various sexy poses and then just claim they are trans or something
creepyPMs,removed,some sort of altright trigglypuff i love this
creepyPMs,removed,i actually get this a lot from indian guys as in men from india and turkey actually maybe its cultural
creepyPMs,removed,triggered
creepyPMs,removed,what if youre not as fat as you think you are
creepyPMs,removed,hes not wrong tho
creepyPMs,removed,the problem here is that youre being far too kind with the potato reference start asking him why he keeps sending you pictures of asparagus wrapped in fabric
creepyPMs,removed,haha
creepyPMs,removed,haha
creepyPMs,removed,haha
creepyPMs,removed,haha
creepyPMs,removed,haha
creepyPMs,removed,haha
creepyPMs,removed,haha
creepyPMs,removed,haha
creepyPMs,removed,ok not to be offensive to people with mental disabilities but it sounds like this person has some sort of mental disability like thats not supposed to be a petty insult or a joke all of these creeps who fit into the not being responded to but still send stupid messages anyway category always seem like they have a little bit more going that just basic rudeness they also always seem kind of delusional and as if they dont understand human interaction that well as they never bother to think of why theyre not getting a response also wtf is a sooky pic
creepyPMs,removed,you seem to be confused hes talking about his dick
creepyPMs,removed,i mean i dont get it besides the obvious stuff you didnt like give him a hard fuck off or anything why just for post value
creepyPMs,removed,does it say that you arent interesting in older guys i mean im not like defending old creepster there but some younger chicks are into older guys i think right
creepyPMs,removed,holy shit that is a great series of screens thats epic
creepyPMs,removed,its not eveb friendzone its this zone
creepyPMs,removed,it kinda seems like youre flirting in a weird way so if you did want it to stop thats probably not how to do it
creepyPMs,removed,yeah but she started with the potato shit im just saying its sending weird signals
creepyPMs,removed,i mean the pictures are kinda hot imo guys in boxers are hot
creepyPMs,removed,why would you continue to respond to this guy
creepyPMs,removed,wait do you know him why didnt you block him maybe you like his potato
creepyPMs,removed,is he attractive physically
creepyPMs,removed,the fact that you kept that conversation going as long as you did makes me second guess feeling secure about talking to girls
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand why people just dont say stop messaging me its not that hard really
creepyPMs,removed,easy tiger i didnt throw any blame i didnt feel the need to explain my comment any further but youre just reiterating my sentiment at no time did i mean to imply she did anything wrong besides yeah that was an extreme example and of course i picked up on her discomfort
creepyPMs,removed,not knowing your mom is dead doesnt make him an idiot
creepyPMs,removed,ohh no ill reapprove it you can put the comments in the comments through
creepyPMs,removed,even better
creepyPMs,removed,youre both annoying me just for different reasons
creepyPMs,removed,httpsimgurcomaomsoj this guy went on a tirade against not only me but several people in a sub that you can rlprobably guess from the topic of discussion he got himself banned for wishing death on all of us and purple was nothing but cordial with him i freely admit i probably antagonized him a bit too much butwow guy is a loon
creepyPMs,removed,i mean yeah the guy is an idiot and childish but what exactly is creepy about this
creepyPMs,removed,alright i guess i would just consider it more rude than creepy but i seem to be the minority in that opinion
creepyPMs,removed,this is very reminiscent of the word salad that is often a characteristic of schizophrenia
creepyPMs,removed,where do you meet these people and how come you carry on a conversation with them im just intruiged
creepyPMs,removed,yes alot of them wear badges and have cars with flashing lights on the top
creepyPMs,removed,yea twitch is just cam girls with a little box in the corner with lol in it
creepyPMs,removed,you sound like a huge bitch
creepyPMs,removed,both pretty cringey tbh
creepyPMs,removed,at he implies that its consensual instead of the usual ready or not here i come
creepyPMs,removed,honesty best policy
creepyPMs,removed,cant decide whos more cringey
creepyPMs,removed,miss is for grown women who feel bad about being grown women and have been made to value youth and so take any mention of something that implies youth over maturity as a compliment
creepyPMs,removed,this reveals more about op than anything else
creepyPMs,removed,unless they are good looking
creepyPMs,removed,thats your opinion but i was not talking about you or to you furthermore based on what you just said we are in agreement that it is unacceptable regardless so again this post says a lot about op
creepyPMs,removed,you receive a wrong text then preceed to act like a cunt just so you can try and post here to get karma good job op
creepyPMs,removed,your both incompetent
creepyPMs,removed,what is with these weird ass fetishes
creepyPMs,removed,what in the hell is wrong with this guy a lot of the texts made not sense almost like he had tourettes but with texting not making fun of tourettes its just an example but yeah they gave me the creeps for sure
creepyPMs,removed,so why are you on a dating site still
creepyPMs,removed,lol i think im aware of this like i said it was an example i knew at least one person would find it offensive
creepyPMs,removed,incopitent there goes my braincells i translated your exchange to make it more polite and less brain damaging chadwicke reeperthat accursed chad is there no end to his schemes good day to you i would like to extend an invitation to a feast at my manor we will have a grand old time i eagerly await your response faithful fiona forgive my bluntness but i must say that it is blatantly clear that you did not read my profile chadwicke reeper i would like to rebut that statement i have read your profile and despite your claims i still believe you would enjoy yourself at my gathering surely you are interested faithful fiona you most certainly did not otherwise you would have seen that im in a relationship and i am very faithful to my lover you are either a liar or an imbecile chadwicke reeper i am neither dishonest or dense but i must point out that it is rather hypocritical for you to call me an imbecile all the while you fail to realize that i am asking you to be a bit more adventurous surely you would find a thrill in being just a bit naughty and less than faithful to your other im a young rich gentleman of good blood and my manor is among the finest throughout the land why not come for the thrill and have some fun faithful fiona oh i beg your pardon then i could not have possibly realized what a complete and utter scoundrel you are spits i bid you a good day
creepyPMs,removed,yeah it also sounds like hes having conversations with his self a lot of these texts are pretty disjointed which could be a sign of underlying mental health issues
creepyPMs,removed,why wont she just talk to mr
creepyPMs,removed,anyone else think the response was over the top
creepyPMs,removed,is the pm really creepier than publicly announcing how horny you are or sharing your sex toy purchase with a bunch of unsuspecting people
creepyPMs,removed,geez just block his ass
creepyPMs,removed,if youre grading fairly and actually going from to is pretty damn good thats marriage material would be the most disgusting person out there who shits themselves and then digs in it and licks their fingers being a girl that you have no feelings either way about not hot but not ugly either is a fucking stunning supermodel who is also rich and likes to fuck for a regular guy is very good attractive but gettable not so attractive that you constantly have other dudes hitting on her right in front of you cool to hang out with but you still get in arguments sometimes and want to choke her out for being a bitch
creepyPMs,removed,he should be admired for his effort at least
creepyPMs,removed,i kinda think youre both creepy
creepyPMs,removed,it sounds like he has a mental disability
creepyPMs,removed,and yet she has them stored in her phone and doesnt block them
creepyPMs,removed,isnt attention the main reason you are posting those and nog you are shaming them classy
creepyPMs,removed,please share with me why you find this creepy i would merely consider it rude and poorly mannered unnecessary behavior but i fail to see how it is creepy this is merely my personal interpretation and i am looking for someone to share their opinion on it
creepyPMs,removed,seriously i was very clearly trying to avoid breaching rule two i just wanted their opinion
creepyPMs,removed,rpokemongonsfw never fear the power of reddit is here
creepyPMs,removed,lol so youre a fucking whore that posts on rgonewild and you think you can shame men for making sexualised comments maybe dont be a whore then
creepyPMs,removed,new sub very weird pms
creepyPMs,removed,confused thats a comment not a pm was the pm a picture of the comment without context because that is indeed weird
creepyPMs,removed,he was trying to make a very odd game of thrones joke less creepy and just cringe honestly
creepyPMs,removed,say hello to creepypms is like the lamest burn ever
creepyPMs,removed,youre a little late with your removal
creepyPMs,removed,i think ive said k
creepyPMs,removed,this is the worst photoshop attempt i have seen in quite some time
creepyPMs,removed,i would of done it
creepyPMs,removed,this is clearly photoshopped how is no one else seeing this its not even photoshopped well lmao
creepyPMs,removed,honestly sounded like he started trolling halfway through and instead of ignoring or blocking him you kept feeding right into it if he was being a creepy douchebag after the first two denials i dont know what you expected after half a dozen more
creepyPMs,removed,lol nobody deserves to be assaulted sweet tits
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know what alternate universe hes from where lesbians are meh i thought straight guys thinking all the cool girls were gay was as universal as straight girls thinking all the nice guys were gay then again i just hang around lots of gay people 𝓱𝓾𝓱 𝓲 𝔀𝓸𝓷𝓭𝓮𝓻 𝔀𝓱𝔂 so maybe the straight people i know tend to just have gayer than average personalities if that makes sense
creepyPMs,removed,of course there isnt a genetic correlation between personality and sexual orientation but if youve spent any time at all in the queer community youd know that queer people tend to have certain shared traits it has nothing to do with anything innate and everything to do with shared life experience and selfselection bias but its still a thing the same way that women having longer hair on average than men is a thing despite there being no real reason for it
creepyPMs,removed,im about sure this dude is in the closet
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know if men here are totally effeminated or too lack experience to see whats going on but this girl is obviously an attention whore i have never seen a man reject a girl that was interested in him in such a patronising and demeaning way everyone that encourages and agrees to women like this dont deserve any better i dont care how you look or what gender you are if you treat people like this you are trash
creepyPMs,removed,update your phone damnit
creepyPMs,removed,that ombre look aint working lmao
creepyPMs,removed,he made one good point though you told him to leave you alone as if you were uninterested in further conversation then he says something to get the last word and then you acknowledge that and reply againa nd the conversation continues life is easier when you just ignore toxic people online
creepyPMs,removed,ive seen that troll karissas pics and all i can say is hahahahahaha and dave looks like an overweight redneck pot bellied pig with a big wad of chewing tobacco
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,he said i dont know if men here are totally effeminated or too lack experience to see whats going on but this girl is obviously an attention whore i have never seen a man reject a girl that was interested in him in such a patronising and demeaning way everyone that encourages and agrees to women like this dont deserve any better i dont care how you look or what gender you are if you treat people like this you are trash what a jackass
creepyPMs,removed,hes so hostile towards gay people and so afraid of being called gay
creepyPMs,removed,how am i vilifying gay people this guy is obviously incredibly homophobic so i am pointing out that he seems like hes trying to overcompensate it was a joke relax dude its reddit
creepyPMs,removed,sorry its just that thats whats worked for me i think conversations like this are exactly why most people dont respond at all even with not interested it just gives these attention starved people an outlet to latch onto and they are usually not nice
creepyPMs,removed,there are a lot of examples of this happening in society like ted haggard and possibly omar mateen not always the case of course but it does happen
creepyPMs,removed,im just saying that it is a common trope and people will u understand it relax i am not your enemy i am not the slightest bit homophobic i am just a dude who put a comment on reddit
creepyPMs,removed,first of all it is clearly not ops fault that she was creeped on that is on the guy who started the creeping however towards the end she had an opportunity to just ignore one last insult from a narcissistic creeper who just had to get the last word in and leave but she chose instead to prolong something that was obviously uncomfortable for her by continuing to respond to and feed the creep am i insane here or is that not what happened
creepyPMs,removed,you are freaking out way too much about something so small i dont care enough to continue
creepyPMs,removed,wtf lmao
creepyPMs,removed,not that continuing after you said to stop was okay but if youre posting your boobs online you surely have to know some pervert is going to comment or message you wouldnt it be better to just not respond
creepyPMs,removed,understandable ive posted photos in turtle necks and havent gotten the same result but i dont have the big boob problem so i dont have that pov im just saying if youre posting photos of your boobs op isnt in a turtle neck you have to know that some weirdo is going to come out and comment on it why not just report them like you said you were going to giving them the satisfaction of being acknowledged doesnt do any good its the whole concept of dont feed the trolls idk thats just how i see it even when i see my friends reply multiple times to creeps i dont understand it its almost like they like the attention but dont want it to come off that way so they respond negatively im not saying thats the case with op just what ive seen in the past
creepyPMs,removed,im not trying to criticize im sorry its come off that way im genuinely wondering from my past of being creeped on i find that if you dont replyjust report them it tends to be dealt with a lot quicker
creepyPMs,removed,yeah im guessing he escalated too quickly cause otherwise the picture and not the idiotic way in which he presented it could have been somewhat effective cheers and good luck finding a decent non creep dick holder
creepyPMs,removed,definitely different but i kinda like the originality
creepyPMs,removed,in my opinion if you have great tits you should be able to show them off while youre young enough without having others be disgusting about it and i can vouch for the turtleneck thing i have a big chest so its obvious in anything i wear
creepyPMs,removed,sorry but this is less creepy and just more funny i laughed pretty hard
creepyPMs,removed,how is this creepypms material
creepyPMs,removed,he was the jewish shrewish
creepyPMs,removed,satanfister you say i think we can work something out
creepyPMs,removed,hes like telling everybody
creepyPMs,removed,wow that was extremely rapey did you report this to the police
creepyPMs,removed,they please refrain from using problematic language such as this in the future
creepyPMs,removed,out of interest was the full stop a response to the lame youre gorgeous opener or do you text like that
creepyPMs,removed,this kid sounds super autistic it feels weird to be making fun of him but somebody in a position of careauthority should be explaining one or two things to him thats for sure
creepyPMs,removed,idk whats creepy about this you telling some guy off doesnt really qualify
creepyPMs,removed,ufuckswithducks
creepyPMs,removed,gross indeed i hate mobile reddit
creepyPMs,removed,holy fuck people like you really do exist
creepyPMs,removed,guy trying to flirt on a dating site and you try to call him rapey idk kinda shitty
creepyPMs,removed,im not saying the guy deserved any respect he was annoying and needed to be shut down but bringing he word rape into it is completely unnecessary and id understand why it would piss somebody off what a shitty mindset to have seriously he was trying to be cute not saying you need to respect that but he wasnt forcing himself on her notice that he didnt keep going after she made it clear that she wasnt playing when she said no lots of people flirt by giving a quick lolno btw so i can understand how one might get confused
creepyPMs,removed,men seem to care just fine that they are actual peoplei think they understand that women are actual people
creepyPMs,removed,actually quick google found him i can message you his name if you want
creepyPMs,removed,i kind of did have a chuckle at the part where the lady said that she was constipated and dr pervert said that she was full of shit
creepyPMs,removed,thats kind of a sexist thing to say but whatever every man is the same right
creepyPMs,removed,i searched dr zyx xyz on google on found the same document with the name of the creepy doctor on it maybe you should black out dr zyx xyz too
creepyPMs,removed,it varies
creepyPMs,removed,first really creepy stuff ive seen here in a long long time
creepyPMs,removed,of course this was hilarious and the guy was a total creep but i dont understand why people upload pics of themselves or people they know to subs like gw
creepyPMs,removed,guess ill not be commenting here again then considering how quickly the users of this sub assume things downvote me to hell guys
creepyPMs,removed,how has no one asked this so far links to go pics
creepyPMs,removed,so in my best please dont downvote me in to oblivion or flag me or remove me from your comment section voice i would like to ask where the creepiness was here maybe he was a tad forward by asking you out without getting to know you but as far as i can tell he was being friendly and you reciprocated and then he sort of asked you out is that creepy was it the medium in which he asked that was creepy he was polite you were polite and he said or did nothing sexual or ask for pics or anything again im asking because i dont get it im not saying youre wrong im just confused
creepyPMs,removed,dont be a prude let your ass and ballsack hang freely
creepyPMs,removed,this guy want harassing anyone and was crazy polite if anything your weird and angry responses and sending pictures of your ass is the creepy part
creepyPMs,removed,and theres the context i think we were missing i can see how that might have come off a bit creepy i will say i dont know which way he would have gone if youd continued to talk to him but if you felt creeped out then it is totally your right to stop talking to him i just thought it was maybe a friend of a friend or something not some rando from a fb craigs list add thanks for bothering to clear that up makes much more sense now
creepyPMs,removed,could you explain the context of hisher comment
creepyPMs,removed,not yours dude your wifes gw pics
creepyPMs,removed,i hope im not violating any rules by asking this but is this really creepy if you post on a nude subreddit ppl get the implication that you enjoy posting nudes if someone asks for more but isnt persistent about it couldnt you just say yesno and then how they proceed after that determines harassment im not trying to victim blame or anything just better understand the situation if this was a dick pic id see the creepy but this guy didnt really do anything that bad to me but if im wrong id like to understand why thank you in advance
creepyPMs,removed,call me oldfashioned but i kinda agree with creeperposting pics of your wife on gonewild is indeed imo an invitation to creepy pm s
creepyPMs,removed,but this guy wasnt really creepy lets see some of the other creeps
creepyPMs,removed,creepy from him but cringe from you
creepyPMs,removed,i am actually curious to see what your ass looks like how could he not notice the balls
creepyPMs,removed,how will you feel when he does this to someone else because you didnt stop him now
creepyPMs,removed,i know the guy was creepy and get your point but what do you really expect if you post pictures of your wife on reddit
creepyPMs,removed,i feel bad for the next person he does this to
creepyPMs,removed,its fucked up to imply that there is an element of blame but theres definitely a causeeffect relationship between posting and getting creepy pms
creepyPMs,removed,the poster says hes autistic on his main account mystery solved everyone
creepyPMs,removed,the only reason men ever hit on women in person is because they look good clothed if you look good naked and a guy and if you are geographically near him its essentially the equivalent of average irl flirting only that most of the time the woman in question thinks its creepy because they cant see whether or not the guy is hot which determines whether or not average flirting is creepy or not irl
creepyPMs,removed,so is that a no to threesomes or
creepyPMs,removed,you post to rgonewild a lot lol
creepyPMs,removed,i do wonder why almost all of your posts are just creepypms
creepyPMs,removed,is old enough to not fall for this
creepyPMs,removed,i was thinking the same thing i am one of those asshole cousins
creepyPMs,removed,load more images why would you keep this going for like messages
creepyPMs,removed,well maybe you shouldnt have posted an insulting picture of trump and expected everyone to respond with love and kindness hmm theres a thought
creepyPMs,removed,show some respect it must be doubly exhausting to be ashamed of
creepyPMs,removed,of course not
creepyPMs,removed,uhh no
creepyPMs,removed,ufuckingwhitemale
creepyPMs,removed,lets get a count of how many people who post in this thread also get creepy pms from thedonald subs current count
creepyPMs,removed,jesus dont let this be your view of everyone on that sub they are mostly memers this is just a severe case of ones inability to be properly social
creepyPMs,removed,this will be unpopular but i was kinda rooting for him after a while
creepyPMs,removed,charge your fucking phone
creepyPMs,removed,not just americans all the cretins in the world who go out and destroy cities beat people up call the white race racist wear vagina hats and burqas because thats empowering to women etcall because trump is the new us president
creepyPMs,removed,ugh this is not rcreepypms material
creepyPMs,removed,its cool to make fun of his skin colour
creepyPMs,removed,im pretty sure that if you message to the mods of td with this whoever did this will be banned its dickish behavior not an accurate representation of that community just saying
creepyPMs,removed,i doubt this happened
creepyPMs,removed,lol honestly that was a good come back
creepyPMs,removed,yeah thats what you call a degenerate unfortunately you cant get rid of them theyre just kind of their like burrs stuck to your shoes everyone else is nice though
creepyPMs,removed,what did he say that shows he molests people
creepyPMs,removed,in the future if you need to print it out and jerk off to it
creepyPMs,removed,are you comparing fraud to hillary using her emails and foundation to commit exhortion on political figures and accept bribes while putting classified documents at risk
creepyPMs,removed,what a stupid thing to say
creepyPMs,removed,obama literally just signed the worlds rights away to the nsa days ago and you are worried about trump being a fascist
creepyPMs,removed,pretty clearly can see the guys screen name user fuckingwhitemale
creepyPMs,removed,post the quote please because how i have seen it he never said that he said there are women who will let him grab their pussies because he is rich but i dont think he actually said anything about consent
creepyPMs,removed,weve got the creepiest pms dont we folks fake news
creepyPMs,removed,is that creepy oh boy that shit is normal talk on should i feel afraid after a kid on xbox threatens to kill me and rape my mother
creepyPMs,removed,its the best favorite subreddit tbh
creepyPMs,removed,ill grab a woman by the pussy i cant be president now
creepyPMs,removed,video or it didnt happen of him grabbing womens pussies
creepyPMs,removed,it was just humorous illustration of how many people are still agitated
creepyPMs,removed,i would like to know what makes you think that
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair if you go into any sub and disagree with their main shit youre gonna provoke all sorts of people im thinking this is on you op yup im victimblaming
creepyPMs,removed,well at least most of us can represent ourselves better than that thats pathetic no matter the topic
creepyPMs,removed,hopefully your year old does and hopefully your two year old gets run over by a truck and have thier brains and guts spilled all over the street and you cry over the sight with your liberal tears
creepyPMs,removed,look i might not be a girl but i did name my penis delilah so technically
creepyPMs,removed,it makes the law questionable
creepyPMs,removed,guys like this is just out to harm you with words its nothing special really he just doesnt have any limit on what he is going to say and he is mad so what you are going to get is some really fucked up shit just dont take it seriously no one would say that to you in real life
creepyPMs,removed,proof that could be a set up
creepyPMs,removed,i read this quote times how does this proves hes a molester
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,i wish i was rich
creepyPMs,removed,there are some pretty stupid fucking people here on planet earth anywhere you go youll see we have not moved an inch from the slime that spawned us
creepyPMs,removed,lol trump fraud settle down shill im not even an avid trump supporter but theres far more beef on hillary for comitting fraud
creepyPMs,removed,not sure what one would expect by going to a cult sub and shitposting there its like going to an antifa protest swinging a swastika flag
creepyPMs,removed,i thought he was a contentious race and the hive is the hive is the hive and the results are kicking in pretty hard
creepyPMs,removed,this looks like a troll who just got exactly what he wanted
creepyPMs,removed,bullshit you guys are so anti trump you make shit up to attack him his policies should be enough to crucify him but you extreme leftists call everything offensive both far sides are absolutely retarded find a middle ground and do whats actually good for everyone instead we have extreme right and extreme left in a pissing contest i hate trump but i also dont think everything he says is racist or offensive the left gets triggered to easily and the right is just blind to trumps policies they just want to win and feel special everybody has to grow the fuck up and see that both sides are way to extreme
creepyPMs,removed,seems like a troll feeding the troll you are
creepyPMs,removed,you intentionally poke the bee hive with a stick and then you complain when you get stung about how nasty those bees are maybe dont troll their sub with some dumb gif if you dont like the abuse
creepyPMs,removed,i was told to die in a pm after talking about how much i hate the media and their hyperbole i was defending trumpso they assumed i was a trump supporter
creepyPMs,removed,i think some original insults would be more effective than mimicry
creepyPMs,removed,well reddit is essentially a hub of triggered cucks its to be expected
creepyPMs,removed,i personally prefer to have a president that has molested women it shows that hes not afraid to break the law to get things done
creepyPMs,removed,thats not very nice to say youre assuming my reading level is bad like my black friends you shouldnt assume such things
creepyPMs,removed,we dont know if they consented all we know is he didnt any anything about consent hence its legal
creepyPMs,removed,are the people on reddit this fucking dumb its an obvious troll lol if the jerk off on ur picture later wasnt a giveway enough
creepyPMs,removed,this is true but mods not enforcing sitewide rules can get a sub quarantined or banned
creepyPMs,removed,im being serious here and your just fucking around wtf it takes alot of smarts to be able to find loopholes and break the law without being charged i wish i was smart as trump but im not thats why hes president and im not
creepyPMs,removed,can we see the picture we need to determine if its jizz worthy
creepyPMs,removed,oh ew why do i have to get lumped in with this
creepyPMs,removed,when youre a star they let you do it let you do it sounds an awful lot like consent to me i really dont think you can call consensual sexual contact assault is it indicative of disrespectful treatment of women very possibly does it constitute sexual assault by definition it cannot
creepyPMs,removed,not saying your dumb like my black friends but just not smart im just trying to be real with you on the internet and not be politically correct wouldnt you molest a girl if you find a loophole somehow like groping girls at a crowded concert etc
creepyPMs,removed,i can read you know you keep assuming im dumb like my black friends for some reason i did read the quote
creepyPMs,removed,this is the best i could come up with
creepyPMs,removed,well if you go in hard with a gif of trump jacking off a virtual dick you have kind of raised the bar to that level already you cant troll and then be upset about copping flack back thats not in the rulebook at all thats kind of the whole point of trolling rustling jimmies while not being upset yourself oh and by the way im one of those weirdos and i have never pmd anyone notalltrumpsupporters
creepyPMs,removed,i see i try my best to not let morals get in my way of living thats why i love trump so much i feel like hes like me and to be honest if he does ends up using the white house to become richer he deserves it i wouldnt mind in fact i would encourage it
creepyPMs,removed,i would have ignored him
creepyPMs,removed,dick pills are a helluva drug
creepyPMs,removed,im just replying to the guy above who acted like exploiting loopholes was bad its not illegal if you dont get caught right plus i keep saying im not dumb like my stupid black friends god
creepyPMs,removed,you must feel so proud of yourself you really accomplished alot whatever will he do with gasp negative kharma
creepyPMs,removed,im not a donald supporter in anyway im a canadian that would have voted bernie but im also not stupid this looks like the work of a shill
creepyPMs,removed,a lefty on rnews told me that gang rapea of german girls was a price worth paying if it saved refugees you are not alone
creepyPMs,removed,i understand so what you have to do is if your loophole is hurting other pretty asian girls then what you have to do is identify what makes you feel guilty and to truly convince yourself that you are not doing anything wrong then after a while you keep groping them and not feel guilty over time you ill get used to it just keep reminding yourself that other peoples feeling dont matter only yours and about the racist someone said something about being dumb and i was just trying to show you that not everyone is dumb like those black people theres alot of diversity in our society these days so not everyone is dumb
creepyPMs,removed,please dont assume were all like this
creepyPMs,removed,not everyone there is a creepy fuck like that guy also what was the rest of the context that you left out
creepyPMs,removed,assholes are everywhere unfortunately is a human thing
creepyPMs,removed,am i reading this wrong didnt you first call the guy a rag
creepyPMs,removed,we are talking about a year old thats a person at a brink of maturity someone who can work someone who could already operate motor vehicles for a few years someone who is in the process of deciding their entire future finishing high school its not or the ages when you are half kid and your hormones are off and its not even about sex just creepy messages
creepyPMs,removed,pretty sure theyre just trolling and to be honest its beautiful
creepyPMs,removed,lol is this guys username seriously ufuckingwhitemale clearly a troll thats trying too hard to be one
creepyPMs,removed,swedish trump supporter here op on behalf of td i am deeply sorry for the messages you recieved i personally find this behaviour shocking and appaling and unacceptable to say the least im certain that the vast majority of people over at td would condemn this behaviour
creepyPMs,removed,their guy winning doesnt mean anything for them or anyone in their social class they feel like there should be some payoff but nothing yeah not having your country filled with muslims and mexicans is totally nothing
creepyPMs,removed,temporarily embarrassed millionaires the lot of em you should read that quote again it was a critique of socialists in america not the other way around this is one of the best examples of marxists taking things out of context and using it as their propaganda
creepyPMs,removed,hey my comments or the person replying to me i still see my comments
creepyPMs,removed,can i just say that he doesnt represent us there are people like him but mostly were pretty respectful
creepyPMs,removed,not really the leader of the womens march is a muslim american woman who unironically advocates for shariah law in america so those facts arent really alternative theyre just facts you dont like to face
creepyPMs,removed,thanks for the reply understood
creepyPMs,removed,i meant to reply to the post where op posted additional screenshots
creepyPMs,removed,or is it people who think the pms posted arent real naw that cant be
creepyPMs,removed,how about go fuck yourself
creepyPMs,removed,they sound perfect for each other
creepyPMs,removed,how isnt it winning exactly abortion gag order muslims banned today later today he will sign an executive order for the construction of the wall how more winning can you take honestly
creepyPMs,removed,a literal fascist but i bet you wouldnt mind a literal communist right why though why is that communism in russia alone ended up killing times as many people as all fascism combined not to mention communism in other places such as china so why do you hate fascism and not communism why is ok that every university is infected by these marxist parasites but the moment someone mentions fascism you lose your shit
creepyPMs,removed,and this doesnt violate rule
creepyPMs,removed,for some reason i read all his replies with an indian accent
creepyPMs,removed,this screenshot is a false flag
creepyPMs,removed,its false flag
creepyPMs,removed,its a false flag attack
creepyPMs,removed,its a false flag attack
creepyPMs,removed,its a false flag attack
creepyPMs,removed,its a false flag attack
creepyPMs,removed,its a false flag attack
creepyPMs,removed,op this guy makes you out to seem very pretty
creepyPMs,removed,same with renoughtrumpspam rsocialism rlatestagecapitalism and a few other political subs you want to get called a fascist and banned just drop on in and disagree with one of em
creepyPMs,removed,hahahahahahah
creepyPMs,removed,thats op saying triggered they did a bad job censoring their name equally cringy if youre going around other subs trying to troll people
creepyPMs,removed,holy shit this is awesome
creepyPMs,removed,hey we arent all like that youre the ones always talking about not all muslims tolerant left yeah right youre the ones always harassing trump supporters trying to bully us into having the same opinion as you whatever libtard hope you enjoy your maga
creepyPMs,removed,it technically isnt brigading if the post was found from rall
creepyPMs,removed,the whole purpose of rthedonald is to shitpost and support trump which is why any posts not supporting him are deleted if people want actual discussions they can go to raskthedonald
creepyPMs,removed,thats excessively ignorant of you
creepyPMs,removed,its about people standing around watching as their country gets fucked
creepyPMs,removed,as we know one all thats how i know everyone in this sub is a faggot like op
creepyPMs,removed,i wont link to his profile but this guy is ironically a frequent poster in rnofap
creepyPMs,removed,umm arent you being pretty creepy as well
creepyPMs,removed,i honestly could not tell who the baddy was in that exchange that are both as bad as each other
creepyPMs,removed,whining about what
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair we dont know what was said before this op could be throwing equal amounts of shade
creepyPMs,removed,holy shit are you that incapable of looking at it from an unbiased point of view he literally said it verbatim from both sides and you jump straight to rape and death threats which are on the far far end of the spectrum and do come from both sides this is the fucking problem you are the problem you actually jumped straight to rape and death threats from one of the most unbiased comments on this site
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,our president won we arent that mad like the lot of you on reddit
creepyPMs,removed,its not just thedonald the left and the right both have a bunch of immature assholes
creepyPMs,removed,just curious op provided the name of the creep in the comments does that not break the subs and reddits rules
creepyPMs,removed,what did you say before he pmd you
creepyPMs,removed,is it really fair to generalize about the entire population of people subbed there
creepyPMs,removed,the same is true the other way though lots of people assume just because someone voted trump or dares to agree with anything hes said means they have a raging trump hardon
creepyPMs,removed,so you and your snapchat friend get into it and now youre generalizing this behavior of one edgy year old retard to a whole subreddit 🤔🤔😒
creepyPMs,removed,visualized everything was bertstarejpg at first then lold op how does it feel having your pic ejaculated on honor horror
creepyPMs,removed,so just to be clear its required by rcreepypms that any identifying information in the submission itself be redacted ☼ remove all identifying info including pictures names or pictures that will not identify the creep are okay when in doubt block it out but its okay to go ahead and identify the creep in the comments
creepyPMs,removed,op posted such a comment in this thread curious as to why the submission wasnt nuked and op banned
creepyPMs,removed,sorry you caught a bad pede thats really disgusting
creepyPMs,removed,there are nutjobs on both sides you got a real winner there
creepyPMs,removed,im sure its not what the lynch mob wants to hear but as a frequent poster over there we encounter these types with frequency many believe they are bots or troll accounts
creepyPMs,removed,wouldnt you say the damage has already been done though i would think youd lock the thread at the very least and ban op from posting here in the future to discourage this behavior
creepyPMs,removed,their mod pmd me asking me if i liked guys grossed me out
creepyPMs,removed,again just to be clear its ok to identify the creep and subject them to harassment as long as the information is removed from the thread because its still very easily visible in ops profile at some point in the future
creepyPMs,removed,its fake just fyi
creepyPMs,removed,you mean on the post you made where you were intentionally breaking their subreddits rules and trying to bother others
creepyPMs,removed,i just came here to say plug your phone in and turn your battery percentage on how do people walk around not knowing how much life their battery has left i am very disturbed by this
creepyPMs,removed,looks like op cant take their own medicine
creepyPMs,removed,td cucks getting triggered always makes me laugh out loud
creepyPMs,removed,pretty sure this breaks reddits rules on vote manipulation
creepyPMs,removed,im one of those stupid people who voted for trump tell me please enlightened one how it feels to be so intelligent
creepyPMs,removed,if you want to impress me get a creepy pm from rwholesomemes this is low hanging fruit and youre both cunts
creepyPMs,removed,lol all these comments removed for calling this out as bs this will just be another enjoy controlling whatever narrative your trying to mods lmao trump is still americas president time to maga or sit down
creepyPMs,removed,its onisionspeaks have fun hes awful
creepyPMs,removed,im just going to assume this is some beef between two teenagers if either of you are older than then this is truly sad and i hope yall get some help
creepyPMs,removed,banned
creepyPMs,removed,oh thats nothing compared to the hate they receive on a daily basis
creepyPMs,removed,think that is bad you should see the nice friendly messages i get from leftists in my pms death wishes and all
creepyPMs,removed,liberals are super angry all the time tho
creepyPMs,removed,couldnt care less
creepyPMs,removed,just like at td
creepyPMs,removed,how do we know this isnt fake
creepyPMs,removed,rgoodfakepms
creepyPMs,removed,how retarded
creepyPMs,removed,theres a reason rcreepypms suggests you use a throwaway account to submit postsits in the sidebar multiple times
creepyPMs,removed,im glad you asked many other subs do not allow references to other subs because of brigading the same reason why the mods removed a comment referencing another sub in this thread
creepyPMs,removed,these russian trolls are sociopaths they need to be reported
creepyPMs,removed,fuck you fucking cowards
creepyPMs,removed,triggered umad sounds like someones butthurt
creepyPMs,removed,your battery life triggered me i bet you ride on empty and coast into the station dont you you sob triggered
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think that its fair to judge an entire subreddit based on a few users who decided to send shitty messages
creepyPMs,removed,admitting to starting immature discussions with immature people then attempting to doxx said douche bags is why a lot of people dont take most liberals seriously the submission shouldnt be considered a creepypm either most people associate creepy pms with some deranged perverted and or psychotic person deliberately trying to get your attention in hopes of meeting in person this post is just straight up arguing and trying to piss each other off aka trolling but its against rtd on reddit and submitted by a uplantvagina so the legitimacy checks out im sure if you go any further left youll just end up in russia
creepyPMs,removed,the guy in the post did nothing wrong and i support him fuck you ban me please
creepyPMs,removed,fuck you
creepyPMs,removed,every group has its share of idiots i can assure you we arent all like that
creepyPMs,removed,theyre just high on the internet and do this to try and shut him up
creepyPMs,removed,dae feel these people have been waiting by their confederate flags to pounce finally a candidate that says its ok to degrade women and call black people niggers because their toothless cousins who raped their brother taught them that this is how the world is supposed to be
creepyPMs,removed,theres just as many nice people in renoughtrumpspam it just depends on who you want to antagonize
creepyPMs,removed,taunts people gets taunted back somehow thinks the winners are triggered kek
creepyPMs,removed,oh wow an internet argument between two stupid people never seen that before
creepyPMs,removed,lol never even gave me a chance to prove it not that it matters anything i say youll claim as fake news because thats your political position
creepyPMs,removed,i guess youre right the same way rihanna beyonce etc all of these are funny clowns when they bleach their skin
creepyPMs,removed,can we see the first half of this lol
creepyPMs,removed,you know what bothers me about this why do you reply if they were such a bother to you and so creepy you have the power to stop yet you dont
creepyPMs,removed,im not sure which one is supposed to be the creepy one
creepyPMs,removed,what the fuck is a mantrum
creepyPMs,removed,he was probably just super concerned if you have terrible back pain
creepyPMs,removed,i would feel proud if someone would jerk off to my picture it means hes without a girlfriend and im hot op wins this one bigly
creepyPMs,removed,you are both idiots
creepyPMs,removed,go fuck yourself
creepyPMs,removed,i know its against the site rules but imo those whishing for your kid to be raped or killed shouldnt had their names removed everyone should know who those sick fucks are
creepyPMs,removed,some people are just so creepy they dont even deserve to have their name scratched out
creepyPMs,removed,discussing the topic you lost you knew the rules you lost theres no discussion to be had but ridicule of a bunch of entitled crybabies who cant handle not having it their way you lost you wont accept it we have nothing to discuss
creepyPMs,removed,fuck thats hilarious guys a savage
creepyPMs,removed,didnt you originally go to their sub and try to trollbait ya sure these are over the top but what were your original intentions did you truly make the original post thinking nothing would backlash if you really didnt think youd get any negative initial feedback then congrats youve never dealt with keyboard warrior internet trolls til today
creepyPMs,removed,do you really believe they wish death on a year old
creepyPMs,removed,its an actual fetish so i personally dont understand the insulting part nor do i understand the fetish for the record its just another derogatory meme that makes people who use it look really stupid unless they are referring to someone who is in fact a cuckold buuuut chances are most of the people saying cuck dont even know what cuckold is or that the term exists they seem legit threatened by it or something idk i really dont understand the purpose of the insult since most legit cucks are going to be very private about that info and most people arent cucks so imo its like telling me im albino super rare but im not though i guess with how pale i am it makes more sense than the tossing of the word cuck
creepyPMs,removed,trump is legally the president which means america lost stay salty loser see ya in years
creepyPMs,removed,did you seriously think people in this sub were intelligent and mature i mean come on
creepyPMs,removed,you arent helping with those kind of comments though you shouldnt just lump together an entire group of people like that
creepyPMs,removed,you should charge your phone
creepyPMs,removed,lets not pretend that the donald doesnt have a theredpill heritage
creepyPMs,removed,that sucks mate
creepyPMs,removed,isnt his junk pretty small im surprised some people arent even ashamed to send pics like these when their rod looks so short
creepyPMs,removed,this has to be a troll people like this cant really exist in real life
creepyPMs,removed,why would you send a year old dude any picture
creepyPMs,removed,pretty respectful if you ask mehe wished you the best of luck though he did mention curvy women and didnt completely flip out but hey you do you
creepyPMs,removed,i think both parties of this conversation come off creepy
creepyPMs,removed,hold on how did you know he didnt just want a polite conversation his initiale messages look fine to me
creepyPMs,removed,i mean you are kind of sending very contradicting messages lol you said you dont want a relationship and enjoy being single then you say youre not there to be fetished of objectified but you also have sent them multiple pictures so exactly wtf are you doing on that service lol
creepyPMs,removed,both of these people arent listening to each other
creepyPMs,removed,man things like this make me want to be a women just getting creepy pms and then sending them to their family members
creepyPMs,removed,that is the tiniest dick ive ever seen
creepyPMs,removed,he had a regret and apologized a decent thing to do dont see what was sexual about what he said
creepyPMs,removed,i got bored with it and read it in my mind like rick and morty wubbbalubbadubdub peace bitches
creepyPMs,removed,that guy is clearly a weird loser however i have to ask why did you keep on engaging with him thats what i dont understand about this sub
creepyPMs,removed,sorry that was actually a genuine question but i guess the second sentence gave my impressions off
creepyPMs,removed,i just made this reddit acc to ask are you ddd
creepyPMs,removed,i get that this guy maybe went about it the wrong way but i also get why he wouldnt want to be friends being friends with someone you have feelings for can just be painful and make those feelings worse
creepyPMs,removed,in his defence thats something that would make me feel bad for a few years i dunno maybe he was being nice but i think there was certainly an element of maybe we could hook upget back together
creepyPMs,removed,even if hes being a massive dimwit you shouldnt try to contact his family about it s
creepyPMs,removed,i find what this guy is doing perfectly reasonable his advances got rejected so he just packed up and left he didnt throw a fit to stay friends with someone who rejected you is a recipe for pain and the friend zone i know i definitely want to be friends with people im attracted to but i dont do it anymore because im emotionally honest with myself can you imagine becoming friends with someone and then they start dating someone it would be shitty im going to avoid that
creepyPMs,removed,im conflicted the situation sucks ass sure but isnt this a lot better than him continuing on pretending to be friendly to try and get a relationship out of it the internet is full of people telling others to screw up their courage and ask about a relationship if thats what the want not to just float around as friend if thats not what they want we tell them if its not there just move on based on that it seems like the guy did the right thing but the fact that it comes off unpleasant cannot be denied all in all just a yucky situation not sure if creepy but definitely yucky
creepyPMs,removed,the white club
creepyPMs,removed,this is going to be a very unpopular opinion but there was no need to be so offended by such a light joke this is not a creepy dm its just a joke that didnt vibe with you
creepyPMs,removed,hes obviously just a teenaged internet troll best to laugh and move on
creepyPMs,removed,op you were being a bitch go fuck yourself
creepyPMs,removed,i think youre taking a childs internet trolling too seriously the police would laugh at this message
creepyPMs,removed,when he was sure of it he promptly moved on to be clear im friends with plenty of people i initially had romantic feelings for i was able to reframe the way i thought of them but if i was unable to reframe how i thought of them i would never string myself along its a problem with circumstance not anything the girl should take personally similarly what if your girlfriend told you she wanted to open up your relationship and not break up but see other people this happened to me once as well is it wrong for me to not want to be apart of that because its emotionally not what i want is it wrong for me to throw away an otherwise perfectly good relationship to protect my own feelings and not be such a doormat how is this any different he clearly doesnt think less of the person shes the one that took it personally
creepyPMs,removed,can i showask you something
creepyPMs,removed,what do you do for fun that was uncalled for an inappropriate ummm wtf i dont see where the guy on the left said anything at all wrong but the special snowflake bitch clearly needs to shut up and stop crapping all over people because she wants more attention for her thuper thpethial athexuality rolls eyes
creepyPMs,removed,or or he could be talking to a dyslexic pound girlwhich may not be a bad thing for a man in the restaurant biz in all seriousness though whatever it is his rationale sucks
creepyPMs,removed,can someone just post a tldr because pages of texts and an essay are a tad too much for me
creepyPMs,removed,yeah while theres a chance he did this friends are assholes when they have no repercussionshe may be telling the truthhis response gives me hope he is
creepyPMs,removed,well the bed wetting probably puts off a few people apologies if you really do that assuming the name is a joke
creepyPMs,removed,this isstupid theyre using the internet and easily search what theyre doing is illegal id just block them and never say a word to them this is obviously a desperate troll
creepyPMs,removed,i love it when two assholes unload on each other
creepyPMs,removed,yet there were no gonewild posts
creepyPMs,removed,bitch give me back my bad its mine
creepyPMs,removed,no but you can sit on this sword im about to jam up your goddamn careless evil ass its never funny to joke about shit like that fuck that guy not literally leave that up to big bubba
creepyPMs,removed,mr raper can you please report to the principals office whos he rape this time
creepyPMs,removed,wow and you actually broke up with him are you crazy
creepyPMs,removed,wow the retardation is strong with this one
creepyPMs,removed,do you really believe its not a joke
creepyPMs,removed,more suited for rcringepics
creepyPMs,removed,chuckling tho ayy
creepyPMs,removed,the dude is obviously a bit short on class but i think people here are being a little too hard on the guy
creepyPMs,removed,this has nothing to do with having a penis
creepyPMs,removed,hes not wrong hes just an asshole emotional comfort comes in all shapes and sizes this one is ill timed but has also been pulled on me when my mom passed im a guy and a girl asked to snuggle to comfort me i didnt want to be alone so being the sexually oblivious rhino i am i accepted ive learned from that snuggle is the girl version of netflix and chill we went out for years not the best basis for a relationship but i was definitely comforted sorry for your loss
creepyPMs,removed,yup just like others will feel he is wrong because they dont feel the same way it would be ignorant to think everyone feels the same and if they dont agree with you they are wrong
creepyPMs,removed,fair enough in all sincerity though i think people here might actually be overreacting a bit to what he said yes what he said was completely uncalled for but this strikes me as the kinda guy that if the roles were reversed would actually want this kind of offer in the midst of tragedy different people handle tragedy different ways i dunno sorry all for the bad pun hangovers make for short sighted judgement
creepyPMs,removed,wait is this unsolicited and random i know there are people into the whole extreme domsubslave thing and for them this type of thing from what i have seen isnt unusual
creepyPMs,removed,haha and you dated this person
creepyPMs,removed,downvoted just cuz hes a douche
creepyPMs,removed,your ex deserves a bullet in the head but that would be an insult to the gun that fires it it would be repulsive to wish death on someone who deserves far worse
creepyPMs,removed,seems like a caring guy
creepyPMs,removed,some people dont know how to separate reddit from reality this kind of fucked up shit is only funny on the internet when you dont know the grieving parties
creepyPMs,removed,rchargeyourphone
creepyPMs,removed,lmao that was hilarious absolute mad man
creepyPMs,removed,found the white knight
creepyPMs,removed,just curious why are you still talking to your ex i assume that you guys ended off on food terms and stayed friends
creepyPMs,removed,see edit
creepyPMs,removed,awww why did you guys break up
creepyPMs,removed,why would you inform your ex about this when he clearly doesnt even know who youre talking about
creepyPMs,removed,deathmust repopulate
creepyPMs,removed,i said what i said no reason to delete the comment and i dont really care about internet points anyway just wondering why people still love downvoting a mistake lol
creepyPMs,removed,that was funny
creepyPMs,removed,please elaborate
creepyPMs,removed,that man needs to be shot
creepyPMs,removed,ahhhhh he got you
creepyPMs,removed,hes just being thoughtful
creepyPMs,removed,yeah its easy to pile on this guy for what he said but we dont know the type of relationship they had perhaps they had a darker sense of humor and she just decided to get offended at this particular moment not really that creepy considering we dont know the context of their past communication op needs to lighten and probably take him up on his offer
creepyPMs,removed,if hes your ex why are you telling him
creepyPMs,removed,send that shit to his mother
creepyPMs,removed,well if theres anything i can do you know if you need a shoulder to cry on or a cock to sit on im always here
creepyPMs,removed,sometimes words of support is just the plain truth and sometimes those words of truth can just be inherently triggering yet without malice which is what my comment was but the subjectivety of the mods judgement has final say and that in itself is triggering to me this sub no longer feels like a safe space
creepyPMs,removed,hes probably on the autistic spectrum lack of compassion and all that
creepyPMs,removed,this is terrible a true gentleman would have offered his face for her to sit on
creepyPMs,removed,a stranger asked another stranger for sex in an insensitive manner in what way has this emotionally affect you
creepyPMs,removed,fucking awesome bropoints
creepyPMs,removed,yeah it doesnt look like he was trying to be nice it looks like hes a morally depraved douchebag with poor impulse control trying to get it in by any means possible on the same page of ops history it seems like the same dude tried get with her the day after he had a child with a diff woman i think the jury is in op your ex seems like a horrible person time to stop communicating and move on
creepyPMs,removed,oh yeah of course man i use the term loosely is a massive cunt
creepyPMs,removed,that was a good laugh didnt expect it haha
creepyPMs,removed,you miss of the shots you dont take no seriously hes a dick
creepyPMs,removed,why women on all those screenshots keep replying to creepers when i dont want to talk with someone i just block them after first message its just such a waste of time
creepyPMs,removed,i never understand how these conversations go on so long i am like i dont want to talk to you block
creepyPMs,removed,are people not aware of the block function why tolerate it astonishing
creepyPMs,removed,thats not all you did this is a fucking pathetic and obnoxious thing to message someone but you specifically suggested that you carry all these traits guy
creepyPMs,removed,i dont find this too ridiculous sometimes you get drunkhigh and you cant help where your attractions take you im a straight man who has been hit on by a gay guy before and i was a bit uncomfortable but i didnt hold it against him i feel like he has the right to try
creepyPMs,removed,just so you know hes not desperate
creepyPMs,removed,is the guy who messaged you in any shape way or form handsome now dont get me wrong i definitely see the creepiness in here but i cant help to think if the guy was some brad pitt looking dude this would be a dominating and flirtatious man instead of creepy
creepyPMs,removed,why do you even respond
creepyPMs,removed,there were several really great amazing opportunities there to just stop replying
creepyPMs,removed,how is my comment not civil i was just adding discussion to a topic
creepyPMs,removed,why are you continuing to talk to him
creepyPMs,removed,yes it is because i was asking if the guy was attractive in her opinion and then gave a reason to why i asked the question are you insinuating i was being a creep jesus i dont get why people get so uppity when you go against what they believe now if i were telling her that the only reason dude was creepy was because he was unattractive then i would understand where youre coming from by the way not once have i tried insulting you nor her and im trying to have a civil discussion sorry you dont like the topic
creepyPMs,removed,then i would not respond to any more of his msgs to you and just block his number
creepyPMs,removed,just amusing would be creeped if from a guy
creepyPMs,removed,yes because a guy would know its stupid to ask
creepyPMs,removed,attention whore
creepyPMs,removed,faggot
creepyPMs,removed,he seems to be a real dick doesnt he
creepyPMs,removed,its fairly difficult for a girl to be creepy
creepyPMs,removed,not that im defending the creep just curious as to why someone would have an account on okc if they have a husband i was under the impression it was a dating website
creepyPMs,removed,sometimes i feel like the bar for creeps set too low on this sub
creepyPMs,removed,why do you talk to him
creepyPMs,removed,okay so explain to me how fucking grinding on someone is an any way platonic
creepyPMs,removed,its autism i have it too and ive done stuff like that too in the past
creepyPMs,removed,why keep replying especially in a somewhat friendly way
creepyPMs,removed,why are you using comic sans
creepyPMs,removed,well said except i believe if im making an effort to bring a conversation to someone its rude to not put some effort back in to keep it going i doubt anyone can stay interested in someone who isnt trying regardless of who initiated it
creepyPMs,removed,he must not have been attractive enough for this to be funny instead
creepyPMs,removed,good thing you hade the s at the end otherwise i would have thought you were genuinely stupid s
creepyPMs,removed,that font makes me want to burn down an orphanage
creepyPMs,removed,neither of you can type all seriousness though theres some shady shit goin on there
creepyPMs,removed,isnt this just a joke
creepyPMs,removed,when you reply you just add fuel to the fire and good luck
creepyPMs,removed,your a idiot
creepyPMs,removed,i mean i still have phone numbers from middle school in mine everything else is super creepy but the keeping it for seven years bit isnt
creepyPMs,removed,i dont talk like that to girls because thats not how i am but is it really that bad if i as a dude got a text from a girl that was all like hey you want to come over and out these big boobs in your face i wouldnt be like thats gross i would be like well thats nice
creepyPMs,removed,i think trying to be nice gets us all texter and textee into this position to begin with if we were all more honest it would be better and httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfyqmqxqgeby
creepyPMs,removed,so you text in your sleep
creepyPMs,removed,something to watch on a saturday people harbor their feelings end up in friendships when they would prefer something else better to be honest hopefully someone will get something from it
creepyPMs,removed,i was just asking a question you dont have to be antagonistic about it yeesh
creepyPMs,removed,they wouldnt try it if it didnt work sometimes people think its just the guys who act this way but after my divorce i got tinder and i was shocked by how forward lots of girls are young and old attractive and fat some of them are blatant about it outright while others try to be sweet and conservative at first and then they do a and say something random like i love sex so i guarantee those lines have worked for that guy and he knows something like out of will respond favorably
creepyPMs,removed,the girl is guilty of using your instead of youre as well
creepyPMs,removed,welp
creepyPMs,removed,your a idiot jesus
creepyPMs,removed,i guess i mean that the creepy part is that he kept it at all not so much the duration
creepyPMs,removed,funny that this is the most upvoted comment but your a idiot which is particularly cringey with bonus irony got a free pass
creepyPMs,removed,i call bullshit on this post im sorry but theres just no way in hell this guy is still a virgin
creepyPMs,removed,sadly hes right his straightforward approach does work sometimes although its guaranteed to only work on people as desperate and single focused as him not the kind of person you would want to see often
creepyPMs,removed,your wrong
creepyPMs,removed,if you saw my cock youd understand
creepyPMs,removed,i kinda liked the redick part i bet this dumb routine actually does work you shoulda gave him more to work with op woulda been hilarious
creepyPMs,removed,so is her your a idiot not that im advocating for him they both just suck with english
creepyPMs,removed,sorry the who dis made me kind of think youre an idiot
creepyPMs,removed,i lost interest when i saw op didnt know how to use youre
creepyPMs,removed,idiotic feminist talking to immature idiot yep check and check
creepyPMs,removed,my eyes lead directly to my judgmental brain it hurts
creepyPMs,removed,block
creepyPMs,removed,i never said that creeping or crossing boundaries was ok i believe that creeping boundary crossing and spelling words incorrectly are all practices one should strive to avoid engaging in i dont hate the people who use words incorrectly quite the contrary i feel sympathy for them and that probably bothers you more and rightfully so and i think most people feel the same way and i think most people cant help it you could be albert einstein announcing the e if later that day you say i would like a apple theyre gonna go ahead and double check your math no one hates someone for mispelling a word but the amount it devalues anything youve said before it or will say after it is staggering unless of course you correct yourself at which point nearly all is forgivenforgotten depending obviously on how long it took you to correct yourself even so all most people need to see is evidence that you do in fact know the correct usage i dont know what it is about words but regardless of how obvious what you meant to say was pretty much all mistakes are going to cheapen what you say if its any consolation it seems that for whatever reason theres not much variance in the amount of cheapening you can mispell something simple or complicated and for me at least it pretty much all seems to carry the same weight
creepyPMs,removed,im very sorry i left myself logged in and a houseguest thought she was funny my apologies
creepyPMs,removed,im very sorry i left myself logged in and a houseguest thought she was funny my apologies
creepyPMs,removed,grammar is our lord and savior and you will include sex if you actually agreed
creepyPMs,removed,can you please be more specific
creepyPMs,removed,he looks as homely as a potato too
creepyPMs,removed,could you have just oh i dont know not replied to avoid further creepfest
creepyPMs,removed,if whats up sexy is the worst you get after posting suggestive pictures on tinder you are doing very very well
creepyPMs,removed,or shes a cunt
creepyPMs,removed,are you saying one should not be proud of what they are alllivesmatter friend
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair maybe the guys asking for plainer rejections arent the kind to go off on women
creepyPMs,removed,i imagined they were bitches at mua but this one takes the fucking cake she should probably be eating some makeup from now on see if it makes her prettier on the inside cos she fucked up
creepyPMs,removed,where does a fetish this random even originate some childhood experience
creepyPMs,removed,you honestly asked for it lol
creepyPMs,removed,i hope to god nobody likes you gets any position of power in this world you really are a cancer
creepyPMs,removed,i think that dude is trolling hard actually made me laugh at that
creepyPMs,removed,did you get that i put a dozen caveats in front of that that i was trying to be sensitive to you not the guys that i acknowledged that you have every right to not do that any reason at all that i was kind of thanking you for a task that is not your responsibility not something you have to care about but its kinda nice if you do like giving money to a beggar
creepyPMs,removed,cringe anarchy rulez
creepyPMs,removed,finally with sense here
creepyPMs,removed,lol i ment what part of rule i broke cause i didnt find any
creepyPMs,removed,thunder cunt would be the best superhero name
creepyPMs,removed,i like this guy ooo gurl lol
creepyPMs,removed,he keeps referring to how sexy your profile picture is how sexy can it be
creepyPMs,removed,yeah okay guy cant take a hint but i gotta ask why didnt you just say youre just not interested to talk to him
creepyPMs,removed,youre both fucking idiots i did upvote the post though because it delivered double the cringe
creepyPMs,removed,its okay not to understand a kink but that shouldnt of been a focus even if it was vanilla comment exposing you to anything of that nature without consent is the issue im sorry that happened you made it sound like it was extra creepy because he has a kink
creepyPMs,removed,i dont even have a penis but i know many other women who do this is the dumbest fucking thing ive ever read if im transphobic at all its purely because im forced to listen to these delusions except having a phobia requires you to be afraid of something not just frustrated with its stupidity i have to wonder if there are transgender people out there who think people like you cast them all in a negative light by being delusional im completely fine with the concept of people who want modify their body and way they see fit and behave any way they want but once you start saying you are a woman you have stepped plainly in to the area of clinical delusion now i have to find a trans sub to ask if there are differing opinions in the trans community on this subject
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i mean if youre a straight guy and turn down sex with a gay man youre a homophobe your logic is for fuckwits
creepyPMs,removed,title gore i literally have no idea what happened
creepyPMs,removed,he doesnt know better
creepyPMs,removed,i laughed but yea i think he was trolling
creepyPMs,removed,rtheredpillirl
creepyPMs,removed,i think what confuses me is when op continues responding eliciting more response like stop responding ignoring would remove half the responses posted on here
creepyPMs,removed,next time send him the god damn link to the thread so we can get some good comment drama going also which social networking app is it because if its tinder i assure you it is in no way intended to make friends
creepyPMs,removed,any chance i can get a link to the archive of that thread you knowfor masturbatory purposes
creepyPMs,removed,how was that creepy i used the medical term atleast i didnt say for science if anything you should find my honesty refreshing
creepyPMs,removed,probably asking for the gone wild pics for science
creepyPMs,removed,so why do you participate
creepyPMs,removed,now i gotta see the picture
creepyPMs,removed,now i gotta see the picture
creepyPMs,removed,unfortunately you responded exactly how he wanted you to
creepyPMs,removed,why did you blockhide his name he deserves the hateful messages that so many people would have sent him is there a rule against this we need to bring back public shaming do you a have link to the picture he is talking about for scientific purposes strictly please know that im joking and dont take number seriously take number seriously dude needs to be hung by his balls
creepyPMs,removed,sounds to me like he was just trying to be friendly and discuss shared interest
creepyPMs,removed,well how big now i have to ask
creepyPMs,removed,well played they just nonsequitored into a shitty year old meme
creepyPMs,removed,what size was the bra s
creepyPMs,removed,hahahahaha u donot want money and pic of dick too found my new pickup line im suprised he managed to use the right too given this entire thin is riddled with errors who are you chatting with some india it customer service reps
creepyPMs,removed,girl you better dial up those police folks nowheard they might help you with stuff like this
creepyPMs,removed,the way hes typing i half expected him to start talking about a snek
creepyPMs,removed,ah yes the troubleshooting internet connection turned date classic indian romance story
creepyPMs,removed,well there are some women who do like it problem for this dude is that he was never really taight that the rough talk play comes after a healthy dose of conversation in a relationship and not just out of the blue with strangers that or maybe he just gets off on threatening people different strokes different trolls
creepyPMs,removed,dude sounds crazy but do you really think no one that browses reddit should have your number thats kinda crazy too
creepyPMs,removed,was not expecting what i found in your post history out fucking standing
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think that what i saidi asked if she really thinks no one that uses reddit should have her number which is a hugely different question thanks tho
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt say that you should have gave that guy your number i do not think you should have at all i asked that out of the entire user base of reddit do you really think there is not one person that should or could have your number that doesnt imply that you should give your number to anyone that u dont want to or that you or anyone else should share theirs with everyone here i dont see where u get that from
creepyPMs,removed,dude sounds crazy but do you really think no one that browses reddit should have your number thats kinda crazy too i literally did not say that nowhere in my comment do i imply that anyone should have her number i ask if she really thinks that out of the millions of reddit users that not one of them would be able to get or should have her number it just seems crazy to think that a huge population of people shouldnt be able to get to know her because they have a reddit login
creepyPMs,removed,i wasnt trying to argue with your opinion or how u live your life if thats how u feel then thats how u feel i was only asking for clarification which u also dont owe some stranger on the internet
creepyPMs,removed,noi didnt her decision was to not give the guy her number i said i agreed with that i didnt say that that was kind of crazy either way its her life her decisions arent up to me or anyone else to agree or disagree with i said that if she thinks that exactly zero of the millions of people that use reddit wouldnt be able to or shouldnt have her number for the sole reason that they are reddit users would be kind of crazy which i stand by
creepyPMs,removed,it would be funny to send him a pic of a sliced hotdog with i didnt have anything that small so i had to make change paid in full
creepyPMs,removed,the decision and her statement of never give a redditor your number are different things you have to you understand that i would hope that you can comprehend i dont know when asking a question became attacking someone but we need to walk that back as a society if thats where we are
creepyPMs,removed,i gotta be honest the dick pic thing is pretty funny maybe im alone here but telling you it was an invoice so you werent expecting a dick is just hilarious especially when paired with what he said about dick pics earlier
creepyPMs,removed,you really think this loon is worth talking to after that tantrum
creepyPMs,removed,im so sorry you had to go through that please remember that not all men are like that i hope that one day youll feel comfortable giving your number to someone on reddit and youll find that youre not hurt again feel free to pm me and discuss more im a genuinely nice guy and my dick pics are extremely tasteful and classy havesexwithmehavesexwithmehavesexwithmehavesexwithme fuck you slut havesexwithmehavesexwithmehavesexwithmehavesexwithme
creepyPMs,removed,use the guys email and sign him up for all sorts of online bullshit every mailing list you can find send it his way
creepyPMs,removed,something tells me its a small deformed looking invoice
creepyPMs,removed,so youre saying theres a chance ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
creepyPMs,removed,did you accept the offer
creepyPMs,removed,but was it a good dick pic yes all dick pics are gross and weird
creepyPMs,removed,whats the deal with creepy indian guys seriously this kind of creepy stalking is really common with them and ive started wondering why india of all places
creepyPMs,removed,im going to need pics to fully understand the difference
creepyPMs,removed,that depends are you going to end me
creepyPMs,removed,i just feel bad that he has to be constantly locked in his own torment like hell never live a normal life i just feel bad that he has to live like that
creepyPMs,removed,this guy will probably find your number anyway or show up at your door step some day
creepyPMs,removed,apologies i did it for the ease of op finding your response my bad
creepyPMs,removed,wow get over yourself op
creepyPMs,removed,read it and op youre really rude and condescending you should add that into your profile page sheesh
creepyPMs,removed,to be honest i dont feel like this was that creepy some people think it will make people smile to be told that theyre beautiful its very different from the creeps that think it is their duty to tell you how sexy you are and explain all the gross things they would do to you with that being said i understand why your guard is up at random guys that just have to let you know what they think about your physical appearance it gets really annoying that you cant just exist you have to be reminded that your appearance has been approved by mentm and you can now carry on with whatever you were doing but i dont feel like in this case he had such a bad intent
creepyPMs,removed,jesus christ lady you need to go sit in a fridge or something because you have no chill at all what he said isnt cool at all but you started it off by being a bitch you are a bitch
creepyPMs,removed,a quick inquiry of a total of females yielded the following results immediate blocks with creep asshole pervert screw off sent me gruesome pictures i will have nightmares of responded with a dick pic sent me the address of nearby castration clinics started worshiping cthulhu satan lucifer dark lord and lord gaben offering my soul in the process asked why the fuck i would ask this told me to kindly go fuck myself didnt respond at all responded after spam messages noticed that i they should call bullshit fucked me for £ but damn that girl was merciless
creepyPMs,removed,its my duty to inform you after finding this reddit post at random that not all menyou shouldnt string along and reeeeeeeeeeeeee
creepyPMs,removed,fat ugly wife oh hes just being silly heehee
creepyPMs,removed,but they never get to put the shaft in the end huh wink wink nudge nudge
creepyPMs,removed,soevery married ugly dude
creepyPMs,removed,im with you on that but only because i come across slightly effeminate enough that they dont know if im telling them theyre fabulous or if i want to get my nut and never call in the morning im saying i get away with dirty things basic bruhs never could
creepyPMs,removed,there are a ton of beautiful older women but these nnice guy geeks dont have a chance with any of them because they to like to fuck good looking younger guysbut they say all of these gorgeous women have hit the wall so that means theyre unfuckable not that theyre inadequate in bed even if these hot ladies give them a chance they turn into the geeks they have always been just a ps if older women are so disgusting why are they the top porn search almost universally because women age better than men despite the wine and milk argument that is perpetuated by most likely pedophiles
creepyPMs,removed,just laugh at this obvious edgy posing teenager he or she is probably some fat reject that should have their dna eliminated from the gene pool
creepyPMs,removed,and to all who are saying this is the creepiest message youve ever heard really grandma you dont peruse this site more than that this is a disturbed teen that will grow up to be a deviantartist in the future have any of you ever met a neckbeard they all talk like this and they never do anythingjust like everyone with their dreams
creepyPMs,removed,your message made me feel weird while i was traversing the internet world
creepyPMs,removed,you and your type are whats wrong with society in general a simple thank you should suffice yeah he might be hitting you but he might just simply complimenting you would you prefer damn bitch you ugly as an ass wrinkle if after you say thank you and not friend him he keeps messaging you then proceed with your original reaction but to automatically go nuclear over a compliment some deep underlying issues that reside in you lady
creepyPMs,removed,dont lie to yourself you an ugly bitch nobody going around putting there hips on you or telling you that you look good just like op has some deep desire for the rest of the world to know she is is pretty because her man has a side piece who isnt a bitch
creepyPMs,removed,in the book mash from which the movie and tv series were made there was a brief mention of a whore whose epilepsy was ummm switched on every time someone had sex with her
creepyPMs,removed,fetishizing any kind of disorders is one of the most gross things ever
creepyPMs,removed,you post all over rgonewildcurvy not sure how this is out of the ordinary
creepyPMs,removed,honestly i never thought about this before but i think it can be exciting its about control believe it or not some people like to have it i dont know whats your handicap exactly tho
creepyPMs,removed,dear all women guys either start off as a love interest or try to worm their way in as a friend their is no third friends option unless hes gay
creepyPMs,removed,damn a tripod it was that much
creepyPMs,removed,given that there are websites for this exact purpose theres a reason these guys are using okcupid to find a sex worker either they dont have enough money have been blacklisted for whatever reason or want to prey on naive women
creepyPMs,removed,also the ones who say what they can do in bed in all my years having sex only one guy lived up to that he was also a cheating hoooooor take from it what you can mic drop
creepyPMs,removed,hung like a raisin i like you
creepyPMs,removed,as creepy pms go that is less creepy and more sad op please hide your beauty it is a hazard to public health
creepyPMs,removed,im not trying to instigate anything or pick on anyone but i have to ask why not just block them to begin with it seems to me less stressful than having to explain why you dont want to talk to them and put up with their assholery
creepyPMs,removed,you could start by ignoring him idk
creepyPMs,removed,remember the rules if followed whatever stupid pickup line you have just might get you laid step be attractive step dont be unattractive
creepyPMs,removed,this man is definitely earning his virgins by blowing up on the internet
creepyPMs,removed,white knight much
creepyPMs,removed,giving logical advice to ignore someone after so many messages is pretty supportive
creepyPMs,removed,yeah you want to at least feel some friction some girls have been used up like crazy
creepyPMs,removed,translation i will marry a year old against her will because im too much of a fucktard to engage in a consensual relationship with another adult
creepyPMs,removed,to which extent not letting women drive or treating them like secondclass citizens orany number of things that are commonplace even among moderate muslims
creepyPMs,removed,haha what seems to me like you were a total bitch and he zinged the fuck out of you with that last line lol grow up
creepyPMs,removed,no
creepyPMs,removed,or
creepyPMs,removed,honestly didnt see that coming i think its pretty funny its weird but funny
creepyPMs,removed,well
creepyPMs,removed,if thats an actual picture of you in the purple shirt you are a and i mean that in a very noncreeper way lol that guy is just a jerk that doesnt know how to take rejection
creepyPMs,removed,its pretty obvious by the way this person crafted their message they are intentionally being creepy to get a response out of you you posting this on rcreepypms was probably exactly what they wanted and they are combing through your shocked posts and getting a laugh out of it
creepyPMs,removed,hes a grade a pussy for posting that while hiding behind his keyboard hed likely never talk that way to anyone in person
creepyPMs,removed,can i see the photo in question
creepyPMs,removed,i vote euthanasia
creepyPMs,removed,most people are idiots most men doubly so source am a man
creepyPMs,removed,she should have let him see the body it would have been the decent thing to do
creepyPMs,removed,of course she was all the cp she shared fromw the chance board was long gone so no way for the investigation to see the cp she shared just seems very odd that srs would defend her yet get up in arms about jokes on reddit
creepyPMs,removed,why are you even trying to rationalize with this idiot just no and then block
creepyPMs,removed,somebody is triggered
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair its not entirely a free market when we have to treat our employees like people when you can just hire peopleimport goods from other countries who will put up with near any working conditions
creepyPMs,removed,okay i agree with most of this persons points but they just take it way too far jeez
creepyPMs,removed,jesus fucking christ that is if christ were a little kid sicko
creepyPMs,removed,people are too sensitive sometimes
creepyPMs,removed,in his defense girls who practice poly and witchcraft are usually not the most attractive people
creepyPMs,removed,find out this person voted for trump you fucking idiot you piss off persephone
creepyPMs,removed,what a fucking idiot we call them deplorable not reproachable gosh
creepyPMs,removed,whats a liver lancer clinically proven cunt sounds like the premium package for a sex change operation
creepyPMs,removed,oh i bet he was steaming guys like him get so butt hurt over liberal feeemales expressing their thoughts and beliefs on okcupid and then evolve into some sort of altright trigglypuff that cant help but message these women and attempt to put them in their place and try to make them feel as angry as theyve made him feel sadly for him op did not give him the jimmysoothing reaction he was desperately seeking ­¡qué lástima
creepyPMs,removed,so are you one of those super positive people despite any evidence to the contrary
creepyPMs,removed,being the shitty kind of person i am i try to tell everyone when theyre ugly independently of when i think theyre as shitty as me that helps me keep track of who i should be talking to
creepyPMs,removed,but they were a match he must have thought that meant something
creepyPMs,removed,alright doesnt that chinese friend comment mean that he does have a sense of humor i mean its pretty offensive for some really it is but saying that he needs a sense of humor makes like sense
creepyPMs,removed,idk they just asked you twice and apologised when you said no for the second time slightly inappropriate maybe but i wouldnt call this creepy at all
creepyPMs,removed,its either your girlfriend or its a dude
creepyPMs,removed,rpmsfromneckbeards
creepyPMs,removed,honestly youre the cunt
creepyPMs,removed,i am not seeing the creepiness sorry op
creepyPMs,removed,sounds like a joke to me i mean a terrible one but a joke cockrooster no
creepyPMs,removed,whos bothering the chat with people at all when theyre in a relationship
creepyPMs,removed,sure dude to each his own im just giving my opinion you have to admit though it is basically reverting back to a prepuberty state just saying
creepyPMs,removed,rhumblebrag
creepyPMs,removed,hi lets fuck
creepyPMs,removed,i suggest you seek help for your hatred of the people that made this country great and if you give me that on the backs of blah blah blah bullshit ask yourself whether or not project management is a skill hes not wrong your hatred for those who civilized this country is kind of pathetic although i am very amused that people have noticed the theme to your bullshit thanks for giving us popcorn enjoy the internet
creepyPMs,removed,looks to me youre on those kind of sites purely to get these kinds of responses defensive right from the get go could be wrong though just my impression
creepyPMs,removed,that happened
creepyPMs,removed,whats your twitch if you dont mind my asking
creepyPMs,removed,i cant even wheres my safe space s
creepyPMs,removed,i dunno vore is pretty fucked up
creepyPMs,removed,its called trolling have you guys never been on the internet before
creepyPMs,removed,but but what is your kink i dont expect an answer btw i just am interested in others kinks i had a friend that absolutely loved to sit on spread around and roll in foods for other people i also used to know someone that really liked balloons and latex in general i havent talked to anyone with some of the more strange fetishes though i dont care what people do in their private time we all have our kinks i just like to learn from those with them haha
creepyPMs,removed,i try not to judge a book by the cover but wow the fuck even is that haircut
creepyPMs,removed,my kink is to stalking women and make them fear for their lives you dont get genuine fear if its consentual s because reddit users cant tell gallows humor from psychopathy because theyre idiots
creepyPMs,removed,im not sure liking someone based on their race is racist for instance i could say that i like blonde girls does that make me a hairist no its just called having preferences everyone has them
creepyPMs,removed,you gotta admit as creepy as that is it is kinda hilarious
creepyPMs,removed,i dont get the ops point i know girls called neal and they are super sensitive when assholes say its a boys name its online so who knows the bed comment i get but the name bit sort of ruins it
creepyPMs,removed,well do you enjoy it op
creepyPMs,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
creepyPMs,removed,if all else fails just remember httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkoucoyvaos die deutschen flirten sehr subtil
creepyPMs,removed,have you never seen a natural redheads crotch before i suggest doing a google image search at the very least because youre missing out on the meaning of life itself
creepyPMs,removed,lol at fuck you stinging what a weirdo that guy is
creepyPMs,removed,whats her number and is she busy right now
creepyPMs,removed,im not sure whats creepy about this
creepyPMs,removed,can you give her my number
creepyPMs,removed,lol i dont know i mean i find this more funny than creepy like a wtf funny
creepyPMs,removed,what kind of dick bullshit is that how are you still single immediately followed by why are girls such birches
creepyPMs,removed,you have to be kidding me
creepyPMs,removed,both pretty creepy
creepyPMs,removed,judging an entire populace based on a subreddit that specifically is for putting these mentally regressed fuckers isnt exactly what i would call a correct judgement i agree that especially the recent generation of eastern countries are full of self entitled pricks but you shouldnt generalize after all these pathetic self entitled pricks we also identify as creeps know no nationality for sure these people of the east have a lot of disrespectful and rude people especially regarding the people of the western countries but for sure there also are people that know how to properly respect a woman and more importantly a fellow human being i dont call myself mr perfect or something but i and the circle of relatives well those that i consider as relatives just like everyone else we also got some bastards we share blood with tend to know how to treat women independent of race with the respect another fellow human being deserves through i have to say that within the recent years the country developed by quite a bit as such i dont know if we still count as west or east i dont want to start a political debate thank you its turkey for those who wonder the google suggestions for does turkey also were also amazing btw from having nukes to making sleepy and having proteins tl dr creeps are everywhere but it doesnt mean that the entire populace is full of retards the eastern countries tend to have quite a bunch of them dont forget the topic of this subreddit right sorry for the long rant
creepyPMs,removed,a term used by hypocrites
creepyPMs,removed,just fyi people with bpd dont try to force our perspectives onto people thats just nonsense it means we are emotionally hypersensitive to the point of needing treatment and in some cases medication and it often leads to impulsive behavior to deal with it including gambling fucking drinking drugs ect we arent fucking monsters and i dont appreciate the perpetuation of that historically held stigma that we are manipulative we are often mistreated because of this kind of ignorance think before you speak goddammit
creepyPMs,removed,to be honest i doubt he was dead serious with the message especially the ps
creepyPMs,removed,sold
creepyPMs,removed,stop
creepyPMs,removed,im wondering the same thing the title seems a bit too much for the message despite still being creepy
creepyPMs,removed,fuck i ended up spending the last half hour delving into the hole that is that subreddit and the related ones those people are cunts
creepyPMs,removed,theirs a sub reddit for it dont remember though
creepyPMs,removed,seriously i wish i could sell my stinky used underwear for a pair seriously if anyone wants to paypal me for some stinky nasty ass underwear pm me ill do it
creepyPMs,removed,did a dude really just use the word mansplain is he sexist against himself
creepyPMs,removed,send him my way im a poor college student with more than enough panties
creepyPMs,removed,fuck where do i sign up
creepyPMs,removed,im not criticizing anyone i dont see whats particularly harmful about my post
creepyPMs,removed,lol would you take kidding of course
creepyPMs,removed,hey can you remove the link to that subreddit id be happy to reinstate your comment after an edit
creepyPMs,removed,to answer your question just look on over at srs
creepyPMs,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrzhwgngrmk
creepyPMs,removed,everytime i read stuff like this i just want to see a picture of both people
creepyPMs,removed,creepy is so subjective a lot of these i found funny
creepyPMs,removed,this is creepy i read it as they were flirting with each other
creepyPMs,removed,he is also a loser who hates truml
creepyPMs,removed,wow a massive dick and a tiny dick all in one great package
creepyPMs,removed,typical fuckin indian
creepyPMs,removed,id rather he have beautiful tattoos and a nice cock cause a beautiful cock is still pretty ugly
creepyPMs,removed,as everyone else has said tell the police not the internet the police can actually help
creepyPMs,removed,some girls would kill for a sugar daddy and here you are not even replying you are something else
creepyPMs,removed,atually you were really polite most people here just pretend they are polite and i have feeling they go to those sites just to bait people like him and post it here
creepyPMs,removed,dont wanna brag but a girl once told me i had a beautiful cock
creepyPMs,removed,nonononononono though if hes into the same stuff maybe his also looks like this barf
creepyPMs,removed,trump is prolgbt since hes been elected hes been open about that but the rnc didnt really allow him to be before the election
creepyPMs,removed,yeah youre full of shit and you instigated this no oh reddit his his first message
creepyPMs,removed,dont you feel bad about being a hooker though
creepyPMs,removed,so would you
creepyPMs,removed,doesnt feel so good does it
creepyPMs,removed,you must be gay
creepyPMs,removed,thats because guys dont get creepy pms they get blessings and you should take yours i wouldnt lick the clit from jump though unless you have a dental dam
creepyPMs,removed,for fucks sake pakistan get ur shit together
creepyPMs,removed,was it big at least
creepyPMs,removed,oh god you dodged a bullet with this girl op she says only god can judge me then belittles you for being mormon not only that but shes threatening to break your dick off etc and then has the cheek to say she had reported you haha i also like that she could have blocked you much sooner but kept it going for her own sick enjoyment what a loser
creepyPMs,removed,i mean you cant blame the guy for wanting one last hurrah
creepyPMs,removed,i mean this guy was a dick but you sunk to his level with the cracks about mormonism sorry about the bad week though
creepyPMs,removed,you decided to use racism to combat his unsolicited messages
creepyPMs,removed,the purple is such a hostile person and the cringey say hello to reddit
creepyPMs,removed,i honestly think this guys just dumb as fuck and accidentally sent it
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i know what you mean maybe you should give him a chance and if he gives off weird vibes then end it
creepyPMs,removed,checks post history for pictures damn you win this time
creepyPMs,removed,damn that definitely qualifies as creepy need a new sub rcreepyasfuckpms is that some site where you can do just friends its always amazing to me that people think theyll change your mind especially with some ridiculously gnarly creep show spectacles i want a new sub with times this has worked shouldnt take long
creepyPMs,removed,if i was your boyfriend and i knew you were going out with a past fwb while prepping to move in with me id dump your ass
creepyPMs,removed,theres a sub dedicated to something like that rtributeme
creepyPMs,removed,ah still isnt that sort of a red flag personally if im about to move in with my gf lunches with other people ive had a sexual relationship with are off i meando men ever really want to have lunch to catch up with someone they have had a sexual relationship with no in my experience they want to hook upand clearly this guy is no exception
creepyPMs,removed,i guess thats trueclearly shes not looking to mess around i just wonder if its not a little naive to expect a guy who you hooked up with with no strings to want anything other than sex
creepyPMs,removed,the feminism is strong in this one poster above you
creepyPMs,removed,after reading i was not surprised to see that the top mod of this sub is a feminazi typical sjw cant win arguments so you remove anyone who may possibly not see things your way i hope you are proud of being antiamerican and procensorship lead the way to a new america one not worth living in
creepyPMs,removed,in other words youre a powertripping cancermod someone who posts in one of those subs may not necessarily agree with them
creepyPMs,removed,asian food huh
creepyPMs,removed,meant nothing by it just found such a massive blanket statement amusing
creepyPMs,removed,all men who date significantly younger women are all creeps solid blanket stereotype
creepyPMs,removed,you directly stated it theres nothing to imply lol older guys who arent creeps dont want young women
creepyPMs,removed,okay sure if you scroll up youll see you did exactly thatcausality if i say all black people who dont steal have jobs that still implies i believe all unemployed black people are thieves get it hey dont get me wrong it doesnt mean anything to me but mincing words doesnt mean youre not being a generalizing dick
creepyPMs,removed,i agree there have been plenty of examples of female creeps lumping a gender together is not the way to go
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,because thats what she was doing
creepyPMs,removed,he doesnt have a very nice case either
creepyPMs,removed,stupid rule but okay
creepyPMs,removed,why havent you blocked his number already block his number
creepyPMs,removed,this is somebody trolling hard
creepyPMs,removed,not all of these are creepy
creepyPMs,removed,why dont you just block his number baffling
creepyPMs,removed,women still react the same way
creepyPMs,removed,s in case it wasnt obvious jesus fuck
creepyPMs,removed,so how big those really are we deserve to know for scientific reasons
creepyPMs,removed,this cant be real nobody talks like that this is bullshit
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,i cant figure out where hes creeping on op from how the hell did he get the impression you were living off the proceeds of your mellons youre doing nothing you should actually go to school you shouldnt treat him like shit even though you havent talked to him for five years i guess he saw you off campus and immediately assumed that any attractive woman having fun with a goodlooking guy was serially dating guys for their money and not attending school because thats how reality works on planet selfobsessedmisogynist oh also once he found out you were an engineering major what he had retroactively meant by acting like a little slut was that you looked cute how could you misunderstand that
creepyPMs,removed,does this sub basically exist to shame ugly guys because if a good looking guy had tried most of those it would have worked lol cringe this sub
creepyPMs,removed,so on to the important questions because everyone else already dissected his comments pretty wellare your knockers really that big
creepyPMs,removed,so its being a niceguy to question the legitimacy of a post on reddit
creepyPMs,removed,okayam i wrong to question the legitimacy of a post and in doing so does that equate me to the guy real or not in the post
creepyPMs,removed,righto went back to the rules for a second time on mobile on clicking the little i at the top of the rules didnt show the part about not being allowed to question the validity of someones experiences its kinda like but on a much much smaller scale anyone who claims they were raped cant be questioned or wrong about it even if theyre lying if someone says this is exactly what happened thats the truth and its against the rules to ever question it i think there should be a change in the rules but hey at least i know where to post now so that if anyone dares question me about the legitimacy of my experiences theyre wrong and im right its okay for op to be offended by me asking people to consider if its a real post i dont mean to offend by suggesting it be taken with a pinch of salt being offended and offending deliberately are very different things youre pandering to people who want karma for receiving a message from someone theyre not interested in by allowing them free reign to post whatever they like without question or critical analysis
creepyPMs,removed,lets get real here both are just doing their thing here hes just bad at picking up girls and shes being mean because thats the only way hell go away but this is only as cringey as half the facebook messages on facebook
creepyPMs,removed,this has to be fake op pls admit you orchestrated this or maybe its someone fucking with you using high school guys accountpics
creepyPMs,removed,dude has some serious mental health issues going on ive had a stalker before and all sorts of red flags were going off reading this post noticeably all the latent rage towards the woman thats the mark of a man whos on the edge of sanity
creepyPMs,removed,could someone answer this honestly for me why the hell do you girls even reply to this shit i meanevery time i see something posted here i think well i would have just blocked him right there but then theres always a response is it so you can post here im just curious
creepyPMs,removed,block block blllloooccckkkk
creepyPMs,removed,not sure if that last one is too creepy quite odd but not as creepy as the others
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i knew that question would come across badly my point is this and you guys can downvote me if you want i would have stopped talking after he mentioned my breasts actually i would have told him to fuck off and then blocked him she goes on to tell him hes being inappropriate and then later tries to justify what shes doing with her life and responds to his allegations that she was parading around like a slut why even humor him at all your assumption that i was saying she was egging him on is wrong i know the guy is a creep regardless of her response i was just genuinely wondering if people who post here kind of let it go on longer than they normally would so they can post the creepiness here thats all
creepyPMs,removed,we should organise a hate campaign against this guy and put him into one of those machines where they slowly grind you up and you cant do anything to resist because youre chained up and all you can do is scream for help until the machine grinds even your throat to a pulp he will die knowing that he is scum
creepyPMs,removed,nah im just not a judgmental prick
creepyPMs,removed,im not saying youre in the wrong here but why dont people just block guys like this it seems like youre playing their game by responding
creepyPMs,removed,lol what rule could this possibly have broken is the only thing were allowed to do here shit all over people with poor social skills or something
creepyPMs,removed,yeah fuck science and common sense i have a trans friend with feelings and when she sees comments like this it causes her to have extreme anguish and panic attacks but lets all laugh at fragile masculinity amrite ladies hehehehe no delusions or double standards here
creepyPMs,removed,what so trying to be objective and give the cringey kid the benefit of the doubt is uncivil get real dude
creepyPMs,removed,im here to support everyone reddit is not a place for gas lighting
creepyPMs,removed,thing is this fucking image is ancient this sub should have closed years ago then
creepyPMs,removed,damn this is some vintage meming
creepyPMs,removed,hey with the way she dressed she was asking for it
creepyPMs,removed,how is this not supportive isnt the definition of supportive to provide encouragement or emotional help im just asking a question im certainly not being uncivil in fact im being overly civil in reality if i were talking to a friend my own child or anyone else i sought to support i would certainly ask them why they continued to engage the idiot but i guess stuff like this is this subs bread and butter and if everyone just said screw you and moved on this sub would be crickets ban me if you want but dont try to twist a simple question asked with a genuine desire to understand into me being uncivil or unsupportive
creepyPMs,removed,youre being trolled dont you realize that
creepyPMs,removed,will i get banned
creepyPMs,removed,contact his mom and see what she has to say
creepyPMs,removed,good nigger
creepyPMs,removed,psa for the sake of rcreepypms please consider taking him off of block this would be for the greater good thank you
creepyPMs,removed,confused the fiancé was a lie if notwhy are you asking for people to message you just curious its still a legitimate response to a dick question you had
creepyPMs,removed,way to overreact to a joke the stuck up attitude is more cringeworthy or creepy than anything else here
creepyPMs,removed,this looks too fake to meno one is that stupid and socially akward combined
creepyPMs,removed,he might legitimately have aspergers or something similar regardless the sheer amount of honesty oozing from ops responses are so fantastic we should all be so bold
creepyPMs,removed,while im sure most people would say you should have blocked him ealrier if i was in your position i would have milked him for more creepy weirdness too
creepyPMs,removed,i dont even think about aspergers that way its just another type of person many of my friends with aspergers do things like this and dont realize its weird until someone explains the creepiness is separate from any diagnosis but the roleplaying was an interesting way for him to convey how creepy he is
creepyPMs,removed,how fucking hard is it to hit block op loves karma i guess
creepyPMs,removed,this is what this sub was meant for truly horrifying people sending absolutely shitty messages not mild triggerings but just ignore him hes just bouncing off his own self hate on others
creepyPMs,removed,fyi aspergers mental illness
creepyPMs,removed,wow ramiugly is about attractive people looking for confirmation
creepyPMs,removed,youre being just as creepy as the guy in the post stop
creepyPMs,removed,uhh as a male you look good dude like i went back to check you lookin good son nohomo nopedo dont get me wrong its clear as fuck you put mad effort into lookin good but its also clear youre in the wrong pond if youre having trouble with the ladies west coast girls love lightskinned dudes like you for whatever reason white women dont like indians hook up w a black chick or halfblack chick or start introducing yourself to black culture and appropriate it halfway dont be fake be the indian equivalent of a wigger im white i can say that one p to start you off there if youre interested in that path i recommend tech snoop dogg obligate ice cube and anything that is not trap music a genre of rap except for wiz khalifa in small doses for some reason dont hate your skin bro learn to rock it with every bit of respect and acknowledgement that i havent walked steps in your shoes id totally wear it this guy was probably cucked by an indian by the way to others the above sounds racist i know all i can say its not meant to be game is game
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,honestly i looked in your post history and youre a good looking kid hes probably some bitter foreveralone neckbeard whos jealous rest assured that you are better than this person in every single way he must be brutally unhappy with himself to lash out like that and is most likely very lonely because really who wants to be around that kind of person
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,nice argument thanks for the attention btw
creepyPMs,removed,is a commie
creepyPMs,removed,this shit is so fake
creepyPMs,removed,nah im just being hyperbolic because the mods are cancer and i want to be banned
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,there are assholes on here there are real creeps but this is a psychopath
creepyPMs,removed,im betting the guy who sent that is a loser i doubt he has accomplished anything in his life people dont like him and girls dont want to be with him so the one thing he has to make himself feel superior is am old racist ideology that shouldve died in the century i look at your amiugly post and thought you just look like a normal guy in fact youre tall and thin which a lot of girls do like the guy is probably jealous that an indian dude is better looking than him dont let that asshole get to you dude youre very young so you may not have experienced guys like this pathetic human theyre out there and im sorry youll have to deal with them youre already a better person not because of your skin color but because of your character good luck with your future man i hope you feel better
creepyPMs,removed,i more so meant how most of the posts here are now this ugly boy called me m lady maximum creeper
creepyPMs,removed,i kind of wish you could send him links to these threads so he can see that overwhelmingly people think hes being a creepy asshole maybe at his level of delusion or mental issues or whatever it wouldnt do anything but still what the hell
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i just got banned for participating in a hate sub the hate sub rtumburinaction like what im not a hateful person and dont condem bigotry but am not allowed to post anything in that sub without being banned and they said that if i used a different account they would shadow ban my ip so i couldnt participate is reddit at all so what the hell reddit auto banning ppl for participating in unauthorized subreddits is akin to a zero tolerence policy its completely uncalled for and lazy why cant the mods distinguish between hate speech and debates against hate speech if the mods dont want to moderate then why the hell are you a moderator
creepyPMs,removed,so why is this are mods just being lazy and indiscriminate is it easier to just ban someone than to see of they are an active and useful member of this community
creepyPMs,removed,do you think the guy might be on the autism spectrum or have some kind of mental handicap this kind of behavior exceeds the normal creepy shit you see on here
creepyPMs,removed,guy just needs to be thrown in front of a bus tbh
creepyPMs,removed,this cant be real theres no way a person could be this cringeyis there is there
creepyPMs,removed,reminds me of a kid i know on xbl i had actually defriended him once but then added him back because i felt sorry for him now i invite him into party chat just to make things selfdestruct with that delicious awkwardness which only someone on the spectrum can provide good shit
creepyPMs,removed,from a biological standpoint hes right though i can call myself a lizard and truly believe i am one but that still doesnt change the fact that im still a human and not a scaly reptile
creepyPMs,removed,men have dicks and women have vaginas thats just basic life and no amount of complaining about it on the internet will change that
creepyPMs,removed,hi look im often depressed but im more often a cunt im very skilled at being a cunt im a cunt ninja and literally the cuntyist thing i can think of for revenge is staying alive working at being happy and having a good life just to spite him after depression its never great but believe me it can be good and thats better than worrying about what the garbage of humanity says or thinks
creepyPMs,removed,how do you get btw op
creepyPMs,removed,this is cancer
creepyPMs,removed,yeah anything except standard fonts are illegible to my robot eyes all those curves and stuff my brain cant handle it
creepyPMs,removed,why is this creepy this seems pretty reciprocal
creepyPMs,removed,why is this creepy again
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt necessarily creepy if theyre dating
creepyPMs,removed,font is horrendous
creepyPMs,removed,so he compliments you and you get offended nice
creepyPMs,removed,the post says almost but in the last picture his dob is not that that excuses his spelling or pedophilic tendencies
creepyPMs,removed,dude if its same year i was born then im almost and im damn sure not ready to deal with that the guy is
creepyPMs,removed,no wasnt being entirely serious to be honest it also says in the last pic that his birthday is september so yeah hes but its hardly pedantic its years by that logic the girl is nearly but i dont want this to confuse you into thinking im condoning anything this sick freak did or said just worth dealing in facts not editorialised headlines like the above
creepyPMs,removed,look at the title of this post local almost year old
creepyPMs,removed,looks like the sheriffs department is going to fuck up any case they have against him by making thinly veiled threats against him in the comments on facebook way to go you unprofessional dumb fucks
creepyPMs,removed,it would be helpful to include as much relevant information you can report these incidents to httpsreportcybertiporg
creepyPMs,removed,probably an unpopular opinion here but your initial response following the automated message was in no way called for and came off even more entitled and rude than his initial response just saying theres no reason to take any shit of course but tact is still a thing
creepyPMs,removed,yes thats definitely fair i agree wasnt trying to specifically knock your post just lately theres been tons of posts that arent as cringey as before ha
creepyPMs,removed,ahaha omg i missed that thats a troublesome rule though the reason the majority of these creepy pms are creepy is because of sexualized content which means the whole sub is constantly kinkshaming op is kinkshaming a man looking for a domme and seriously why is masturbating to computer game hentai so sacred that op cant make a joking comment about it
creepyPMs,removed,dont know why you bothered wasting so much time with him it was clear at the start it wasnt going anywhere so why write such a long message at the end not like he will change
creepyPMs,removed,to blame the scotch after reminding this guy of the write drunk edit sober adage 😢
creepyPMs,removed,well as a man who doesnt act this way and who doesnt have a single male friend who would either i kind wish youd think about what you are going to say before you say it
creepyPMs,removed,wait i thought i was banned from here why can i still see and comment
creepyPMs,removed,you mean this or theyll get a tremendous boost in confidence winwin somehow being treated as a grain of goodness in a desert of shit kind of feels pretty bad and not just bad for me as a guy who often feels as if hes one wrong move from being judged as an inferior animal with no real individuality but also for all the women actually view men this way ive grown up with female classmates coworkers friends and authority figures wholl not only tell me that men are the root of all evil but who also tacitly expect me to apologize for it today i went to class and once again had to politely nod my head while female classmates talk about men with pretty much exactly the same tone a kkk member might use when they talk about coons so when you actually phrased your comment as involving all men it kind of struck a nerve
creepyPMs,removed,delete ignore
creepyPMs,removed,whats your problem cant a person ask for a picture of a rooster without everyone getting all huffy about it some people like chickens you guys think your so high and mighty because you dont like chickens judgemental smh
creepyPMs,removed,cant we just see his username and everyone send him some nice messages
creepyPMs,removed,if its happening a lot maybe you should change how you are its like when they say dont tell people to change but if bad shit keeps happening let it go or change
creepyPMs,removed,seems like a decent guy actually just very awkward
creepyPMs,removed,fuck that font
creepyPMs,removed,she was even calling somebody about it last screenshot dang that man cant even have his harmless fetish without being made fun of
creepyPMs,removed,if i get banned for this so be it one bestiality is not illegal everywhere it is legal in various countries and within the us it is legal in various states httpsenwikipediaorgwikizoophiliaandthelaw httpsenwikipediaorgwikizoophiliaandthelawintheunitedstates so yeah depending on your location its not a crime regardless of your location though its not necessarily a kink it may be a fixation for some sometimes referred to as bestialists but for others its a sexual orientation i actually did a research project on the subject of whether or not zoophilia may be an orientation in some cases to which the answer was yes and presented it at a sexuality conference hosted by httpwwwsexscienceorg ive still got the poster i used for the presentation and a summary of the information if youd like to hear the definition i used or the results i gathered from the interviews also of some note is hani miletski who tried to address the subject of zoophilia as an orientation dont get me wrong i said elsewhere in this thread and i stand by that the guy in the original has zero respect for animals or for women and at best has a kink for seeing women degrade themselves with animals an attitude i find deplorable and i know nothing of the message you deleted but regardless neither do i support your attitude here and i think it needed to be called out
creepyPMs,removed,haha oh shit yea
creepyPMs,removed,hey all he wanted was some material he knew when to stop asking
creepyPMs,removed,hes very awkward but seems ok
creepyPMs,removed,honestly this looks like its a prank it didnt come off as creepy just funny
creepyPMs,removed,seems from the text you gonna meet him and suck him anyways maybe not at lunch
creepyPMs,removed,i find it so hard to believe that this happens in real life
creepyPMs,removed,i love how everyone in the comments is like fetishes and creepy guy when this guy is clearly just trolling ive had friends just make goofy prank calls like this
creepyPMs,removed,how can you tell its the same guy
creepyPMs,removed,this is like ken m level trolling i think
creepyPMs,removed,baby wipes are harsh and scratchy what baby wipes is she using if baby wipes were harsh and scratchy i dont think people would use them
creepyPMs,removed,gotta appreciate his determination and enthusiasm
creepyPMs,removed,oh come on this shouldnt count as creepy it was a legitimate and polite thing to ask he probably gets more nudes then the normal creeps
creepyPMs,removed,rfdr retarded font didnt read
creepyPMs,removed,wow you really showed him
creepyPMs,removed,ok you can argue its more harsh but im calling complete bullshit on scratchy
creepyPMs,removed,dude needs a dictionary stat and im guessing he could use a bib too
creepyPMs,removed,wut this is reddit none of this is important lol like oh no my internet points
creepyPMs,removed,abort the thread no pun intended or is there
creepyPMs,removed,so you skipped the lunch part
creepyPMs,removed,why if you hated it that much would you rub diced onions on yourself
creepyPMs,removed,yeah this isnt too creepy not that blatantly asking for nudes is good but if youre going to this is probably the way to do it
creepyPMs,removed,i think the font is worse than the fetish creep
creepyPMs,removed,i found this so funny
creepyPMs,removed,honest question why is that creepy part of dating is trying to be open about what you like im not into the fetish but asking your so to be apart of it and communicating is what should happen she wasnt and they broke up but why was that creepy
creepyPMs,removed,i wouldve taken the offer like thats
creepyPMs,removed,lol yes she needs our support she is a trooper god bless her honestly i dont know how she would survive unless we gave her support
creepyPMs,removed,omg are you okay thats sexual harassment can you do anything legally about this
creepyPMs,removed,yep theres a wiener in them there britches
creepyPMs,removed,bizarre yes creepy no
creepyPMs,removed,isnt this fake lol
creepyPMs,removed,haha kill yourselves please
creepyPMs,removed,tbh you must be vary naïve if you dont expect creeps in a sub with boob in the name
creepyPMs,removed,i dont get it i mean this person knows you well enough to mail a letter to your address and know what youve recently been up to im assuming theres more to the story if somone taking the time mail a handwritten letter is creepy though plus id love to get letters in the mail
creepyPMs,removed,see that prompt called block them oh of course you didnt that would be the rational thing to do
creepyPMs,removed,without any backstory to this this is just cringy at worst
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think he insulted you for being a single mom but still fuck him what a doucher
creepyPMs,removed,at least he wrote you a nice novel
creepyPMs,removed,there is nothing creepy here
creepyPMs,removed,are you blue if so arent you the one being weird
creepyPMs,removed,have you tried deleting the match
creepyPMs,removed,i can see that this guy is an aclass doucher but this really isnt a creepy message
creepyPMs,removed,a little depressing but it doesnt seem that creepy if anything the only creepy part is that it is a letter just kinda seems sad really seems like the sad creepy rather than the douche creepy but still creepy nonetheless interesting post
creepyPMs,removed,ive been looking for obese unattractive tumblrinas all day long im so glad i found this subreddit
creepyPMs,removed,well hard to believe someone would hit you up on purpose xd
creepyPMs,removed,bet youve been flirting for him for drugs kek
creepyPMs,removed,im having a hard time determining which one is creepy cmon america wtf there is two genders male and female sorry liberals and your insane genders
creepyPMs,removed,your notification bar game is sick
creepyPMs,removed,that doesnt look like a pm or even a text get over yourself
creepyPMs,removed,that person is a pedantic mother fucker who has no fucking idea how anything works i love most of all that they equate love with sex im going to guess its a woman who cries herself to sleep when she fucks a guy and tells herself that sex equals love so she doesnt feel like a slut
creepyPMs,removed,im convinced asexuality is not equivalent to being gay or lesbian so im sorta with grey message person
creepyPMs,removed,sue me but i dont think he was being particularly creepy here although it was disrespectful of him to push his agenda on you and act like he knows your sexuality better than you do
creepyPMs,removed,i know what putting a in front of a word means asexuality isnt something youre born with i guarantee most people who classify themselves as asexual have had traumatic sexual experiences in their life
creepyPMs,removed,there is nothing i could have said that others have not said already also this being reddit i hope youre not surprised at the randomness of some comments
creepyPMs,removed,in fairness you were leading him along and it seems like you were enjoying the attention the way you deal with these people is ignore and block
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair and im not trying to stick up for this guy or anything but i had sex with someone who thought they didnt like sex and it completely changed their mind about it some people just need to find the right person and this dude went about it entirely insensitive and completely the wrong way
creepyPMs,removed,eh youre both idiots
creepyPMs,removed,i think that was his way of complimenting you i think you need to turn the sensitivity down on your creepy detector
creepyPMs,removed,ubleakjavelinqqwerty me
creepyPMs,removed,no op is overreacting to a message of a sexual nature on a dating app that is designed for sexual encounters its like going to an ice cream shop and being offended when someone talks about their favorite ice cream
creepyPMs,removed,op is kink shaming ban her¡
creepyPMs,removed,i said hi to him
creepyPMs,removed,okay but what makes him creepy plenty of times youll see people on tinder and okc ask for hookups and it generally works for them not being interested doesnt equal creepy
creepyPMs,removed,so by that logic does that mean op is an asshole because of initial reply before the comment this comment gets removed rule etc just saying your explanation doesnt make the op look very good they should mod your comment because it may hurt the ops feelings actually mods can you just remove this whole subreddit all this hypocrisy is hurting my feelings so can you please fuck off and die before i cry irl
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,i disagree with both of your points but disagreeing with the second one is kind of why i disagree with the first one this person is very clearly mentally ill and it doesnt take a professional to recognise that in the same way it doesnt take a professional to recognise someone is physically ill and im not trying to treat it secondly mentally ill people are vulnerable and cant be held fully accountable for their actions this isnt just an opinion but is enshrined in law and therefore i dont think its fair to attribute creepiness to mentally ill people in the same way it would be unfair to attribute it to a mentally retarded person and in addition to all of this i think the identities of people should be protected where possible as this isnt about mob justice and this is particularly pertinent when mental illness is in play
creepyPMs,removed,im a bit confused didnt heshe only say hello gesture as a kind thing or am i taking this the wrong way because it seems im missing something everyone else gets
creepyPMs,removed,im confused he asks to meet up and you immediately insult him
creepyPMs,removed,when did he say that i must have missed that part
creepyPMs,removed,i and many other i know dont see hook up as wanting to bang given he was a dick after but she needlessly insulted him before
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,maybe you generation should stop making euphemisms out of harmless phrases then getting insulting us when we use them in their original form
creepyPMs,removed,i see that you completely ignored the paragraph i wrote about the sexual part
creepyPMs,removed,again like i mentioned doesnt seem creepy he just seems like a dick and was trying to neg her but thats not being creepy thats just being a dick
creepyPMs,removed,my point is that you cant reasonably expect everyone to keep up with all the new ones that are popping up our generation did make up plenty of euphemisms but we didnt demonize older people when they used the original terms in ways that we thought sounded gross because of our slang interpretation we just laughed and moved on
creepyPMs,removed,judging by the design and color scheme this is also a dating site ok cupid i believe so most likely hook up here means have the sex context context context plenty of people use dating sites for things other than sexual hook ups i prefer not to assume malicious intent if something can be reasonably explained by ignorance that said im creeped out by people asking to even meet me with the first message lets chat a little first so i know youre not a serial killer thats fair i still wouldnt reply with an insult
creepyPMs,removed,ive only ever heard the term used as a sexual euphemism a handful of times in my life the majority of the time its lets hook up with bill and stacy or lets hook up for lunch and plan our day ive heard the term used in a nonsexual way countless times i would never assume it to be sexual without getting clarification
creepyPMs,removed,maybe a decade
creepyPMs,removed,that would be the clarification i mentioned but that was after op had insulted him
creepyPMs,removed,slang didnt move around nearly as quickly before social media just because it was in use near you in the late didnt mean it was in use everywhere if it wasnt a tv or movie catch phrase it could sometimes take years for slang to catch on
creepyPMs,removed,i just wanted clarification why she was being mean to him right off the bat and everyone seemed shocked that there was more than one interpretation of a euphemism when thats literally what a euphemism is and now everyones upset with me for asking a goddamn question and clarifying my reasoning for the question i wasnt trying to spark up an argument
creepyPMs,removed,you insulted him and called him ugly first
creepyPMs,removed,oh cool no one else mentioned that yet thanks
creepyPMs,removed,what was their comment
creepyPMs,removed,yeah it can mean that i think it mostly does insulting the other person for reasons he asks for a hookup on a dating app she tells him hes ugly its only after that he responds with her not being so hot herself ok not the best come back of all time but she started off being directly insulting
creepyPMs,removed,not going to lie i like youre proud of this response and all but its not an effective response to be fair he could be telling the truth and just wants to fuck just to say he fucked
creepyPMs,removed,i guess so that is assuming they do have a malicious intent however and it could be possible that it who ever sent the to op really did only want to say hello i know having a stranger texting you out of the blue is weird enough but i dont think the intent here was to want something from op most of the texts i see here are usually hinting at stuff like that but i really dont see that here which is why i was confused kind of hard to judge a stranger from a bunch of text they sent over the internet when its bland like this without any revealing details other than going to now were going to the same party i could easily see myself in the same situation trying to text someone ive never met because we might be meeting each other
creepyPMs,removed,show themone ass cheek
creepyPMs,removed,love it used to do something similar for the same reasons ended up with a couple of really good friends with the same sick sense of humor win
creepyPMs,removed,i dont really feel this is horrible hes just trying to tell her he has feelings he didnt even proposition her the response was biting no less i have to wonder if theres more to the message we arent seeing
creepyPMs,removed,whats creepy about that heshe is just trying to be nice
creepyPMs,removed,im just kind of curious as to how hes messaging her on snapchat was he hitting on her and asked how to contact her and she gave him her snapchat if so she kind of invited it no
creepyPMs,removed,sadly youre not cute enough what a shity thing to say to someone
creepyPMs,removed,this is more cringey than creepy
creepyPMs,removed,all he said was hey do you wanna hookup all she had to say was no thanks not interested
creepyPMs,removed,and inside your panty a big throbbing wang
creepyPMs,removed,youre way police i would have blocked him much earlier no need to engage the creeps
creepyPMs,removed,i dont care how much he tips thats stupid and potentially dangerous hopefully this is a lesson learned
creepyPMs,removed,i dont really find the message all that creepy actually i think coming here and asking for an explanation is pretty needy maybe he is needy otherwise i dont know the point is sometimes shit doesnt work out the way we want it to
creepyPMs,removed,i think the point is that men rank most women to be more attractive then vice versa as in the average guy would rank about of women he sees as pretty while the average woman would only mark of the men she sees as good looking this is the unfair advantage as dictated by nature the guy goes on to rant in a manner that makes him seem insane but there is a core of truth that most women in this thread dont seem to realise
creepyPMs,removed,i got messaged by a big bad moderator you are definitely correct on the missings lol
creepyPMs,removed,look on the bright side your current username is one of the best games on nes
creepyPMs,removed,just get the ban out of the way already instead of threatening me on my mistake on not labeling my joke
creepyPMs,removed,dont leave us hanging
creepyPMs,removed,you pooped in this mans mouth lets just let that sink in for a minute
creepyPMs,removed,you all wonder why the crazy person you dated is acting crazy op litterally shit in this guys mouth and she is surprised that hes a fucking wierdo
creepyPMs,removed,you could argue that whether itd hold weight is a different matter considering guys generally do not care about a gals height as much as gals care about a guys height its not bad to feel confident it is pretty deceptive in my opinion to intentionally wear something to give someone a false impression i highly doubt hes wearing taller shoes for his confidence and more likely to appeal to gals who like height personally i think its a bit bias to claim rejecting someone based on their height makes someone not worth knowing as i highly doubt you dont have attraction preferences yourself so to think your preferencescriteria is somehow better than a person who has height in theirs is a bit skewed to me people like what they like to me it comes across like a guy approaching a gal based on his attraction to her yet getting pissy when hes rejected because she doesnt find him attractive
creepyPMs,removed,hey remember when you shit in his mouth
creepyPMs,removed,you were posting on the most toxic sub on reddit that sort of language is just how those bitter maladjusted women hating freaks say good morning to each other good luck on improving your life stay away from that disgusting sub
creepyPMs,removed,wow if there is any truth to this sounds like you and your mum are total cunts
creepyPMs,removed,exactly if youre and theyre youre a pedophile and should be locked away for good
creepyPMs,removed,im not doing it just because of the definition and more because of their quickly deleted forever alone posts about how if a girl is in puberty it shouldnt be illegal even if still underage but note taken for the future
creepyPMs,removed,third message was unncessecary but why didnt you at least respond during those hours
creepyPMs,removed,at least you get messaged you must be a chad of men are kissless virgins who have never once interacted with a female because females only want the top of males and somehow all females collectively manage to marry the top of males the world is a crazy place i suppose anyway stop flaunting your chadliness it is not becoming and it is cruel to the tips fedora
creepyPMs,removed,well someones a bit sensitive about being called cutie i see cringe in both sides of this conversation
creepyPMs,removed,this was just overreacting
creepyPMs,removed,im getting some cringe from op also you missed blocking out his face in a few of those screen caps
creepyPMs,removed,you gave him your number after meeting him in the parking lot
creepyPMs,removed,so even when a male is and successful he is not enough for your average mlady classic hypergamy if you ever change your mind and decide to lower your standards i am here i dont know you or what you look like but you sound beautiful i write poetry i love philosophy and im projected to be very wealthypowerful when im older tips fedora
creepyPMs,removed,aside from this guy being a caveman with a phone its not unknown for women in a commited relationship to invite someone of the opposite gender into their bed
creepyPMs,removed,like men are the only source of dick in the world well they kind of are even if there are great copies out there and toys that have been inspired by dicks the original source of those fake dicks are still the ones that came attached to men
creepyPMs,removed,i would argue that those dicks also came from men
creepyPMs,removed,fuck sign me up for a sugar momma from afar
creepyPMs,removed,where do i apply for a long distance sugar mama
creepyPMs,removed,as a straight dude i would totally go for a gay sugardaddyfromafar
creepyPMs,removed,in the future you can direct any potential long distance lesbian sugar mamas my way d
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt a creepy pm this is tinder this is a dude breaking the ice by using an unoriginal pickup line if you dont like that yous shouldnt be on tinder and definitely not walking into a joke like this i bet you carried on the conversation anyway
creepyPMs,removed,im gonna start using that line
creepyPMs,removed,isnt this an app designed so people can hook up i thought the entire premise of tinder was to have sex and the guy thought he was being funny
creepyPMs,removed,pretty sure you were the one with the creepy pm its pretty much common knowledge that you start off with a cheesy pickup line this is an app for people to meet up and fuck if you dont like it then dont use it
creepyPMs,removed,i find every creepy pm that is a tinder profile shot stupid its not like they have your number and are hitting you up and harrassing you during your day to day life you can unmatch them with button clicks generally a tinder opener that has to be something weird or goofy to get a response so the fact that it comes of as not normal isnt a surprise to me
creepyPMs,removed,til every opinion needs sources
creepyPMs,removed,huh so thats what counts as creepy these days
creepyPMs,removed,so a guy with a witty response which was obviously a joke is now creepy you must be fun at parties
creepyPMs,removed,he treated it like an opinion and said opinions needed sources in my unscientific opinion i agree with what youre saying since by nature theyre two genders which are supposed to be attracted to each other since the goal of nature is to reproducecontinue the genes i remember years ago in anthropology class there was a theory that homosexual arises whenever the population is too high as a means of population control ive never followed up that theory so i dont know how it holds up
creepyPMs,removed,ive seen many cheesy pickup lines on tinder this one not even close from being creepy though
creepyPMs,removed,correct me if im wrong but isnt that a hook up app what would you expect again not sure never used it
creepyPMs,removed,i know this is not marked as caw can i offer you an insight its not the famous getting a restraining order or the sort stay safe and best of luck
creepyPMs,removed,and white dudes wonder why everyone everyone hates them
creepyPMs,removed,hes probably upset that he doesnt have the balls to come out
creepyPMs,removed,tinder shouldnt really be allowed here
creepyPMs,removed,i realize that everyone that posts here feels creeped out but without more context i just dont think this was meant to be creepy just really terrible attempt at humor
creepyPMs,removed,stab him in the kidneeeyyy
creepyPMs,removed,replace asian with any fetish its ok to have but id rather not know that you like looking at girls feet
creepyPMs,removed,unless it works
creepyPMs,removed,i know everyone here is trying to be super sensitive and progressive but its a little over the top consider that maybe shes an adult with her own motives and choices and its pretty condescending and patronizing to dismiss someone like this or imply that you know their intentions better than they do ie her being embarrassed the next day this is totally paternalistic no one would make such excuses if the genders were reversed its not taking advantage of someone who is an adult and makes an advance further why should ops friend get to determine what his sister gets to have in life i understand withholding because of concern for the friendship but we should all recognize that no one should be able to determine some elses happiness like this
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt a creepy pm
creepyPMs,removed,without a screenshot this could all just be made up
creepyPMs,removed,take the money and ru
creepyPMs,removed,thats it this sub blows nowadays peace yall
creepyPMs,removed,one wordits moobs i lied theres a second wordits creep
creepyPMs,removed,im sorry if this is offending but what if he genuinely didnt know and was confused in a typical biological context most beings that are asexual also reproduce asexually is there something im missing
creepyPMs,removed,youre against bdsm i dont understand
creepyPMs,removed,give me your best shots mods ban me
creepyPMs,removed,hey what do you look like im not telling you end of conversation
creepyPMs,removed,a pretty indefensible stance other peoples ways of life are their own business obviously doesnt excuse the offensive messages though i dont know why people do this sort of thing whats it supposed to achieve
creepyPMs,removed,its actually spelled poussey and shes dead now
creepyPMs,removed,hahahahahah haji
creepyPMs,removed,isnt that really extreme he just likes to date white people and hes brazen about it why is it such a dealbreaker
creepyPMs,removed,i roll my eyes at the antibdsm stuff though i often respond anyway the stuff that really got to me was way she treated the narratives of other abuse victims and when she started saying some vaguely homophobic stuff in one of her comment still even after that she doesnt deserve pms like that on a sub like raskreddit it could easily be someone who just wants to troll and upset op rather than say anything to convince her shes wrong they probably didnt care what it would do to her opinions
creepyPMs,removed,well i dont see it that way its just how he talks using phrases he heard but doesnt fully understand
creepyPMs,removed,because that would be better and you assume the better option because hope
creepyPMs,removed,that was the translation you moron its deliberately exaggerated for comedic effect the actual message is below
creepyPMs,removed,will would you
creepyPMs,removed,being sexually interested in someone means you cant be their real friend i mean dont get me wrong if his intent was to create a situation like ops where its essentially sex in exchange for rent thats total shit but how does the act of expressing sexual desire towards someone youve known for years automatically make them false or insincere do most people just make friends with people who theyd never ever sleep with or what
creepyPMs,removed,ah see i dont judge the vulnerability of women based on vague references to hostile home situations so to be clear expressing sexual interest in someone with a dangerous home situation is distinctly predatory behavior does this apply to both genders whats the typical waiting period for someone leaving dangerous situations at home before youre allowed to express your feelings without it completely ruining years of friendship maybe i just have a poor perspective on the matter
creepyPMs,removed,pave hell woah slow down this was between consenting adults was open about giving them a place to stay and also about their attraction for that person and human needs she said no and they accepted that perfectly fine you make it to to be like they raped a child and then brutally murdered them this was like room sex no thanks
creepyPMs,removed,your phone theme is cancerous
creepyPMs,removed,no being honest and upfront with the other person about what you want is mature nice try to make them sound creepyweird though so i guess you would have wanted him to just assume a friends with benefits situation without ever discussing it and then for him to start making moves on her so that she is forced to feel uncomfortable and hurt why would you lie and be dishonest
creepyPMs,removed,maybe someone can help me out here how is this animal abuse i dont know anything about dogs but it would seem with a male dog on a female woman the dog wouldnt be getting hurt right again i know literally nothing about dogs my animal knowledge extends to horses and cats then im pretty much spent
creepyPMs,removed,sure its disgusting but i have a feeling the dog didnt mind i doubt it was forced at least
creepyPMs,removed,isnt that up for debate though i mean inserting things into animals is definitely wrong because yeah the animal has no consent to that however couldnt someone argue that an animal could want sexual relations like hasnt there been recorded incidents particularly between dolphins and humans not saying i approve just showing you the holes in the no consent argument also as a clear side note i am not condoning what creep did to op nor will i ever consent is key and harassment is bad always
creepyPMs,removed,nope are you having that much trouble reading
creepyPMs,removed,pointing out that its at least not abusing the dog
creepyPMs,removed,do animals consent to being slaughtered for food to being drafted into work i totally agree with the conclusion that bestiality is gravely disordered and wrong but i think you need a more robust framework than just consent because it is not consistent with how we ordinarily use animals
creepyPMs,removed,i think the people that fuck animals and the people that enjoy watching that shit need to be killed in the chest one in the head
creepyPMs,removed,i know crazy how some sick fucks actually buy two animals and let them have sex or even make them have sex just to get a fancier kind of dog or force a horse to have sex with a donkey just to get a mule absolutely disgusting
creepyPMs,removed,specifically based on a need people can survive without eating animal products in many cases its more efficient
creepyPMs,removed,when a dog humps someones leg thats not animal abuse so why is his insertion suddenly considered abuse thats where i get confused and dont quite understand the logic its all semantics to me its illegal taboo and morally wrong but i dont understand why its considered animal abuse when the animal is not being hurt
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know about setting him on fire for watching it maybe for sending it being smug about it and imposing it on another person
creepyPMs,removed,is actually still pretty good though
creepyPMs,removed,but your my sweaty lol dont worry im an asshole
creepyPMs,removed,it seems like you had the power to turn a racist into a gentle and loving man too bad you blew it now youll never find true love
creepyPMs,removed,seems like a joke to me but eh what do i know
creepyPMs,removed,im not defending bestiality but sex with animals is not illegal or considered abuse in all places even within the us so before reporting ensure that it is illegal or can be prosecuted
creepyPMs,removed,you were way too polite to that guy
creepyPMs,removed,so by not up for debate you mean only one side right just to clarify because it seems like half the debate is remaining up
creepyPMs,removed,holy shit as a man who has been active on reddit for nearly years ive never gotten an unsolicited pm god that sucks for women
creepyPMs,removed,this is more like cringe than it is creepy
creepyPMs,removed,if you need him hell be in his lab sorry
creepyPMs,removed,yeah but we cant see what was removed so
creepyPMs,removed,how does this even happen on reddit i guess you posted a picture or something
creepyPMs,removed,in fairness when face to face cup size is pretty easy to estimate without asking
creepyPMs,removed,you would do poorly in bangkok
creepyPMs,removed,well he is obviously not a genuine nice guy but you can argue that your first response wasnt exactly nice either
creepyPMs,removed,its pathetic that this sub cant take criticism or hell that it doesnt allow different opinions
creepyPMs,removed,i posted i think its a joke but eh what do i know also yes im getting punished for following a rule but its a such a fucking stupid rule enjoy your safe space
creepyPMs,removed,if thats you i wouldnt be getting too picky
creepyPMs,removed,my advice is dont engage these people in the first place
creepyPMs,removed,ball size cos thats what you gonna get sonny
creepyPMs,removed,dont creep in the foot while he was honestly trying to be sure
creepyPMs,removed,good chemistry ok lets get it on so rohypnol
creepyPMs,removed,what did he say
creepyPMs,removed,go to the sidebar in the flair part where it says edit click on that and choose from the list of flairs available
creepyPMs,removed,i took it as chop busting but i get the situation did you ask how he meant it
creepyPMs,removed,i just feel bad for him he seems so desperate
creepyPMs,removed,you missed a name a couple times on and also holy fucking shit this guy is mentally ill
creepyPMs,removed,why are you so friendly lmfao tell him to fuck off
creepyPMs,removed,this dude isnt a creep hes ill his baggage obviously includes mental illness and id bet money he stopped taking his meds recently i wonder how far he took his delusional obsessions with selena gomez and ty like hopefully its just in his head and hes not mailing them vials of his blood or something kinda scary how he says if he ever got with selena theyd both die
creepyPMs,removed,mental illness looks like severe manic phase of bipolar disorder the delusions concerning celebrities is also notable
creepyPMs,removed,sure this guy was high on coke meth adderall or any combination of those with booze quite possibly the most delusional thing ive read in a very long time im realistically going to become a billionaire bahahh
creepyPMs,removed,omg he has to be mentally unwellthis is just beyond words
creepyPMs,removed,im not qualified to diagnose mental illness and certainly not off the basis of text messages only but id bet a months pay this guys having some mental illness episode its aaaalmost like erotomania in that hes targeted women who dont know him and developed elaborate fantasies in which he has relationships with them op really hope this guy doesnt show up at your gfs place
creepyPMs,removed,this guy must have some mental health issues i think it would be frigtening to be the focus of this kind of obsessive behaviour
creepyPMs,removed,they were my favorite bits too dude needs serious psychological help
creepyPMs,removed,needless to say she should probably block him
creepyPMs,removed,your gf was texting him at some point its kind of obvious bro
creepyPMs,removed,i wonder if he took some sort of drug that put his mind in a state where he could spontaneously text a runon novel to her this is beyond the normal creepy weird its like that disheveled guy downtown you see pacing back and forth talking to himself thats entirely focused on his own conversation with god knows what
creepyPMs,removed,well to be honest he has a point a person is not your property
creepyPMs,removed,an age is not objectively creepy ignoring your boundaries is sure but an age difference is not inherantly creepy
creepyPMs,removed,this was terrifying beginning to end change your number i feel that simply blocking isnt enough to escape this
creepyPMs,removed,this makes me very sad because im pretty sure that man is legitimately ill i know this sub throws mental illness around sometimes but this man seems to be schizophrenic or manic its not easy diagnosing someone off of so little but the man is displaying actual delusions
creepyPMs,removed,no this is a sick person that needs help
creepyPMs,removed,hi sorry for the stupid question but whats trper
creepyPMs,removed,this is mental illness right here delusions of grandeur to the max seems like a manic episode for sure feel bad for both parties here and i hope he gets help he clearly needs it
creepyPMs,removed,that battery level is really stressing me out
creepyPMs,removed,god i lost it when he said he was sober when he sent all those late night texts and when he said he was only delusional in some aspects of life just this behavior makes me genuinely think that he maybe slightly autistic high functioning for sure but he definitely lacks quite a bit social communications that makes me think hes not completely there mentally
creepyPMs,removed,be firm with him through your text youll make him think that youre playing hard to get with him this is really fking creepy
creepyPMs,removed,wouldnt have a clue im relatively a newbie your coworker sounds dangerous those texts are not normal make sure he doesnt go postal
creepyPMs,removed,ya this is textbook mental illness he is most likely in a maniac phase with delusions of grandeur
creepyPMs,removed,i would set this guy up with a mental health professional that amount of messages shows a serious problem and i worry for his safety if simply blocking him his the end of it
creepyPMs,removed,either op is a bit a of a phony or his girlfriends isare cursed
creepyPMs,removed,it seemed like she was replying deleted messages on client side
creepyPMs,removed,either he is a complete sperg or she was in his no effort fuck once bucket
creepyPMs,removed,how tall is the girlfriend
creepyPMs,removed,drugs with a side of mental illness hes delusional about his relationship with multiple women including op and celebrities
creepyPMs,removed,what a ride obviously something wrong with him though im not endorsing a response but somewhere along his life he encountered mental difficulties and is hoping this reachout will solve it he needs help
creepyPMs,removed,if i had to guess its methamphetamines ive sent lengthy emotionally charged essay texts to my girlfriend on meth and other amphetamines that could qualify for this subreddit fortunately they were not so cringey and my girlfriend is not exactly a stranger but i can totally see myself in this dudes shoes if the circumstances were different on stimulants like that everything feels so right and you feel so in love with whoever is on your mind even if it is completely irrational essays that ive written for university while on meth have turned out to become words of incomprehensible garbage even though i thought i was writing the gospel at the time of the length of these texts the loveyness of them all makes sense if this guy was flying high
creepyPMs,removed,even fabricated some thingslike the tattoo thats a good point i hadnt thought of it kind of clinches it for me im pretty sure that hes having some kind of mental problem id actually hope that the op gets in touch with this dudes parents and at least lets them know that maybe there is some mental health issue that needs looking into
creepyPMs,removed,this is one of the most insane things ive ever seen this would be grounds for a restraining order or some other kind of legal action imo he has a fixation and he is clearly mentally ill your gf needs to take steps for her own safety no fucking joke
creepyPMs,removed,nope this guy has mental issues his train of thought is pretty much textbook flight of ideas
creepyPMs,removed,im calling his mates or someone stole his phone this is too well put together as a joke
creepyPMs,removed,still trying to figure out why he has ops gfs number lol
creepyPMs,removed,youre right its not her responsibility but it would be the nice human thing to do and try and help a human who is clearly mental even if its just hey your son needs help can you not talk about me and get him help so he doesnt kill me
creepyPMs,removed,well from this ethical point of view it is not your responsibility to report the violence committed to you in a robbery this dude needs help before he harms someone or himself his condition is very treatable i think just sending this stream of messages to a psychiatric department or the police instead of posting it on reddit would be enough for him to taken into involuntary psychiatric care
creepyPMs,removed,this is incredibly hard to read and im sorry for you to deal with this my brother is schizoeffective and i am all too familiar with this kind of stuff he talks about these girls he barely knows and how hes in love with them im guilty of looking at his phone and ive seen insane text messages like this i really hope this was just a random episode and is the end of your experience with him my brother has been obsessed with this one girl he briefly dated over the summer years ago for about years now its not a pleasant experience for anyone involved
creepyPMs,removed,im curious how much of the conversation they deleted
creepyPMs,removed,op this guys does not sound like a normal well adjusted human being please look into restraining orders and blocking him from accessing your gfs social media if you know his family please forward this to them it really sounds like he needs help he sounds like the type of person that could quickly turn his i must have her attitude into if i cant have her no one can and life isnt worth living
creepyPMs,removed,exacctly my ex gfs old abusive boyfriend is on gf and screws most of them tried to rape my ex cause she said no to anything other than hj being guy pulled a knife on me and i had to beat the shit out of him with a poll waiting for cops kicked the jack out of a golf cart the land mantaners were fixing set fire to a highschool bathroom showed up naked to exs houses on the same day to unload shotguns at their houses and had to be tazed by a cop stole a beehive and just got out of the loony bin after he smashed his car through the police precinct over them towing his truck guy has a constent stream of girls sometimes at once because he has that retard confidence and we live in a southern back alley and im guessing his confederat flag tattoo has magic abilities
creepyPMs,removed,had this been messages written over the course of a year im sure the evaluation would be a loner with little to no chance of doing any harm but this is a manic episode and a quite extreme one at that a medical professional would certainly react upon this as a man that could be on the brink of determining to jump out a bridge hang himself or shoot himself the threat to others has to be quite substantial but the threat of an imminent suicide is usually reacted promptly upon
creepyPMs,removed,it has to be fake no one would write that much without one response
creepyPMs,removed,were just looking at mental illness here its creepy but in a more walking past a crazy homeless lady at night kind of way
creepyPMs,removed,this guy reeks of a manic episode bpd
creepyPMs,removed,im assuming a manic episode didnt read beyond the first dozen screenshots
creepyPMs,removed,mental illness
creepyPMs,removed,i call bullshit poes law and such
creepyPMs,removed,doctor here might include some substance use ie cocaine or meth but pure bipolar delusional disorder schizophrenia etc can do this too christmas stress can be a huge trigger or he could have something else medical like a brain tumor thats causing behavior like this not likely but possible people going through something like this should be helped not mocked he can be treated and he would probably go back to being a healthy welladjusted person ive scrolled through the entire thread and while a few people point out that this behaviour is consistent with a psychiatric episode i dont see anyone suggesting the best way to help him and yourself please phone the police nonemergency line and inform them in case youre wondering if this is really serious enough to call the cops the answer is yes he is ill enough that is affecting the way he functions hes probably a lot worse off than hes showing many police stations have special teams that respond to situations like this ie a squad car with a nurse and a cop this way he can be taken to a hospital to get the help he needs before he goes too far and threatens your safety and his own im not saying he will but its a possibility if he becomes more ill best wishes to you and your gf
creepyPMs,removed,i feel bad for him because hes clearly suffering some kind of mental episode but holy fucking shit this surely has won the sub
creepyPMs,removed,she shouldnt have responded at all or she should have been like wrong number lmao
creepyPMs,removed,is that really creepy not trying to challenge you to an internet joust or anything but it just seems like this guy is misinformed and awkward is there more to it
creepyPMs,removed,and this is how you get murdered
creepyPMs,removed,change your phone number immediately a close friend of mine starting acting this way and his condition just got worst and worst the sad part is that he thinks hes being sincere and endearing and when people reacted poorly then he got violent and angry i had to break off all ties and block him from every social media site
creepyPMs,removed,you really care about internet forums keep up great work
creepyPMs,removed,well thats a stupid rule
creepyPMs,removed,install security cameras
creepyPMs,removed,please get the police involved sooner rather than later this is about levels deeper than regular creepy
creepyPMs,removed,i would seriously not have posted this at all but would delete it now if i were op youre putting your gf in serious risk of being her life made a living hell by a seriously disturbed person
creepyPMs,removed,okay come on that line is gold you better steal that because i already have do my friends dont believe retards can well show em lil buddy
creepyPMs,removed,demi is made up
creepyPMs,removed,i mean dude seemed pretty genuinely honest in his social awkwardness and knew it too he even apologized profusely and preemptively
creepyPMs,removed,wow came here for the armchair psych comments nevermind fuck this lame sub who isnt thinking up the name for whatever is wrong with this clown enjoy your boring arbitrarily restricted sub
creepyPMs,removed,the mods here are absolutely nuts i dont know if theres another sub with more rules than this sub so many fun convos are shut down by the mods its very odd on such a silly sub
creepyPMs,removed,everything you do here is a violation theres so many very very specific rules here and half the the time the mods themselves dont follow them its very arbitrary
creepyPMs,removed,deeeeng he proved you wrong
creepyPMs,removed,you guys just shit in everyones cereal be ashamed of yourself
creepyPMs,removed,didnt say date him said that line is gold op needs to steal it great for future creeps too
creepyPMs,removed,civil and supportive i didnt say date the guy said steal that line
creepyPMs,removed,think of the potential guy isnt taking a hint you slap that down impassible wall he knows he cant comment or else bam hes a retard and he admitted it now it goes way beyond this i tell ya you know those please be neat wipe the seat signs now its the ultimate passive aggressive sign saying pee on the floors again the staff doesnt believe retards can pee on floors youll show em lil buddymaintenance
creepyPMs,removed,what if i change it to poo poo head
creepyPMs,removed,i totally did but then he transitioned to being a woman so i just keep his dismembered member in a jar and look at it longingly
creepyPMs,removed,scrolled too far tusk act hello
creepyPMs,removed,he seemed pretty respectful though also awkward and inexperienced the messages are more cringey than creepy
creepyPMs,removed,lololololololololololol this is fucking gold may want to post this comment in the incredibly popular post at the top of the page lol
creepyPMs,removed,yea thats what your mom said last night
creepyPMs,removed,why didnt you block him after the first one
creepyPMs,removed,why respond in the first place why not block him after the first dick pic
creepyPMs,removed,well are you a asking for a friend
creepyPMs,removed,you didnt say no until the last screenshot which is probably why he kept going i guess he should have gotten it anyways though
creepyPMs,removed,they do seem to enjoy it though its very rare that ive seen him get told to fuck off right from the get go and like i said he lays out his personality in the profile so these women know exactly what they are getting into before they interact with him and even after hes a dick to them they just laugh it off until he pushes harder or they ignore his raunchiness and try to get to know him
creepyPMs,removed,fair enough maybe more of him being dense rather than creepy though
creepyPMs,removed,why are you making so many assumptions youre literally trying to draw out a narrative from simple sentences all im saying is just like sterotypes arent reflective of an entire population getting bad messages doesnt mean all will be bad not that you are obligated to respond but im sure theres a middle ground between being a total dick and being completely compliant
creepyPMs,removed,whats the context i would say thats more wtf than creepy
creepyPMs,removed,i think its more funny than creepy tbh
creepyPMs,removed,are you actually transgendered
creepyPMs,removed,he was probably trolling
creepyPMs,removed,obviously just trolling
creepyPMs,removed,typical mideastern descent courtship
creepyPMs,removed,hey you wanna go out sorry i cant because i broke my leg yesterday oh i have the cure to broken leg bones it will heal up in seconds i said im not interested god
creepyPMs,removed,ask him if he wants a blowjob
creepyPMs,removed,im sorry please tell me which specific rule i broke please
creepyPMs,removed,you know when you block out the names with the same color it makes it hard to follow and actually it looks like its just you talking to yourself itd look better if the left was just cropped off
creepyPMs,removed,i stalked a sociopath for a few months once and also met other sociopaths i didnt wanted have to do much with so yeah you are stalking him who are you to judge
creepyPMs,removed,no wonder you think this is creepy your reading comprehension was way off he has friends most of which are female not female friends
creepyPMs,removed,what an asshole pm me op i think you and i would be a good match
creepyPMs,removed,getting hit in the face with neckbeard dick all day errday would suck so whats your gamertag mlady
creepyPMs,removed,wait does your username stand for gondor wild
creepyPMs,removed,and this is the road that leads to a sad lonely miserable life with a company of many cats
creepyPMs,removed,hahhaa you are sad pathetic and will be lonely and blue unnecessary attitude kys
creepyPMs,removed,make some skrilla off of that shit
creepyPMs,removed,for any particular reason or just because
creepyPMs,removed,sooooooo how big are they
creepyPMs,removed,you know unfriending and ignoring someone who is inappropriate on your social media feeds is actually the most adult way of dealing with this kind of thing verbally sparring with someone online for the purposes of posting the conversation to another social media outlet would probably not be most people idea of dealing with it glad things worked out though
creepyPMs,removed,his life is miserable without you the reason he keeps pestering you best not to reply as this gives him hope
creepyPMs,removed,why even humor the guy i would just block him and be done with it
creepyPMs,removed,no contact with an ex is a pretty solid life tip when a woman says shes not or no longer interested you should believe her not only that but remaining friends on social media after a breakup one person didnt want can be psychologically damaging if you regularly see updates even if the breakup was amicable you can always remain friends but not follow their posts
creepyPMs,removed,why bother talking to him
creepyPMs,removed,stop responding to him
creepyPMs,removed,as i mentioned in my comments it depends on the breakup for most heterosexual men it is very solid life advice to avoid contact with an ex if shes the one who initiated the breakup specifically for legal reasons
creepyPMs,removed,pics
creepyPMs,removed,im genuinely curious why do you bother responding you are obviously terse with him so im wondering why hes worth the thought
creepyPMs,removed,stop talking to him
creepyPMs,removed,i may not have explicitly stated depending on the breakup but i alluded to the fact that this applied to breakups in which one has not initiated the end of the relationship especially if the breakup was less than amicable in these instances as a heterosexual man it is inadvisable to make contact with the woman period
creepyPMs,removed,report him to facebook for contacting you from multiple accounts he can get banned from facebook on both accounts d
creepyPMs,removed,hey its me a cactus
creepyPMs,removed,obviously im just a stranger and dont know the details of your relationship but this comment really makes me feel like he has mental health issues its common for abusers to become infatuated and obsessed with their victims after they break up to the point of even harmingstalking them several years later it may be wise to ignore all contact attempts from him just be careful is all im saying
creepyPMs,removed,pics as a joke in response to the joke about fucking a cactus despite the down votes i still think its funny
creepyPMs,removed,ah yes the emasculated cuckold he wants to discuss the idea and h o w it would you i or him feel as he got off on the fantasy the cuckold is one of the fetishes i find most hard to comprehend the desire to watch another more virile dominant male have sex with their significant other as they watch and possibly really ridiculed during they desire the humiliation of watching a perceived alpha male with their partner and often has the small penis humiliation fetish mixed in the whole you are not man enough for me i need a real man being the idea i just dont get why these guys try it on with women who have shown no interest in their specific fetish why not contact other cuckold fetishists and have a discussion together
creepyPMs,removed,the send nudes thing is a meme and i have to say i rather enjoyed this one even if it is a bit of a stretch
creepyPMs,removed,say its not that creepy then post to creepypmslol
creepyPMs,removed,so does that make it gay if i want to suck your nips
creepyPMs,removed,as a straight dude id suck a mean dick for
creepyPMs,removed,yes of course its been removed the assumption is always that the op is absolutely right no matter what and there will be no questioning of anything ever got it
creepyPMs,removed,nah you got what you deserved
creepyPMs,removed,called a joke
creepyPMs,removed,oh my god i laughed cried its tough to accept guys like this exist in real life almost as a standard an ex came to my apt for dinner the other night and one of her facebook friends pulled some shit like this it was funny until it went on for entirely too long i have trouble understanding why she didnt call him a pathetic retard and tell him to fuck off i mean it is going to be awkward trying to maintain a friendship after someone propositions you to hook up and then begs for a reason what he did wrong for why not
creepyPMs,removed,what iasip quote is relevant here is there a reference i missed
creepyPMs,removed,this is pretty hilarious
creepyPMs,removed,this is hilarious i would of sent nudes straight away
creepyPMs,removed,might not be the way they meant it but just in case in south africa its perfectly acceptable to talk of coloured people mostly descendants of the malaysian slaves that were brought to the cape of good hope to work on the farms but also from the prostitution and marriage of black people by white people that resulted in pregnancy they have a culture very akin to the afrikaners or boers and dont like being put in the same group as black people because of many cultural differences and sometimes serious racial bias technically it comes down to the language they speak and the culture they belong to but what americans would call a lightskinned black person is commonly called a coloured person here
creepyPMs,removed,this is hilarious just sent this to my husband the send nudes thing is a meme
creepyPMs,removed,i mean he made the wrong assumption ended the conversation without name calling or getting shitty dude was just embarrassed
creepyPMs,removed,haha thats funny i think theyre joking
creepyPMs,removed,why should we change how we use words because a few people on reddit disagree hooking up is used in a tone of movies as well as in real life and the intention is not to have sex its to hang out
creepyPMs,removed,no one is arguing clearly stating a point
creepyPMs,removed,if youre engaged why are you on a dating site
creepyPMs,removed,why did you accept his friend request if you have never had any contact with him
creepyPMs,removed,i never understood the point of that dating sites are already a nightmare especially for women why would you put yourself through that when you just want to meet people to chill
creepyPMs,removed,asking about deepthroating as a first message is as shallow as your profile and meaningless existence wouldve been a good response too
creepyPMs,removed,why did you accept the friend request but did not respond to the first hi he wrote there was nothing wrong with that at the time the first hi was written of course
creepyPMs,removed,oh wow you dodged a bullet a guy messaging you saying hi this is so creepy i cant even
creepyPMs,removed,more asshole and less creepy
creepyPMs,removed,really though so someone you added as a friend now wants to try to talk to you shocking
creepyPMs,removed,just pushed a midget off a bridge into the path of a speeding train impressed eh
creepyPMs,removed,youre friends with him on facebook yet dont bother to see if he did indeed get a girlfriend
creepyPMs,removed,see i dont know the app you guys are using so i have no idea if what he is saying is crazy or normal
creepyPMs,removed,suuuuper bored found his fb he follows one person of course its op sooo creepy stay far away from this guy holy hell and edit the picture with the screenshot in it maybe
creepyPMs,removed,pansexual eyeroll
creepyPMs,removed,i feel like op is the weirdo here
creepyPMs,removed,aw poor soul give him a break
creepyPMs,removed,not sure if boy or girl
creepyPMs,removed,he wasnt that weird about it at least and he doesnt seem persistent these are positives
creepyPMs,removed,it could just be her picking up on a nonexistent romantic interest an honest mistake no need to jeopardize her employment really
creepyPMs,removed,as far as this sub goes not too bad
creepyPMs,removed,cant blame a guy for asking p
creepyPMs,removed,alternatively girl on fetlife wont stop replying to guy she has already turned down
creepyPMs,removed,you honestly think a person who goes to great lengths to laminate your comments so he can wipe his ejaculation off is a creep where are your priorities im sure if the cumbox guy wrote you youd already be planning your wedding grow up
creepyPMs,removed,that one reply was harsh lol
creepyPMs,removed,i love this im stealing this and sending it to random users from now on
creepyPMs,removed,it actually looks a lot like some replies were deleted
creepyPMs,removed,apache junction new river geez man where is this going down
creepyPMs,removed,the boldness of the move would almost be admirable if not for the straight up creep factor cuz its never some hot guy being a perv its going to ne some meth mouthed whack job or old ass smelly alcoholic
creepyPMs,removed,of course
creepyPMs,removed,you didnt flag the other user who said the exact same thing but sure and for the record there was nothing shameful about my comment just a hypersensitive gross misinterpretation of what somebody wanted to see so they could point a finger and blow a whistle
creepyPMs,removed,are my smileys outdated not up on the newfangled emoticons and emoji my sarcasm tags take place in pure ascii sorry
creepyPMs,removed,the aspergers is strong with this one
creepyPMs,removed,you let that go on way longer than it needed to
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt actually a threat though
creepyPMs,removed,does this persons username start with a b or a c perhaps
creepyPMs,removed,i mean whats the app if its tinder then idk what you expected if its like church meet ups then yeah i can understand
creepyPMs,removed,it isnt vaccines its talking to people like this that cause autism
creepyPMs,removed,is this really creepy pm material he backed off after you responded negatively
creepyPMs,removed,if im correct the thick blue line on the left of the messages means she saved his so im assuming they had a convo because of this plus how hes wording stuff yet she didnt save hers if this is the case then why
creepyPMs,removed,i do read them as i said this has only happened a few times and yes it was my mistake to trust the website to be filtering properly all im saying is that if i tell okc to filter out women who are not looking for men and it still shows me some that are not thats a problem with the website that can easily lead to mistakes like this
creepyPMs,removed,i would just send him dick pic that way he would leave me alone with a comment like if you want to hop on this you can otherwise hop off
creepyPMs,removed,so i call this one a creepy tie
creepyPMs,removed,now thats what im talking about an honest to goodness creepy pm way too many post are pissing contest between two weirdos
creepyPMs,removed,im definitely gonna get banned but i find it hilarious you goto a board meant for losers to vent to taunt them so you can get angry pms you can then post out of context hilarious a trolling im not saying this to insult you i really think it is hilariously clever and funny im an asshole myself im certain pulling back the curtain is bannable here but i want to say you are my favorite troll on reddit this is the highest of compliments
creepyPMs,removed,other than two dudes talking crap to each other i fail to see what makes the other person creepier also you sorta got owned op
creepyPMs,removed,one can hope they die alone untouched virgins or my preferential way for them to die would be to flay them alive keeping them conscious as i slowly cut them apart inch by inch and feed em to my dogs
creepyPMs,removed,i swear the internet is a small penisinferior masculinity detector bet hes hung like a pink jelly bean
creepyPMs,removed,why bother responding i dont get it these people are not gonna change their ways just because you prove that youre better than them they get more sex than youd imagine thats why they go on a dating site and message women with casual sex on their profiles cause when you feel like a commoditysome other women enjoy the flirting and or the dirty talking i get the vibe that you didnt get on the page to get dates but to purposely search for guys to send you messages so you could postem here
creepyPMs,removed,i guess i broke a rule which one i cant quite tell but i dont get it anyhow
creepyPMs,removed,it must be tough discovering youve got a fetish its a taboo but youve got to come out for it if you want to find someone whos on the same level thats like learning how to talk to girls all over again
creepyPMs,removed,thats the stalker they like all the info they can get
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,so heres the thing just asking i dont see the problem up front hey this is what im here for id like to know if you are too i dont see a problem with that personally as long as its presented in a respectful way although id like to hear other opinions too oh er because if you do i totally dont want to talk to you is just cringeworthy
creepyPMs,removed,thats when you just post your address and say i got all day pumpkin
creepyPMs,removed,interest probably perhaps the belief that a websites calculations are not a good indicator of compatibility and conversation is more useful its a little weird to me as someone who hasnt internet dated to see people put so much stock in what the computer says
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,im not sure you understand how date sites work s what a nutcase you gotta buy her dinner first atlest
creepyPMs,removed,so you just want to bully people im not a fucking neckbeard i was just trying to have some fun go harass someone else
creepyPMs,removed,yet you know this and still play along
creepyPMs,removed,that guy has huge balls
creepyPMs,removed,im not sure what you think adult friend finder is but thats definitely what its for friend finder fetish and sexual talk
creepyPMs,removed,adult friend finder is more of a sexual fantasy fetish threesomes kind of friend finder not so much dating
creepyPMs,removed,who the fuck wastes their time going back and forth like that with a wrong number seems pointless
creepyPMs,removed,weiner chick
creepyPMs,removed,dude you cant match on tinder then ignore the guy thats bullshit
creepyPMs,removed,adult friend finder is a sexual fantasy threesome fetish and hookup friend finder site unfortunately some people dont lead into discussing those properly and come on way too strong
creepyPMs,removed,maybe you should switch to another friend acquisition site this one is kind of notorious for that being as its a kink and fetish friend finder a lot of men on there dont seem to know how to talk to women properly
creepyPMs,removed,i am a bot on behalf of reddit i would like to thank you for your honesty we live in harried times honesty is in short supply thats why when you go out of your way to assure the reddit community that your comment is honest i honestlybot have made it my mission to thank you
creepyPMs,removed,compared to the dudes who flip out and start name calling this guy is cool
creepyPMs,removed,so youre on adultfriendfinder and dont expect to get messages like this you are on the wrong website buddy
creepyPMs,removed,i know ill get downvoted but thats lame yes hes a creep but youre just being a dick too wrongs dont make a right there are better ways of handling that this is like keying someones car because they cheat on you be the better manwoman
creepyPMs,removed,this is somewhat creepy but i dont disagree with of what hes saying feminists are generally very self righteous and bigoted kudos to him for sticking up for us
creepyPMs,removed,i want to guess that you spoiled the negan kill
creepyPMs,removed,eghappinysegg
creepyPMs,removed,dang why would she make a rule like that you must have been a little shit haha
creepyPMs,removed,not cool
creepyPMs,removed,that seems really strange that a teacher would allow everyone but you to break common classroom rules are you actually telling us the same lies you told your parents and expecting us to believe them too youre a little shit arent you
creepyPMs,removed,im copying word for word what the comment reply another user said before the mod decided she didnt agree adult friend finder is more of a sexual fantasy fetish threesomes kind of friend finder not so much dating unfortunately because of this purpose that the website actually serves people will often send messages like this they dont intend to be creepy but it will happen that some people just come on way too strong there is a disclaimer about the websites purposes when you sign up an account
creepyPMs,removed,shes on a power trip and deletes all of my friends comments every time she makes on in this sub deletes things not because of rules but because she doesnt agree with someone powertripping
creepyPMs,removed,glenn dies
creepyPMs,removed,the same people who whoop and holler over spoilers have a big overlap with those who whine over trigger warnings
creepyPMs,removed,just shows guys will fuck anything with a vag when they come to their senses after getting rejected they realize how ugly the fat cow actually is
creepyPMs,removed,wow youre kind of an asshole
creepyPMs,removed,op cant take a joke
creepyPMs,removed,im assuming theres a solid reason why you were singled out
creepyPMs,removed,so because he used a bad line you spoiled the show for him thats fucked up
creepyPMs,removed,so what was the spoiler
creepyPMs,removed,i think this is a bit harsh yeah he asks something inappropriate but it could just as well be someone trying a line that just is a bit much funny but not cool
creepyPMs,removed,oh i do
creepyPMs,removed,this is more funny than creepy lol rat ads
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand why didnt you just unmatch him when you lost interest
creepyPMs,removed,i was just trying to voice my opinion ill refrain from doing so next time sir
creepyPMs,removed,ah some good ol slutshaming to top off my day thanks boys
creepyPMs,removed,was there a reason you didnt just unmatch him
creepyPMs,removed,why didnt you just unmatch him when he started getting creepy
creepyPMs,removed,that opening line is actually hilarious
creepyPMs,removed,pranks gone wrong you wont believe how number two inch fell short
creepyPMs,removed,i mean to be fair he did seem to comprehend why what he said was wrong maybe he learned something
creepyPMs,removed,what is wrong with just writing immediately sorry no offence but i am not interested in you and leave it at that why leave the guy hanging that is rude in my opinion
creepyPMs,removed,i think its fair to met him know if you guys have been messaging his reaction however is hilarious
creepyPMs,removed,i get that this woman was just a creep but you guys are being pretty transphobic obviously people should disclose their genital status before the clothes come off but holy shit
creepyPMs,removed,tldr
creepyPMs,removed,youre one weird dude to engage with them for that long am doesnt even exist in my book a guy could wake me up at am to tell me my bed is on fire and id spend less than half a word telling them to fuck off and going back to sleep p
creepyPMs,removed,baby once you experience this dick youll be all up on that being bi ¡ what you say gorgeous
creepyPMs,removed,dont you dare talk about my mistress like that shes amazing especially when shared with my best friends
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand how any of these go that long i just block people the first time they get creepy guess it doesnt make for funny posts that way
creepyPMs,removed,did he stop messaging you if so then hes such a bad guy really ive heard of guys who wont let go
creepyPMs,removed,everyones a dude to me i think i must have unknowingly watched a few stoner movies when i was but a child and put dude in the genderneutral box in my mind being a silly foreigner like that sorry though because i definitely just subconsciously assumed you were a guy thanks for taking it like the innocent mistake it is rather than a deeply rooted problem in todays society youre a cool dude no wait
creepyPMs,removed,paragraphs are your friend
creepyPMs,removed,whats weird is the fact that you kept responding to him for so long
creepyPMs,removed,why do you even continue texting
creepyPMs,removed,looks like it was a genuine question depending if you actually looked naked in your picture
creepyPMs,removed,dont feed the troll
creepyPMs,removed,no to be a dick or nothing but you kinda shoulda probobly ignored him instead of feeding into him tldr do not feed the troll
creepyPMs,removed,he doesnt see it as sexist to basically state all women have to offer a guy is their looks im guessing hes american
creepyPMs,removed,tbf though ive met a few girls in my life where the yin to the biological yang clock ticked and my thought was put a baby in her he could have used a little foreplay with it though at least ask for a date first
creepyPMs,removed,why not just block him
creepyPMs,removed,why u message him back if it dat creepy
creepyPMs,removed,a man that has the courage to send you a picture of his flaccid penis after years from what you have told us should not be shamed but placed on a pedestal it takes a big man no pun intended to do such a act of heroism
creepyPMs,removed,feel free to downvote me but how come you didnt just tell him you were out of town and will send the package soon wouldve saved both of you a lot of trouble
creepyPMs,removed,no fixing needed my manor woman takes a big person to be comfortable with their body at its most vulnerable state man or woman the fact that he is willing to share that with her must mean she is some one very important to him yes its a crude way of showing it but its also a symbol of trust dont take what i say in a wrong way but theres always two sides to a story right you always have to see light in the darkness
creepyPMs,removed,i agree it is vulgar but what i am saying is that it is rare for a man to have or even less likely send to a woman with out having a extreme amount of courage in assuming you have received dick pics with the way your coming at me but answer me this how many were flaccid and be honest a man prides him self in his penis according to most women so why in gods green earth would he send a picture of for lack of better words his soft dick
creepyPMs,removed,fake
creepyPMs,removed,eat dick
creepyPMs,removed,why dont you just block him
creepyPMs,removed,fuck you more
creepyPMs,removed,its the internet people can say things and not be held accountable
creepyPMs,removed,how to get upvotes mention rape
creepyPMs,removed,thats more sad than creepy he seems heartbroken
creepyPMs,removed,next time censor your name tara
creepyPMs,removed,what about the new number you talked about
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair i can kind of tell youve got a great cock jk
creepyPMs,removed,damn wish i was hot enough to get hired just like that
creepyPMs,removed,ヽ༼ ຈل͜ຈ༽ ﾉ raise them dongers raised check out for more info
creepyPMs,removed,violations or no violations im a fan of the quality content this sub provides but when i cant tell the creep from the cringe i become conflicted and must don heros attirea hero no one wants and no one asked for again look at the change in tone its abrupt you really go from saying she sounds unhappy and that a relationship could fix her to mocking her and telling her youll post all of what she said on the internet in about sentences you are the creep here brohiem and if you cant appreciate the hypocrisy inherent in her exploiting folks for money and the like to your all of a sudden when you discover you will never be the decent guy to her tell her you dont pity her she never asked for that either bro and that you will post the convo to earn karma i dont like seeing this sub being used by the people that are usually theunbeknownst to themcontent and posting here should not render one immune to much due criticism
creepyPMs,removed,for reference this lady is transphobic in other words shes normal and mentally stable good on her anyone in their right mind would be transphobic
creepyPMs,removed,yare yare daze
creepyPMs,removed,thats not how it works
creepyPMs,removed,i dont see which rule that breaks
creepyPMs,removed,the rules state that i should give credit to the op in this case he was the creep and i didnt want to name him directly so i credited the sub im not sure what i could have done better in this situation
creepyPMs,removed,i would like some clarification on the rules because i really tried to do it right and i feel the removal is unwarranted
creepyPMs,removed,pagingunosefetish
creepyPMs,removed,haaahhahahhahaha was looking to downvote then i saw the picture
creepyPMs,removed,this kid needs to go on some fucking meds and get some friends
creepyPMs,removed,thank you for answering my question i suppose where i get caught up on this is that the term mansplaining implies that this kind of behavior only happens one directionally as a man working in a femaledominated field i have had my knowledge and opinions dismissed based upon my gender alone on many occasions youre a man you just dont get it etc i completely agree that it sucks the behavior though is not exclusively one gender against another even though the term would imply that it is that would make the term mansplaining every bit as sexist as say femsplaining which are both just genderspecific ways of being condescending
creepyPMs,removed,ive heard that before but i highly doubt the context wasnt even nearly correct and its still pretty weird to assume thats what she was talking about
creepyPMs,removed,this sub would stop existing if you just stopped talking to people when they start to do dumb shit like this like a normal person
creepyPMs,removed,youre doing it right now
creepyPMs,removed,what about if you have a big dick how do you brag about it without sounding like abig dick
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair whenever a new girl wants sex with me she asks about the size or makes note of it i could easily see someone getting ahead of himself and offering this info before she asks mistakenly thinking it was the size that instigated the desire
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,no joke im gonna work out someday and become a monster capital m man man man capital m
creepyPMs,removed,this doesnt really fit this sub
creepyPMs,removed,i could have been stronger if we hadnt had moved i was gonna join the football team and we worked out hard in my old school and i hanged out with my friends a lot especially this one friend who was superstrong i felt like a man once and told him whaat jokeingly my friend he pushed me and he was super strong i looked at him hurtfully and shocked he was white and i thought whites were supposed to be weak and scrawny but all i had was the mindset of a macho manidiotlike jackass the movie idiot but he was my freind so i laughed it off
creepyPMs,removed,ok fuck reddit i post to much shit a boat me here idiot
creepyPMs,removed,fuck you and your submission rules im cray crayi just wanna get banned mani posted whats on my mind nigger boys bigger bigger than white boyzim part of boyz in da hood
creepyPMs,removed,fuck you i love you the bible teachs to love everyone like a homosexual a man a pedophile a boygirl and a lesbian a women
creepyPMs,removed,how does this fit into this sub this has nothing to do with people being creepy mods
creepyPMs,removed,i agree it is rude less rude is a remark when they do see it but ive never been with someone who refrained from doing either
creepyPMs,removed,how dare that thought criminal say the horrible word female you shouldve just turned him in the the ministry of truth
creepyPMs,removed,doesnt seem that bad
creepyPMs,removed,i wouldnt say its my taste i much prefer if they have manners and a little tact theres no knowing theyre going to comment until they do id like to say its unexpected but it happens often enough truly im a bit surprised to find im apparently alone in this experience at any rate i wasnt trying to say its reasonable to volunteer that information only that it wouldnt surprise me if that were one of any number of reasons behind the phenomenon apparently however im an outlier in whether or not this happens so i guess maybe not
creepyPMs,removed,okay so by no means am i saying that i support this dudes assholish behaviour but hear me out when i say that i sorta understand where hes coming from i used to try the whole online dating thing a long time back and i cant tell you how many times ive been completely blocked and left in the dust after people saw my face its a terrible feeling when people dont even bother texting you at all after they see you it drives your self esteem into the dirt now im gonna say it again the dude in this pic is a massive dick but i feel like the chick should have at least messaged him back when she saw him and said he wasnt her type its just a small text but it has a big impact on the receiver and makes them feel a little better than being left in the dust
creepyPMs,removed,eh
creepyPMs,removed,lol love grolling cl skanks
creepyPMs,removed,you bet
creepyPMs,removed,why not just block the number
creepyPMs,removed,with out their consent your public photos arent going to get too many requests for consent its practically an oxymoron what you wrote
creepyPMs,removed,cool that you feel sorry enough for him to put him on blast on the internet i actually do feel bad for this guy seems sad and lonely
creepyPMs,removed,wrongs dont make a right
creepyPMs,removed,fucking hate how men dont understand what women have to put up with how does this not suggest that she believes this is a gendered issue
creepyPMs,removed,quit your bitching
creepyPMs,removed,still a compliment nonetheless
creepyPMs,removed,youre bein a real bitch stumpy
creepyPMs,removed,as a proud feminist why do you consider categorizing a human being in this case men with facial hair extended to their neck as creeps is it alright to call a women who has feminist views as a bitch
creepyPMs,removed,my b i dont normally use language like that and it wont happen again is there a way you can block moxitude from the thread though
creepyPMs,removed,will do i just wanna say walk in to any mens jail and you will hear the phrase punk ass bh about times if you stay for minutes i do agree it is probably gendered and the reason it is an insult to call men the bword is along the same lines of why calling a man py is an insult its still a slight against women even if youre saying it to a man i do understand all of that sometimes though words on the internet seem like small potatoes compared to the real life hardships and mental ableism ive faced my whole life its hard for me to be sympathetic to someone like moxitude but i agree with you and thank you for not being a dick about it
creepyPMs,removed,at least he has decent temper or brains didnt seem like a grown ass man child right
creepyPMs,removed,its not harassment
creepyPMs,removed,wow how have you not blocked him already i get you feel bad for him but this is just beyond annoying dont get why some people just never get the hint you barely replied how does he not feel awkward
creepyPMs,removed,clear your god damn notifications
creepyPMs,removed,stop talking to him people like that can turn from being in another country to being in your country rather easily or maybe its just and im becoming cynical still fucking creepy though
creepyPMs,removed,its rmildlyinfuriating
creepyPMs,removed,isnt attractive enough for me to say yes idk seems like your a bit too far up your own ass
creepyPMs,removed,he got butthurt because he found a man attractive
creepyPMs,removed,but i do find it funny how quickly he went from thinking you were cute and regretting his past bullying to thinking you are an abomination its almost like he thought someone was a girl and then it turned out to be a guy and that disgusted him
creepyPMs,removed,the same thing they say about the biggest racists i know all kkk members are secretly black
creepyPMs,removed,why do you have ads on every screenshot you have malware on your phone e
creepyPMs,removed,no one no one thinks this is a fake text no one at all
creepyPMs,removed,in his defence finding out a pretty girl has a cock is kinda gross
creepyPMs,removed,faggot
creepyPMs,removed,this whole interaction looks a little trashy on both sides i dont know the full story so i might be wrong here but he sounds dangerous and you sound like an asshole why not just ignore him why you went that far as to contact a family member of his
creepyPMs,removed,the way the title was typed up reflects perfectly the kind of a brain that thinks biology is inherently incorrent
creepyPMs,removed,this looks incredibly fake
creepyPMs,removed,pansexual you mean they are into goats
creepyPMs,removed,wensday just shoot me now i cant go on
creepyPMs,removed,but are you into weird stuff
creepyPMs,removed,you guys are ridiculous the idiot in question here never hit on the op he was grossed out by the sex change
creepyPMs,removed,hahaha this is fucking hilarious i cant wait to meet a trans or whatever the fuck you claim to be one day you guys are living circuses you are a man now you want a fanny stupid mental illness you have going on and then the guy found you attractive hahaha he is right you are a weird and creepy faggot 😂
creepyPMs,removed,so are you a lesbian or straight or what its all confusing hope im not offending
creepyPMs,removed,okay sorry if this sounds rough but if theyre attracted to women why not just stay as a man
creepyPMs,removed,so fake
creepyPMs,removed,how charismatic what a fucking cunt
creepyPMs,removed,luckily people who are trans die a bunch luckily for us normal folk 😀
creepyPMs,removed,this reads like a shitty sitcom sketch saying this isnt uncommon doesnt excuse people parading lies around and making a problem look more direprevalent than it actually is
creepyPMs,removed,pansexual isnt real just made up
creepyPMs,removed,lol he thought you were hot id count that as a win what a homo
creepyPMs,removed,ok
creepyPMs,removed,technically when op was being bullied she hadnt transitioned so describing their past self as male isnt wrong
creepyPMs,removed,wow you are the most retarded thing ive seen in a while firstly you post a pic of yourself with fucked up makeup then you get agressive for no reason if you are not interested reject like a normal functioning human dont talk shit seriously you are fucking retardes and the guy was correct this time
creepyPMs,removed,i hate it too especially because asian women are my favorite does it creep you out because you are asian if so what kind of asian are you i would never fetishize you so no worries there i would love you you would be my darling
creepyPMs,removed,i think hes just trolling no way this person is for reals
creepyPMs,removed,that made me laugh its creepy but my type of creepy
creepyPMs,removed,hacked maybe
creepyPMs,removed,i disagree
creepyPMs,removed,i think he deserves to know the detergent type
creepyPMs,removed,making comments about men with big dicks getting into your inbox isnt going to reduce the creepy pms
creepyPMs,removed,i dont see the creepiness in these pms
creepyPMs,removed,i think these messages are the ops not the creepy guys
creepyPMs,removed,wow youre like seriously uptight about this shit arent you they used the word guy hardly offensive
creepyPMs,removed,huh im not sure anymore either they sound like a response to a message but they are from someone
creepyPMs,removed,dumb question what do you get out of it
creepyPMs,removed,i mean technically grills are pieces of furniture theyre not normally considered regular furniture though
creepyPMs,removed,seems like a joke conversation between friends
creepyPMs,removed,i downvoted this post
creepyPMs,removed,guy is ambiguous in of itself im sorry but if you are referring to somebody who at the time was years old and male transgender or not he wasis male a guy is not something to get worked up over
creepyPMs,removed,lbs skirt steak tbsp lime juice tbsp soy sauce tbsp worcestershire sauce tbsp olive oil tbsp minced garlic servings people instructions combine lime juice soy sauce worcestershire sauce olive oil and garlic in a flat container to hold the steak or a large ziplock bag add steak and marinade for whatever length of time you need even a few minutes adds flavor grill or broil each side for about min and check the internal temp with a meat thermometer doneness keep cooking until the desired doneness about deg for medium let it rest and the residual heat will carry it over
creepyPMs,removed,well the comment section is a massive circle jerk so thats something but regardless of what he said he had the decency to keep it private you didnt return that favour and instead showed his opinion to a bunch of anonymous strangers in hopes of rallying up support which you knew youd get from these lot for yourself whilst ridiculing him i dont have an opinion on what the conversation was about but take a step back and look at it on a macro scale of one person to another he showed you some decency as an adult you should show the same in return
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt an example of a creepy pm if you want to continue the argument with your friend you should do so without looking for reassurance first
creepyPMs,removed,disclaimer this is a cross post im not the source of the image
creepyPMs,removed,physics minor and took his last physics class years ago sure makes sense
creepyPMs,removed,i have two dozen pictures of this girls asshole but yea this guys so creepy for thinking she might want to role play totally out of this world to ask her that huh its not like people can friend her from gonewild or anything its not like people follow her posts oh wait thats totally what happens its truly you who are the the balllickers
creepyPMs,removed,im gonna get downvoted to oblivion and thats fine but generally when i think of horror fans i think quirky and unusualpossibly dorky so i dont think asking if one is into roleplay is that far outside of the sphere of geekery theres nothing to suggest it was anything other than one person looking to another person and trying to discern similar hobbies not all roleplaying is sexualby any means
creepyPMs,removed,anyone who refers to a fetus as a parasite even to make a point is messed up in the head
creepyPMs,removed,roleplaying is not only a sexual thing you know i think he might have been a creep or just trying to get to know you
creepyPMs,removed,the girl is saying some gnarly stuff but op says the most cringy things im suggesting here that op is cringier than girl is creepy i draw evidence from the shift in tone in the conversation hes all about offering to help fix this girl this fixing meaning being in a relationship with himgross until theres a compete change in tone after she says the newest victim of her hustling is actually really decent before she says this op saysof the potential of money being given awaysomething like guys will say anything to get into a girls pants until they cant get into their pants the tone shifts after the girls response that the guy is decent op then questions the existence of the aforementioned man a free dating site and then throws in the cringy reddit karma thing the strength in my conclusion that op is cringier than girl is creepy lies in the sudden change in tone mentioned here coupled with what provoked the shift the man actually being decent why would few details about a man make op go from wanting to be the proverbial bearer of all soothing love and support to haha so much karma i actually dont pity you at all the shift just happens too quickly when compared to what op was offering earlier que coldplay song i dont condone how this girl claims to live her life but i just wanted to point out the cringe factor here some niceguy level cringe
creepyPMs,removed,i can see why he hasnt had a blowie in a while
creepyPMs,removed,i think this thread and the way that it has been handled by its moderators is enough to convince me to say goodbye to this subreddit i thought this subreddit was to post creepy pms for others to share a chuckle over not serve as an echo chamber to wave feminist dogma some of the posts were occasionally humorous but this thread has illustrated what a toxic community this subreddit represents i know you wont miss me and the feeling is mutual
creepyPMs,removed,wow this is creepy sounds well thought out and logical to me oh wait i forgot those two things arent allowed when talking to feminists ill take my downvotes and leave now
creepyPMs,removed,why you gotta white knight this bitch
creepyPMs,removed,poor guy he must have finally figured out that if you dont get a bj at least once every years jizz clogs up your brain and you die
creepyPMs,removed,do you think he could of been making a joke even though its in really poor taste
creepyPMs,removed,not sure what you were expecting from the donald
creepyPMs,removed,this is a test comment about rincels
creepyPMs,removed,im sorry but how the fuck is this creepy sounds like a smart and well thought out response to a blatantly ignorant and shameful post
creepyPMs,removed,wow
creepyPMs,removed,huh never seen a screenshot with the creepy stuff on the right before
creepyPMs,removed,theres no context here its obviously not out of left field and his message begins with youre welcome so shes clearly slipped a thank you and something about feeling special in there leading up to this i hate this cutting out everything else in the conversation just to embarrass someone or make it seem creepy i mean he sort of sounds like a creep but you people are way overreacting and in some cases extrapolating some pretty ridiculous things out of what he said
creepyPMs,removed,youre a fucking idiot take some prozac or something
creepyPMs,removed,maybe he is chinese devouring pussy now makes sense right
creepyPMs,removed,im so confused how is this a creeper is op red or blue asking if they like to roleplay is an innocent question you have a bunch of platforms that you can do roleplaying on with ocs and maybe hes just trying to build rapport and make a new friend
creepyPMs,removed,wow way to wildly jump to conclusions there good job for all you know that person was trying to ask if you were into dungeons dragons in an effort to chatget to know you a little better and you had some kind of insane mood swing and treated a depressed person like shit youre a real asshole op i hope you get raped
creepyPMs,removed,well how tall are you have you ever been kissed
creepyPMs,removed,you must have a runt of a rooster
creepyPMs,removed,creepy maybe but you kind of went overboard no just say no and move along he seemed like a nice guy who happens to like feet
creepyPMs,removed,okay well that makes the mods of this sub as pathetic and ridiculous as you i wasnt rude and wasnt making personal attacks and still had my comments removed enjoy your sexless angry tumblrina existence
creepyPMs,removed,first
creepyPMs,removed,really is that your assessment of me i have unresolved issues because i critique your position well your assumption of what thing upsets me the most is just that an assumption if you think oppression on women justifies not calling you out on hypocrisy i think you are wrong
creepyPMs,removed,my coworker is jewish and divorced if youre in the mid atlantic area let me know
creepyPMs,removed,roasting and insulting
creepyPMs,removed,i can almost guarantee you that he was joking around and will not consider moving over to chicago have some faith in humanity once in a while you have literally nothing to be worried about
creepyPMs,removed,shoulda told him you were born a man
creepyPMs,removed,im not offering but i am interested to know the answer from a general standpoint
creepyPMs,removed,this is clever maybe if youre
creepyPMs,removed,i would have replied okay hes my buddies number insert number hes coming to pick u up
creepyPMs,removed,hello all a quick question mods if this post is an issue considering im not sharing pms i apologize and will not be offended if you remove careful before we chase you away with torches and pitchforks jk we are civilized we use downvotes what do you think the reasoning is behind the rampant sending of dick pics particularly unsolicited reasoning pfft these people would show up as a black spot when you try a brain activity test i understand that some people think peni pronounced peeneye are pretty im not in that camp i just i dont get it i suppose i think the entire subreddit is in this camp through is it an exhibitionismtype fetish is it literally just to be a jerk i saw so many of these fuckers leaving exhibitionsts footfetishists humiliation lovers diaper lovers delusional rapists aside i could name another twenty of these not sure about being a jerk but you certainly are on the right way jerk for one is an essential reason are there people out there that see a wang and automatically just want sex with it of course there are you can generally find them at a place called pornhub thank you for your time i guess you are welcome and jeez i agree that dicks are a pain in the ass posted a selfie with my sister once holy hell i know that oddly our female half of the family look gorgeous meanwhile the men can make a baby cry from a hundred yards away with our glare but i didnt think that it would turn into a dick magnet i got so many dicks thrown at me that i considered opening a hot dog stall
creepyPMs,removed,woman man gay who cares its a blow job ftfy
creepyPMs,removed,i think being straight up would be a more effective tactic xd tell him to fuck off
creepyPMs,removed,this may be the least creepy creepy pm ive seen
creepyPMs,removed,why did you not just block him what am i missing
creepyPMs,removed,did she not realize she could have blocked the second it got weird
creepyPMs,removed,well i agree that he was persistent and weird but maybe you couldve given him a reason to not talking to him
creepyPMs,removed,i kind of get where hes coming from tinder especially isnt known for being a place to really get to know someone
creepyPMs,removed,ah i get it this sub promotes pretending to be fed up but not actually doing anything about it for the purpose of gaining karma
creepyPMs,removed,years jesus glad you got the lead out why did you wait that long
creepyPMs,removed,have you told him that you arent interrested
creepyPMs,removed,i mean this wasnt really that creepy dude was just a dick more than a creeper
creepyPMs,removed,so fuck his connections you cant be arsed to deal with the bullshit anymore
creepyPMs,removed,epic imgur comment through that fella will be surprised when he checks out the link
creepyPMs,removed,have you told him to get help or told people close to him that he needs help i assume that since you were close friends for a long while theres something worth knowingsaving its something that can be overcome through therapy mental health issuesrejection can result in viscous spirals i know what its like so i do sympathize with the guy a bit obviously i dont know the whole story i never harassed anyone to this degree but i could definitely see that possibility it was easily overcome for me with therapy it turned me into a much better person i also know this is the internet so who cares but i felt compelled to respond
creepyPMs,removed,what app is this why not pretend to be a boy
creepyPMs,removed,block button
creepyPMs,removed,seeing so many awesome people putting dumbassed in their places is super empowering ftfy not all the creepedupon are women got your point though
creepyPMs,removed,i dont need to read it again but thanks
creepyPMs,removed,and i was talking about other genders getting dick pics too thanks for the clarification though
creepyPMs,removed,people disagree it happens its okay thank you
creepyPMs,removed,what if youre asked for a dick pic tho
creepyPMs,removed,thanks bacon lady
creepyPMs,removed,or she just right clicked hit inspect element and changed all the text to some fantasy creep crushing for karma
creepyPMs,removed,jesus christ really had that boiling right below the surface huh
creepyPMs,removed,you enable
creepyPMs,removed,no its not rape culture
creepyPMs,removed,why even ask for an opinion if youre gonna downvote what you disagree with also even if it sounds rapey that is not rape culture rape culture is actually getting raped and society accepting it
creepyPMs,removed,jesus christ thats a little overboard
creepyPMs,removed,learn how to accept a compliment and leave it at that there was nothing creepy about this one
creepyPMs,removed,wasnt really creepy also until we know the pics he is talking about you may just be overreacting what kind of content is on the profile does it maybe invite compliments such as this
creepyPMs,removed,bullshit
creepyPMs,removed,i subscribe to this sub most of the time i think its hilarious what was creepy about this ok if the guy is say married etc and messages this then it could be sad but if you read the other posts on here its nothing so ya im fine
creepyPMs,removed,or you could accept a compliment but tell him its unwanted in a polite way the last thing this world needs right now is more hate
creepyPMs,removed,am i the only one who thinks ufarthegn acted like a dick by replying to her dont provoke them just ignore they leave you alone after sometime
creepyPMs,removed,seriously this isnt that creepy at all i mean i certainly would not do that shit but its not like he said anything inappropriate get over it
creepyPMs,removed,how dare he message someone about pokemon go show his mother surely she will understand be offended punish him idiot
creepyPMs,removed,well its shitty but kind of expected when you post to rgonewild
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know op sounds like a bitch just by reading this now im tempted to have everyone i know in the midwest seek her out and msg her on fb
creepyPMs,removed,if i message the naked girl online she will succumb to my charms instantly
creepyPMs,removed,well i wouldnt expect the clients to be any different in that subreddit
creepyPMs,removed,post desperate pics get desperate responses
creepyPMs,removed,it could be just me but id love to see some good replies sometimes fun ones people who made you smile or is it just one huge pile of dump
creepyPMs,removed,i mean what the fuck do you expect honestly
creepyPMs,removed,i wouldnt was just a thought is there a subreddit for guys doing it right though would be cool to see
creepyPMs,removed,i thought it was ridiculous enough to be hilarious
creepyPMs,removed,you put waaaaay more effort into that response than you needed like anything you say will get through the thick skull of a creeper pretty sure its more for you than for him when responses are this long and condescending
creepyPMs,removed,isnt that the point of posting to gonewild getting a bunch of creepy pms to validate you no no of course notits forartistic purposes
creepyPMs,removed,chill
creepyPMs,removed,incompitent
creepyPMs,removed,you have to expect some creepy pms when you post to gonewild but the last guy saying youre a whore with no carer terrible
creepyPMs,removed,i wish you didnt have to blur the creeps names might be fun to message them
creepyPMs,removed,the actual content of this message isnt really creepy
creepyPMs,removed,ok im going to be the bad guy but the person on the right completely went from to there wasnt anything creepy about this message except for the person on the left getting attacked from the get go i dont mean to offend you op if you were the person on the right but i think you way over reacted
creepyPMs,removed,the grammar and spelling make me want to smack everyone involved with that conversation
creepyPMs,removed,yeah that shit just happens to anybody who plays online not just cause youre a girl
creepyPMs,removed,its about what happened to the op no it isnt in a couple of minutes i found the last of those pictures on a blog post from so unless op is really plumbing the depths of her experience and also had a blog three years ago this is a repost so what is this thread about again
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair this is pretty common behavior towards men too within gaming communities
creepyPMs,removed,no if specifically states being a girl gamer sucks so your assertion isnt correct at all
creepyPMs,removed,bitch dog nasty pussy send me your tits you had a great rack
creepyPMs,removed,oh fuck off
creepyPMs,removed,im looking for big whoop tm can you help me for anything less than pieces o eight
creepyPMs,removed,hmm i feel like that language you are using is just a creepy as the guy who is hitting on you i know you were trying to shoo him away but still its just my prejudices against these things
creepyPMs,removed,thats his entourage youre talking about plus by reading this id definitely say they are a package deal
creepyPMs,removed,both rude you couldnt just say sorry not interested
creepyPMs,removed,reading through my profile for an insult thats cute
creepyPMs,removed,poster to rnormalnudes and twoxchromosomes lmao hahahahah im sure im way out of your league ive seen enough here
creepyPMs,removed,this cunt is going to end up a lonely old man
creepyPMs,removed,im sorry i made that comment ok
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair he seems more awkward than creepy theres nothing sexual in here nor does he randomly bring up his dick at all
creepyPMs,removed,we need ops pics id venture to say that youre a at most because theres got to be quite a bit of testosterone in you to be that witty
creepyPMs,removed,well maybe if you werent talking about fucking blowjobs all the time he wouldnt message you
creepyPMs,removed,that was uncivilized i dont think so dude get the fuck off it
creepyPMs,removed,i apologize i forget what im replying to sometimes
creepyPMs,removed,definitely not even my asian friends would find this hilarious
creepyPMs,removed,utanixification
creepyPMs,removed,hey now dont go sending him to ruin fetlife
creepyPMs,removed,well whats the answer
creepyPMs,removed,absolutely no judgement or anything like but do you answer a lot of blowjob related questions
creepyPMs,removed,more of a swing and miss than a fuck up
creepyPMs,removed,hey its me ur new lover
creepyPMs,removed,to be a devils advocate a big dick not a huge one but one of ample size does immedietely feel better than a small one saying its the way you use it is pretty misleading its like saying the only beauty that matters is on the inside just a way to make objectively ugly people feel better not that i totally disagree about being able to use it versus not or with the beauty thing either but a smallmicroscopic penis can literally feel like nothing furthermore to give a more direct answer to why men care it is simply because it is a symbol of masculinity a larger member more masculine at least thats the mindset its like being muscular vs being out of shape
creepyPMs,removed,no people should not need that to see a joke dont fucking give into the s
creepyPMs,removed,the same reason women generalizing are so obsessed with their weight we are told by society we should have a big dick every porno is basically a guy with a big dick and the girl screaming omg the big is so big while moaning lika crazy cause thats what big dicks makes girls do there are alot of porn clips where theres a girl talking into the camera on how small your dick is and how you could never make her orgasm some people have this as a fetisch
creepyPMs,removed,i get you i totally do but hearing from society and every porno ever that you need a big dick weighs harder than one or more redditors this also makes it so that those with a big dick think thats all they need which is probably why youve experienced those guys as the worst
creepyPMs,removed,same with weight and other body ideals just tell the kids to stop being so naive and thinking people in magazines are not photoshoped and its all good how do we ev en have anorecticbulimic people i mean dont tell me youre fooled by the photoshop in magazines
creepyPMs,removed,step he must find someone who wants his penis inside of them step optional unless hes not a big fan of exhibitionism go someplace private with this person step make penis hard i think this involves some kind of hydraulic device or perhaps chanting and an animal sacrifice the bigger the penis the larger the animal to be sacrificed for him i would suggest one of the smaller members of the cricket family if all else fails scotch tape and a twig or toothpick step put on a condom for the love of all that is good and holy put on a condom step line up erect penis with the entrance of the hole of partners choosing step in out repeat as necessary step remove penis from partner step weep quietly as he removes scotch tape from penis
creepyPMs,removed,wow really
creepyPMs,removed,its okay not everyone has imagination
creepyPMs,removed,thanks for your time
creepyPMs,removed,super creepy when nervous laughter actually manifests itself through texthaha
creepyPMs,removed,hahaha it sure made me crack up though
creepyPMs,removed,i think hes just all out cool enough to get away with it
creepyPMs,removed,if i scratched my gf shes probably hit me and then wed end up wrestling instead of having sex😂
creepyPMs,removed,thats pathetic
creepyPMs,removed,because it does work on some girls who have that kind of sense of humour
creepyPMs,removed,send nudes
creepyPMs,removed,jesus christ also learn how to crop
creepyPMs,removed,would have improved the post
creepyPMs,removed,as sad as this is i think you should just reply and tell him to stop messaging you
creepyPMs,removed,how is it not civil to not be sympathetic to someone who is causing their own problems
creepyPMs,removed,indian alert
creepyPMs,removed,sorry im indian and i post my hunches as i feels em
creepyPMs,removed,so do you if not dont mind this comment
creepyPMs,removed,basically how all the emotional preteens who use the word triggered online operate what they really mean is they are triggered
creepyPMs,removed,op herself sounds like an asshole
creepyPMs,removed,dont see what the problem is here guy was polite enough and kept it brief not your thing then no worries
creepyPMs,removed,i know right they are so full of themselves that they forget to also read the messages completely
creepyPMs,removed,you should of said yes and revealed your manness after watching him wank
creepyPMs,removed,uh i think youre taking it a little too far that wasnt even implied
creepyPMs,removed,why did you even keep responding
creepyPMs,removed,no part of asking strangers to watch you masturbate is polite even if they tell you not to worry about it
creepyPMs,removed,whatevs fuck yo sub
creepyPMs,removed,um this was posted hours ago on riamverysmart by ualoonie rquityourbullshit
creepyPMs,removed,the idea of anyone from rchildfree calling anyone else childish is so laughably ironic
creepyPMs,removed,meanwhile what i would do invite him over tell noting call him into the bed room a quick session of screaming and a jacked boyfriend later a hog tie bondage later then offer him the choice between being dropped of in a allmales prison shower with soap lying just next to him or a small loan of a million dollars fuckers tend to be rich after all
creepyPMs,removed,the entitled sister fucker in case those posts disappear the same guy message her back the thing about women is you have to be forward and assertive dont listen to the bullshit feminists and rniceguys say about you not being pushy sometimes you have to be pushy they just spread the myth about take no for an answer and dont be pushy so that cowards and betas wont discover the secret to getting women women fucking love it when you make them feel uncomfortable it shows you have control of the situation and the power to make them feel comfortable again it puts you in control it puts you in power they respect that oh and he can one day i can imagine myself turning into hitler one day i honestly empathise with him a lot i watch his documentaries and i can kinda know what he was feeling he was a bad man but he was human weve all been there lets not judge and finally if i ever marry a nonvirgin woman im gonna cheat on her probably with hookers with the exact same number of partners that she had before me that way we both have an equal sexual partner count its the only way id feel not selfloathing so yeah that guy wow
creepyPMs,removed,youre not wrong about the pedo thing its such a common idea there and yes its the longest part of the faq and they its an apologist text for sleeping with underage girls i think i need to go take a shower now
creepyPMs,removed,why do you continue talking to him though
creepyPMs,removed,understand that you werent interested or understand that his behavior isnt acceptable people down voted me but im really not trying to stir the pot or bait people
creepyPMs,removed,youre implying that the only reason id ask this question would be because i have bad intentions
creepyPMs,removed,wow okay he fucked up and definitely shouldnt start a conversation with a dick pic lol but youre just as embarrassing you could have let it go and let him be the creep but you then kept harrassing him in return even going so far as to message him out of the blue the next day im not really sure you can take the high road here
creepyPMs,removed,not even being an edge lord i think i just realized whats wrong with these guys they have autism like these look like what my autistic friend texts me except he isnt sexually harassing
creepyPMs,removed,i definitely agree that this guy takes douche to an entirely new level and the fact that he has a daughter and still thinks that is acceptable makes me feel very sorry for her but what i kinda dont understanddefinitely not judgingjust curious is why i see women continue to engage guys like this all the time on here why if he skeeves you out then why would you continue to have a conversation with this type of person it may just be mebut i dont really see some guy who is willing to make his first interaction with someone a picture of their dickall of the sudden being like you know what youre absolutely right im a fucking pervert and i need to learn some manners and some skills on how to interact with women
creepyPMs,removed,i mean i cant agree with sending a dick pic first but theres an obvious reason why youre single
creepyPMs,removed,jesus calm down if you didnt like being sent a dick pic just block him
creepyPMs,removed,you both have issues
creepyPMs,removed,triggered
creepyPMs,removed,stop engaging these shitlords
creepyPMs,removed,removed because the truth hurts peoples feelings
creepyPMs,removed,ok real talk some fetish things i can understand so you like feet or horses or balloons ok different strokes for different folks it is the impossible fantasies that i cannot relate to not at all not just lactation fantasies but like there are people who are into the idea of being eaten alive i think its called vore its like dude you would be dead if that happened
creepyPMs,removed,lame
creepyPMs,removed,i mean a chopped up dick is a bit more than an eye for an eye but damn that mustve been a terrible google image search im morbidly curious to see what turns up myself
creepyPMs,removed,he said matters that men should discuss therefore it would have been funny is op said they were born a man thus leaving creepy guy with nothing to say how this was not polite confuses me
creepyPMs,removed,im scared this will be taken the wrong way but autistic people really dont need to see stuff like this so many of us already absolutely hate ourselves for being a burden on our families and seeing stuff like this along with the stigma we alteady face for being autistic and disabled in some cases is super i dont know depressing maybe is the word i understand where youre coming from and that venting helps but im assuming there are parenting groups for parents of autists that you could turn to rather than mainstream where autistic children and teens will see it please dont take this as a personal attack if i had seen this maybe a year ago i probably wouldnt be here today because of the guilt and self loathing i already felt
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know about this one hes right at one point your best move wouldve been to just blockignore him sending a dickpic to start a conversation isnt a rare thing to happen
creepyPMs,removed,trying not to break a rule here getting a random dickpic sure is creepy but theres some point to what hes saying you really are better off just blocking these kind of people they wont learn anything from you trying to explain their creepiness to them also his mother really had nothing to do with the situation dont fall low like that when dealing with this type of creep with them beating you with experience and whatnot
creepyPMs,removed,he did say block if you dont like what you see
creepyPMs,removed,purely for argumentative reasons if you believe that someone should be offended when someone else sends them a disgusting picture without being asked then can you say hes wrong when hes offended that op did that back to him does his actions somehow make op morally correct in this situation is the messenger an ass hole for sending a disgusting pic and op is not because of the actions of the person she sent it too or are they now both ass holes in this situation
creepyPMs,removed,i never really tried negging until last night but i got a reaction it saddens me because when i write a genuine opener i am flat out ignored i dont understand it myself
creepyPMs,removed,drop the degree i just want people to say hey i am fine thanks and you
creepyPMs,removed,i get that but times at what point do i stop feeling like i am a ghost i legit sometimes wonder if i am still alive and in reality when dozens of people ignore me when i try make conversation or if i only sometimes exist or black out unaware my actions may have chased them away i am not obligated to a reply but i feel if i sincerely approach you and you are not interested i deserve to know why i am very understanding i just sometimes want to know what i am doing wrong
creepyPMs,removed,holy shit you showed that idiot good job i wish more girls would be as quickwitted as you are i really have no sympathy for people who start a conversation with a dick pic its just disgusting
creepyPMs,removed,hard not to take it personally especially when they look over your profile and not say a thing i feel like leftover food i would not even ask why just a simple recognition that i asked you how you are would be nice it would probably mean more to me then theyd think life and death levels of different really
creepyPMs,removed,this is cringeworthy on both sides
creepyPMs,removed,okaaaaaay weird much
creepyPMs,removed,i like ops moxie fancy my dick pic
creepyPMs,removed,does that happen often wouldnt they realise that tinder is only for when you match
creepyPMs,removed,continues to say go away doesnt just block him just like any other idiot on here
creepyPMs,removed,nope he just made a stupid joke and forgot about it no desperate techniques to win a special unicorn here
creepyPMs,removed,feel free to look up the definition of fat
creepyPMs,removed,ok i actually found this one to be kind of witty and charming better than the typical hey and dtf openers i usually get but i can totally see how this comes off as too much
creepyPMs,removed,fat people are an extremely easy target yeah theyre pretty slow the texture is weird though
creepyPMs,removed,oh cool youre on reddit too still waiting on those pics xd
creepyPMs,removed,im not trying to insult anyone but ill try and keep the sass to a minimum next time
creepyPMs,removed,you seem to get involved in lots of drama on reddit
creepyPMs,removed,something tells me they are probably overweight and hate themselves so much that they go online and do this to other people
creepyPMs,removed,that started off nice great penmanship and then it nosedived congrats on your gfs curvatious titsthough
creepyPMs,removed,get promoted to bartender i tend in a dive and i can literally tell customers off for being out of line
creepyPMs,removed,i cant wait until im old
creepyPMs,removed,and people wonder why ive never asked waitresses out
creepyPMs,removed,k
creepyPMs,removed,but would you compliment a guy on his pecks or biceps
creepyPMs,removed,gotta be fake
creepyPMs,removed,my boss unprompted asked if i wanted him to ask the guy out if she had however
creepyPMs,removed,i can understand that a lot more than telling some strange girl you like her tits
creepyPMs,removed,you are a great moderator s
creepyPMs,removed,so do we get to see those magnificent tits
creepyPMs,removed,you know what you should do you should send him an unsolicited picture of your feet then post it here so we can see his reaction that will show him
creepyPMs,removed,omg girl seeing that creepy message totally makes me warn you your phone battery is low oo
creepyPMs,removed,you know anyone could do it really lets all just start sending around pictures of our feet and posting guys reactionsalong with the feet picturesto finally teach creeps like this a lesson
creepyPMs,removed,terrible idea it has to be feet because of the implication
creepyPMs,removed,if youre barefoot you cant run away
creepyPMs,removed,nah its not dark youre misunderstand me because if you want to leave then obviously you can leave but you wontbecause of the implication
creepyPMs,removed,you i like you let me inbox you something creepy
creepyPMs,removed,if i threaten to kill you where is the threat in the posted pic
creepyPMs,removed,pretty sure youre upset that someone disagrees with you so now youre throwing around baseless accusations lol
creepyPMs,removed,different interpretations i guess depending on the app its entirely possible this person doesnt have a clue who she is where she lives etc i just dont see the police viewing this as a real threat
creepyPMs,removed,i think someone gave you that girls kik
creepyPMs,removed,where did he explicitly threaten her its like saying im surprised no one has assassinated yet vs im going to assassinate legally the guy is safe just creepy as hell
creepyPMs,removed,except he never actually threatened anything fucking moron
creepyPMs,removed,permission to literally nail him to a wall
creepyPMs,removed,every step is an escalation it might go from this to his dry run and if the dry run goes in his favour were dooooooomed
creepyPMs,removed,if you say i promise to kill or whatever you face nothing unless you actually do it
creepyPMs,removed,hm not really seeing the creepyness just kinda keen is all
creepyPMs,removed,aaaaaaaaaaaaaand no reply becausee you realize youre using immature methods of defending your point of view maybe some day youll learn to deal with people who have different views than your own
creepyPMs,removed,gonna need some imagery for context
creepyPMs,removed,creepy how
creepyPMs,removed,seems like a realist to me whats creepy about being realistic
creepyPMs,removed,this screams years and she cheated not two months clingy dump lol crazy dude
creepyPMs,removed,call the cops and say what someone was mean to me on the internet
creepyPMs,removed,they both do sorry i disagree a he typed some shit who the fuck cares its fucking letter people should be able to say whatever the hell they want online anonmysly wether it be calling people nigger fags or sending creepy pms
creepyPMs,removed,attractive women im not attractive and i was really ugly in the past ive never gotten that kind of message from a guy but no guys write to me at all so theres that
creepyPMs,removed,i mean i do have a thing for darker girls is that a racial fetish
creepyPMs,removed,im more attracted to tandark girls
creepyPMs,removed,i wouldnt call this normal behaviour but its certainly not indicative of an actual rapist many people on the internet will say you should be raped
creepyPMs,removed,what consequence should there be should he go to jail for being creepy absolutely lets give up online anonymity holy christ man
creepyPMs,removed,you seem more aggressive than him
creepyPMs,removed,oh my god i also hate feet i have trouble wrapping my head around the fact that some people think theyre attractive
creepyPMs,removed,nothing creepy thats a keeper
creepyPMs,removed,you were being too nice haha once he called you a cunt you should have told him to fuck off
creepyPMs,removed,not strong enough of a response
creepyPMs,removed,come on im not saying one way isnt gross one has to be worse
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair at some point in your life the only qualification to be a friend was that you made eye contact with someone in your general area shame that changes
creepyPMs,removed,again i agree wholly that both are gross and wrong but one has to be worse i mean really they are each creepy in a unique and special way but which one would make you have uncomfortable tingles more if it happened to you
creepyPMs,removed,he was at least being a gentleman about it no forcing or anything
creepyPMs,removed,was that the same psychology of when a guy sends a dick pic they are hoping to receive a graphic sexual back in reciprocation they think that is a woman sent them a sexual pic they would be turned on and very excited so dont understand why some women hate dick pics so on the same thread he thinks if he sends a foot pic the op will send one back weird i never will understand foot fetishists they can never explain why they love feet just that they do and think them sexy i just cannot understand it though i do understand this is a creepy guy
creepyPMs,removed,of that could have been avoided if you just stopped responding when you should have
creepyPMs,removed,well a few years ago women started getting their boobs out in public to feed their babies i didnt want to see them but i kept silent because complain about a woman getting a boob out in public and youre an oppressor
creepyPMs,removed,well idk it seems like he just wants to be friends not very creepy at all
creepyPMs,removed,he was being a gentleman about it compared to the vast majority of creeps i am not defending him i am just pointing out that he has not forced it upon you as most creeps would
creepyPMs,removed,well you just got trolled x
creepyPMs,removed,its always cringey when people have to call out creepy pms also those stupid emojis
creepyPMs,removed,this sub should just be called forgot how to block
creepyPMs,removed,it got discouraging like the guy really didnt understand the question
creepyPMs,removed,maybe you should too
creepyPMs,removed,i mean you kind of freaked out about feet there for a second but i guess its kind of a weird convo they just seemed lonely and you were just waiting for someone to blow up at werent you
creepyPMs,removed,does this person have a history of being creepy to you i didnt interpret any of that as over the top he even seemed to accept your friendsonly boundary
creepyPMs,removed,i would consider it ive always thought it would be hot to have a woman talk me intomake me do something with another guy
creepyPMs,removed,mate youre a trump supporter you wont get accepted
creepyPMs,removed,female redditor here with similar experiences i have to say tbh hes not completely wrong if you really did say lets hang out sometime and why do you keep replying to him anyway blockignore his ass if you dont want to see him i get downvoted to hell for being straight up
creepyPMs,removed,you should really blur out peoples usernames next time
creepyPMs,removed,every guy does that
creepyPMs,removed,im a nice guy you stupid cunt shouldnt you be staying away from cunts like me staircasewit
creepyPMs,removed,its sad not one of the the many moms of ops ive hooked up with here felt they needed to tell me to quit it
creepyPMs,removed,what youre op if you dont care why would others or am i missing something
creepyPMs,removed,hey babe i eat assi dont think you understand i eat a lot of ass
creepyPMs,removed,if you dont contact the police you are defiantly putting yourself in danger
creepyPMs,removed,what is this a dissenting opinion away with thee thy vile villain leave this safe space for we want to laugh at people without hearing reason or the other side of the story for we are fragile butterflies and really cant handle criticism or dear god someone disagreeing with me if feminism is protecting women at every turn and whim on the internet because their feelings are at risk of getting hurt i want nothing to do with it seriously if you presume guilt without any chance to hear the creep his side of the story your morals are bad and you should feel bad
creepyPMs,removed,last girl i dated loved it she brought it up and asked me to
creepyPMs,removed,so youre telling me my girlfriend doesnt like it when i slap her pussy as foreplay that explains why she bites the tip of my penis i guess
creepyPMs,removed,my dear lord this guy is the embodiment of beta how did you even manage to stick him youre a nice person op
creepyPMs,removed,under your last pic you say you think he might be improving why didnt you just block him why are you still talking to him he thinks if he badgers you enough you will cave just block him so maybe he will finally register that you and him will never ever happen i had to do the same with a friend a week ago i always gave a second chance not anymore this way he might learn that he wont be always forgiven and maybe he will behave different with other people this time i didnt even block him just said goodbye unfriend and remove from all media when he wrote again i didnt read didnt answer im done trying to see the good in him and i suggest you the same for your own sanitys sake
creepyPMs,removed,damn i find it fucking crazy how nice some girls are if i was you this shit would be over instantly

creepyPMs,removed,to be fair we lose blood flow to the brain
creepyPMs,removed,why reproduce with a man like this your son will probably end up like him its in his genes
creepyPMs,removed,httpswwwredditcomuservorpaleskimo your messages are indeed racist towards white people
creepyPMs,removed,youre funny
creepyPMs,removed,haha the funniest thing is that he doesnt know youre a fag pretending to be a girl 😂😂😂👌👌 wwwwipcomlicom
creepyPMs,removed,on phone at work to say this
creepyPMs,removed,its a common response not saying its right when someone else is racist first this vorpal fella wasnt racist to him directly but was posting racist remarks on reddit when someone attacks a specific thing you identify with your gut response is to ask what makes them so special for not being that thing and try to undermine them
creepyPMs,removed,he only wishes his son were yours because he likes abortion lasagna
creepyPMs,removed,why bother with this shit block his ass
creepyPMs,removed,if youre monogamous with your husband why are you active on okc
creepyPMs,removed,i was thinking the same op said they dont have them on facebook they only have their number doesnt sound like they are friends honestly i think op likes the attention
creepyPMs,removed,fuck rule two i didnt read that shit
creepyPMs,removed,if this has been an ongoing thing why do you still respond to their messages
creepyPMs,removed,but lets be real most people are there to date and get laid
creepyPMs,removed,this whole thread is creepy
creepyPMs,removed,why do you keep this person in your life if they say things like this to you frequently
creepyPMs,removed,has anyone actually met one of these foot fetish creeps just for the lulz and to see what the fuck theyre like perhaps taking a male accomplice and wearing the least sexy footwear imaginable and just documenting how fucking weird they act
creepyPMs,removed,i find this the most forgivable creepy pm so far if you can confuse okc for an instant messenger dude is still thirsty af though
creepyPMs,removed,why havent you blocked him
creepyPMs,removed,i think op seriously needs to block him and make her social media profiles privatefriends only especially since he keeps commenting on her children if these comments escalate or sound like he might do somethingcome into town she may want to consider warning her childrens schools to be on the lookout for this nut job
creepyPMs,removed,i wonder if you started responding if you could outcreep him
creepyPMs,removed,it is not racist to not be attracted to asian men or black women ive know white people who say theyre not attracted to black people and vice verse and none of those people were racist you cant control what your sexuality is or who youre attracted to preferences are not racist
creepyPMs,removed,omg you guys are a drag
creepyPMs,removed,gotta hide the gut man he looks like the sort of dude whos got that chunky trunk like hes probably fairly strong but not in an aesthetically pleasing way
creepyPMs,removed,youre a girl so dating online or otherwise is pretty easy either way as a guy with severe anxiety i hate online dating i cant read people at all from just text and it feels like everyone is willing to drop you in a second be because of the huge availability of others
creepyPMs,removed,or just next level ken m
creepyPMs,removed,hmm how did you manage to take all those screenshots at the exact same time
creepyPMs,removed,damn son i feel bad for that guy something is definitely wrong with him
creepyPMs,removed,twist op has been responding and just deleted her responses
creepyPMs,removed,so out of curiosity i looked this dude up every picture is the same taken on the same machine on different days he has but has from year old dudes honestly the entire situation is entirely too creepy for me
creepyPMs,removed,for some reason the comment of them knocking around turned me on a little help me
creepyPMs,removed,leave brittinea alone
creepyPMs,removed,omigosh getting attention is sooo terrible rite guis
creepyPMs,removed,its not easy to tell but at first sight it looks like a dating app pretty stupid way to look for friends if ask me
creepyPMs,removed,the annoying part was that he clearly asked about your name and you talked about your friend twice
creepyPMs,removed,youre not wrong here and im new to this sub but does this really count as a creepy pm youre just disagreeing with someone who happens to be wrong and you also initiated the conversation
creepyPMs,removed,why even engage just ignore block and move on
creepyPMs,removed,im not agreeing with this dude but i am one of those guys who was falsely accused of rape because of some dumb girl didnt want to admit to what shed done
creepyPMs,removed,yea like others have said year olds are the worst hes probably the kind of person who prides himself in having edgy opinions and being different im not in any way defending him but hopefully theres hope this little shithead will grow out of it and realize what a little turd he is
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair it might be that of all rape accusations are false highly unlikely like near impossible we dont know how big of an issue it is in society and theres nothing to suggest its only its been a while since i looked into this but the amount of false accusations is an undefined number so i feel its disengenous to claim its
creepyPMs,removed,im pretty big on mens rights and womens rights btw and this guy is a basketcase i just want to point out that those of us who work with victims of false accusations as well as victims of rape we dont think that way i spent half my time reading that wondering why you were even engaging this person screw em hes an idiot
creepyPMs,removed,im not disagreeing with what youre saying i think its true but i also think our society doesnt like having grey areas as in case by case innocent until proven guilty has throw out the window for a bunch of guys lives by girls lying and girlsalso guys as well have been pressured into never going to the cops when they were raped i have no idea how to fix the problem but there needs to be some sort of ramification for people like that utah school that said since she was drunk its against policy and not rape when in fact she very so much was along with the people who make a false story to ruin someones life
creepyPMs,removed,oh yeah better go on the internet and complain about it expecting something magical to happen instead of going to the cops and a gynecologist to acquire the proofs necessary to imprison the rapist you do realise by not going to the police youre leaving a dangerous criminal free that will most likely rape somebody else again or are you selfish and really dont care whatsoever everything he said was right as much as people itt dont want to admit it expecting a victim to go the authorities and proove they are a victim isnt victim blaming its common sense go ahead mods ban me for daring to disagree and pat yourself on the back for stopping another bigot for today
creepyPMs,removed,i found a whiteknight
creepyPMs,removed,and you took it
creepyPMs,removed,so im going to throw in my two cents here but please dont hate me until youve finished reading the idiot thats texting is taking his opinion to the extreme the world isnt black and white but shades of grey perhaps he was falsely accused of raping someone sadly that does happen and can be insanely difficult for the victim in this case the person being accused to overcome both in reputation and their own mentality a friend of mine was threatened with a false rape charge and blackmailed for years as a school teacher it would ruin his life its these people that are the cancer that being said to claim that anyone who doesnt report it is a liar is so amazingly stupid that it hurt my brain to comprehend its a simple minded unthoughtful insensitive and hurtful view by a simple minded person who should no longer have the right to communicate with others as a fellow silent victim i feel for you there is a special form of pain deserved by someone who would take your right to say no its a shame you had to have that conversation but at least you know that they are not worth being friends with let the idiots be idiots with idiots
creepyPMs,removed,isnt that trolling
creepyPMs,removed,why dog shit
creepyPMs,removed,why even answer couldve just blocked him or ignored him nothing he said was creepy either
creepyPMs,removed,how so im legitimately curious as to how you came with the conclusion that society is more prone to victimblaming like is there statistical scientific evidence that proves your point or is it just your assumption on how the world works
creepyPMs,removed,is it bad that sometimes i just feel sorry for these people they cant spell or speak really like are they foreign or on the spectrum or something they probably dont have families to give them the mental health support they need
creepyPMs,removed,hes probably into rape roleplay but just really bad at bringing it up
creepyPMs,removed,fuck when did this place become an sjw shithole oh yeah always has been
creepyPMs,removed,i think thats the joke
creepyPMs,removed,nice throwaway username
creepyPMs,removed,wtf why were you dating this guy
creepyPMs,removed,i love your response to shows ya pussy like youre willing to show your pussy
creepyPMs,removed,itt whoosh
creepyPMs,removed,come on the whole convo is fake the boyfriend is obviously roleplaying jofferey
creepyPMs,removed,i know this is serious thing but lulz call the policeeee
creepyPMs,removed,i mean why dog shit as opposed to some other animals shit
creepyPMs,removed,he is absolutely just joking and just trying to be funny
creepyPMs,removed,haha sorry this is kinda funny definitely creepy but its a direct quote from yesterdays episode pretty much all of it
creepyPMs,removed,he was probably watching game of thrones reciting this scene live to your brother in hindsight missing his gf preparing to make peace and messing with the bro cause hell miss him too i wouldnt take this as any much as anything but a bizarre attention grab from a quirky ex boyfriend
creepyPMs,removed,this is a joke post for sure albeit a morbid joke
creepyPMs,removed,i think ive cracked the code send me pictures of your boyfriend topless waits for boob pics
creepyPMs,removed,rthathappenned
creepyPMs,removed,yeahweird dude did you block him
creepyPMs,removed,did you report him to the police saying things like that are very close to illegal
creepyPMs,removed,the most disturbing part of the messages youre literally disgusting wtf does that even mean
creepyPMs,removed,that was pretty funny to be fair to him
creepyPMs,removed,itt people only sort of getting the joke but missing the forest for the trees
creepyPMs,removed,actually report him to the police thats illegal if my friend can go to juvie for making a threat as a joke with apparent sarcasm he can go to jail
creepyPMs,removed,under some situations anyone can be oppressed just saying
creepyPMs,removed,so why do you answer them lmao
creepyPMs,removed,i would argue that the first message wasnt really all that creepy maybe a bit odd but seemed like they were just trying to be nice then the next one was creepy maybe not horrendously so but uncomfortable after that they went from rolling steadily downhill to jumping right off crazy peak of nutjob mountain
creepyPMs,removed,i agreed with everything he said excluding when he said if you were really raped youd go to the police i wouldnt call him shit because he has a differing opinion he was very well spoken and had a strong grasp on morality he just probably knew people who were convicted through false rape charges i dont see the reason to insult him for having different views and experiences than you
creepyPMs,removed,im not discussing the rape thing im asking why be an asshole and bully someone who has a different opinion
creepyPMs,removed,soi cant see your pussy
creepyPMs,removed,based op btfos again
creepyPMs,removed,i liked him too he also seemed to get it and left go go whispers guy p
creepyPMs,removed,unable to read due to shitty quality
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,same im gonna try it on my so next time i wanna order pizza lol
creepyPMs,removed,here is reddits response to the messages i censored the admins name just in case i guess by this point i have to keep posting and ignore him
creepyPMs,removed,im told the guy has autism is nearly and lives with his parents probably doesnt have a concept of boundaries
creepyPMs,removed,op just cut your losses and move on hes just going to keep using the debt as a reason to contact you this isnt that creepy yet but it looks like its going to be as he gets more desperate hell either eventually pay it back or he wont regardless of whether youre talking to him as long as he knows how to pay you back i guess if he doesnt pay you back because you wont talk to him you know thats the direction it was going in anyway as in he was going to use the debt as a way of punishing you in some way for something hell get over it faster if you just cut contact anyway
creepyPMs,removed,you should definitely confer with the girlfriend on this one
creepyPMs,removed,most people dont care about their profiles so much as op uppity nerd bitch grow some skin youre creepier than he is
creepyPMs,removed,germans have a certain skull structure different from other countries and ethnicities skill structures there was a post not too long ago about the different ones on rpics i think it was pretty interesting to look and read on
creepyPMs,removed,hes a creep misspelled hopping corrected his spelling after already misspelling a word
creepyPMs,removed,wow i didnt realize both sides could look like total assholes at once
creepyPMs,removed,what a reasonable response from op yeah fuck that guy for having a penis
creepyPMs,removed,i got confused for a moment and thought this post was actually about you and submitted by the guy there was nothing creepy about his messages and you were very rude and curt to be fair it is a pretty nice way of rejecting someone as he wont feel like he is missing out after seeing such a huge red flag
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know if id consider this creepy the guy may not have been able to follow directions so to speak but i suppose thats a lot better of a personality flaw to have than the rudeness op exhibits
creepyPMs,removed,sorry i didnt know that this was a safe space when i left my previous comment i will instead leave a comment in full agreement with the op as is required
creepyPMs,removed,yes this is a creepy guy his messages are clearly creepy to everyone who sees this your response was completely justified and this is excellent creepypms material good day
creepyPMs,removed,go fuck yourself bot its fucking true this post shouldnt even be on this sub its not even fucking creepy
creepyPMs,removed,i think you treated him a bit harshly no need to be a complete bitch
creepyPMs,removed,well in all honesty this is some pretty lackluster material
creepyPMs,removed,since there seems to be a growing issue with literacy on this particular post i invite everyone to read rule thoroughly before leaving a comment on this post have a good day
creepyPMs,removed,he was so incredibly creepy you get him girl beep boop
creepyPMs,removed,just because you dont subscribe to an idea doesnt mean it isnt fact
creepyPMs,removed,its pretty baffling that on a sub for judging people from their messages you cant call out the op for being a bitch
creepyPMs,removed,of course not
creepyPMs,removed,sarcasm would reverse the meaning of my message which would then violate the rule beep boop
creepyPMs,removed,this is a support sub if you honestly need support for this i dont even know what to say other than grow the fuck up
creepyPMs,removed,im sure ill get a shit storm for this but those of you who feel this guy is a horrible person entertain this thought process if you will he messages a girl on a dating site based on how she looks is that normal i personally have never used a dating site but based on my friends interactions of their messages are based on what the other person looks like i dont even believe that they read the profiles of the person they choose to message both male and female friends so he sees what he determines to be a beautiful girl and messages her asking if she is feeling naughty and interested and if they could have a little fun on here what does on here mean is that sexting or meeting up or either is that lingo supposed to draw an automatic conclusion op replies no now correct me if im wrong but isnt this an abnormal response isnt normal online dating protocol to not respond if you arent interested not saying that op is wrong for replying no but just asking if this is a common or normal response based on my friends interactions online they often talk about ghosting and how when you arent interested any longer you just stop messaging so id assume the same protocol is true for when someone messages you and you arent interested receiving the no the guy feels that at least op responded so that gives him an opening is that a reasonable conclusion for him to make or should he just take no to mean fuck off i know from real world dating that woman oftentimes will say no or put on a not interested persona when a guy approaches them because they might not be looking to be approached or they might not be automatically attracted to the guy however i also know that guys who are the ones often making the first move dont settle for this no or dont let the no be the final thing they say to the woman because they believe that they could convince the girl or change her mind or show her something about them that stands out in the real world it would seem that ops no wouldnt be an automatic leave me the fuck alone is the no to be interpreted this way in the online world if it is why is that everything else the guy did after the no was just stupid but based on the opening conversation should the guy have stopped replying after ops original no tldr the opening of this interaction is confusing and im curious as to what the proper online protocol is here
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair you have been somewhat rude and i dont really see what kind of support youd need for a message that wasnt even disturbing or odd he did have that nice slice of entitlement at the end though haha
creepyPMs,removed,not all of us myself for example i am delighted by the slightest moment at which i can display my chivalry and in this case i would surely morph into a literal doormat at the house you were showing me just so you could wipe the speckles of dirt off your shoes onto my tongue mmmhmmmmmmm i love u mlady i will make you squirt with my inch cock
creepyPMs,removed,dont worry about this fucktard commenting hopefully the mods will delete it hes clearly not following the rules just report him
creepyPMs,removed,ex uh huh
creepyPMs,removed,youre a poor negotiator op
creepyPMs,removed,what a close minded bitch hes better off without her
creepyPMs,removed,people like you are ruining society why should everyone have to do and act the way you want them to people can say and do whatever the fuck they want lady the feeling of being harassed is subjective so yes if youre a sensitive little twat then you should expect to be harassed every time you leave your house or visit a public forum on the internet it is completely unreasonable for anyone to assume that a man sitting beside your child is a paedophile and will molest them but then again that is my opinion of your retarded opinion and were both allowed to have opinions just like were both allowed to perceive harassment differently and just like men in many muslim majority countries are allowed to stone their daughters to death if theyre raped ps go find a new therapist to help you with your rape issues the one your seeing now is obviously shit at their job oh and if you reply to me again im going to feel harassed and cry myself to sleep
creepyPMs,removed,the post itself violates one of the rules of rule dont give me that shit
creepyPMs,removed,not gonna lie i didnt think anyone posted in gw was really a woman cant believe people actually do it especially this being reddit
creepyPMs,removed,the sad part is that guy gets laid more than me
creepyPMs,removed,eh isnt really creepy sloppy kisses are unique
creepyPMs,removed,somebody please cut his dick off
creepyPMs,removed,dont find it creepy at all he just thought he was talking to his friend way is history views creepy just because they dont align to your views preferring a girl who is a virgin over obe who isnt is pretty common preference for men well just dont telling girls that but most men know it
creepyPMs,removed,the first girl doesnt count i was drunk
creepyPMs,removed,wow you were generous in comparing his tiny dick to a dying flower shouldve called it a nasty slimy slug thats being buried in rock salt
creepyPMs,removed,how does the concept of rape culture apply here exactly this is one dude being a complete cunt not an entire medium excusingcommending his actions
creepyPMs,removed,i think this is cute
creepyPMs,removed,nowhere in that message did he say he was white your comment is just as cringe worthy
creepyPMs,removed,im trying to be devils advocate here but i think that this time its probably due to the guy being stupid he probably meant ummm instead of mmmm thats his first mistake then he told you that he isnt going to do those things with the detergent he probably figured he should say that because he probably felt that you wouldnt answer his query because you probably would have suspected that thats exactly what he would do stupid decision because he could have made you feel safer about answering his query if he had just said i really like how nice your clothes look and literally nobody around me has such nice looking clothes so i figure you must be using a damn good detergent all in all the guy was
creepyPMs,removed,can someone creepy pm me
creepyPMs,removed,dont worry this isnt my account lol
creepyPMs,removed,i came here for the creeps but cant get over that you posted a photo of yourself surrounded by your washing on a dating website
creepyPMs,removed,im trying to be devils advocate here but i think he deserves to know the detergent type
creepyPMs,removed,fake
creepyPMs,removed,ill try to be the devils advocate to the devils advocate so the mod dont make it too hard on the guy if they do isnt trying to remove the creepiness from a post that was not overly rude but just awkward to reassure the victim a form of support in this case
creepyPMs,removed,thats what the piegon said u cunt
creepyPMs,removed,saying someone is a biological sex isnt transphobic saying they are a man might be transphobic saying they are male is a fact you cannot change the sex you are born as that is male you can change the gender you are which would be to a woman in this case
creepyPMs,removed,its not arrogance its biological fact i mean i dont care what somebody identifies as they can think theyre a tree for all i care but that doesnt change the fact they are human just like being transgender doesnt change the fact you were born either male or female it blows my mind people actually get annoyed at using the word male to describe someone born with a penis if i am referring to a mtf transgender person then i will refer to them in the feminine form but that does not stop them from being biologically male
creepyPMs,removed,this is more hilarious than creepy imo
creepyPMs,removed,not defending the creep because the creep came on way to strong and said some uninvited things but unless op had an age preference set that the creep wasnt part of the creep couldnt have known about that aspect plenty of relationships have age gaps but its also okay to have age preferences and not want older guys to message you in summary guy is a creep because hes a creep no matter his age
creepyPMs,removed,no nothing that makes me think of criminal minds because it was a joke
creepyPMs,removed,so op is the creep gotcha
creepyPMs,removed,there is no such thing as a proper dom its a preference it doesnt come with a prescribed list of behaviors
creepyPMs,removed,i thought the dudes strong maybe reaction was pretty funny
creepyPMs,removed,cmv i cant help but feel this sub has grown into a safe space in which people bait horrible reactions out of men in order to bully them collectively
creepyPMs,removed,replying to someone with just the word no on a platform like this cant be considered anything else its rude and dismissive when someones putting themselves out there obviously this guy isnt very please tell but op was rude first be nice to people and they might be nice back
creepyPMs,removed,crucify me if you see fit but my mother taught me to be polite to people if i expected the same back
creepyPMs,removed,forgive me but i dont know what youre getting at here
creepyPMs,removed,so whats your answer op
creepyPMs,removed,thats weird i thought this was rcreepypms not rroommatedrama
creepyPMs,removed,you were probably right but just because a guy is thinking of you when hes drinking doesnt mean he only wants a booty call lol people can drunkenly text their crush or someone their interested in too
creepyPMs,removed,key word here is fathers
creepyPMs,removed,not a huge fan of how hes responding in an encouraging way then sharing it to be laughed at doesnt excuse how shes being highly innapropriate
creepyPMs,removed,sorry but thats worth it therell be some pain in the ass at the end but nothing does it like crazy
creepyPMs,removed,she sounds crazy enough to fuck or times
creepyPMs,removed,i was thinking bpd but its some kind of pd
creepyPMs,removed,just so you dont rule it out ive been fucking with my friend via text for years with catfacts he has no idea who it is because i have multiple numbers it drives him insane because he has no idea who it is his brother knows all about it too which makes it even funnier one of these days ill post the epic story on rfunny
creepyPMs,removed,thats a safe assumption considering all the other texts were riddled with no punctuation or the wrong word but youre probably still right
creepyPMs,removed,ugh empathic moment of shame i did this myself though across like twenty four hours and only with one woman who was initially interested before i bombed like the boston marathon one reason the one day felt like forever to me was i got obsessed with okc for the first days after i started using it it turns out shame like all emotions has a purpose
creepyPMs,removed,so did your friend sleep with her
creepyPMs,removed,only women are allowed to be upset about double standards
creepyPMs,removed,ugly godll wrap your bitch up like some headphones
creepyPMs,removed,meanwhile in the rest of the world a giant hurricane is hitting the caribbean and the south eastern us lots of countries have weather
creepyPMs,removed,baby mommies and baby daddies are often considered a negative in our culture similar to having a child out of wedlocklife partnership neither are actually bad nor will they have a negative impact on the child as long as they are raised in a supportive stable enviorment the reason these things are considered a negative is stability is that much harder to find parents in different cities where and who to celebrate birthdaysholidays who has final say when the bio dad has different rules than the new dadmom bio motherfather arent being fair in who gets custody step siblings that may or may not live with a child full time i could go on it just makes things more complicated not worse just complicated
creepyPMs,removed,the boys go to their fathers fathers is there a story here
creepyPMs,removed,meanwhile hurricanes are killing people in haiti and florida is on lock down
creepyPMs,removed,if he has been doing all that for that long and you havent blocked him or removed him what the fuck are you doing like yea hes a creepy moron but why are you not removing him are you enjoying the attention every so often
creepyPMs,removed,i meant sooner years of harassment why wait that long
creepyPMs,removed,op is jelly
creepyPMs,removed,i know my statement stands its still his friend and theyre both encouraging this
creepyPMs,removed,hmm tell us a little about this sister you speak of
creepyPMs,removed,calm down white knight she wont have sex with you
creepyPMs,removed,didnt say no
creepyPMs,removed,being a dick hole and pointing out that someone could have avoided a shitty situation easily are different things you werent being nice you were being a white knight what ever this sub has become a cesspool of white knights and illogical individuals peace
creepyPMs,removed,no need for the childish homophobic response doesnt make you look much better than him
creepyPMs,removed,why has she tolerated him for eight years exactly
creepyPMs,removed,the hot one obviously
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,when in rome
creepyPMs,removed,how nice of you maybe shell want to bang you now
creepyPMs,removed,it was direct either you are up for a booty call or not better than leading you on for minutes only to find out he was some creepy guy
creepyPMs,removed,is it really worth censoring this you say the actual word in your head reading it so whats the point
creepyPMs,removed,she just want the d what is the problem
creepyPMs,removed,the guy isnt blaming the victim he is stating an opinion that isnt offensive nor against the rules i believe
creepyPMs,removed,oh come on its obviously a dating or sex chat app or some shit you honestly thought it was an app about cats can you tell us this app if it is a cat app its different if it is a sex chat come on
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,you forgot to mention that it was really just one popular artist and his fanbase that was pushing for the art to be banned
creepyPMs,removed,he forgot to mention that it was really just one popular artist and his fanbase that was pushing for the art to be banned said popular artist also used to draw art of the topic in question this is not the first time this artist has used his fanbase to force a website to ban content as well
creepyPMs,removed,said fanbase also was guilty of harassing artists and the websites staff and threatening to physically harm site staff in person if the content was not banned
creepyPMs,removed,for all we know this dude could have posted anything what was posted was it actual child porn oh fn the problem with fn is that they originally stated they werent going to ban it and then quickly caved in which got people pissed since some people were either already there or people joining i dunno what the dude posted but ill say that kemoshota furry boys typically to isnt exactly promoting child rape unless someone that already has pedophilic tendencies sees it i like kemoshota a lot but real children are gross retards that annoy and bug the shit out of people worst thing on the planet promoting child rape would be something like sexualizing about the fact theyre young specifically not differentiating your fetishes in fantasy and the real world or talking about how sexy or good looking children are im not protecting anyone here except the reasonable people that do cub and kemoshota and kemololi and such i have no evidence against or for whatever was posted since i cannot see it but i just wanted to give my two cents on the situations entirety
creepyPMs,removed,i dont condone the harassing but a lot of people were peeved from the fact that the site aready had a small userbase which was also growing and then they were suddenly dumped after the site said theyd allow cub porn im personally confused as to why people went to a site that allowed content they dont like if they dont like it why go there i know there was a whole security scare on fa but wouldnt sofurry have been a better choice
creepyPMs,removed,im more confused than anything else what was he even trying to do what was his goal
creepyPMs,removed,my comment probably got removed because it contained a few unsatisfactory words to describe how much i dislike children anyways ill post an edited version of my explanation on what i think about the entire cub is immoral ideal its from a neutral standpoint despite me liking kemoshota so please just trust me on this for all we know this dude could have posted anything what was posted was it actual child porn oh fn the problem with fn is that they originally stated they werent going to ban it and then quickly caved in which got people pissed since some people were either already there or people joining i dunno what the dude posted but ill say that kemoshota furry boys typically to isnt exactly promoting child rape unless someone that already has pedophilic tendencies sees it i like kemoshota a lot but real children are gross and annoying little buggers they tend to the hell out of people personqlly one of my least favorite things thing on the planet promoting child rape would be something like sexualizing about the fact theyre young specifically not differentiating your fetishes in fantasy and the real world or talking about how sexy or good looking children are im not protecting anyone here except the reasonable people that do cub and kemoshota and kemololi and such i have no evidence against or for whatever was posted since i cannot see it but i just wanted to give my two cents on the situations entirety reminder that this is a neutral standpoint with no biases no ideological filter none of that its just my point on this whole shebang
creepyPMs,removed,well without context yes pedophilia is quite disgusting i actually know the person that posted those links and while hes an idiot hes not a pedophile what he linked was a screencap of someone saying they hate how people say think of the children gore and rape art is fine because its art and yet specifically get mad at cub porn i agree with the screencap he took since it explains how this kind of thing sets a double standard if you think gore is horrible because it insinuates real life murder fine i guess but choosing only certain things is a form of hypocrisy if you consider cub porn to be immoral then gore rape snuff and any other art of the sort should also be applied equally this is why its important to know context of things the dude defending the pedos wasnt even a pedo he was just mad about people cherrypicking certain fetishes and defending others that are also illegal in real life
creepyPMs,removed,i look at them because theyre cute and have a different mentality than real life children theres also the factor that these are fictional creatures with no real definition on what their sexual or mental development entails i certainly dont like stuff where theyere like actual kid minds i prefer ones where they act like adults and look cute the wonderful thing about fiction and fantasy is that anything can happen you can have a year old thats a god among seven dimensions and contain all the knowledge in the universe
creepyPMs,removed,actually the reason its considered fine is because they are a fictional species of fantasy setting these are not real people with real consequences or any form of reality sites like inkbunny have all porn involving humans banned and does not allow condoning molesting children or real pedophilia its fine if it makes you uncomfortable but i recommend trying to stand from a more neutral perspective
creepyPMs,removed,theres a lot of things youre legally allowed to say in public that is not popular i can apply the same thing to furry things in general if i went out into public and said im a furry and i look at furry porn with dog dicks on anthropomorphic dogs and anthro sheep butt people would definitely not agree with that public statement but its totally legal sorry if its taking a long time to respond but reddits cooldown system is having me wait after each post i have a bad way of words but please try to understand what im talking about im not on a moral standpoint of child child im trying to explain a logical and neutral standpoint as to why i like it and how it doesnt make me a pedophile
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think real life murder is treated any better than real pedophilia also i dont want to fuck children thats pretty gross and creepy if you understood the context im trying to explain they are complete fantasy and do not exist thus having no victim or any sort of real world taboo that requires punishment in the context of kemoshota a lot of it is japanese art which draw them as adultminded individuals that look small and cute like this one is cute its so cute and lovable theres porn of him not going to link it for the sake of not getting flack about posting it and hes not traumatized hes not innocent and unaware hes not abused or corrupted or convinced in doing it he knows about sex and has sex much like an adult does and handles it like an adult if the dog were going take off your pants and acting super creepy about it and the cat wasnt aware about sex then it would be pretty offputting however since this is a fantasy world these two are in a cute loving relationship with no form of abuse or sexual assault or anything
creepyPMs,removed,yes it can be a neutral argument what you do is look at both sides assess what information and reason they give and put them together so far ive only seen its a child which isnt the argument its not a child its not a real child with real children connections it is not a way to branch off from real children its its own thing with its own set of rules my arguments so far have been that it is a fantasy with no real children involved or effected in any way that op posted a post with no context that people are cherrypicking certain kinks about fantasy and how theyd be horrible in real life about how public opinion is not law or fact and one point i wanted to bring up is ignorance people ignorant about certain things will not understand things unless they try to understand or look into it people in public will be ignorant about people that like scat or sex they hate those people and generalize them into a biased category the same happens here one man is mad at people for being hypocritical and people call him a pedophile because he was making a point that was against what they stood for rather than generalizing we should read and assess the situation carefully get to know people do research read what they say carefully and try to reply in a calm neutral tone with counterpoints and reasoning it also helps to use i think or i feel to display an opinion and to not aggressively use you in a debate
creepyPMs,removed,ive learned that pretty much any social chat app you gonna get guys that wanna show you their dicks or talk dirty o o its best to steer clear
creepyPMs,removed,it happens the other way around a lot too people are shit
creepyPMs,removed,i bet you dont shave your pussy
creepyPMs,removed,it was an honest answer
creepyPMs,removed,maybe im a dick but im not really seeing a problem here you were honest so was he all i see is incompatibility
creepyPMs,removed,which asshole is the one im supposed to laugh at
creepyPMs,removed,i honestly dont think he was being a dick you both have different expectations and its best you find out now that you arent on the same page i hope you find someone who meshes a little better with you than this dude
creepyPMs,removed,id say this belongs more on rcringepics
creepyPMs,removed,i can think the argument is that having weird cartoon cp available will stop people from seeking out the real stuff if that is true i think the argument is valid i do not think there are any real evidence to support it however and i do believe most websites that balance on the border on the law will sometimes go over
creepyPMs,removed,im not going to lie your post history is the bestworst
creepyPMs,removed,sometimes i wish a dude would try this shit with me i use photoshop for a living id send him the most convincing photo of himself with a micropenis
creepyPMs,removed,so did you send the nudes or wot
creepyPMs,removed,if hes romeo he should kill himself now
creepyPMs,removed,niggers are monkey monkeys are retarded and retards are shit if you believe in evolution then every one is a monkey indeed monkeys are retarded and you are living proof of it dont know how you confused a retard with feces but still proves my point that youre a retarded piece of shit
creepyPMs,removed,i kinda feel bad for them well except for the whole they dont want my pms send more pms thing i mean its not like they really got to choose what theyre attracted to and im sure they know its wrong but cant help it to clarify i still think abusing children for your own pleasure is incredibly wrong and something nobody should do and there is no excuse for doing so even if youre a pedo but i do feel kinda bad for them hopefully im not breaking the rules by posting this and im sorry if i am but i just wanted to point out that theres two sides to the story
creepyPMs,removed,i get that the creep took it to a racial place but you didnt have to
creepyPMs,removed,can they fit inches poor guy he probably meant to say centimeters
creepyPMs,removed,wow you must be triggered someone said a pleasantry to youjesus take a seat and catch your breath im getting triggered just thinking of such a situation good god how dare they
creepyPMs,removed,well he is not wrong in a sense just the wrong aproach and the wrong place
creepyPMs,removed,they are all thinking that obv
creepyPMs,removed,dont people understand that some people have morals learn to be flexible and go down on your self its possible
creepyPMs,removed,if you have to have sex before you can fall in love you may have some issues or have no idea what love is
creepyPMs,removed,seriously you seem to have loads of absolute douches on your case is there a gang of them or something yeah theyre called rshitredditsays
creepyPMs,removed,is this one of those dudes that as some developmental issues that you were nice to out of pity op
creepyPMs,removed,why did he get banned he was only asking how the post was creepy
creepyPMs,removed,without context this doesnt seem like a very creepy pm
creepyPMs,removed,not very creepy to be honest
creepyPMs,removed,tan your tits is the best insult ive heard in a while
creepyPMs,removed,not being a perv here but just curious as to what this guy was looking at
creepyPMs,removed,i honestly dont think he was trying to insult you at that point i think it was his way of complimenting you hes saying your boobs look so good they it makes him wonder if they are real or not either way its still a pretty stupid question to ask someone you dont even know
creepyPMs,removed,this was annoying to read on both sides
creepyPMs,removed,i just looked at your post history didnt realize how annoying it was to have big boobs or is it cause you have a thirst trap boob pic up either way those guys are ridiculous
creepyPMs,removed,im not interested in girls with poor battery management
creepyPMs,removed,you seem entitled and he seems like he has some insecurities having insecurities is imo not bad especially if someone on a site like that is as unfriendly as you maybe he had to built up a lot of self esteem to message you and you crushed it some posts on here are genuinely creepy but yours is justdumb
creepyPMs,removed,why dont you just stop him
creepyPMs,removed,this dude complements you and then u give him attitude and get all salty when he gives it back im sure he dodged a bullet with this conceded girl
creepyPMs,removed,calm down what reality are you referring to the reality of op im not sure if she flaunts her tits on the internet i do know some men prefer real boobs and some prefer fake ones that was the reality my comment was referring to
creepyPMs,removed,in this guys defense the only reason i still have tinder bumble and hinge are better in my area is so my friends can send hilarious and stupid messages
creepyPMs,removed,sooomy question is why do so many girls wait to block someone as soon as shit goes bad why respond why not just block them outright and be done w it
creepyPMs,removed,pissy manchild syndrome
creepyPMs,removed,found the foot fetishist
creepyPMs,removed,the s ruined it
creepyPMs,removed,he is an hateful idiot but you are not much better yourself
creepyPMs,removed,anyone who couldnt see the super obvious sarcasm in that post deserves to be offended
creepyPMs,removed,of course its wrong to call someone a racial slur but the whole worlds better then being white puts the op in the same boat
creepyPMs,removed,niggs
creepyPMs,removed,c
creepyPMs,removed,i mean a little fat shame never killed anyone
creepyPMs,removed,yeah you like that you fucking retard
creepyPMs,removed,stop it youre giving me ptsd flashbacks
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand how everyone here thinks this is bad yet there seem to be a lot of guys that need to insult any guy here willing to admit that you are guilty of doing the whole hellorejectioninsults i just dont understand what you get from it
creepyPMs,removed,as far as im concerned your both villainous here a good act doesnt wash out the bad nor does a bad act wash out the good you did good in defending yourself in some sort of way but on the other end your defense was just crude and barbaric as his was
creepyPMs,removed,white people can be so overly sensitive lol
creepyPMs,removed,but trump is fat himself
creepyPMs,removed,do not blame the fact that you got in trouble for defending yourself on your size im skinny and have been all of my life and i was bullied as well you think i was allowed to defend myself dont use it as an excuse just acknowledge that the system is generally busted and theres nothing inherently special about your case compared to pretty much anybody else in a similar situation
creepyPMs,removed,how stupid are you
creepyPMs,removed,god yeah those weird gay dudes being attracted to men and stuff s
creepyPMs,removed,spoiler alert he wasnt attractive and he obviously cant read or write and he called me older its all a bunch of how about no
creepyPMs,removed,you are into him though you just think youre not its a female mind thing
creepyPMs,removed,dont even acknowledge it just block him the most devastating thing you can do to this type is ignore them
creepyPMs,removed,funny how this time the indian was on the receiving end of the creepy pms real change of pace there its nice to see really
creepyPMs,removed,i like how you handled it some people on this subreddit could learn a thing or two form you
creepyPMs,removed,you let that go on too long before shutting him down lol the first time he asked about jacking off i would have been out of there
creepyPMs,removed,why would you even explain yourself for so long this guy was just toying with you not like he cares
creepyPMs,removed,your lipstick isnt actually good though it makes your face seem pale and is too much anyway
creepyPMs,removed,where are people posting their pictures on reddit
creepyPMs,removed,christ just rape a disadvantaged woman yeah fuck that guy and fuck you too
creepyPMs,removed,lets get this straight he has been bothering me for months i leave him alone for the past months and he messages me from userdelvinmcelroy which he just admitted is also his account asking why i stopped arguing with him while at the same time provoking me stalking me commenting on every comment of mine from userazalasvalentine heres both accounts with messages in the same screen shot he is a fucking pathetic liar httpmimgurcomnoivczq

creepyPMs,removed,why hide his name name and shame
creepyPMs,removed,how do you know who he is
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair he was right right
creepyPMs,removed,is after people knew war could fuck people up but it underappreciated and not well understood relative to today a lot of veterans suffered in silence coping with alcoholism or becoming abusive to their spouses and kids yeah hes for sure fucked up and a threat to this sex worker all im saying is maybe the response should be just to back away block him avoid the threat instead of making fun of his traumatized dysfunction
creepyPMs,removed,so was he small for your standards
creepyPMs,removed,like what techniques asking for a friend ofc
creepyPMs,removed,why are you on okcupid if you have a boyfriend
creepyPMs,removed,i agree with the whole anti unsolicited dick picks thing but the fact that you said no one will know its yours is pretty immature what if i took a screenshot of a nude a girl sent but put it online with her face blurred i dont think many of you would like that
creepyPMs,removed,just out of curiosity why are you in okcupid if you have a boyfriend
creepyPMs,removed,i may have paid for bestiality porn when i was a teen
creepyPMs,removed,cam work lol get a job
creepyPMs,removed,oh wow why the cuntish attitude go from telling someones angelic to calling her fat nice going
creepyPMs,removed,why blur it tho id out the fucking predator if it ends up that hes shamed for it whos fault is that hes sending pics of his horrible little appendage to everyone and anyone its his own tough shit if it ends up getting posted face n all
creepyPMs,removed,i think the blame is on you for being in a relationship with someone who types like a braindiseased
creepyPMs,removed,we should totally get a bunch of dudes to bombard him with dick pics lol
creepyPMs,removed,shitty wording from the guy but not being attracted to certain genitals isnt transphobia just like its not racist to be moreless attracted to certain skin colors
creepyPMs,removed,which is why i said the guy is a dickhead it was mostly on the transphobia in the title
creepyPMs,removed,shut the fuck up you rancid swine im trying to seduce you with my charm
creepyPMs,removed,b o d y s h a m i n g
creepyPMs,removed,you should post a boob pic tho
creepyPMs,removed,while i hate to say that youre now a proud addition to his fap folder and at worst might appear in one of a myriad of submissions in some thread or imgur assuming he ends up doing anything with it i doubt he will though since hes probably too busy looking for his next session youre going to be all right theres so many pictures of amateur nudes on the internet that youre like a single plankton in the sea and i dont think yours would set yourself apart from any other
creepyPMs,removed,well ive read on askreddit about a scene from a serbian film about a guy shoving his penis into someones eye socket and killing them in the process
creepyPMs,removed,huh
creepyPMs,removed,sure saying them titties is rude but youve never heard of people them as a compliment them cookies that cake means theyre really good also i know im gonna get down voted because im not blindly hating on the creep but he wasnt even butthurt you were the one who was originally butthurt and you pulled the year old insult why you so butthurt bro
creepyPMs,removed,maybe you werent butthurt but neither was he and you were clearly trying to get a reaction out of him
creepyPMs,removed,while this guy did turn out to be a douchebag i do feel like immediately shutting him down simply because he was one year out of your age range is a little premature who knows the true love of your life may be out there waiting for you just out of your reach because youre a couple months too young for him
creepyPMs,removed,i guess everyone has their preferences and are willing to bend here or there to accommodate certain people at least you can put age ranges on your profile without looking like a bitch i only like white guys but i cant put that on my profile without people jumping my ass for being racist people like what they like
creepyPMs,removed,its so small the fda has to consider it a choking hazard
creepyPMs,removed,this needs to be sent to his girlfriend i feel bad for her
creepyPMs,removed,deaf dumb and creepy not a good combo
creepyPMs,removed,isnt it best to just not respond to people like that i feel like people adopt the creepy pm mindset when they realize how many heys get ignored and how much attention being a jackass gets
creepyPMs,removed,low key really wish i had the confidence to be this shameless
creepyPMs,removed,she might but she really should know this guys not fit to be in a relationship she deserves better
creepyPMs,removed,you shouldve known that was going to be disastrous by the way he typed
creepyPMs,removed,i wouldnt bother responding i knew this was going downhill when i saw bdsm
creepyPMs,removed,ew
creepyPMs,removed,y not block
creepyPMs,removed,its like throwing a picnic on the beach and getting pissed when seagulls show up
creepyPMs,removed,so im going to deliver these are some of the messages i was able to grab of himmakong different throwaways and following me there are comments too but theres too many to grab so heres the pms insteadat least some of them also somemay say hours and minutes but these were all months ago httpimgurcomktgyqnh i know this one was him due to how he writes my username httpimgurcombnsayqy i comment on a post he just happened to be in explains how paranoid he is httpimgurcomqvteuht he then impersonates me which is very creepy
creepyPMs,removed,hey op
creepyPMs,removed,hes my kinda guy he sounds smart and trying to imprive something most of you dumbfucks know nothing about
creepyPMs,removed,your the creep here op hes just a other teen guy looking for a friend he acts nice and reapectful and u give him snotty responses
creepyPMs,removed,girl really he is years on this dating site already so clearly he knows what works and what works not so you better cut your attitude
creepyPMs,removed,well since all white people which i assume perhaps incorrectly op happens to be based on the response are apparently racist by default i dont see how this is much of an insult considering its completely beyond our ability to control the circumstances of our own birth and upbringing
creepyPMs,removed,why did it bother you that he was viewing your profile was he sending inappropriate messages whilst doing it i dont understand
creepyPMs,removed,no i didnt
creepyPMs,removed,im not claiming all white people are racist im reiterating the claims others make
creepyPMs,removed,how did you know he was viewing every day just out of curiosity
creepyPMs,removed,this is more sad than creepy
creepyPMs,removed,guess you dont upvote jewish guys racist cunt
creepyPMs,removed,ugh you are a alllivesmatter kind of person arent you disgusting
creepyPMs,removed,hes definitely creepy but i rolled my eyes so hard at a woman of my stature
creepyPMs,removed,i see the blm movement is spreading
creepyPMs,removed,lol ok
creepyPMs,removed,holy balls this might be the strangest fetish ive seen pushed on you ladies yet
creepyPMs,removed,just to play devils advocate here he may have wanted to meet face to face to make sure he wasnt getting catfished it happens often enough
creepyPMs,removed,reality is harsh sorry youre not being worshipped enough
creepyPMs,removed,as i read it i kept thinking why do you keep answering him he would have been shut down by me after the netflix and chill opener telling him where youre going where you live doesnt seem safe to me if youre not looking to get stalked
creepyPMs,removed,its a good thing i dont have the ability to maim people over the internet that guy would be missing parts i promise he would miss
creepyPMs,removed,why do you continue to engage in conversation
creepyPMs,removed,i can adjust my maiming for her
creepyPMs,removed,the title of this post gave me cancer and aids
creepyPMs,removed,someone set this garbage human being on fire l
creepyPMs,removed,at no way am i answering that text it can wait for a lot later why do you
creepyPMs,removed,its one of those things where its flattering but at the same time you can understand why some girls react the way they do to guys messaging them for the most part i get it now but try not to be mean about it
creepyPMs,removed,probably just drunk girls saying outrageous things on each others tinders as a joke still pretty gross but i doubt a girl actually looking to hook up would talk like this
creepyPMs,removed,could she fit in a rowboat
creepyPMs,removed,pussy
creepyPMs,removed,she might have been a mutt or yea you might not need it i was just kidding around
creepyPMs,removed,stop censoring so much shit youre part of a much larger problem
creepyPMs,removed,pussy
creepyPMs,removed,most dudes would be thrilled to receive this message but its most likely a bot
creepyPMs,removed,sure you dont let me refresh your memory since you just deleted the last two days of your posts here is the post i was responding to since you got banned for it i pmd instead of replying on the thread this was the link before you decided to delete everything
creepyPMs,removed,haha whos the user funny thing is that the mashriq is clearly superior over north africa in every possible way the best thing morocco is known among saudis is being a hub for prostitutes and sorcery
creepyPMs,removed,definitely stealing this one
creepyPMs,removed,probably works more often than youd think as a man my instant lizardbrain response was depends then my dense outer shell of emotional scarring and bitter callous catches up and i think wait a second thats awfully demanding for a stranger on the internet and forward i am suspicious is this a scam probably and then at the tail end i get a bit pissed off jealous and indignant she can get away with opening conversations like this and get laid fuck her even if she is real
creepyPMs,removed,is that better
creepyPMs,removed,if she was cute i wouldnt mind although id be suspicious
creepyPMs,removed,well did you do it
creepyPMs,removed,its a dude
creepyPMs,removed,if trump is prolgbt then why did he choose a running mate that believes in conversion therapy
creepyPMs,removed,is this still creepy on tinder
creepyPMs,removed,i was hoping i wasnt the only one to feel a little uneasy about a sexually aggressive women
creepyPMs,removed,wait you said no
creepyPMs,removed,why is it really creepy its not like its particularly threatening or anything
creepyPMs,removed,should have titled this ayy bby wan some mod tools
creepyPMs,removed,whats your twitch
creepyPMs,removed,how did she look
creepyPMs,removed,yea that wasnt a woman
creepyPMs,removed,nah its a woman you can tell her little tantrum in the last message
creepyPMs,removed,want to rub your bald head on my bald pussy
creepyPMs,removed,this is unbelievably fake
creepyPMs,removed,ya but do they id like to think i would get so much dick if i was a chick
creepyPMs,removed,to quote the best looking man whore i know you dont sleep with over girls by having standards
creepyPMs,removed,this is one of those posts where rtrashy meets rcreepypms
creepyPMs,removed,come on depends on how she looks and whether or not you think shes a botscammerdude or whatever youre worried about
creepyPMs,removed,girls struggle to get laid too hilarious that made my saturday
creepyPMs,removed,i have yet to see a man throw a tantrum about being rejected when pretending to be a girl trying to hook up with a bald guy
creepyPMs,removed,willing and honoredinteresting way to put it lol im not sure about this girl op
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i think the ones oozing desperation and crass opening messages are the only ones struggling i mean lets be realistic men have to actually put in some effort women just have to decide where is too low in lowering their standards an unattractive man needs one hell of a big heart a great personality towering intellect and the ability to take rejection without giving up an unattractive woman needs in internet connection there will be a guy that will have sex with her
creepyPMs,removed,ugly girls struggle to get laid
creepyPMs,removed,i mean this is pretty fucking hilarious tbh id send nudes
creepyPMs,removed,i dont see the point in continuing the conversation by making him address his answers it did seem a bit like you were flustered that he didnt think like you i wouldve moved on instead of getting so involved with questioning someone i wasnt compatible with
creepyPMs,removed,that was an awfully long time to talk to someone you clearly wrote off
creepyPMs,removed,woah there is really no need for the passive aggressiveness i was merely commenting on your tenacity and probably my amusement at how long you bothered to continued that conversation
creepyPMs,removed,at no point did i say you were wrong my comment was not asking you to defend your actions try to not be so defensive not everyone is out to get you👍🏼
creepyPMs,removed,is the psychotic ones text in white or purple seems purple to me
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,call me insane but i dont think are you single is that creepy id say the response was more creepy actually
creepyPMs,removed,but but but technically i never saw anyone saying no to a creep here literally i didnt see one message where just no was written at perhaps this the answer to all our worries
creepyPMs,removed,im sorry thats my fault im a stupid sexist i forgot only women win here
creepyPMs,removed,block him and move on with your life the guy is being a creep and probably is going through a hard time in his life continuing any kind of communication is reinforcement to his behavior
creepyPMs,removed,autism is a hell of a thing
creepyPMs,removed,why did you reply back when he said take care i would have ended it there
creepyPMs,removed,you might not but that doesnt mean everyone else has to follow your selfimposed rules
creepyPMs,removed,the initial remark was creepy but the rest was just a dumb asshole arguing with a more intelligent asshole
creepyPMs,removed,oh no a man messaged me what do i do internet
creepyPMs,removed,well you didnt say no so that a maybe xd
creepyPMs,removed,i understand however the answer to that question heavily dictates how the rest of the conversation will go you call it creepy i call it to the point
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand why people dont block people like this after telling them to stop multiple times
creepyPMs,removed,i really hate this pushy dumb douche and his awkward bullshit as far as this fetish goes its one of those where i really dont understand how it comes about he wants to be shrunk and also be humiliated by wearing womens clothing like theres a lot to unpack there the shrinking thing i do not get at all but okay the humiliation from wearing womens clothing though that can fuck off anyone who sees being like a woman in any way as humiliating can go fall down a fucking sewer and i dont care if im kinkshaming for this ill kinkshame you off the damn planet idgaf
creepyPMs,removed,actually i didnt my comment was made before you made your warning i didnt even think about it and i dont like how saying something is problematic because it is warrants removal but ill take it since theres no other choice i dont like how he thinks femininity is shameful and i should be able to express that here not all fetishes are harmless at least let me say that
creepyPMs,removed,kinkshaming really really
creepyPMs,removed,your view of respecting others is not the endallbeall of respect
creepyPMs,removed,you still dont get it have a good one
creepyPMs,removed,ok i just did which particular rules have i broken out of curiosity
creepyPMs,removed,i dont see the creepiness in it seems like he fucked off after being rejected
creepyPMs,removed,tell him to hit me up im in
creepyPMs,removed,im just saying i dont think this counts as a creepy pm given the given circumstances not sure why a mod is telling me to not voice my opinion on why i think it doesnt belong in this sub
creepyPMs,removed,why would you go for a bbw escort that shits gross
creepyPMs,removed,im not gonna act like im not gonna act like im not even into makeup
creepyPMs,removed,im not gonna act like im not gonna act like im not even into makeup
creepyPMs,removed,yeah before u come ur like mmm i could eat some cum thatd be hot but after cumming ur like oh shit thats gross
creepyPMs,removed,if you look at porn or engage erotic in roleplay online youre a perverted pig and deserve to be castrated duh
creepyPMs,removed,not sure why op didnt just block and ignore this dude after the first few messages would have prevented a headache
creepyPMs,removed,yeah we can my go to creep is to pm a bearded dude and tell him his beard made me all wet and ask if i can wipe my pussy on it i know im horrible sometimes
creepyPMs,removed,im not antisemetic when i call a jewish person a kyke i just want them to see my point of view jeesh thin skin much
creepyPMs,removed,i guess its different for everyone i personally love cumming on my face and lapping it up like the dirty little slut i am yeah i like that dont i but to each there own i do see what you mean though
creepyPMs,removed,its similar to welfare to them they arent getting anything despite their efforts so they should be given it instead of just working harder for it
creepyPMs,removed,he will be back and not as polite the second time im betting
creepyPMs,removed,so were assuming every women is an uptight feminist worrying about respect for women
creepyPMs,removed,lmao its honestly cause its a black guy i feel like black guys are so much more chill like he knows you dont wanna just fuck around he understands and hes out
creepyPMs,removed,tbh if i was single and some girl offered me her pussy like that id be flattered
creepyPMs,removed,whats his name
creepyPMs,removed,read that as the guy wanting some barbie and thought op was a fucking cunt
creepyPMs,removed,on the one hand you jumped down his throat basically immediately on the other he did act like a creep at the end and guessing from being able to see his age this might be a dating app so maybe you were able to sniff him out immediately
creepyPMs,removed,and if youve comprehended anything ive said youd know i agree that alcohol is no excuse but dont overextend that to mean that because its no excuse it means it accurately reflects your intentions it really doesnt if you take away someones ability to think clearly and they act without thinking clearly you cannot claim thats just who they are theyre certainly responsible for their actions though and im glad youre not terrible when youre drunk but im sure you dont act identical to how you do sober
creepyPMs,removed,universal cringe
creepyPMs,removed,hahahah is ur ex some dumb hood rat
creepyPMs,removed,why is she calling u a nigga and why is acting like shes blacku know that hoe is gonna cheat on her fake as fiancee
creepyPMs,removed,what did they say
creepyPMs,removed,op idk if you are the one studying but if you are what the fuck is wrong with you
creepyPMs,removed,i kinda rolled my eyes for both of you though what i dont get is that there is so much to do on the internet and someone makes time to send someone a message like that
creepyPMs,removed,wow what a condescending and overly angry response
creepyPMs,removed,eh this doesnt seem that bad maybe ive been desensitized because ive been on this and similar subs for too long but he backed off immediately once he knew she was it was a pretty lame line on you but i dont know enough back story to know if it was appropriate or not
creepyPMs,removed,so i work for a phone sex line and this actually is some weird type of fetish wonder if its the same dude
creepyPMs,removed,doesnt look creepy to me looks like youre just having a pointless argument with someone on the internet
creepyPMs,removed,but then she cant get that juicy reddit karma
creepyPMs,removed,is too young what country
creepyPMs,removed,for real yo ive been on reddit for years and nobody has been a dick to me not when i didnt deserve it anyways lol
creepyPMs,removed,everyone in this conversation is terrible
creepyPMs,removed,guess she really hates dd
creepyPMs,removed,why not just block her
creepyPMs,removed,i always wonder why the girl keeps answering in these kinda conversations
creepyPMs,removed,youre a guy i dont understood the fucktoy
creepyPMs,removed,you have a ac and is still hot for real serious question
creepyPMs,removed,could be worse but thats still pretty damn bad
creepyPMs,removed,this kid is my hero i wunna growd up to be just like him
creepyPMs,removed,its literally worse than rape s
creepyPMs,removed,man who gives a fuck forget it
creepyPMs,removed,pretty sure that isnt your choice
creepyPMs,removed,she wants to be a judge we let her do her own thing in her own little world
creepyPMs,removed,wait ok help me out a little here how is receiving a message like in ops post actually worse than being physically penetrated in an undesired sex act
creepyPMs,removed,basically she wanted to make out that op was a disgusting creeper so she could post the conversation on rcreepypms and here we are
creepyPMs,removed,you should have stopped bothering about halfway through clearly she doesnt want to see things from your perspective
creepyPMs,removed,ive said it before and ill say it again there have to be girls out there who like them or dont mind them there is absolutely no way that guys send them with this frequency and continue to do it if they only got negative feedback
creepyPMs,removed,i guess getting a dick pic is to a girl is the same as hearing what a girl thinks about something is to a guy
creepyPMs,removed,pls respond
creepyPMs,removed,hey op if youre still looking for advice you should try posting to httpworkplacestackexchangecom
creepyPMs,removed,i liked him until i saw your update
creepyPMs,removed,you miss of the chances you dont take
creepyPMs,removed,why not
creepyPMs,removed,go to the police and file a report for sexual harassment
creepyPMs,removed,hey op so youre canadian
creepyPMs,removed,you sound like youve never been in a relationship
creepyPMs,removed,he sent you a polite text at first if you would have told him simply that youre not interested instead of accusing him giving him advice he never asked forinsulting himcarmawhoring then maybe you wouldnt be asking these questions then again being married at and sending passive aggressive messages speaks volumes about you sa well i just hope you dont have children and wait till you hopefully mature up some more
creepyPMs,removed,because its inappropriate learn some social skills
creepyPMs,removed,start sending him porn buff black well endowed men every time he replies just porn tons and tons of porn if he keeps replying just find a new video over and over
creepyPMs,removed,maybe you should consider using another website just one mans opinion
creepyPMs,removed,teenage girls are using kik and snapchat and crap to meet people they fake profiles on tinder they use reddit for christs sakes i made my first fetlife profile when i was they are doing it if we like it or not so lets just contain it to a place where its really only teens
creepyPMs,removed,jesus christ
creepyPMs,removed,yuck its gross the funniest explanation of how dicks look was from a kristen wigg movie that always makes me laugh
creepyPMs,removed,oh he got you there op
creepyPMs,removed,swinger relationships are depressingly common they also dont tend to last long if i recall correctly its sad really
creepyPMs,removed,i think youre right about youre right to do as you please but i also suggest you read that book again because regardless of what you take from it it does say all those crazy crazy things that produce idiots like this guy you can do everything and be everything jesus wanted you to be without being on the same team as this guy
creepyPMs,removed,rchargeyourphone
creepyPMs,removed,when did i say otherwise im not being creepy my only point was that a year old putting the moves on a year old is nothing strange she handled it well but to the guy above me saying the kid was thirsty nah hes just
creepyPMs,removed,racism is not a what makes a woman a not useless mother it is the nurturing that does that racism is not nurturing it is perpetuating false beliefs and ideas of imaginary superiority over others that is not true and not real at all we all want the same things for our kids no matter what ethnicity or religion race is a myth we are all equally human and the only difference is skin pigmentation the closers you are to the equator the darker the pigmentation to keep your skin from burning and you can stay in the sun longer than a paler person who has less pigmentation the lighter the pigmentation the further away from the equator the skin pigmentation has nothing to do with anyones intelligenceintellectual ability athleticism talents or anything else because the lighter the skin pigmentation the sooner you get burnt by prolonged exposure to the sun which a darker pigmented person takes longer to get burnt by prolonged exposure to the sun and that is all that it means it does not make anyone more likely to be criminals or more law abiding based on it either
creepyPMs,removed,honestly its tinder why expect anything else
creepyPMs,removed,was this album cut down whats left over looks like a really awkward rejection but nothing sexist or anything about false hopes
creepyPMs,removed,alright ill try this again since you deleted my last comment i never said debated that a year old is or isnt a child where you managed to infer that from my original comment bewildered me my point is that hes not thirsty hes just a dude trying to get some action from a girl he finds attractive the message was creepy op handled it like a champ though
creepyPMs,removed,til about findom thats just really freaking weird but also the one time i wouldnt mind being the dom if my partner wanted xd
creepyPMs,removed,im sorry but what is wrong with you people if it was me id take them to the cleaners without second thought do not hesitate show no mercy and your journey to rfinancialindependence will be complete
creepyPMs,removed,just cause all parties consent doesnt mean some things arent fucking weird
creepyPMs,removed,take a look at some of her earlier videos
creepyPMs,removed,after some careful googling i found the profile and it read not interested in pegging you hard with a strap on while taking the husbands cock in the mouth and and being spanked and used by us both oddly specific if you ask me
creepyPMs,removed,your disinterest in him is valid its fine to say hey im not attracted to you but its when you tried to call him out in a negative light basically calling him shallow for only messaging you because of your looks thats the part that seems hypocritical
creepyPMs,removed,a paedophile would by definition not be interested in a teen
creepyPMs,removed,yeah def not a girl and def not i would say report them but tech speaking they did nothing wrong still creepy as fuck
creepyPMs,removed,i dont get creepy from this this poor girl needs help its good that shes getting it but in the meantime she needs to lay off the relationship search and try to get better
creepyPMs,removed,so is there really a picture of your vagina on that website or did he just randomly say that whats the deal
creepyPMs,removed,hmmm what shall we do about that
creepyPMs,removed,this fucking hilarious the last part was a bit cringey though say hi to creepypms
creepyPMs,removed,maybe its a little dramatic i think we can all agree ted bundy was one of the most evil people to walk the face of the earth this guys just a fucking creep
creepyPMs,removed,so i can comment on a sub on rall and get blocked from another immediately seems like lazy moderating imo especially the choice in subs it seems like cringe anarchy and creepy pms both have an underlying feeling of harassment or bullying were the communities so different the users so obnoxious from a certain list of subs that you really had to block them all
creepyPMs,removed,yeah but this case is different they didnt ask just got rejected by some random person who walked up to them and said no like for example im smoking pot in high school and i get banned from the church club at school because they saw a picture of me smoking wasnt even in their or smoking in their club or asking other from their club to smoke they just banned me and sent me a letter so i replied that idgaf didnt even want to be there thats pretty much what happened here unless i missing someting obv they replied like ass hats but that tends to happen on the internet
creepyPMs,removed,hes probably just lying about his age just to make a profile and try to hit on women kids literally do this all the time
creepyPMs,removed,why you gotta call old ouch
creepyPMs,removed,thats weird considering you just said this elsewhere in the thread all peoples voices should be equal and respected as much as the status quo i suppose what you meant to say was all voices should be respected except the ones i dont like
creepyPMs,removed,why do you keep egging this person on if youre ostensibly so offended by their remarks
creepyPMs,removed,i never said it was a smart plan
creepyPMs,removed,i mean i disagree with preemptively banning random people but i dont understand why people are getting so pissy
creepyPMs,removed,hi hello i am not aware if you are aware but i want to make you aware that that is not a list thank you have a nice day
creepyPMs,removed,geez sorry i disagreed with the consensus on his age
creepyPMs,removed,in all likeliness they never would have come here anyway and thats why theyre responding the way they are well that plus the fact that its an autoban which imo is the most retarded thing a mod team could possibly do
creepyPMs,removed,not explicitly listing them in the first place is retarded and not telling the users who are actually asking so that they can tiptoe around the mod teams feelings is just setting them up for failure with how sensitive this mod team is i wouldnt put it past them to label a totally innocent sub as affiliated with whiterights just because the head mod commented on a whiterights sub once
creepyPMs,removed,you got it its a zerotolerance policy the worst kind of policy there is a zerotolerance policy for fighting is what got me suspended for days for getting punched in the face back in high school didnt even get any punches in myself before the other guy took off but i still got suspended
creepyPMs,removed,alright im probably gonna get the shits for this but that was too harsh opsure the dudes being creepy but hes still just a person the other comments in this thread are a little disappointing to read tooyou guys are really quick to make jokes about someones dead mother
creepyPMs,removed,what do you think is worse having some stranger be creepy to you or having someone say your mothers probably turning in her grave because youre a disgrace im not condoning his behavior im just saying that as someone with a dead parent that stuff really fuckin sticks with you
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair to him you kinda did tell people
creepyPMs,removed,you validate the negative behavior by responding to him hes going to take that as more evidence that negging works
creepyPMs,removed,i dont see anything regarding the rword in rule please do not make up rules on the spot thank you
creepyPMs,removed,not explicitly listing them in the first place is a bad idea and not telling the users who are actually asking so that they can tiptoe around the mod teams feelings is just setting them up for failure with how sensitive this mod team is i wouldnt put it past them to label a totally innocent sub as affiliated with whiterights just because the head mod commented on a whiterights sub once
creepyPMs,removed,that was a bit extreme
creepyPMs,removed,nice like actually nice good to see mods responding to feedback even when the feedback is tongue in cheek you earned back a bit of the respect you lost from bringing back auto banning not a lot but a bit
creepyPMs,removed,i would have reacted the same way but i also l prooobably would have let him buy me a bra first lmao
creepyPMs,removed,have you ever been kidnapped
creepyPMs,removed,rephrase your comment
creepyPMs,removed,look the hair what the fuck imagine the girlfriend
creepyPMs,removed,the most creepy thing is a account for gonewild
creepyPMs,removed,why are they on there responding to messages if they have a boyfriend
creepyPMs,removed,why are you guys so obsessed with reporting him like just tell the obviously socially awkward dude no thanks because he did something unprofessional and leave it at that if you want to go out of your way and say hey dude this is unprofessional and i feel uncomfortable about it you probably shouldnt do this again because someone will report you and you will get fired i feel like a warning is enough theres no need to go out of your way to make some elses life harder or be vindictive about it op handled it like it should be handled
creepyPMs,removed,i mean im sorry but i cant tell why this is creepy if its the penthouse club thing i mean that person wrong numbered them
creepyPMs,removed,some mens brains get fucky when they start jerking off really fucky they think im horny right now and i love looking at genitals they arouse me she definitely will feel the same way
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt take that away from it at all rofl also if i wrong number messaged some one i would be super embarassed lol
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think this is as much of a creepy pm than someone messing with you because you had the wrong number
creepyPMs,removed,oh god please tell me he didnt take your virginity
creepyPMs,removed,as a guy whos never sent dick pick i dont get it either
creepyPMs,removed,oh dear jesus that font
creepyPMs,removed,are your spelling and grammar are atrocious not is
creepyPMs,removed,just curious why did you keep trying to correct the word pretentious to pretentiousness also that second guy sounds like a real weirdo
creepyPMs,removed,just tell him his merry xmas triggers you even a lunatic like that wouldnt want to open up that can o worms
creepyPMs,removed,honestly im more offended by the pitiful and atrocious spelling in this message than the content itself
creepyPMs,removed,i know everyone gets all precious about this but my response would be jump off a bridge
creepyPMs,removed,you really went out of your way to let him know you werent interested maybe just delete and ignore the next one
creepyPMs,removed,lol someone should tell him actually good looking men dont have to beg and offer a gd house to get some
creepyPMs,removed,lol who cares
creepyPMs,removed,come
creepyPMs,removed,hi its me that guy
creepyPMs,removed,i would be happy to aide in this search for this creep in pm
creepyPMs,removed,is it though
creepyPMs,removed,why do people think shit like this works like its blindingly obvious itll be crap for him as well as you yet he continues just wondering why you gave this asshat more time of day than that initial exchange
creepyPMs,removed,well why not just ask for a dick pic for a giggle
creepyPMs,removed,the girls in porn all have tell tale visual clues to being on birth control duh when you get dick worth of cum dumped in your jay jay your on bc amateur before everyone freaks out this is a joke
creepyPMs,removed,if someone online asks if youre a girl always say no
creepyPMs,removed,why let him have the last word and show us
creepyPMs,removed,i have nothing but respect for the decrease your attitude i have to use that in a conversation everything else is stupid and pathetic
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,damn nas was right you lose money chasing women now he gets no girl and no sale sucks to suck
creepyPMs,removed,i agree with you we should be careful to avoid being harassed do you it seems to me that in your opinion it doesnt matter that we try to raise people and make changes in social attitudes because creeps will keep creeping and therefore the responsibility for not being creep upon rests on its victims i disagree with both parts of that assumption years ago it was fine to slap a woman on her behind without her consent it wasnt considered a morally right thing to do but it wasnt considered all that harmful and it was thought of as natural behaviour times change but only if you make them change that particular change did not come about because someone told women to wear armoured underpants or pretend theyre men i am also all for women dealing with the problem in any way they deem good for them so always do this is out of line
creepyPMs,removed,i dont actually see this as creepy at all slightly suggestive maybe but without seeing the other messages dont flatter yourself
creepyPMs,removed,are all these guys mentally retarded
creepyPMs,removed,idealistically youre absolutely right however until then the reality is that these creeps exist and if you dont want to be exposed to it preventative measures make sense
creepyPMs,removed,i dont get this seriously a man politely interacted with you in such a way that you know he found you both likable and attractive and saw an opportunity to get to know you better society has long placed the burden of romantic initiation upon men so he saw an opportunity to do so he did not harass you he did not treat you poorly some people might even consider it complimentary that a man found himself attracted to you in a short interaction what is wrong exactly should men just stop trying to interact with women in ways that show romantic interest first if i were a single man who met with an attractive an likable woman should i say to myself my id certainly like to get to know her better id like to ask her out but i guess doing so makes me an annoying creep so i shouldnt try perhaps one day a woman will select me for a mate as a man if women regularly expressed an interest in me id be flattered and feel like i was doing something right but hey guess thats the division between the sexes
creepyPMs,removed,shut up mom
creepyPMs,removed,so its cool for a girl to hit on a guy but when a gay guy hits on someone its weird i dont understand
creepyPMs,removed,in australia if you go to a doctor and ask to get tested for stds herpes is included in the testing not necessarily true it sometimes is sometimes isnt just like anywhere else on top of that blood tests for herpes are only accurate months after exposure and even then they arent correct protocol for std panels really isnt much different in australia than in any other first world country australia has roughly the same rate of hsv as most other developed nations theres a good chance you do have herpes unfortunately
creepyPMs,removed,good deflection it always amazes me that these creepers never clue in i mean they miss the first one sure but clearly youre communicating and dont want to talk about that yet he keeps on trying i cant quite tell if its because he thinks youre dumb and will start talking about sex with a stranger no less if hes more disgusting about it or he realizes it and just blatantly decides to not respect your boundaries in the hopes of nudes i dont know its obvious it wasnt moving in that direction by your second response and i doubt he just wants to be friends in any genuine sense creepers will be creepers i guess ftfy youre welcome this is the longest ftfy ive ever done
creepyPMs,removed,do i really need it though
creepyPMs,removed,girl chilllllll
creepyPMs,removed,dont say all guys are like that that is a massive generalization that is not true id say even is too high of a guess but it is a percentage large enough to be a problem i agree with that
creepyPMs,removed,wow thay guy literally has no life other than stalking people and trying to make them feel bad he probably has a mental deficiency
creepyPMs,removed,i mean think about it and try not being bias if its happening a lot of times maybe they should change how they are its not terrible advice
creepyPMs,removed,what kind of tip did your friend give this guy
creepyPMs,removed,why do you make a conversation with this hideous beast why respond at all
creepyPMs,removed,loltriggered
creepyPMs,removed,i need to know did it work did she return to the car
creepyPMs,removed,you think youre safe on the bus dumb feminist
creepyPMs,removed,hey man dont sterotype
creepyPMs,removed,one time in high school i asked a girl to show us her tits i was in the back seat of some friends random friend there was a police car pulling in to the park we were already pulling out of a parking spot and the girl came up to the window asking if we had a cigarette i said not but that she should show us her tits for science she looked behind us her right then in front of us where the obvious cop car was creeping in during highschool lunch time and she pulled up her shirt and bra and put her boobs right on the window i looked at her chest then the cop car then her chest and we actually drove out no problem i was the coolest dude ever for like the next few hours to the two guys that didnt know me hell i thought i was pretty cool for a few hours i have no idea how the cops did not see that or why they would just dismiss it if they did wtf but got to see titties and didnt get us pulled over and have our pot confiscated during school hours sometimes everything just comes up millhouse
creepyPMs,removed,im ready for the down votes but womenpresenting really are we really already in that phase
creepyPMs,removed,you probably think im some bigot i can assure you you couldnt be furthest from the truth i just think most of people who make sure they use the politically correct terms like womenpresenting rofl sorry have their head buried so deep in their own politically correctness that they dont stop and think about the people they are refering to what do those people want they want to be perceived by the outside world by the way they are inside wheter that is woman or man so when you separate woman and womanpresenting you are actually doing them a disservice kinda like morgan freeman once said about racism the best way to stop it is stop talking about it a womanpresenting person is a woman and a black man is a man
creepyPMs,removed,a woman walks into a bar look i know i have a pair of tits nice long blonde hair i sound like a woman and i look like one too but all you motherfuckers call me john wayne okay
creepyPMs,removed,clearly
creepyPMs,removed,it depends political correctness tends to silence everyone who has a different opinion whether they are justified or not being blunt creates uneasiness which leads to conflict that in turn leads into reflection on the problems and finally solutions the moment we stop coming up with solutions to our problems is the moment we die
creepyPMs,removed,you totally missed the point read again if you still dont get it my point was its cool if you are gender fluidagender whatever you just cant expect people to know that by default and most people dont care about your gender identity when you just wanna order a glass of water got it
creepyPMs,removed,once again you are john wayne you reach over by the bar and ask for a drink the barman says do you want anything miss are you gonna correct him
creepyPMs,removed,not moving goal posts because in this scenario john wayne never announced out loud his name was john wayne like in my previous comment where i failed to make a jokish comment real people dont annouce their gender whenever they enter a room you would correct him remember you look like a woman and you sound like a woman do you really have the time to correct everyone who mistakenly takes you by a woman
creepyPMs,removed,exactly if you were john wayne you would be tired of correcting people so unless you befriended the bartender you wouldnt bother as for the bartender if youve been working for hours you dont wanna hear about how someones sexual identity trust me so its a winwin if you go along with it
creepyPMs,removed,why are you hanging out with sketchy guys in an alley
creepyPMs,removed,god i thought we were almost agreeing for a second there the thing is what other people think shouldnt have any effect on you and is it reasonable to expect changing habits that are thousands of years old in such a short time i dont think so stoping assuming gender would make sense if people that identify with a diferent gender were almost as numerous as the cisgender people you know that of the worlds population is straight right only are gaylesbianhave a diferent gender and inside that minority people with gender dysphoria are a minority
creepyPMs,removed,dunno where you live but where i live calling someone miss is probably the most polite way to treat someone you dont know
creepyPMs,removed,thats cool and all but your gender identity has nothing to do with your ability to interact with people on a daytoday situation it doesnt impede you in any way the bartender doesnt have to know your gender to sell you a drink the blind cashier however btw no one would employ a blind person as a cashier but it works for the analogy whatever xd needs to tell you he is blind so you can understand why you need to tell him the amount of money you give him i just knew the percentage of cisgenderstraight people and inverted to get all the people that dont fit that description and that includes gay people as well as nongender binary people
creepyPMs,removed,yes you too its hard to get our points across via text on the internet but that doesnt stop us from trying
creepyPMs,removed,ooo edgy mod is edgy is this the only place where you have had authority over anyone lolll sad sad little man
creepyPMs,removed,doesnt green text indicate that the receiver of the messages took a screenshot you didnt cross out your username on the first picture it says you received messages from yourself
creepyPMs,removed,well in my inbox all of the green messages are the ones i sent its also indicated by the to
creepyPMs,removed,the point wasnt that it changed colors it was that in your inbox your own messages are generally the green ones
creepyPMs,removed,women these days just dont know how to accept a compliment
creepyPMs,removed,hes an mra how can you tell
creepyPMs,removed,i mean im ready to get downvoted into reddits butthole but op gave her number to some guys in her alley that means she found them somewhat cool enough to exchange a conversation and her replys indicate she likes the way the guy is talking to her she is replying right away and carrying a conversation im willing to go out on a limb and say op would be fwb with the guy if the opportunity came
creepyPMs,removed,theres nothing creepy about that it looks like a friendly and flirty conversation
creepyPMs,removed,he took it like a champ tho
creepyPMs,removed,both sides of this conversation were pretty fuckin funny
creepyPMs,removed,whats creepy about this some random guy messaged you asked to be friends you said no and he said okay literally nothing creepy is it because he didnt know you to begin with even then i dont find this creepy
creepyPMs,removed,hey at least be didnt drag it on for years and constantly call you a bitch among other things
creepyPMs,removed,can we see the thread of him defend the pedo dont really see the connection between these two images either
creepyPMs,removed,lol dumb hoe
creepyPMs,removed,well yeah it would be his size and he would feel bad
creepyPMs,removed,well anyone could dodge a huge bullet let me know when you dodge a microscopic bullet
creepyPMs,removed,make a complaint to the pizza place its not good for business if the employees harass the customers
creepyPMs,removed,like the girls who think if a guy masturbates theyd damn well only be thinking about them and porn is just like infidelity
creepyPMs,removed,yeah but did you hit up his coworker though
creepyPMs,removed,your children will be too youre well
creepyPMs,removed,withholding sex haha glad im gay
creepyPMs,removed,stop whining try getting contacted about daily for almost years including having your family and friends harassed along with the whole time how about having then show up at your house at on a tuesday and them rolling around in your front yard screaming beetlejuice beetlejuice beetlejuice and still the legal system wont do shit but then again you are female so you might get some legal help
creepyPMs,removed,this is creepy as shit but also seems kind of fake like hes living a stereotype of a niceguy also they both use ellipses incorrectly using two dots instead of three which kind of leads me to believe that it was written by the same person
creepyPMs,removed,why dont you stop responding to him
creepyPMs,removed,did this happen to you
creepyPMs,removed,tell your dadbrotherfriend to kick the shit out of him im not a violent person but he deserves it
creepyPMs,removed,wtfall he wanted was some kisses and a little touch of his penis is that to much to ask jenny
creepyPMs,removed,i dont even know what to say how did he contact you
creepyPMs,removed,im always a big fan of sending screenshots like these to his momsistersfamily if you can track them down
creepyPMs,removed,his behavior is horrifying but i dont understand why youd even bother replying to him after the first inappropriate text id just ignore him and if he texted again id block the number trying to politely respond to this type of behavior accomplishes nothing
creepyPMs,removed,fag
creepyPMs,removed,i deviated from the verbatim quote myself so that i could specifically use gender neutral pronouns i always try and avoid giving anyone the personal satisfaction of correcting someone elses usage of pronouns
creepyPMs,removed,would be fucking messy legally though if one party deletes messages asking for it maybe goes on the other guys phone and deletes them and the im service wont turn records over or theyre encrypted or something like that itll be a pita doctored screenshots biased judges the pussy pass people using the loophole of oh its somebody elses knob or something its difficult
creepyPMs,removed,stop posting your fuckin nudes then duh
creepyPMs,removed,i mean least he asked first i guess
creepyPMs,removed,you pmd people hateful stuff on other subs and you are very ugly i hope you get raped
creepyPMs,removed,this is the first submission thats has genuinely been creepy sorry you have to deal with this
creepyPMs,removed,surely some poorly adjusted insecure young lady somewhere is rewarding this behavior for as often as these random messages show up or who am i to judge maybe its their thing to oblige these creepos
creepyPMs,removed,um this isnt really creepy this sub is turning into if someone says something that offends me or slightly upsets me its creepy and goes online this text is hilarious and if i had received it id be laughing my ass off
creepyPMs,removed,please keep that opinion to yourself and follow the rules of the sub which you read of course
creepyPMs,removed,because women think inches is about avarage for men its not like women take out a rules and measure the dick of the guy theyre going fuck so a the guy is making up for what ever the women think a good sized dick is or b thinks women love huge dicks source some girl in a psych class did a presentation on it and found out that women are awful at measuring she went out and asked people and stuff
creepyPMs,removed,i am so confused your account was made to repost someone elses picture into amiugly and change the age from to and then proceed to post the pms you receive in creepypms that pm if real is messed up but so is what you did im baffled at the way people seek enjoyment through lying on the internet
creepyPMs,removed,well the app is called meet me theres a lot of creepy people on there tbh
creepyPMs,removed,because u asked a stupid question
creepyPMs,removed,trigger warning flair lol
creepyPMs,removed,how about you pm me his account so i can have a sparring session with him ive got nothing better to do these next few days and it sounds like a fun way of getting him to tone it down
creepyPMs,removed,op better wipe her hdd shes got kiddie porn
creepyPMs,removed,why is his dick so pointy its like a grotesque string bean
creepyPMs,removed,bitch wife
creepyPMs,removed,i cant tell whats cringier his message or the fact that your carrier is sprint
creepyPMs,removed,so op i gotta ask what was weird about his dingaling
creepyPMs,removed,i want to see his dick now just because i read the story and want to see the weirdness deliver op
creepyPMs,removed,sounds like you really like looking at dick closely
creepyPMs,removed,you do you man you do that even if you have any questions or concerns
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt read the whole thing but that is epic
creepyPMs,removed,either the constant exposure to creepy pms on this subreddit is starting to have an osmosislike effect on me or im missing something but this doesnt seem that bad its a little on the nose and definitely crossing a personal line but it doesnt scream creep to me do i need help am i turning into one please somebody bring me back to the light side
creepyPMs,removed,obviously i didnt bother to click on the street is not exactly the same thing
creepyPMs,removed,dick so small i gotta turn into a detective classy
creepyPMs,removed,you do you man you do that even if you try to avoid seeing but that they insisted you see
creepyPMs,removed,if you get to the queen of burns
creepyPMs,removed,obviously i didnt bother to click on the vulva but yeah sure maybe
creepyPMs,removed,rjusticeporn
creepyPMs,removed,nah i just dont know you so idk why youre trying to talk to me lol ok you have guesses to why you think he wants to talk to you he wants to meet new friends nope he craves intellectual conversations with other like minded people nope he wants to get laid bingo
creepyPMs,removed,ok so everyone knows that out of times when a guy talks to a girl on the internet its because the guy wants to get laid im going to assume that all girls know that so then why do you keep responding to guys if you dont want that kind of attention other than entertaining us in this subreddit and why do you keep getting shocked when you find out that he wants to get laid im just trying to understand the dynamics at play here the absolute majority of guys only engage in conversations on the internet because they want to get laid its no secret its just how men especially men in their twenties work they seek sex all the time trust me i know im a guy
creepyPMs,removed,although this is extremely entertaining to read i have to ask the question why do you keep responding to him when you are clearly uncomfortable talking to him why not just ignore him or even block him
creepyPMs,removed,i have to admit that i concur with his question why did you respond to him why is this guy worth a minute of your life
creepyPMs,removed,i do not condone the sending of dick pics at all i have never sent a dick pic to anybody not even my wife that said if my wife was feeling down and needed a pick me up the absurdity of me sending a dick pic would in this very specific case be a pick me up again though i am not saying dick pics are ever appropriate and unsolicited dick pics from strangers or nonromantic interests are even worse
creepyPMs,removed,perhaps but it seems much easier to just ignore or block the men who are creepy my question is why do women not ignore or block creepy men after all i have read in this subreddit women continue to chat with men even long after he showed what a creep he is why
creepyPMs,removed,social norms dont apply on the internet its the one place on earth where everyone can say what they really think without facing any real life consequences i think the posts on this subreddit is proof enough you cannot expect people to behave the same on the internet as in real life that is just naive if you are going to participate in something for example a dating app then you have to deal with everything that follows i guess this subreddit is one way for women to deal with unwarranted sexual advances but this still doesnt answer my question why women keep chatting with men even long after they showed what creeps they are
creepyPMs,removed,and you hit accept right
creepyPMs,removed,thank you for giving me an answer that makes sense and i fully understand that this is not limited to dating apps so this is about fear of retaliation do i understand that correctly well shutting down men should not lead to anything if it does you will always have the law on your side and i cant help but think that if you shut down creeps as soon as you feel uncomfortable that it will drastically reduce threats and stalking instead of continuing chatting because you are afraid of what will happen if you block him you can never control other people but you can control your own responses to situations and the first respons to any creep should be to insulate and protect yourself from him
creepyPMs,removed,does that mean dick pics arent as pointless as previously thought
creepyPMs,removed,people took this really seriously lmfao
creepyPMs,removed,no thats insulting this guy is borderline not a sociopath someone with antisocial personality disorder would not be this overt it would be a subtle laying of a web to guage interest and then making a move only when theres a good chance it would work borderline personality disorder on the other hand is where the person makes a move and then plays the victim to try and get sympathy aspd is like a mad scientist or tyler durden whereas bpd is the crazy motherinlaw stereotype or the fight club narrator one is logic based the other is primarily emotion
creepyPMs,removed,holy shit people are still using the word sapiosexual honestly i dont know why heterosexualgaybisexualetc whos into smart people is so hard to write out maybe because theyre pretentious snobs or is it because sapoiosexual has a nice ableist undertone
creepyPMs,removed,hey look at mr popular over here with his friend requests
creepyPMs,removed,no no have you people never been around people that use drugs this is how people who try to come off as intelligent when they arent sound it doesnt mean that they are using drugs it really blows my mind reading things like this like im not trying to be offensive at all its just so crazy to me to see that there are people that havent ever seen drugs or been around people that use where i grew up theyre all over the place most people i know have used drugs at least one point in there life and thats not counting weed i have honestly never met someone that hasnt at least tried smoking weed once
creepyPMs,removed,not that creepy
creepyPMs,removed,why did you cut him off did he steal from you or just because he used heroin addicts need a support system you cant just abandon them because they decided to get high ive been addicted to heroin for years and im only its a hard drug to quit and i dont want to know how hard it would be if i didnt have my support system when i got out of rehab i probably would have relapsed the minute i walked out the door and ive relapsed since then heroin is no joke please dont just cut your friends off for using heroin just be there for them when they are ready to get clean and dont expect them to get clean until they are ready because it will never last if they arent ready
creepyPMs,removed,you could have just left the party im sorry but they were just getting high do people not smoke crack or shoot up at parties you usually go to i know when i went to parties after high school there was always a couple people smoking crack in the back or shooting dope in the bathroom and there was definitely people snorting coke and popping x pills i just cant believe everything im reading im really surprised that this type of thing isnt normal everywhere
creepyPMs,removed,why its an accurate if brusque description of a medical condition caused by over eating people can feel horrified by seeing others eating themselves to morbid obesity
creepyPMs,removed,because its not dont ask the rest of us to tip toe around the fact that youre destroying your life by eating calories a day of fast food and candy if anything the honesty should be a wake up call
creepyPMs,removed,i greet all my friends that way
creepyPMs,removed,i mean this kind of is the thing cousins will do
creepyPMs,removed,why is his cousin on his ipad at am
creepyPMs,removed,that would have been a problem if he wanted to cum deep inside her tbh
creepyPMs,removed,it was a joke lol but yh
creepyPMs,removed,yeah
creepyPMs,removed,its pretty rare in my area to find any girl over without kids i thought that she seemed a bit abrasive for my taste but hey a job a house no kids and a future outweighed that she quickly just became an oversold lie sad
creepyPMs,removed,ummmmmm im in black and shes in red maybe you read that backwards
creepyPMs,removed,im not knocking it i just find it a bit offputting personally i understand why though
creepyPMs,removed,nah she didnt i took shots today last message was from sunday
creepyPMs,removed,i mean of course there are women who lie online no one has ever said otherwise but this doesnt seem creepy she either made a false profile or things have changed recently in her life and she hasnt updated the profile yet
creepyPMs,removed,agreed thank you
creepyPMs,removed,either shes fibbing or she hasnt updated her profile yet but i dont see how this is creepy sorry
creepyPMs,removed,hello sexi
creepyPMs,removed,that might well be legit
creepyPMs,removed,wow what a pos you are good to know you wont be reproducing and your bloodline will die with you have a nice life
creepyPMs,removed,i meant in a general sense not literally every person
creepyPMs,removed,all good id have to be a special kind of fuck to post this if it was how you read it lol
creepyPMs,removed,sorry you took that as a personal attack it wasnt
creepyPMs,removed,then you should say in general you shouldnt generalise and say that wed comment differently based on gender soooo should i say in general or not
creepyPMs,removed,fuck you carmen
creepyPMs,removed,not that it makes it any less creepy but in the us only states have the legal age of consent at states are at all the rest of the us states are including all of canada mexico is all i dont know where this was but theres a very good chance that the guy is just a standard creep and not a pedo
creepyPMs,removed,rcringepics
creepyPMs,removed,im sorry guys i know its supposed to be creepy but this just made me laugh so much
creepyPMs,removed,it looks like you took the screenshot before and then took another after so youre first screenshot was not intended for rcreepypms
creepyPMs,removed,sweet mother of aspergers
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,but he was drinking trying to test luck
creepyPMs,removed,same way someone would jack it to vintage porn shes probably dead now faps weird sets it down and sleeps not a huge thought process if youre thinking of the women as sex objects and not humans
creepyPMs,removed,tell you what ill consider complying only if you provide a video of you castarating yourself then squeezing lemon juice on the open wound thanks in advance
creepyPMs,removed,hugs are jewish
creepyPMs,removed,loaded this should suffice
creepyPMs,removed,when i wrote that i honestly considered throwing a s at the end now i know i should have im going to leave it as is though seriously some places need those absurd minor laws though some of the girls walking around now
creepyPMs,removed,lmao its not a trump supporter writing all of that moron its directed at a trump supporter a liberal who has poor reading comprehension and on reddit wow i never thought that was possible s
creepyPMs,removed,youre whoring yourself on the internet what are you expecting
creepyPMs,removed,why you always reply though
creepyPMs,removed,how can i get his followers to target me id love a completely legal opportunity to shoot any and all of them that attempt to approach me after all i would need to fear for my safety since theyre threatening to harm and rape me pop pop dead scum
creepyPMs,removed,well assuming youve got the genders correct he is drunk that tends to inhibit ones reasoning significantly if we can use i was too drunk to retroactively revoke consent i think we can also use it to get a mulligan on sending weird texts
creepyPMs,removed,eww cursive writing
creepyPMs,removed,so this guy is unable to text properly due to his drunken state and most people in this sub are wrecking him for it sounds like victim blaming to me
creepyPMs,removed,wait michelle obama isnt a man are you telling me that breitbart lied to me again
creepyPMs,removed,idk about this guy but a lot of hispanics do that
creepyPMs,removed,if you give me his email then ill send it to him so he knows all us internet peeps are getting a kick out of it
creepyPMs,removed,hm i wonder if he was right or not
creepyPMs,removed,butbuti wanna see you naked i dont care the race
creepyPMs,removed,elizabeth warren claimed to be indian and that one black women who headed the naacp claimed to be black she told her family not to tell anyone and she put on makeup we dont have a picture of you so i mean i dunno that wasnt really a creepy pm just some weirdo telling you your white
creepyPMs,removed,now i need to see these pics to see what all the confusion is about for science of course
creepyPMs,removed,creepy guys on gonewild weird
creepyPMs,removed,you sound like a real bitch no amount of nude pictures can make up for that
creepyPMs,removed,now im curious about what was originally written here
creepyPMs,removed,ok well i suppose you can call them whatever you want but they are sex workers
creepyPMs,removed,it seems like you think a sex worker is someone who exchanges money for sex that is not the definition for your education httpsenwikipediaorgwikisexworker
creepyPMs,removed,thats a pretty lame joke at least make it seem like youre intelligent and ask for a ferrari and what to see their reaction
creepyPMs,removed,would it really be too much trouble to just type out what you mean
creepyPMs,removed,one of the most unattractive things a guy can do is beg for sex its so pathetic and an immediate turn off if it was a girl begging would you i think not its just tacky and really sad
creepyPMs,removed,dont get me wrong—his opening message is godawful but is it really all that creepy to me it just sounds stupid and cringe not so much creepy
creepyPMs,removed,you guys are complaining about getting hit on by sugar daddies and im over here just wanting to get a single creepy pm from a sugar daddy
creepyPMs,removed,my son and ex husband both have aspergers if dude truly is an aspie they tend to get ideas in their head and fixate on them and repetition is a big part of it not defending the creep just giving a little insight
creepyPMs,removed,me thinking to myself wait are those boobies a ponytail oh this is one of those ones where the girl is being creepy good i like to see things from both sides okay here we go wait is that apenis doublecheck calculations ponytail boobies penis ooooooooh i get it i need to get out more see that there are shades of grey more than two sides to a story multiple colors in a rainbow etc etc ashamed of myself for assumptions made yet posting this comment anyway
creepyPMs,removed,still trying to bank on that notoriety are you well i suppose this counts as identifying yourself as the culprit
creepyPMs,removed,come one come all witness the pipelaying madman in his natural habitat soliciting threesomes from couples that browse reddit together ps i reported you here as well fucko
creepyPMs,removed,nah thats creepy too
creepyPMs,removed,all your posts are on creepy pmsdo you have a different username and do you post on gone wild just curious
creepyPMs,removed,its not harassment its criticism you dolt
creepyPMs,removed,god damn youre on the internet youre not writing a novel i get that youre a writer but you dont have to sound like a snob
creepyPMs,removed,a sex worker is not specifically someone who has sex for money you are using the term incorrectly sugar babies are sex workers by definition
creepyPMs,removed,i adore this sub so i wont help break rules by posting deleted material but just for your own knowledge to read not to post after moderator removal mind you you can add the letters un to right before a reddit link and see the deleted comments works most of the time for example turn wwwredditcomthread into wwwunredditcomthread
creepyPMs,removed,i was talking to jizzyl actually not you but thank you for the message
creepyPMs,removed,so to clarify was it a black dick i wanna know how many levels i should be uncomfortable on here also to his credit i eat ass and do laundry im basically the complete package would be a good tinder tagline if i ate ass
creepyPMs,removed,you sound annoying as fuck i couldnt get past the second image
creepyPMs,removed,i mean it seems obvious this guy was trolling
creepyPMs,removed,nsfw the link in the screenshot httpmimgurcombocceyc
creepyPMs,removed,what a douche bag bore
creepyPMs,removed,haha yeah fuck trans people
creepyPMs,removed,i cant keep up with you crazy kids these days
creepyPMs,removed,you beaners and your politeness
creepyPMs,removed,people on this sub are just getting targeted by trolls people on this sub enjoy attention because otherwise they would block these persons much faster andor wouldnt answer at all as a result a lot of these posts have become a giant circle jerk with no real content to combat this the mods need to ban private reddit message posts
creepyPMs,removed,so how was this creepy again unsub
creepyPMs,removed,wait there are gw pics
creepyPMs,removed,was he of arab origin the way he was expressing himself with all that romantic approach is quite familiar to me not to mention the persistence
creepyPMs,removed,i dont get the downvotes youre making a good point theres a difference between using your phone to survive and using it to beg for money
creepyPMs,removed,i dunno i get pretty flattered when someone compliments my dick they only get to see that once theyve earned my trust and respect though so i could see how thats different
creepyPMs,removed,i happen to know that there were some that were polite and didnt sound anything like this
creepyPMs,removed,i apologize if i ever sent you a creepy pm i do follow your posts because frankly you are pretty i am not the kind of guy to harass or act like a creep sometimes what i think is funny or playful comes out wrong
creepyPMs,removed,objects obscured may be smaller than metaphorical picture used to obscure
creepyPMs,removed,its more cringe how much a pushover and doormat youre than this guy asking for sex lol
creepyPMs,removed,thats exactly the reason why im afraid to start streaming just because you stream a game and he watches doesnt mean that you have any sort of relationship or that hes entitled to your attention i just hope he takes a step back and realizes what an incredibly creepy violent and generally horrible person he is but i doubt thatll happen call the police show them the pm they probably cant do much now but theyre going to write it down somewhere so that in case something does happen they can follow up on it
creepyPMs,removed,whats your finsta andor tumblr you know for science
creepyPMs,removed,at least guy listened to you at the end
creepyPMs,removed,this will only give him hope with a future with you
creepyPMs,removed,how us having a talk with someone trolling
creepyPMs,removed,honestly the part that scared me the most is that your phone was at and not plugged in how can you live with that kind of stress in your life but seriously creepy dude
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know where you live but in my country cyber bullying and online threats can carry a penalty of max years this spastic should get locked up
creepyPMs,removed,guy was probably drunk
creepyPMs,removed,wait yours doesnt
creepyPMs,removed,this phones battery is at and needs charging i am a bot i use ocr to detect battery levels sometimes i make mistakes sorry httpsnpredditcomrphonebatterylevelbot
creepyPMs,removed,are you a man or woman
creepyPMs,removed,thats not what is taught you are severely bastardizing the beliefs to fit a strawman argument they teach that you must perform good works to get into heaven but good works alone will not help you enter if they are done for the purpose of getting you into heaven
creepyPMs,removed,he did not say any he said not enough
creepyPMs,removed,jesus fucking christ
creepyPMs,removed,hes an idiot but i think you should have at least tried replying to what he said and explaining why his argument sucks instead of patronising and poking fun at him this conversation just shows two people being rude to each other
creepyPMs,removed,of course not if a guy said that to me i certainly wouldnt respect him but i wouldnt go all awww sweetie on him either it just makes the situation worse how is that guy ever supposed to see sense if anyone who disagrees with him just mocks him instead of actually explaining whats wrong with what hes said
creepyPMs,removed,i always find it more cringeworthy when the boyfriendhusband responds to the guy hey bro only i get that sweet ass dude dont message my girl brah
creepyPMs,removed,he definitely earned some stick time
creepyPMs,removed,ive been to jail and i aint afraid to go back
creepyPMs,removed,no one outside of a monogamous relationship deserves sex its a luxury also just because someone can get sex doesnt mean they want to just because you could drink piss doesnt mean you want to yes it is sterile i only have sex because i am in a relationship if i werent i probably wouldnt ever have sex because i have no sex drive i dont think im asexual because i am still attracted to people i just really dont like sex so why would i do something i dislike with someone i think is unattractive or not up to my standards just so they dont have to face the fact that they are these things i have to face the facts of my downfalls every day like my ocd and anxiety which weigh heavily on me so do you learn some game even ass ugly dudes with game get hot chicks ive seen it many times deal with it puts on sunglasses
creepyPMs,removed,nice one
creepyPMs,removed,tell sanchito that if he knows what is good for him he best go run and hide daddys got a new
creepyPMs,removed,but surely people who would even start conversations like that are the ones who most need to hear some rationality if it was me i would either have called him out on where he went wrong including where he called me a slut or ignored his message from the start because hes not worth it hes never going to climb out from under his sad little misogynistic rock if when a woman or anyone gets the opportunity to help him understand why he should climb out she instead patronises him when a woman talks to him like you did it likely makes him hate women even more
creepyPMs,removed,if that was my daughter there wouldnt be a call to the police about this thered be a call for fucking murder
creepyPMs,removed,well then hes not worth it and you should ignore him instead of lowering yourself to his level he argues by calling you a slut and a dumb bitch and you respond with passive aggressive comments more insults from him provoke more comments from you and vice versa and all that could have been stopped
creepyPMs,removed,horrible people include those who tell people to go fuck themselves
creepyPMs,removed,i only just saw the edit you made to your last comment yes you were both rude to each other he was rude by throwing insults at you and you were rude by being condescending and pushing his buttons thats a mean thing to do to someone whether theyre a horrible person or not also i dont know if you use dude for just anyone which i do but i just want to clarify im a girl in case that wasnt clear
creepyPMs,removed,a for effort though
creepyPMs,removed,little and year old teens a year old isnt a teen whats wrong with this guy
creepyPMs,removed,but wheres the fun in that
creepyPMs,removed,i feel like your tone has changed now that you know im female but i dont think my gender should have any impact im trying to make an impartial point about conduct in discussionargument not about misogyny it just so happens that misogyny is the topic at issue here im seeing the guy who messaged you as someone with vile views and a dreadful attitude not as someone who i need to fight back against if he was hating on different demographic besides females then i would see him the same way even if i didnt belong to that particular demographic and sure if someone has vile views thats not my fault but its still just as much my responsibility as anyone elses eg a man to make effort to change them when given the chance otherwise hes going to go away to his peers show them the messages you sent him and say see arent women awful and theyll all agree meanwhile you show this community the messages he sent you and say isnt this person awful and everyone here agrees so there are two groups of people who instead of take the chance to discuss go to where they know there are other people who agree withvalidate their views in his case joining a womanhating subreddit in your case posting these screenshots yes the people in that subreddit look awful but if you want someone to change their mind you need to show them why their views are not justified and show them what justifies your own in a situation like yours being part of the group being hated on does not mean being exempt from trying to stop the hate and it does not mean being entitled to patronise someone for their views however awful those views may be
creepyPMs,removed,two words justifiable homicide
creepyPMs,removed,or the ground
creepyPMs,removed,the fact that a child has to read this because their parents think its a good idea for them to be on social mediahave smart phones is saddening
creepyPMs,removed,pretty sure murder is worse than harassment id much rather hang out with a pedophile than someone who thinks its okay to kill a person that disgusts them its like these people want to go back to living in the middle ages humans are supposed to be past being animals fueled by bloodlust
creepyPMs,removed,you need to borrow my shotgun
creepyPMs,removed,police aint going to do shit at least thats my expectation these days id tell him to meet me in a dark alley and my friends and i would set him straight
creepyPMs,removed,of everything involved here your daughter bringing this to you is something you should take a lot of comfort in she sees you as her protected still she knows you as her trusted anchor in this life before my boy gets a mobile phone if i havent hammered the horrors of the world and precautions required by then i had no chance to all the parents who give small children mobiles where are your kids going before they are even teenagers that they need mobiles i never had one but somehow managed to find my parents when i needed them stillmint taught me resilience a hotline to mummy every time life gets a little rough produces wet handshakes
creepyPMs,removed,kill it with fucking fire
creepyPMs,removed,god i hate bill burr i mean im sure its just a persona to a degree but what a fucking obnoxious bassackwards persona to take on
creepyPMs,removed,you seem like a big bitch
creepyPMs,removed,why dont you stfu
creepyPMs,removed,ill rephrase im not sure those were ops real interactions but the replies came from a definite c you next tuesday
creepyPMs,removed,a man can be a bitch or a cunt dont know how thats gendered
creepyPMs,removed,now theres a fetish i can get behind
creepyPMs,removed,just saying ive met a lesbian who was really bi sexual i guess her friend is black out drunk and stops in the kitchen bends over and sticks her butt on my crotch and pins me on the wall i start feeling her up which was pretty fd up infront of a bunch of people i realize now she goes and throws up in the bathroom shortly after next thing i know her friend the lesbian calls me a pussy for drinking beer sticks a bottle of vodka in my mouth to get me drunk and makes out with me really aggressively i didnt even get a chance to flirt with anyone
creepyPMs,removed,normally when i comment on this sub i simply try to be funny but this guy this post is different a lot of stuff about that guy are huge red flags not trying to dad you but id be careful around this guy he is clingy but worse he seems like the stupid psychotic reckless kinda clingy you dont want to be around him even to score weed trust me at the same time you dont want to push him to the edge either youre doing fine now carry on doing that till he realizes youre a lost cause
creepyPMs,removed,hes gas lighting you for sure he definitely has some kind of personality or mental disorder if i were you id tell him that if he contacts you again youll go to the police and id follow through with that you have the right to tell someone to fuck off and them listen good luck ❤️
creepyPMs,removed,good god you need to block this dude or something obviously i realize its more complicated than that but man this guy has some serious issues pissed me off just reading his responses
creepyPMs,removed,pretty sure thats an sarcastic opening line to write something attention grapping and different
creepyPMs,removed,id fuck you under a rock 😏
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt that bad
creepyPMs,removed,its weird like those weirdos into auto erotic asphyxiation they should fucking strung up
creepyPMs,removed,fucking jake
creepyPMs,removed,you could have taken one extra second to add one extra line by the ke lol nonetheless kid is a weirdo
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,youre politeness was definitely not the way i wouldve handled it perhaps make him a bet next time tho
creepyPMs,removed,well was this person really a creep or just like an agressive ass im thinking maybe the word creep is overused on this sub in general some people are just pigs
creepyPMs,removed,what exchange
creepyPMs,removed,a little more context to this story first of all this guy who was posting images was not posting hentaiporno stuff so that is a lie second of all his images were well within the rules of the group and of fb itself so another lie there third it was claimed that you did not know he was a mod of the group which you removed his mod status before kicking him out another lie there fourth you abused your admin powers but not following the rules of messaging him before kicking him out as for this other guy i dont know if they are bros but it seems he was defending him because of your wrongful actions and lies you are not innocent in this did you apologize i never saw it in all that drama where you insulted i remember reading you calling everyone there man babies yet i didnt see anyone insult you more lies and to gossip about this guy in another place is really shitty of you it really shows your character and who you really are so dont believe everything you read here as there is always another side to the coin have a nice day
creepyPMs,removed,its probably not as bad as you think
creepyPMs,removed,not interested in a relationship is not at all the same as not interested in dating
creepyPMs,removed,so weird to me how ppl have online profiles on sites that only exist to facilitate people meeting each dont want people to ever contact them just dont have a profile
creepyPMs,removed,you were a bit of a twat tho couldve gotten your point across without all the insults
creepyPMs,removed,clearly you were at least in the beginning the classier person here and i feel like you could gotten your point across without all the insults
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt say that at all dude seems like an entitled weirdo my statement didnt imply anything more than what it said
creepyPMs,removed,what exactly is his end goal here like im honestly confused i guess he wants to get back together but i just dont see it working out at all after message number if you dont want to talk about it i understand but why did you guys break up and start dating in the first place maybe it would help understand this month stalking behavior maybe you should get a restraining order i know that sounds silly and over the top but maybe thats the only was to prevent him from contacting you in any way also does he know about these posts on this sub
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know why you think i would have to lie about what i think to someone i dont know and wont ever meet that has no bearing on how i live my life but think what u want its weird to me that ppl make online profiles on dating sites and then dont want ppl to contact them thats its thats not at all the same thing as meet every weirdo that sends you a message in real life
creepyPMs,removed,well you are on pof which is the dollar store of dating websites so its kind of your own fault im not sure what you expected
creepyPMs,removed,i am the truly bad guy she is talking about in this post i have been messaged this thread so i suppose you guys deserve a response to know the other side of the coins the facts someone posted a picture that was not against the rule of the group as everyone now agree on this and she a revoked his moderator rights and kicked out a member of the team in doing so she far exceeded her admin duties and broke the rule herself as no members and especially team members can be treated this way as it has been clarified by the group creator as a result she got banned of the group she got mad over a picture and used her power to treat a personal problem the victim put a public post in the moderating secret group and asked why and who kicked him out she saw the post and hide until we found out the admin log showing she did she deliberately had in mind to hide her acts my reaction to her behavior when recruiting me the group creator talked to me about this sort of toxic behavior and told me they were to be reported if spotted i never insulted her nor threatened her i simply posted a few comments explaining her using logic that she was guilty by exceeding her admin rights and willing to hide her behavior instead of publicly addressing the issue with the lad that posted the picture it is not because she felt insulted because she is ashamed of herself that i did insulted her i am not guilty of her being ashamed of her own actions she did something wrong and expected the group not to react nope you cant do shit and on top of that expect people to be nice with you if youre spotted take your responsibility youre adult its not the end of the world the messages as we were talking together for about a year i told her i was disappointed by her behavior kicking a fellow moderator with not a single warning or message hiding it i then said its part of friends duty to tell you when you screw up i had options being a hypocrite and fake like its alright while i think the opposite being honest and tell her she did something wrong but staying positive up to you if you prefer honest or fake people she obviously prefers hypocrites if i am harsh saying well this is wrong ill demonstrate it then the whole world is harsh dont work dont go out dont socialize life will be harsh to you this thread she is not being honest with you when saying she did that she did what she had to do nope she used her admin powers to solve personal matters the picture is clearly not porn or is it here is the picture is it porn or hentaï does it deserve a ban well we all dont think so now she got caught she left the group crying like a child and did not want to face the fact she kicked someone for no reason then she created a thread here to get your attention and to comfort her in the idea that she did nothing wrong and that were harassing her were the truly bad guys she wants to be consoled well ginger heres my advice grow up when you accept responsibilities for a job respect your expectations and dont use your abilities to solve personal problems if you screw up some day which happens relax it happens instead of saying i am sorry then leaving the conversation abruptly explain your interlocutors you understand what is wrong and how you offended them face your action bravely and stay positive if you do something wrong dont try to shift the responsibilities dont minimize your actions its nothing just fb but youre still saying you did the right thing i hope you are internally aware this is a lie dont lie to yourself what happened is not important as it is on fb but i suppose you have the opportunity to learn a lot here in terms of problem solving this might happen to you in a work related context and now you have the key to solve such conflict positively this mess is only the results of your action cowardly kicking someone hiding leaving the group and then blocking me when people face their actions bravely they dont go down in shame as you do and i suggest you must be pretty desperate to look for the support of people on reddit again i have nothing against you stop thinking the world is against you no one witch hunted you and stop hiding behind your problems you dont know my life nor what i am going through i am not using my depression as an excuse to act like shit the truly bad witch hunting threatening insulting harassing guy
creepyPMs,removed,and if you wonder why i replied in a threatening manner this is the simple result of my deep exasperation i spent time trying to make things nice for everyone when someone is being an ass i talked to her and she clearly understands nothing and tries to make me responsible because she cant face her own problems eventually she leaves the conversation as child and keep saying youre responsible for all of the problems of the world including hunger and donald trumps election i was wrong to do so youre right before seeing this thread i did not have in mind to talk to her anymore i am exhausted wasting my time with stupid people that act irresponsibly and cant or wont understand basic sentences but guys dont fall into her manipulation i thought you were all against me so i subtracted myself from everyones life they are all harassing me everyone hates me youre still doing it here you create a conflict and when you have lost the conversation you blame your interlocutor and act as if you were the victim bullied what is this thread about me why are you still trying to attack me when the conflict is clearly over youre the victim of yourself because you are an asshole heres the truth thats your nature you like stabbing people in the back this is called being weak and dishonest i am sorry if you got educated in this shitty way you are the only one to blame for the poor image you reflect of yourself stop shifting the responsibility on others can i go back to my life and hope not to find another thread where you obviously lie about me to have the internets attention no one cares really
creepyPMs,removed,cant hate on the guy for trying
creepyPMs,removed,would have been funny if op got graphic about how childbirth ruined her vagina
creepyPMs,removed,is there any dating site which isnt though i feel dating sites are useless as a guy cuz ladies get flooded with copypasta and creep messages it leaves normal guys to be a drop of sand in the ocean hard to find yourself anywhere
creepyPMs,removed,you shoulda kept playing his game for the long drawn out rejection or till he became frustrated
creepyPMs,removed,hey its me your friend
creepyPMs,removed,my comments havent been deleted yet also here httpswwwvocabularycomdictionarysexism read that youll see that the definition of sexism can include males and females what youre saying is ridiculous and you are flat out wrong its true that women are more typically victims of aexism but just like racism it can go both ways people of any sex can be sexist towards either sex and people of any race can be racist this is a fact the definition of the word cant be disputed how you choose to interpret it is up to you but it doesnt make you right i didnt see any of the other comments that have been deleted but id be willing to guess that they were attacking you and being inappropriate and thats why they were deleted not because they disagreed with you mods that do that dont have subs that last long have a nice day
creepyPMs,removed,dudes getting some mild hostility for no reason i dont think that was a pun there are cats known to mmmm likely he was trying to make a meta reference as a thread in another frontoage post on creepypms talks about how creeps always say mmmm on the phone
creepyPMs,removed,yeah idk about creepy so much as blazed
creepyPMs,removed,thatll make the nightfall interesting on a serious note that wasnt clever at all
creepyPMs,removed,you gotta take chances until some customer understands what data protection is and sues his ass
creepyPMs,removed,i love the way men dont think women are regularly harassed i dont want to seem like mr nice guy over here but we dont understand it because we dont do it dont see it find it rather stupid and with recent media mainly the feminism bs it feels like the issue is getting bloated to seem more serious than it is
creepyPMs,removed,if someone walked up to me threw down a smokeglitter bomb and said were friends now id either run very fast or accept my fate i wouldnt mess with that
creepyPMs,removed,im surprised he kept talking after that autistic spergout over something as innocuous as i drive its pretty clear he meant hes willing to come to you if you wanted to hang out not that hes bragging about being able to drive
creepyPMs,removed,im merely explaining how it is and you cant deny that feminism the movement and not the concept had made itself a real bad reputation lately
creepyPMs,removed,thanks for immediately assuming that im a guy thatll help battle discrimination online
creepyPMs,removed,so were using gendered and very specific terms like that now how is that anyhow less offensive than calling everyone a faggot
creepyPMs,removed,no wonder this thread is full of americans overreacting and playing the victim this guy may be a little bit creepy but he didnt do anything wrong and you want to fire him ffs you think youre better than him
creepyPMs,removed,doesnt make it any less cringey it only gets creepy that he persists instead of going wow youre a crazy bitch and moving on
creepyPMs,removed,youre right mansplaining is used as an actual defense when you run out of reasonable things to say when your fragile basis of argumentation shatters and you dont have anything else to fall back to at least slurs are used a such and everyone is aware that its a slur
creepyPMs,removed,why do you keep segregating between men and women you keep mentioning mens rhetoric and mansplaining your whole basis right now is that im the enemy and that the enemy is men therefore im wrong youre not trying to actually speak about anything that makes sense and keep falling back to your gendered bigoted argument maybe men should keep dismissing womens arguments is debates too just like you right now keep saying that what i said is male and therefore wrong after all we want equal rights and treatment for everyone right
creepyPMs,removed,must have missed the part where im the one using gendered insults
creepyPMs,removed,i have never denied that it happens i have merely tried to explain why men dont understand it with the addition that it feels exaggerated to us not that it is that it feels like it is besides as a man wouldnt it make sense that i know more about mens side of issue if thats mansplaining i find its also mansplaining that youre telling me about the harassment and cat calling because i never asked for that information either
creepyPMs,removed,question though lets say you are a pizza person and the person youre delivering to is the most attractive person youve seen and you would like to see if you two have anything in common how would you approach the situation obviously you cant use the number they gave you do you write a letter haha obviously the other person has no obligation to respond or interact but us it right to try and contact them
creepyPMs,removed,by righteous you mean overly pc and overly offended by differing opinions then yes you described this group perfectly this sub is great but i try to ignore the comments as much as possible so i dont become autistic
creepyPMs,removed,op needs to chill
creepyPMs,removed,sure im a guy but i have never stated that i am yet you immediately assumed it ive never denied that one either and yes feminist bs you know the feminist bs where feminists claim to stand for equality and against segregation between men and women and in the same breath shut up men for mansplaining and complaining about manspreading the hypocrisy hurts by now
creepyPMs,removed,apparently you misunderstood what the word seem means i dont want to mansplain again so please grab a dictionary or consult google
creepyPMs,removed,thats a much better idea not pushy at all slowly slinks away in embarrassment
creepyPMs,removed,the gross messages such as wanna hangout i drive
creepyPMs,removed,disclaimer yes this post is kinda long i dont expect every single person to read every single word im not trying to make this about me i only believe that there were misunderstandings based on my lack of social skills mansplaining isnt there norm sharing experiences and knowledge without regard to gender is the norm i get stuff explained at work and privately frequently and i dont get offended or think that the other person disregards my experiences im also not trying to make something about myself or about men in general im trying to share our side of the issue you can ignore that just as i can ignore this thread or you i didnt post the same thing ten times to draw attention away from other and i didnt downvote everyone in the thread either so im not seeing how im trying to make this about us my mistake was that i expected that you the commenters not you specifically draw conclusions in the other direction that im trying to share mens side of the issue for clarification i did not expect that you get offended at sharing an experience which is the exact feminist bs i was talking about so to sum it up ill properly write the exact message i was trying to deliver as well as my writing skills allow this was about the issue that men dont think that women are harassed regularly i and the men i know and talk to on a regular basis do not think that women are regularly harassed because we dont see it ourselves we dont do it ourselves and we believe its a quite dumb way to approach women as it doesnt work to begin with we are aware that it exists as dicks exist in every aspect of life and it has to have some basis people rarely make this stuff up out of the blue although where i am from and from what ive seen women are treated quite equally on a technical level to elaborate most businesses i applied to have the goal to have over of the employees be women in many departments the goal is already reached and given that the three ranks above my position are women theyre not lacking in leadership positions either stuff like that on top of that every single one of my coworkers is female we talk continuously throughout the day but ive never heard a single one complain about public harassment harassment from a stalker yes but no cat calling from strangers or similar we acknowledge and see that social inequalities still exist these go both ways though stereotypes and objectification plague every person both male and female as example it is thought that females are often seen as stupid or too emotional and males as bruting or cold in regards to emotions regarding the media thing every news site is a business you cant keep up the way to distribute the news without an income as such free sites or newspapers need something to get as many hits as possible to appease advertisers thats why many news are simply blown out of proportion to incite people to read what theyre writing if every news site was purely objective there wouldnt be any differing opinions
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,i think this guy is trolling wanted to get a rise out of you i suppose
creepyPMs,removed,alright everybody i am ops creepy friend ama no i am not an rincel i posted some advice in that subreddit a few weeks ago not sure why op thinks i am one i have had long term relationships both over a year and have had sex plenty of times not that it should matter at all anyway op did end up sending me the pictures i wanted and i just finished jerking off to them i currently dont have a girlfriend due to my very busy schedule and yes because of that i masturbate its very normal obviously i cant and wont post proof of the picture here it is against my code im not looking to make anyone feel uncomfortable i just wanted to appreciate ops feet because i read in another post she wasnt too happy with them i guess i must have struck a nerve with her anyway i just wanted to weigh in here and set the record straight
creepyPMs,removed,i think forcing and asking are two very different things this is why in school they teach kids to ask for consent before kissing someone this is exactly what i did i asked for consent surely if someone asks to kiss you they are not forcing anything onto you op decided to take it a step further and rather than saying no she decided to shame me
creepyPMs,removed,its how guys get bitches that will never love them once women treat them like shit for so long that they conclude all women are like that im torn between feeling bad for them and writing them off as sexist
creepyPMs,removed,eh i actually think you were projecting more than he was it sounded a lot like he associates love with kindness and you associate it with infatuation while he might be a little off base you come across as closeheartedcloseminded and it sounds like he understands that experience subjective and you seem to think that its shared
creepyPMs,removed,theres no way im ever using something like this i dont feel like letting everyone know i think about rape all the time
creepyPMs,removed,youre such a fucking bitch you know that
creepyPMs,removed,so would it be different if you actually felt the same way and were interested in him why not just tell him to stop texting and cancel your future appts shit move in my opinion get a female doctor next time stop fuckin being a pussy
creepyPMs,removed,that wasnt too bad
creepyPMs,removed,since when did bombay exist in asoiaf you sound like a colossal retard
creepyPMs,removed,why do they do this honestly is it the greencard are they that tired of porn phishing isil recruitment wtf there are so many
creepyPMs,removed,i have the weirdest boner right now
creepyPMs,removed,not sure this guys creepy he apologised and yeah didnt take a hint but he didnt get annoyed or defensive either when he was shot down repeatedly
creepyPMs,removed,you need to practice your trolling go shit post in rcirclejerk for a year
creepyPMs,removed,shouldve ended it with a dick pic
creepyPMs,removed,i feel like the counter cringe is pretty hard here that guy probably nutted either way but you had to roleplay gay sex
creepyPMs,removed,so tempted to say do it
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,i respect his candor
creepyPMs,removed,time to get downvoted normally im all for these however i am assuming that there was no conversation before hand here dont you think this guy was being reasonable initially i personally feel like this is more cringe than anything because of the way you were being rude and childish to him maybe im not seeing the whole picture though
creepyPMs,removed,boring meets stuckup
creepyPMs,removed,this guy obviously hasnt been able to pick up a woman in many years and so he tries to belittle them to gain power looks like its not gonna work just ignore the loser whatever he says about you is how he really feels about himself
creepyPMs,removed,i dont really think this person was being creepy just lame would have been better to just say not interested sorry or just not respond
creepyPMs,removed,ok the guys being weird but you were being a bitch to him before he started saying anything perverted
creepyPMs,removed,but dont you think that method in which the op responds is a bit childish were all adults here and surely heshe could had easily said im not interested or dont say replying with k seems so simple minded to me
creepyPMs,removed,i mean it is a complement just an out of line weird one
creepyPMs,removed,my new favourite insult is now twatwaffle
creepyPMs,removed,i hate men
creepyPMs,removed,hey no dick shaming s
creepyPMs,removed,hes hot though
creepyPMs,removed,how did he know you have big boobs
creepyPMs,removed,the adieu at the end is just as cringey as the rest of the convo
creepyPMs,removed,too many neckbeard references cant be real
creepyPMs,removed,so when is your first date
creepyPMs,removed,this is the first thing that comes to your mind wow those are really apologetic white guilt replies cant possibly be a black man haha nervous laugh
creepyPMs,removed,and hows this creepy at all just asked what did you want if you wanted to have the thing that you wanted with him and just quitted when he had to triggered person i see
creepyPMs,removed,at first i thought yeah thats creepy but then it escalated and you two are made for each other
creepyPMs,removed,youre assuming all men are into lesbians nothing makes a woman less attractive than being a lesbian there is literally no potential to work with so why bother unless you overdosed on porn
creepyPMs,removed,people who dont get the hint are the worst they have no respect for anyone even themselves like youre only going to lead to embarrassment and shame for yourself why try side note say hi to reddit comments are kinda cringey and unnecessary sorry op
creepyPMs,removed,literally waitasec u literally got a wanna make out message literally
creepyPMs,removed,im not saying dont do it do what you want you shouldnt be worrying about what the hell i think about it just dont be so absurd as to just expect everyone should be cool about it your free to do it im free to not like it dont expect other people to conform to your personal views because it makes you more comfortable with the world the world is a tough place deal with it
creepyPMs,removed,you know i think that his first message wasnt so creepy but the rebuttal to him was cringey came off as a little unnecessarily rude of course the entire rest of the conversation on both sides was also consistent cringe
creepyPMs,removed,older guy once told me divide your age by two then add years thats the limit it gets a little more forgiving once you get older a year old can date a year old a year old can date a year old a year old can date a year old im down with that im right now i dont know what i would have to talk about with a year old my buddy is and i think his gf is like i feel like a damn grandpa around her
creepyPMs,removed,its different for men
creepyPMs,removed,it may be complete inexperience i said something equally embarrassing in person to a girl i was on a date with once i didnt start dating until i was and i had no idea how to go about making moves since men are the ones required it seems to move things along in a relationship it shouldnt surprise women that sometimes a guy will make a boneheaded statement like the one in ops post in my opinion she and i am assuming op is or identifies as a woman couldve responded bettera simple uh no thank you would have sufficed she didnt need to go full bitch and she did
creepyPMs,removed,eh its just part of our programming to be clear im not defending some year old neckbeard pming a girl in her early regardless of whether she has an age range or not thats creepy as fuck but as far as the trope of guys wanting to date someone younger its a confidence thing if i can hold the interest of an attractive young woman thats an affirmation for me means i still got it you know or else why do you see so many guys in their driving red camaros guys and this is a generalization are fairly single minded you set a guy up on a blind date and all he really cares about is whether or not she is pretty sure we want her to be nice smart funny but is usually going to be is she cute women on the other had are big picture thinkers they are more capable than men again im generalizing of entertaining multiple thoughts and ideas at once you ask the woman what she wants on a blind date sure she wants the guy to be cute but she also wants to know about his job his lifestyle is he funny does he dress well an older guy is more likely to have that stability that isnt to say that shes into the old man for his money but rather that she is secure in his company tldr gross generalizations guys feel secure by dating an attractive women women feel secure when dating a guy that makes them feel secure
creepyPMs,removed,thanks for sharing your post i always get a kick out of what you gals have to endure on the dating apps
creepyPMs,removed,expand a little further i do think that men and women think differently like their brains just work along different lines neither is smarter or more or less flawed than the other but i think that men tend to be more single minded about things where as women deal with more thoughts and feelings at once of course there are plenty of women out there who are focused and plenty of guys who are more conceptual but thats what i think for what its worth
creepyPMs,removed,does a simple scam message on facebook count as creepy i never thought of spam as such just block and move on nothing here suggests anything remotely creepy its just a phishing attempt
creepyPMs,removed,hes literally looking for a gold digger and hell find one too i think hes aware of that lol
creepyPMs,removed,it rubs people the wrong way because its basically giving the weight of an orientation to a preference preferring intelligence isnt fundamentally different from preferring any other personality trait but you usually dont see people saying things like im a humorsexual or im a kindnessexual unless theyre being tongueincheek that combined with the fact that it is a preference for intelligence makes those who use it often come off as pretentious especially considering the fact that it uses the latin root i dont mean to say youre wrong or you shouldnt use it but thats why it could be construed as a bad thing
creepyPMs,removed,automoderator youre busting my balls man why you got to be hating on my sick lyrics ͡° ʖ̯ ͡°
creepyPMs,removed,honey i am the party
creepyPMs,removed,most girls dont like random youre cute messages from strangers i dont understand this nor am i even going to bother questioning the reasoning behind it i am just never going to call a girl cute again i dont want to make girls feel uncomfortable
creepyPMs,removed,i say this to my girlfriend all the time and when she says no i respond with well youve got the right guy i think you just killed his punchline by thinking he was serious a lot of people are on tinder for casual shit but usually get past hello before getting to that point
creepyPMs,removed,talking to random strangers about sex but i mean thats kind of the point its tinder its the hook up app
creepyPMs,removed,im not meaning to associate a particular vernacular with one group of people but i cant help but notice how certain foreign men seem to always chat like this
creepyPMs,removed,there are girls who dont have a stash of castration knee surgery gaping dudes and other pictures that will send shibers down your cock peasant
creepyPMs,removed,except they arent lmfao stop making assumptions you fool arguments that attempt to social shame are never effective online because you know nothing about me in person
creepyPMs,removed,are you completely sure that is a girl and not some dude because the whole im a girl yeah a girly girl such a slut with pink hair most very girly color and fake toenails thats totally girly wow much girl i have fake nails and a girlfriend because everybody knows theres nothing better than lesbian sex with big fake nails talk dirty to me another girl its very suspicious
creepyPMs,removed,thats no girl
creepyPMs,removed,anyone else feel she was just trying to be cute and op totally shot her down
creepyPMs,removed,this is definitely a guy
creepyPMs,removed,this dude is a piece of shit for saying thatbut im stealing gg dawg everytime my grandmother or mother yells at me im going to say gg dawg and hang up
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt very creepy though
creepyPMs,removed,but he acknowledges that he missed it his messages are pretty douchy but not exactly creepy
creepyPMs,removed,hi splendidrainbows i have sent you a pm i may be of assistance
creepyPMs,removed,hard to not be poor when you major in gender studies lmfao
creepyPMs,removed,what makes you think that this is misogyny
creepyPMs,removed,i suggest posting this to rcringepics we love self cringe posts over there
creepyPMs,removed,ffs what is wrong with people i bet hes got a chode
creepyPMs,removed,yeah cause calling someone a stupid cunt means that you have a general hate for their gender right s ridiculus
creepyPMs,removed,that dude practically raped you call the police
creepyPMs,removed,lord i wish we could send this to this mans mother lord op if it ever happens again go to his friends page look for anyone that looks personal and blast this mofo
creepyPMs,removed,post it on his timeline
creepyPMs,removed,you know that the rest of us can read this right youre arguing about what is more metal online on reddit in a subreddit that has nothing to do with music or a metal lifestyle
creepyPMs,removed,you misspelled heavy you pretentious fuckwit
creepyPMs,removed,congratulations on you set of rules that do nothing but help you promote your propaganda
creepyPMs,removed,do you hate your username now that this person raped it
creepyPMs,removed,hi op hmu
creepyPMs,removed,fake
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know him but isnt he just busting balls i mean he is asking her if she agrees to do these things and obviously she says no but maybe in the context of him being a known dick its dickish
creepyPMs,removed,be direct and stop responding could have saved yourself three quarters of this shit my word that boy is crazy
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,this ed is absolutely disgusting
creepyPMs,removed,i just love the way you overreacted
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know why people are downvoting you he is open about all the horrible shit he doeshis wife is equally as fucked up as he is the wife ordered the girl not to kiss greg because she was jealous instead of talking to her husband she placed it all on the girl you arent in a poly relationship if you have a psycho jealous bitch running things greg demanded the ex get a tattoo that had significance to bitch face not him the first time who the fuck demands a tattoo for a lie greg and his wife deserve to be tied up to the basement wall and beat it would be really hot sorry if i got any details wrong i usually dont watch greg but i watched the we broke up a few months ago and dont have the stomach to re watch
creepyPMs,removed,a lot is two words
creepyPMs,removed,sarah devoir went to my school in the and grades she was young for her grade look on her facebook friends and if you notice quite a few of them are going to lakeshore high school she was going there but in the middle school until her parents moved her away
creepyPMs,removed,that girl is stupid for not leaving him
creepyPMs,removed,no idea who this guy is but anyone with unread texts is a sick twisted fuck
creepyPMs,removed,does onision actually think that shades of grey is a model for relationships better yet does he think any of this whatsoever is remotely normal ugh i already know the answers hes a narcissistic sociopath he cares only for himself and abuses everyone else around him until shit hits the fan and he makes a video telling everyone how wrong they are about things without actually addressing the problem at all
creepyPMs,removed,if they are stupid enough to want it he is smart enough to give it to them
creepyPMs,removed,lol onision is a feminist retard
creepyPMs,removed,lots of misinformation and blind reddit hatewagon going on theres a reason this guy is still free hes a creep yet but he knows the law and how to work it hes not running an underage harem with a bunch of little girls in his basement christ
creepyPMs,removed,kinksters are fucking idiots no offense
creepyPMs,removed,duh this is just typical blind reddit fearmongering
creepyPMs,removed,im old greg want to ser my mangina
creepyPMs,removed,ive never seen or heard of these youtubers outside of minutes ago but with some basic googlefu i discovered that the messages offer an incomplete picture of the events between the expartners in this relationship im not on either partners side or condoning the treatment or actions in this relationship but here are a few facts these messages are incomplete and appear to cut content from the original conversation skewing the context and view of the audience this was a triad relationship between a married couple and the expartner this was not the first breakup the partners appear to be in the bdsm lifestyle the requests the youtuber is making were not abnormal conduct for the relationship and an established preexisting norm in the relationship all parties in the relationship are consenting adults httpsyoutubeqbkgzdnimpi the other side of the side with the rest of the text conversation and context around the relationship
creepyPMs,removed,sounds like the spurned yo gf is flirting with some people she knows to get them to try and damage onions reputation he dumped her shes really fucking annoyed thinks shed owed something gets people to botvote this up lol
creepyPMs,removed,just so we are clear everyone knows this isnt about smoking weed its the fact that billie willingly broke the law yes a lot of people see weed as not a big deal but bringing someone who will repeatedly break the law into your home with your family doesnt sound like the best idea literally what would you do to gain forgiveness from someone youve fucked over multiple times maybe a grand gesture such as getting a tattoo also anyone who watches gregs content will understand that the chained up in a basement suggestion was apart of his humor and the words of someone who has lost complete faith in the other party out of context anything can look fucked up
creepyPMs,removed,i may not be liked for this comment but i want to say my opinion ive never heard of him i just watched through a bunch of his videos just now this man has some issues that is for certain but all of his content features sarcasm and joking about anything from eating disorders to rape is that normal not usually but he does it in a very sarcastic and comical way in his perspective this text should be taken with a grain of salt text cannot display vocal tone so we really cant say for sure whether he was serious or being sarcastic this was only a small portion of what was most likely said im not defending him in any way i dont agree with his content but i do think this should be further looked in to before judgements are made just my opinion i dont follow this dude nor do i plan to but if those reading this are choosing to put their attention on him thats your right just remember people like him thrive off attention and after seeing his videos he likes drama i choose to not feed his addiction
creepyPMs,removed,if she had dumped him why would she even care to reply
creepyPMs,removed,more perplexing is how the battery dropped from page to but added back on how does he do that
creepyPMs,removed,is this somehow creepy
creepyPMs,removed,good for him hope she accepts her punishment and comes back sounds like a healthy relationship
creepyPMs,removed,come on you understood perfectly what he was saying shitting on somebody because their sociolect isnt what you consider prestigious isnt cool still creepy for the content though
creepyPMs,removed,you just want to hurt women for fun youre creepy you cant try and reprimand people for wanting to communicate textually with someone they can actually understand if she didnt understand she wouldnt have posted it stop assuming people to be dumb with no evidence
creepyPMs,removed,in what way is that a jerk
creepyPMs,removed,lol i know oh well
creepyPMs,removed,jesus christ youre messages are worse than his
creepyPMs,removed,k
creepyPMs,removed,are you the bicycle spoke
creepyPMs,removed,is she still going to that school d tell the principal please this isnt okay this is really not okay actually
creepyPMs,removed,i call bullshit
creepyPMs,removed,you should report it to the school his intent was clearly there before her birthday and sending those sorts of messages creates a huge liability for the school
creepyPMs,removed,two of my three high school english teachers were investigated for inappropriate conduct with students funnier story teacher was turned in by teacher teacher wasnt doing annnnything teacher was doing the do just plead guilty two months jailtime fine the student for teacher was but still a student
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think this is a creepy pm the guy was just trying to use a pickup line and when he saw it bothered you was actually apologetic tbh seems like youre the one who came off as crazy
creepyPMs,removed,what does how far away from the school have anything to do with it this teacher is a creep and this news to be reported dont be lazy
creepyPMs,removed,wait a few days and see if the teacher apologises or something but still you have to convince her that its a big deal because wow its a big goddamn deal
creepyPMs,removed,my bad question if i hadnt said that op came off as the crazy one would the comment still be breaking the rules
creepyPMs,removed,alright my bad sorry op
creepyPMs,removed,he didnt seem too phased you obvs did it just for reddit you karmawhoring fuck slut p btw i love you
creepyPMs,removed,tell her she is putting future students at risk by not reporting this creepo
creepyPMs,removed,fucking creep i second everyone else report his ass hes a roofie and a glass of water away from ruining someones life
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think this guy really knew how bad what he was saying sounded i mean the line is so terrible it cant possibly work so its effective audience is a couple friends with a weird sense of humor definitely offputting and cringey but i dont think its a bad guy
creepyPMs,removed,mvictem
creepyPMs,removed,i know this isnt caw but since you seem open to advice maybe mention that this will continue to happen if someone doesnt step up if he is this brash will he really never go further than this theres obviously something not right with him how would she feel if something worse happens to another student in the future i mean if she asked to remain anonymous it sounds like hed have a hard time figuring out which barely exstudent reported him anyways idk id just hate to see this cycle continue when such damning evidence exists any parent of a student there would have an absolute fit if they knew that a teacher acted this way
creepyPMs,removed,please tell your friend to advise the school board or if you know approximately where she lives you can likely determine the district and advise them yourself please do something this type of behavior often escalates and he is obviously keen to turn his fantasy into reality current students are very likely at risk
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand why after the first no you just didnt block him instead of continuing to talk to him and saying no
creepyPMs,removed,how is that creepy
creepyPMs,removed,those responses belong in cringe pics
creepyPMs,removed,nope get him fired as a teacher i dont want this fuckwit associated with the profession
creepyPMs,removed,you are trying far too hard
creepyPMs,removed,call them speak to the principle and email the screenshots you shouldnt have to be present to bring this to their attention please report this guy you and your friend were smart enough to say no not every girl will be do it for them
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair he didnt do much to warrant this response
creepyPMs,removed,hey in case you didnt realise his name is visible in the screenshot within this screenshot
creepyPMs,removed,its the students hes still in school with i would be worried about those kids shouldnt be around this creep
creepyPMs,removed,he says ok never mind and you keep responding this sub is supposed to be for people getting legitimately creepy pms not you showing off how you totally got this guy half the posts in here are just people baiting out creepy shit by continuing to respond if im creeped out by someone i avoid them not sit baiting more creepy shit from them
creepyPMs,removed,oh god and i bet at least one of them agreed gross but which one
creepyPMs,removed,id still report his ass
creepyPMs,removed,ruin his career and embarass him in front of his family for being a normal sexual being geez justcbecause the law says you can only be attracted to people older than doesnt change how nature works humans are attracted to fertile beings girls are fertile and are done with puberty physically around so its natural
creepyPMs,removed,the guy is a creep a jerk and clearly desperate it is no wonder that he doesnt have much of a sex life on the other hand it also isnt sexual harassment under the law because sexual harassment is something that is connected with the workplace
creepyPMs,removed,id report it anyway this is not acceptable behaviour and when hes lusting after students chomping at the bit to ask for nudes the principal should be informed
creepyPMs,removed,just go ahead and ban me from this shitstain sub i dont know why i didnt unsubscribe sooner
creepyPMs,removed,hi i have social anxiety but i really want to try and get over it with you i may also have social anxiety im not sure what i want to do lets try and defeat our awkward social anxiety together omg creep alert
creepyPMs,removed,well did you send it
creepyPMs,removed,this was more sad than creepy hes just incredibly shy about talking to someone this the type of guy who would date you a month and just to ask to hold your hand
creepyPMs,removed,just say no thanks or have a conversation with him and then say that was cool but no thanks
creepyPMs,removed,really because you went and found my other comment and messaged me id say someone sounds salty btw im on your side of the arguement dude was a bonafide creep i was just pointing out the hypocrisy of making fun of there for being triggered when you seem so triggered yourself
creepyPMs,removed,yeah gay ppls do that a lot
creepyPMs,removed,jokes on them
creepyPMs,removed,i know pc cuilture doesnt like it but to shit like this always reply jump off a bridge bigots have no reason to live
creepyPMs,removed,again i didnt say that what they said was okay or cool to say my point was that you know it is coming and if you let that get to you too much then maybe you shouldnt go through with it i understand that it may make you happier but there will always be something you arent happy with its just a matter of which thing you want to be unhappy about and im sorry but a foot woman with a giant adams apple is hard to just ignore im not going to hard core stare or anything but its not something you see every day so naturally people stare a little bit
creepyPMs,removed,youre absolutely right op i dont know what came over me and i apologize for that crass and uncalled for behavior if you can see it in your heart to forgive me could there also be a chance that you would share a vid of my cat licking tuna fish off your boobies for cash i apologize in advance if my proposal is too bold to be clear the cash would go to you not my cat
creepyPMs,removed,do you understand sarcasm
creepyPMs,removed,is your country singapore if so blurring could use a little more work
creepyPMs,removed,ill save you the trouble and unsubscribe sweet pea
creepyPMs,removed,thats stupid just dont date kids simple rule
creepyPMs,removed,good thing you blurred out your country dont any creepers finding out where you live
creepyPMs,removed,do i get banned
creepyPMs,removed,as a man are you far more likely to be violent to someone
creepyPMs,removed,upvoted for actually being creepy rather than guys who dont have social skills
creepyPMs,removed,nice picture
creepyPMs,removed,can i ask what he said
creepyPMs,removed,calm down love it was just a question im not the first person to ask this after a comments been removed sometimes they water it down and repeat it sometimes they dont
creepyPMs,removed,i might ask a hundred girlsmight get nosbut maybe that hundredth girl likes to fuck on a pile of trash david cross
creepyPMs,removed,lol
creepyPMs,removed,actually you sound like the creepy one
creepyPMs,removed,that was a beautiful takedown pointbygloriouspoint i quite liked the flat face bit and i absolutely hate people who talk shit about teeth need to be white like some tv bullshit
creepyPMs,removed,how delightfully sexist of you well done in treating men like shit to make yourself feel better over the anonymity of the internet
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair he was offering to pay you to model for him so he could paint a picture of you just so happens he wanted to paint a picture of yall fucking bucks though
creepyPMs,removed,his thing is so small
creepyPMs,removed,hes crazy but you are kind of a bitch for calling him ugly uncalled for
creepyPMs,removed,gross you should have told him to shave that monster bushthats nasty
creepyPMs,removed,im so sorry but this is actually kind of funny i always like messing with people who have the wrong number
creepyPMs,removed,im guessing moh is short for mohammed
creepyPMs,removed,i wouldnt let two strange men into my home where else can see them and me
creepyPMs,removed,what is a year old girl doing on dating sites something is leading me to belive op is a faggot
creepyPMs,removed,imo the kay cool at the end sounds like he was trying to make it clear it was a joke i think its not good for you to be freaking out like this over what is most likely a joke though i understand that its scary youre safe in all likelihood hes not being serious but even if hes actually trying to threaten you he cant actually find you my advice would be to explain to him that that kind of joke made you uncomfortable and to judge whether or not to block him based on his reaction i know im the only person in the comments so far that doesnt think this guy is serious danger and maybe im just being naive but the voicemail is a dead ringer for a tasteless joke to me however as someone else pointed out i feel like these kinds of jokes are often a way of expressing something a person seriously believes but doesnt want to outright say so even if this voicemail is a joke it still could be a sign of him feeling clingy towards you also definitely would ask him about that whole telling his mom youre his girlfriend thing but id say until something else turns up youre probably not in any danger so dont stress over it
creepyPMs,removed,this reads like a bunch of kids playing a joke if you think this is serious then idk what to tell you
creepyPMs,removed,bill lumbergh needs to step in and ask him if he got that memo half a decade ago
creepyPMs,removed,india
creepyPMs,removed,probably because thats what works in some middle eastern places as the sole factor for adding her and the odd time reddit
creepyPMs,removed,that doesnt work in india any more than it does here its because they consider western women sluts
creepyPMs,removed,why the gun and barricades must be more to it because he didnt seem agressive sure he was an idiot for still going on after you said not interested
creepyPMs,removed,the context is that op spends his time following some vegan users all over reddit and lying about all kinds of shit of course he then deletes everything related to veganism from his history and pretends to be a victim he will also delete his accounts every few months and starts again when it becomes too obvious with the trolling based on his history there is a good chance that this pm might be faked here are some archives preview is bad you must click on it from the archives you can click the link for the context and itll bring you back to reddit where you can see it was deleted httparchiveisrmqsz give me minutes and ill have a pm saying you hate your dog using nothing but ms paint edit i was wrong it took minutes httpiimgurcomewxtoubpng op said he was never vegan then a few days later was vegan for years how many of you are vegan by dottywine in intp infp here ocassionally test as infj considered it but never went through with it i kind of went the other way and visited family who had a farm and educated myself on where my food came from and how animals were treated which caused me to favor pasture raised and sustainable products as opposed to factory farming plus if you keep chickens for eggs or meat you can get free pets i can understand why other people would go veg but its just not something i believe in and itd be dishonest of me to say i do i just cant force myself to believe in it it wouldnt be genuine httparchiveishdzrv redditors who have been vegetarianvegan for a significant portion of their lives but chose to eat meat again what made you change your mind and what was the first meat you chose to eat by kaythebae in askreddit carcosianking points hours ago health and happiness i started to let it define me wearing those friends not food shirts or just shirts that said vegan i was basically like those people who let their faith define them and wear shirts praising the lord everywhere they go i realized that i was just looking for something to feel important or like i was special i suppose i could have picked anything but i ended up choosing to be vegan because it kind of draws you in making you think youre a hero fighting a war just because you eat differently i realized that i didnt actually believe any of it and quit ive been working on just being happy being myself and its worked out a lot better i dont need to be noticed or in everyones face with my beliefs to be happy i just need to be happy with who i am funnily enough the more meat i ate the easier it was to feel happy and not miserable all the time so it was a winwin i was miserable because i wasnt eating right and because i thought everything was a battle when the reality is i was no soldier or hero i was just a moody college brat with a bunch of inyourface shirts or you can go through his old history and see that everything related to veganism was deleted httparchiveiskpvvd

creepyPMs,removed,ok so you put quotes but he didnt actually say that he said im going to head that way either way of all the creepy pms that seemed worthy of a barricade and a gun this didnt seem to be one he didnt reply further too
creepyPMs,removed,was in her comment on picture i dont know to me that whole comment thread on seemed way over the top
creepyPMs,removed,thats not right
creepyPMs,removed,i know this indian dude in dubai who did the same thing to a girl in sweden theyre now together
creepyPMs,removed,well thats a different opener points for creativity and no sexual overtones
creepyPMs,removed,i want to be sure i word this carefully as i see this on multiple posts in this sub but why even continue the conversation once you get beyond uncomfortable being a dude i dont get nearly as many messages as you might but as soon as someone crosses the line maybe even before if i see a rationale forming i block them theres a lot more to your situation here from what you described so i dont know the whole story but even in this case where you recognized him from before whats the point of even doing the same dance with this person all over again and not just kickban and move on not trying to troll here just genuinely curious at least part of the problem is that youre on pof there are some doozies on there
creepyPMs,removed,haha you reported them for not supporting your fake pms and lying
creepyPMs,removed,soooooooo fake
creepyPMs,removed,its fake
creepyPMs,removed,they didnt its fake
creepyPMs,removed,nope its fakr
creepyPMs,removed,so you gonna admit that the pm is fake
creepyPMs,removed,nope youre just lying more they said nah this is what i said lol i bet you delete this account now that youve been called on bullshit look at you lying again and again i never told you to delete it i said i bet you would i still am being you will so im guessing the pm was just a bet not an order
creepyPMs,removed,i chose my words carefully in order to gain insight to your process but you answered my question thanks
creepyPMs,removed,i wasnt aware of the rules beforehand but have now unsubscribed from this overly sensitive sub so i dont anticipate this being a problem anymore thanks so much for your patience in guiding me through this
creepyPMs,removed,dont wanna rain on your parade but dont get your hopes up just yet people online tend to be different face to face relax and enjoy yourself
creepyPMs,removed,because we know our siblings and try to protect the world from them and their hellion ways
creepyPMs,removed,i have had better luck in other subs and will continue to do so thanks again for your sincere advice not so strangely this has been the first sub where ive ever encountered any problems stay classy though and enjoy your last word
creepyPMs,removed,i dont see this as creepy at all good for him for going for it instead of always wondering if it would of worked
creepyPMs,removed,still dont think its creepy at all
creepyPMs,removed,so he asked you a pretty straight forward question without a hint of being entitled and hes creepy yea that makes sensestop gaslighting people you dont find physically attractive
creepyPMs,removed,if a brother never asks he never going to know
creepyPMs,removed,i know people have different perceptions of whats creepy but cmon weird creepy
creepyPMs,removed,i fully agree that theres a lot of creeps out there and most of the posts on this sub are definitely in the right but its a lot like a sub like rcringe where a lot of the meaning is just lost and everything is all piled up into one category this dude wasnt being creepy he was just tryna hang out even if he was pushy and didnt get a hint he never got a flat out no so you cant blame the guy for trying
creepyPMs,removed,why are arabindian guys so creepy
creepyPMs,removed,maybe the offer wasnt something they wanted but this is far from a creepy pm
creepyPMs,removed,sure lemme go ahead and read the rules for every sub that has a post on rall before commenting really
creepyPMs,removed,dont see hows this creepy some younger girls like older men he gave it a shot and bounced when you said no
creepyPMs,removed,seems to me you overreacted way too much while slightly annoying he didnt seem creepy at all in his responses
creepyPMs,removed,so howd her panties fit
creepyPMs,removed,still up
creepyPMs,removed,drivel not dribble
creepyPMs,removed,struggling to use a fleshlight now thats a tiny penis
creepyPMs,removed,because lesbians are literally just confused
creepyPMs,removed,fucking creepy cucks man
creepyPMs,removed,how is this creepy have a downvote for wasting my time
creepyPMs,removed,that interaction had very little to do with having a vagina its the same thing for guys respond politely get bitched at dont respond at all get bitched at its just people
creepyPMs,removed,i hope youre a teen as well or youve got some explaining to do as well
creepyPMs,removed,you want to check it out for research purposes im assuming
creepyPMs,removed,hmm
creepyPMs,removed,i remember that bitch encyclopedia dramatica has a page on her if im not mistaken
creepyPMs,removed,why on earth would you keep him going he is taking pleasure in the troll just block him straight away to remove the power from the trolling
creepyPMs,removed,you literally stole a frontpage post
creepyPMs,removed,persistent or not he has a good point that the female is attacking him for only wanting to know her based on her looks and yet she is doing the exact same thing but only to justify her disinterest
creepyPMs,removed,my comment wasnt intended to be confrontational questioning someones actions shouldnt be construed as such
creepyPMs,removed,im bi and i absolutely would like to see your genitals
creepyPMs,removed,you are acting like a bit of a cunt
creepyPMs,removed,honestly everyone in this exchange comes across as ghetto trash kids the girl cheating on her bf with some ghetto loser and the friend who is pretending to be a big man that has a daughter which is a complete tragedy itself
creepyPMs,removed,nothing prevents you from creeping on teenagers living close to you
creepyPMs,removed,there are a few exceptions to this though like if youre in a longterm relationship the rules change
creepyPMs,removed,why do you have crabs so are these people literally retarded what makes them ask stupid ass questions like that i feel like almost every post these people have some sort of deficiency i guess that at least explains why they think this is appropriate to say to other people
creepyPMs,removed,this is what the sub needs more of the ones where the guys are negging and the women just keep responding make me sad it reinforces the whole point of negging that women who wont bottomline fuck off asshole block will eventually give in
creepyPMs,removed,are you lost
creepyPMs,removed,wrong sub
creepyPMs,removed,this and your other post have zero context so its hard to see who is really the one at fault here but judging from others responses to you and your consistent callout of ableism anytime someone disagrees with you regardless of whether they say anything even about your disabilities im going to say its you and before you try that shit with me nice try im autistic myself i also deal with multiple mental and physical disabilities chronic pain and mobility issues which require me to use a cane andor wheelchair so trust me i know ableism and it aint people disagreeing with me
creepyPMs,removed,this wasnt that creepy
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think you know what sub you are inthis has no context and doesnt belong here
creepyPMs,removed,im not even sure whats going on here i think two fans of a porn star are fighting aboutidk
creepyPMs,removed,honestly everything about this is cringey even the number of lols
creepyPMs,removed,yep ironically in response to my comment that asked people to not do just that
creepyPMs,removed,the constant lol after every perverted comment drove me crazy
creepyPMs,removed,i like the way she says lol a lot made me lol too 😝
creepyPMs,removed,thats weird but i really dont understand why you cant seem to type a single thing without including lol
creepyPMs,removed,i seriously think these guys are mentally challenged
creepyPMs,removed,lol
creepyPMs,removed,while he is an unbelievable fucktard and all how shit stop saying lol on every fucking line i want to punch you in the face almost as much as him
creepyPMs,removed,can confirm is normal
creepyPMs,removed,while it isnt pedophilia it is incredible creepy and too common online
creepyPMs,removed,honestly though of the hundreds or possibly thousands of people to be banned this is a very small number of people
creepyPMs,removed,the place that invented sarcasm
creepyPMs,removed,lol your jaws must be hurting if you have to laugh that much for so little
creepyPMs,removed,i feel like she should send this to his wife maybe her friend too
creepyPMs,removed,you loled on every comment whats so funny
creepyPMs,removed,you sound like a righteous cunt
creepyPMs,removed,i dont get why they picked that sub of all subs i mean i feel like the user base is basically the same people who like to bully on the internet
creepyPMs,removed,lol
creepyPMs,removed,i seem to have missed the creepy part
creepyPMs,removed,wiping your account is a little excessive
creepyPMs,removed,then she pulls a dick move and posts it on reddit
creepyPMs,removed,there lol are lol too lol many lol lols lol
creepyPMs,removed,just out of curiosity exactly what kind of consequences should sending a message like this have
creepyPMs,removed,unfortunately in cases like this i think we just need to accept there are assholes out there theres no logical way to control peoples speech and actually enforce it take it to the police if it becomes direct threats and then proceed from there
creepyPMs,removed,saying shit like this should have consequences in your opinion where is the line for the freedom of speech assuming usa
creepyPMs,removed,i agree with what youre saying but i dont see a threat here i see some dickhead saying something fucked up but hes not saying hes going to do it sure you can report it to the police but a one off post on an app is unlikely to garner their attention as a credible threat
creepyPMs,removed,so not in this case
creepyPMs,removed,its kind of a stretch to say that this guy is saying he is planning to rape anyone just off this one message
creepyPMs,removed,because dudes are shit thats why
creepyPMs,removed,would it be fair to say this sub is a safe space or echo chamber
creepyPMs,removed,i love how self centred he is in my experience most foreign people on datingchat sites are
creepyPMs,removed,i think its interesting to note that he started the conversation without mentioning anything in your profile and still managed to get a response looks like the lowquality hi there approach isnt that terrible
creepyPMs,removed,you could block him everywhere if he contacts you someplace block him there too dont talk to him like not one word youre probably not getting that debt back anyway now if you ignore him completely he will give up eventually i think you kinda goofed it up when you started replying and explaining stuff to him you should never do that a clean quick cut is how you do it
creepyPMs,removed,you were just as hostile
creepyPMs,removed,oh it was all acceptable but he mentioned her relation with her brother and that was too much
creepyPMs,removed,op got laid for sure that night
creepyPMs,removed,not that being trim or fit or tan would make this any more acceptable but dang man his lack of selfawareness seems to go beyond conversation
creepyPMs,removed,he could at least not be shaped like a bag of laundry just sayin
creepyPMs,removed,fucking bell is he pregnant seriously though he cant seriously expect this to work
creepyPMs,removed,he looks disgusting to begin with im also straight and a guy so im not sure how serious anybody should take this also i really wish they would institute the ban hammer for dick picks across dating sites its weird
creepyPMs,removed,tell him your name is christianina you were born a male you went through a sex change op to become female but realized you made a mistake and had another identity crisis so went through another sex change operation to become male again as a result of these two operations your genitals or whats left of them are horribly mutilated same as your ass you did decide to keep one breast even though you became male again but you would very much like to take him up of his kind offer of sodomy but he needs to be prepared to take your dick or whats left of it too that will shut him the fuck up and stop harassing strangers over social media
creepyPMs,removed,oh my god i wish i hadnt seen that whatever you saw op must have been much much worse though its hard to imagine what could be worse than these photos
creepyPMs,removed,heres a thought homosexual pantywearing incest fellation enthusiast why not change your profile to gay instead of straight and you might have more luck finding someone you can deep throat i mean i am pretty sure the homosexual community have developed methods to meet these people so you dont have to creep on girls i believe one such method is grindr christ
creepyPMs,removed,really dig his belly
creepyPMs,removed,they always do and they wonder why these types of guys are so persistent
creepyPMs,removed,continuing to talk to him is sending the message you want more dick pics
creepyPMs,removed,i highly doubt hell learn his lesson
creepyPMs,removed,how is that creepy its not even cringe
creepyPMs,removed,ill fight you fight me 😠
creepyPMs,removed,seems like gay men are harder to creep out than women
creepyPMs,removed,he found someone who wanted to do something stupid and impulsive just get a dog
creepyPMs,removed,i agree i think a lot of people are just instantly rude in hopes of having some content to post online somewhere but look this guy was wicked polite about it and he still got some creepycringeworthy material to post be nicer people
creepyPMs,removed,im hoping im a sapiosexual was a joke either way guys really need to learn that size does not automatically mean pleasure if anything it means pain
creepyPMs,removed,okay maybe im being thick here but didnt he say right off the bat that if you said no hed leave you alone i know that isnt always the case its happened to us all but why didnt you even try saying nah man no pics
creepyPMs,removed,well he did ask nicely
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know what it is about foot fetish people
creepyPMs,removed,just block and move on wow that guy is such a neckbeard asshole for saying that s
creepyPMs,removed,maybe im an outlier here but instigating and participation in such a conversation doesnt necessarily qualify as a creepypm
creepyPMs,removed,what did you say that got this reaction
creepyPMs,removed,you both seem kinda dim
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,i found you creepier than the dude for actually speaking to him for so long lol
creepyPMs,removed,yeas i hang out a round a lot of shit people because i live on earth specifically in the usa a country defined by its commitment to patriarchy and misogyny thats a fact whether you want to believe it or not im done now bye
creepyPMs,removed,wtf are you talking about
creepyPMs,removed,more like rip your year old am i right
creepyPMs,removed,sorry to hear this no one deserves to be treated as awful as you did but one question why did you post there asking for trouble
creepyPMs,removed,im british and the amount of cunts in there shocked me thats almost at australian level
creepyPMs,removed,geez what did you do to this guy he seems like a nice chap if he is its way after a year i do not imagine he was that good in person normal people calm down after a while perhaps you dodged a bullet
creepyPMs,removed,thats a little racist
creepyPMs,removed,the truths out the bag yo time to stop being a self victimizing cont
creepyPMs,removed,there are lots of western men who treat women this way so there is no reason to assume they are nonwestern
creepyPMs,removed,and so sorry you had to block her on social media
creepyPMs,removed,is it just me or do other people infer things from girls who use the word homeslice
creepyPMs,removed,make a new account
creepyPMs,removed,hey man my username has been found out by a crazy ex girlfriend from about years ago recently and i just had to make a new account and delete my old one it fucking sucks but its necessary to keep myself sane the amount of usernames that girl went through to drive me crazy man almost admirable in dedication i just wanted to tell you that it was so worth it long term and i wish i did it sooner
creepyPMs,removed,why the attempt to hide your name erin its in yer freaking username
creepyPMs,removed,gee i wonder if the name you greened out is erin
creepyPMs,removed,ah muslims always so respectful of women
creepyPMs,removed,make a new account
creepyPMs,removed,taller shoes do you mean shoes with lefits so you can appear taller and decieve gals who may otherwise reject you for height
creepyPMs,removed,a lot of ageists around they tend to be people who consider themselves ultraliberal and progressive too youre free to prefer person of any age you like providing theyre legal
creepyPMs,removed,if youre trying to have sex with any underage child while being well over youre a pedophile im sorry that this is making you feel uncomfortable in your identity
creepyPMs,removed,i was gunna tell you frommy own experience dont drink and reddit then i saw it was craigslist what the hell else do you expect
creepyPMs,removed,as soon as i see the word mansplaining ik im in for some feminazi shit
creepyPMs,removed,i will get downvoted to hell but here is my story when i was a young man i had one pick up line i used it twice worked both times granted both ladies were friends of mine and were comfortable around me but there was no physical element before the line do you want to fuck simple as that nothing more nothing less i remember the surprised look on their faces once they realized i was serious i would never approach a stranger that way though
creepyPMs,removed,damn what an awesome response thankyou i was more focused on the delusional part i guess but you captured the bigger picture beautifully
creepyPMs,removed,she corrected his inability to type but missed out a word in her last message
creepyPMs,removed,why did you respond
creepyPMs,removed,why havent you banned me yet
creepyPMs,removed,any man who has to say hes got a thick incher is probably hung like a raisin and thats probably an insult to raisins
creepyPMs,removed,im ambivalent i just think ops post is nothing but a case study in impotent rage props for warning shots though
creepyPMs,removed,i feel like the word mansplaining is just as sexistoffensive as female hate the person not the gender
creepyPMs,removed,theyre always either or foreign or both
creepyPMs,removed,points for the star wars reference
creepyPMs,removed,hmmm i cant feel that natural creepiness from this one seems too staged i think its trolling not a very good one though
creepyPMs,removed,i mean theres girls with a thick incher if you know where to look
creepyPMs,removed,nothing is sexy about throwing a hotdog down a hallway
creepyPMs,removed,reasons i hate religion oppressive to women
creepyPMs,removed,so youre both as horrid as each other
creepyPMs,removed,after degrading me on my previous posts i pmed you to rate my new pics which you agreed to it shows this in the full convo you decided to comment on my posts on ramisexy nobody told you to if you have a problem with people pming you asking for rates maybe dont comment on that subreddit at all honey just accept the fact that you gave as good as you got you insulted my looks and called me a hookder before i said anything vicious if youre going to get all butt hurt then maybe dont insult people to begin with
creepyPMs,removed,this is a copypasta meme type thing people pass around different ones for each holiday with their friends
creepyPMs,removed,itt tons of liars who would have replied back in a heartbeat especially after op said she was
creepyPMs,removed,well thought out response
creepyPMs,removed,with all due respect you wasted way more time than i would have engaging with the troll lol did you ever find out who it was
creepyPMs,removed,this was pretty funny though lol
creepyPMs,removed,i now want to know what user this was
creepyPMs,removed,fake we all know its fake
creepyPMs,removed,it is the ramp up to a very old and stupid joke
creepyPMs,removed,dude you turned down the chance to fuck an year old i would have made her swear not to tell anyone and develop some sort of long term fwb situation
creepyPMs,removed,exactly this is textbook pedophile mental gymnastics if i were op i would probably out him so people know that hes like this beneath the surface and will keep their distance post this with his pic name fb profile and watch his friends list dry up
creepyPMs,removed,jesus what kind of advice did you give her
creepyPMs,removed,send her my number
creepyPMs,removed,dude smash that shit
creepyPMs,removed,that went from real quick yikes man especially a friends sister supercringe you just gotta say i dont think of you that way im sorry im here if you need help with schoolwork you arent navigating a minefield here tell her the truth and move along
creepyPMs,removed,are you not charging your phone overnight
creepyPMs,removed,it goes as follows if you woke up in the woods feeling if someone had done something to you would you tell anyone if the person says no you respond with wanna go on a date tonight if they say yes which is what a majority of people in my school said the joke is just ruined and no one laughs cause its stupid that being said i dont think it trivializes anything people who make that joke arent going to think sexual assault is any better or worse over it and this guy who made the comment is kind of stupid
creepyPMs,removed,bro what r u doing
creepyPMs,removed,tell her that you dont want her talking to you like that shes your little sister and youre not going to cross that line let her know if she pulls this shit again youre going to show it to her brother depending on her level of slut she will probably stop talking to you if the slut levels are high enough shell be excited by that
creepyPMs,removed,if you woke up in the middle of the woods with a condom in your ass would you tell anybody nevermind wanna go camping this weekend
creepyPMs,removed,i used to hear this joke in high school youre supposed to say it to another dude then when they say no as a reaction to the whole scenario without thinking you say good want to go camping this weekend super creepy as an opener thats a good friends joke at best
creepyPMs,removed,did you just assume his gender
creepyPMs,removed,lmfao that was hilarious
creepyPMs,removed,where do you get that ops creep had sex with a dog not seeing any reference to him doing that in his creepy pm
creepyPMs,removed,armpits cannot be gorgeous natural or otherwise armpits are gross
creepyPMs,removed,to quote a famous internet user hi its me ur brother
creepyPMs,removed,pretty sure he was painting his walls white while he was writing this fucking truecel
creepyPMs,removed,dude hit it your friend will understand
creepyPMs,removed,hey you dont know maybe theres a cock in there that got lorenad
creepyPMs,removed,want to go camping
creepyPMs,removed,lol
creepyPMs,removed,op fucked up a bit lol unless op can sleep within a couple seconds of lying down
creepyPMs,removed,lmfao
creepyPMs,removed,lol i know the guys is these texted are utterly hilarious and stupid the women who post these texts all seem tryhard seeking social validation
creepyPMs,removed,hahaha this guy is awesome 😂😂🤣
creepyPMs,removed,damn its been awhile since i read one of these stories used to see them everyday
creepyPMs,removed,it wont help at all because these people are likely in another country and this isnt big enough for the police to spend time on
creepyPMs,removed,wait why cant people tell the joke and also i dont see anywhere else where you explained why you didnt just a heads up not trying to be argumentative
creepyPMs,removed,so did you go for it
creepyPMs,removed,and men wonder why everyone hates them
creepyPMs,removed,the part where you said to discuss the rules that part which i pointed out three times now again use the modmail to discuss the rules there thats the part right there
creepyPMs,removed,reminds me of the he just said his name was hugh mungus then the lady says what the fuck
creepyPMs,removed,how much would it pay though
creepyPMs,removed,thats cruel and now he thinks hes creepy not what he said shame on you cunt
creepyPMs,removed,but in the abstract do you
creepyPMs,removed,so what i understand from this is you made a politically incorrect joke about overweight people he is offended demands you to take it down you tell him no it was just a joke in a thread about voicing unpopular opinions of any nature you said no that is not how it works because you have freedom of speech he equates you to be a nazi when the word he is supposed to use is fascist even though that isnt true in this case either the human brain confuses me sometimes this guy doesnt know how this works he doesnt know how anything works
creepyPMs,removed,seems fine tbh i think the definition of creepy has become too broad on this sub literally anything involving someone asking for a sexual favor shouldnt be the only criteria take this one for example he owned up to being a dude at the very start made a suggestion got rejected accepted the rejection and move on whats the creepy part here people seriously
creepyPMs,removed,you dont understand the first thing about what sexism is or looks like you dont understand female oppression or how power and privilege works so yeah you have no leg to stand on here
creepyPMs,removed,thats why they have the block option block him then report him
creepyPMs,removed,i never fully understood this reason for not saying blockreport sure its empty advice but whenever i get creepy or weird messages i just blockreport and move on i dont even consider screenshotting it and posting online or think of some witty response to use to sound clever but maybe thats due to not over thinking these annoying but pitiful isssues
creepyPMs,removed,namely that no matter what you thought of its likely that someone else did too there is no need to say something like block then report its plainly insulting not op but yourself but whats wrong with that advice i do it all the time edit hopefully this is safe to write or is this too borderline
creepyPMs,removed,yes i read them but talking about them is off topic and well i ll just do what it says and keep a civil tongue
creepyPMs,removed,so the dictionary definition of woman is transphobic by that logic if you think that then youre just appropriating words then getting offended when people dont follow your definition
creepyPMs,removed,are you serious
creepyPMs,removed,rule of thumbif he has to brag about how great his dick is its probably not all that great it probably resembles a
creepyPMs,removed,stalking is different from harrassment harrassment should be dealt with somehow imo but stalking as a blanket and general term is harmless upto the point when the person actually contacts whomever they stalkthe people in their lives
creepyPMs,removed,india and many south east asian countries yes it does
creepyPMs,removed,i cant tell which one is the creep
creepyPMs,removed,in his defense guys dont care if the girl is super hot they just want nudes from or so dont get a big head op
creepyPMs,removed,he said southeast asia
creepyPMs,removed,this was one of my first thought along with why he would take pics of it with a huge bush and how crooked it is
creepyPMs,removed,i dont get it why didnt op just block him
creepyPMs,removed,pretty sure this guy is joking
creepyPMs,removed,lol nah i didnt read the rules my bad
creepyPMs,removed,i apologize its kaitlyn rose so do you live in upstate ny lol if so hi its jeffs old roomate
creepyPMs,removed,i had a tinderella try something like this with me once but she was hot and im a man so it worked such is life
creepyPMs,removed,if someone is stupid or arrogant enough to send a dick pic with their face in it then they deserve to be exposed what the actual fuck
creepyPMs,removed,are there supposed to be more than two pictures they seem odd but not really malicious or anything
creepyPMs,removed,yeah the girl is jewish go figure are you jewish ujewdank is another jewish girl
creepyPMs,removed,i know i was just messing with you i am really sorry for bothering you
creepyPMs,removed,thank you i still feel guilty about it though i hope that you will be able to fall asleep soon what is the clock over there
creepyPMs,removed,you mean my username sorry about that i just really love your body and from your history i like your personality too i am really sorry if i annoyed you i just hope that you will have a good night sleep i am so sorry for all of this
creepyPMs,removed,what is the context how did it make him hard
creepyPMs,removed,is that you
creepyPMs,removed,thank you so much i am just always scared to come of as creepy i am sorry thank you for answering
creepyPMs,removed,see she said that it was all right i am sorry i just want to know why she blocked me i am really sorry i just cant find a single reason why she would block me i am extremely sorry please just let me know why
creepyPMs,removed,these are terrible
creepyPMs,removed,yes stay silent a creep like that will have an even creepier response to any of those questions its like they were trying to set op up to get harassed
creepyPMs,removed,unsubbing instead
creepyPMs,removed,this is a very unhappy man like what could have caused this amount of rage and anger also hes clearly at least a little bit attracted with you is he honestly stalked your feed edit at first i thought he called you a flashlight which doesnt make any sense but he actually put fleshlight which apparently is some type of masturbation toy so the fact that he knows what that is probably means that he lives a very unfulfilling life xd
creepyPMs,removed,you sure know to pick them if your not into relationships and want to have a fling im down pm ill fly you to ny
creepyPMs,removed,you have a super low standard for creepy this was lame
creepyPMs,removed,just yesterday you told a girl on the same subreddit that she looks like a lowend prostitute whats with the hypocrisy
creepyPMs,removed,exactly thats not the place to get honest opinions of any kind or shape that would actually help you figure out anything that subreddit is pretty much
creepyPMs,removed,he couldve been trying to get the op to tell him that would be really painful because some guys get off on the idea of sex being painful for women not all these guys are trying to get laid some just have a fetish to satisfy and painful porn style sex is a pretty common one
creepyPMs,removed,i can tell you from first hand experience this does work on some sites girls post ads where they give minimum requirements like or dont bother obivously everyone exaggerrates so if you say then hopefully the small one you can get would be but even when it isnt explicitly stated there have been plenty of times when you make a sutble hint or two about being hung and then the girl always wants to see it and then usually her whole tone changes lol
creepyPMs,removed,you could be that type of special
creepyPMs,removed,na you didnt have to it was really unnecessary actually you cranked it to also there was a chance he didnt know that rape was a thing yet so you could have enabled him
creepyPMs,removed,because even woman find it okay to offer stuff like this ive had offers myself some woman see sex as currency unfortunately shame
creepyPMs,removed,if they didnt catch it its on them s
creepyPMs,removed,this seems more your fault honestly i dont have creepy conversations bc i never let them go far you kept messaging and messaging as if they wont reply to you and keep going might be creepy but honestly you just look stupid why engage honestly why
creepyPMs,removed,wtf dude if some random person send you a dick pic you dont reply this is irl equivalent of walking out of the house in a horror movie
creepyPMs,removed,honestly the latin sounded like riamverysmart but good post nonetheless
creepyPMs,removed,well the first half was genuine the second half was sarcastic is there a s
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt even know that was an actual sub but of course it is im sure youre an attractive individual but do you really need confirmation from unknown creepy redditors like why are people actively commenting on the thread anyway other then to be creepy and either hurt peoples feelings or tell you they want to fuck you what he said to you is inexcusable and disgusting but bruh come on why post for confirmation of your attractiveness and be surprised when shit like this happens
creepyPMs,removed,would you do that please
creepyPMs,removed,this doesnt belong in niceguys this is just a person trying hard to interact with a bitch
creepyPMs,removed,hell id do it
creepyPMs,removed,lol chicks know when they are just like this one
creepyPMs,removed,why the sarcastic title then
creepyPMs,removed,dang send him to me ill do it for a few shitty pictures i need new clothes
creepyPMs,removed,amazing how this is the only comment calling it out this thread is unreal op obviously knows shes attractive and putting down assholes by stooping to their level shouldnt really be the way to go about this this is rcringepics material from all angles maybe rniceguys if you count the comments
creepyPMs,removed,rquityourbullshit
creepyPMs,removed,nice eyes also nice being on r all good job sorta bruised your history for some reason and i was seeing a ton of creepy pm submissions so i was wondering what was up with that until i saw your bdsm post snuggled into the mix of omg awkward posts so now sort of have to ask why do you seek out and manipulate socially fucked up people then manipulate the conversations to make it reddit worthy according to your bdsm post youre a sub due to a former coworker your behavior isnt lining up i also have to call foul because even if these people are acting really fucked up what they dont know is youre manipulating them to draw out their worst behavior with no regard or remorse for what may happen in their life after experiencing your fraudulent conversation its just internet points stop taking it so seriously also thats a really cool ass dog im jealous
creepyPMs,removed,he just wants to trade thongs wheres the harm
creepyPMs,removed,at this point it seems as though you get off on lecturing losers while putting yourself on a pedestal its obvious people like this arent ever going to listen yet you still waste your time trying to reason with them the subtle attachment of your pictures suggest youre seeking some kind of approval and fishing for compliments nothing really wrong with doing that though but dont pretend that youre so much above these people you expose
creepyPMs,removed,if my gf wanted to do it for new clothes or lingerie id say go ahead
creepyPMs,removed,man he had some good ones but then again you had some good ones too hm id have to say you won though question is it really worth it to even go back and forth with these degenerates like besides having material for this sub after the first message what stops you from just straight up blocking them
creepyPMs,removed,sex addiction is a real issue and you wanna clog up their lines with creep calls not really very cool
creepyPMs,removed,my kind of bot if you ask me
creepyPMs,removed,your deflated perception of yourself isnt the problem its your attitude towards these creeps just think about it they are assholes and creepy by default obviously something went wrong for them somewhere for them to act the way they do then you come along and instead of taking the high road and ending the conversation you decide to shit on the guy to accomplish what exactly maybe to teach him a lesson not going to happen if he hasnt figured out his unacceptable behavior on his own or through someone else youre not going to enlighten him to it now in his mind he won anyways maybe to get a laugh out of it if being an ass to another person is your kind of a good time youre being a bully whether he deserves it or not being a bully doesnt make you look much better than the creep considering your history of low selfesteem maybe to empower and make you feel better about yourself theres definitely ways to go about that other than stepping on unpleasant peoples egos just ignore the guy stop playing into his crap and stop being crappy yourself over a supposedly selfrighteous cause
creepyPMs,removed,yeah if you do this at least balance it out by donating to them
creepyPMs,removed,uhhhh ok lol
creepyPMs,removed,ya i hear ya ive had a few that piss me off but i think it maybe gets maybe texts in and im like yeeeeeaaaa block i guess im no fun lol swear i feel bad for yall cause i know that shit must happen on the regular
creepyPMs,removed,jesus dude ok
creepyPMs,removed,he shouldve asked for a pic to prove youre lying
creepyPMs,removed,the guy is completely normal
creepyPMs,removed,you were being so rude right away for no reason if you werent interested him why bother replying to just be a bitch sure he turned out to be gross but you didnt know that right away
creepyPMs,removed,have to disagree you were being a huge cunt you are being an even bigger cunt by posting that trying to embarrass him notice how not one comment in here agrees that he did anything wrong
creepyPMs,removed,that was more baffling than creepy
creepyPMs,removed,really
creepyPMs,removed,if you werent interested in any type of interaction from the beginning then why even respond
creepyPMs,removed,id do it just for the free outfits girl if hes willing to pay you and give you free clothes for anonymous pictures send him my way
creepyPMs,removed,douche dude cringy girl good stuff
creepyPMs,removed,too late
creepyPMs,removed,allow
creepyPMs,removed,take the deal
creepyPMs,removed,hey thats not nice you made me look
creepyPMs,removed,uuh source
creepyPMs,removed,well that was a bit rude on your part honestly
creepyPMs,removed,what excuse i didnt say anything about him
creepyPMs,removed,trawling for ladies with daddy issues
creepyPMs,removed,jesus it was obviously a joke in response to your pms calm down with the ban hammer
creepyPMs,removed,he doesnt seem creepy it seems like you wanted an excuse to give someone shit
creepyPMs,removed,yeah but when i politely start a conversation with hey baby what gets your kitty dripping so i can use that knowledge to give you an hour orgasm with my throbbing cocksickle im considered a creep too see its an unwinnable situation cant start off with sex story cant start off with asking about your sex fantasies females literally leave us with no options
creepyPMs,removed,maybe its his kink calling him creepy is in direct contravention of no bodyshaming or kinkshaming under rule of this sub
creepyPMs,removed,when the creeps intelligence starts regressing into retardation from all the rejections
creepyPMs,removed,this is not a knock on you op but i see this every all the time and im mainly curious more than anything else i dont get why people always have to add the say hi to reddit line or something along those lines i always feel like that makes the post even cringier it just makes me cringe at your side of the post too yeah the guy was an idiot but do you have to announce that youre posting it on here what do you guys think the guys gonna go oh no reddit better change my ways
creepyPMs,removed,that was one cock pic
creepyPMs,removed,yeah im about as lost as the creep
creepyPMs,removed,i thought it was just anonguy making a joke not genuinely into beastiality i feel like this was blown out of proportion lol
creepyPMs,removed,thats not really racist all he said was that he isnt in to minorities
creepyPMs,removed,wait he doesnt want to see pictures of girls tits this has to be a first
creepyPMs,removed,you seem like a lovely human wait
creepyPMs,removed,so youre on a dating website but youre not looking to date right now
creepyPMs,removed,wait really what part does it violate
creepyPMs,removed,mmm i want a farty mcslagbag like u princess
creepyPMs,removed,this actually does work if the girl is interested in that some people are only on this site to fuck ive met plenty of girls who got straight to the point like this and because it was mutual it was just fine
creepyPMs,removed,men are a majority in power not a marginalized group systemic oppression cant exist against an authoritative body
creepyPMs,removed,he just wants to serenade you lol he would probably stop blasting messages if you either a block him or btell him you arent interested
creepyPMs,removed,shoulda known this sub would have triggered fems
creepyPMs,removed,uh how is this a creepy pm
creepyPMs,removed,heh kind of funny but doesnt really belong here though
creepyPMs,removed,yeah op hates men
creepyPMs,removed,thats because they measure using one of these p
creepyPMs,removed,lol any guy with aint gonna be shamed no matter what you say
creepyPMs,removed,the mods of this sub are probably the most shit of any sub since punchable faces they probably all have pretty punchable faces too
creepyPMs,removed,when you measure a penis you start at the asshole then go a few inches past the tip
creepyPMs,removed,a its a site wide rule that using alts to circumvent bans from subs will get you banned from reddit in general great to hear a mod suggesting this but maybe thats your goal b does the fact that you just pointed out part of the reason this is a broken system not even give you a pause it seems to me that this preemptive strike thing is an excuse not to actually moderate at all they might be problems in the future better take care of them now which ironically is usually looked down by society at large especially in historical context
creepyPMs,removed,i believe this my my first interaction with the lad there is a lot more but i dont want to violate the rules by posting his personal reddit account even if he is a troll
creepyPMs,removed,just to be clear you posted to a sub titled am i ugly and are surprised by the fact you got inappropriate comments in return
creepyPMs,removed,no its because theyre getting banned for posting in other subs unrelated to this one
creepyPMs,removed,your language is childish and vulgar worse than his but you get off cz youre a roastie oh well
creepyPMs,removed,why were the majority of these people banned just wondering
creepyPMs,removed,i put you in my mouth nope nope nope nopeville thats some kind of fetish til but i didnt want to sorry other people are disgusting op
creepyPMs,removed,wtf is the deal with dudes and wanting to be shrunk lately what kind of messed up kink is this holy shit
creepyPMs,removed,i now have cancer
creepyPMs,removed,a sub with over subscribers and only answered your survey haha jesus have fun with your echo chamber
creepyPMs,removed,chizme op is she by any chance a ghetto latina
creepyPMs,removed,im sorry but this is fucking hilarious
creepyPMs,removed,i browsed ops post history apparently theres been years of antagonism between op and the poster
creepyPMs,removed,you do understand this is inappropriate and uncomfortable right please dont contact me again boom then post her response
creepyPMs,removed,gotta reel in that link karma
creepyPMs,removed,triggered
creepyPMs,removed,the difference between me and this guy is that he says it while i just think it really hard
creepyPMs,removed,why not just block the number
creepyPMs,removed,dont be modest op you dog you
creepyPMs,removed,thats my boy
creepyPMs,removed,thats me hi doggie
creepyPMs,removed,this is ridiculous
creepyPMs,removed,yeah thats a really dumb rule people could easily enjoy both subs
creepyPMs,removed,say hi to reddit is just as cringey as anything he said
creepyPMs,removed,you have a chance of organising a threesome with this person
creepyPMs,removed,is this how people talk now can we remove them from the gene pool
creepyPMs,removed,this is pretty stupid
creepyPMs,removed,obviously this dude is off his rocker but the whole say hi to reddit thing is a little cringe inducing in itself
creepyPMs,removed,which ones the creep
creepyPMs,removed,reality check you dont get to choose who masturbates to your pictures once you put them online goes for both men and women you can be not okay with him telling you that but you cant make him not masturbate
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair it would have been much easier to just block him or not respond rather than continuing this back and forth eh i suppose you got to get material for that sweet sweet karma though
creepyPMs,removed,wow arent you autistic
creepyPMs,removed,shudders that was such a creepy pm
creepyPMs,removed,shudders that was such a creepy pm
creepyPMs,removed,shudders that was such a creepy pm
creepyPMs,removed,shudders that was such a creepy pm
creepyPMs,removed,thats what being educated in gender studies will get ya
creepyPMs,removed,some dumb young twat who gives a shit
creepyPMs,removed,crush i think theyre fucking dude
creepyPMs,removed,according to
creepyPMs,removed,wow op is insanely rude for no reason
creepyPMs,removed,when you get turned into a fucking lampshade or a nice carry on suitcase its gonna be your fault then
creepyPMs,removed,no there was no reason to be rude to him he was just asking for a legit opinion and op took it upon theirself to insult him so immature
creepyPMs,removed,so seems like a lot of people disagree with it then
creepyPMs,removed,this sub is shit been on reddit for over years and you mods are absolute pieces of sjw shit eat a bag of cocks
creepyPMs,removed,and to think hes probably just trying to make you laugh guys without experience with females are cureeepyyyyy right op
creepyPMs,removed,not seeing how this is creepy
creepyPMs,removed,what is creepy about this all i see is someone joking
creepyPMs,removed,im confused as to how theres rules against being rude about people yet every post here is to make fun of someone who is being a creep and the fact that people get banned for merely showing face in certain subs its not as if this sub is a safe place or anything ive spent quite some time here out of curiosity and i dont get why these rules are in place its not a bad sub but it isnt some shining gem in the sea of all the subs on reddit
creepyPMs,removed,this bot is retarded
creepyPMs,removed,wheres the underwear pic
creepyPMs,removed,you are such a cunt
creepyPMs,removed,if i didnt know any better i would think this would be a creepy satire of the marine what did you say to me you little bitch viral rant
creepyPMs,removed,why didnt you just block him after he kept messaging you instead of repeatedly telling him to fuck off
creepyPMs,removed,so you guys auto ban thousands of people for viewing a thread that pops up on the front page of reddit that seems oppressive i am relitivly new to reddit and browse the new and hot thread list alot it seems crazy to me that there are just giant groups of people who say they want to change things and are against discrimination then turn around and discriminate against huge numbers of people for reading a post in an unrelated sub that they may not even frequent that is literally hypocrisy
creepyPMs,removed,seriously thats the last straw with this subreddit then see ya
creepyPMs,removed,and thats probably exactly why its dumb you know what thats called thats called a binary system that forces oppression on users based on subreddit discrimination you know thats like shooting people because theyre black you racist
creepyPMs,removed,because its a random message telling them theyre banned from a place they might have had nothing to do with the start of the interaction is negative so why would they want to rise above that its really not different from receiving a random hey fuck you message in your inbox
creepyPMs,removed,apparently the mods feel the solution is to make people choose this sub or that sub and never the twain shall meet surely isolation is the cure to toxicity right im of the opinion that the best disinfectant is sunlight but ill probably be banned from this sub for not agreeing with autobanning thousands of people for blanket perceived ideological reasons
creepyPMs,removed,you wouldnt do very well on tinder pun game is awful
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand why youre getting downvoted
creepyPMs,removed,ha ok you win devils advocate get you killed quicker than a bullet around here
creepyPMs,removed,you may be in the wrong sub
creepyPMs,removed,oh god just block me now
creepyPMs,removed,hey o
creepyPMs,removed,just be stern and flat out friend zone him sorry dude no stop sending me that crap you arent directly telling him no and i know from experience that men are bad at taking hints
creepyPMs,removed,well ive deleted my first post as i couldnt be bothered with any more responses i cant possibly see how you can have taken that in any way other than my recommending a person make their online profiles more private the op literally shows that doing so is necessary
creepyPMs,removed,i agree that this is creepy and inappropriate but has she told him no and he persists
creepyPMs,removed,why cant the option be that he no longer makes advances once she doesntdidnt respond youre assuming everyone is a stalker shes legal age too
creepyPMs,removed,jesus christ i forgot how insane the mods were here unsubbed just terrible its genuinely helpful advice not victim blaming you touchy tosser
creepyPMs,removed,well he basically said you wanna fuck you said no and he said fair enough
creepyPMs,removed,you couldve just replied no and never op
creepyPMs,removed,you know honestly it seems like hes trying to be as respectful as he can maybe he knows hes creepy because he appears to be aware of the fact that he doesnt have a chance my hunch is that if your sister told him she wasnt interested he would probably apologize and never try it again
creepyPMs,removed,so were clear i agree with op but if he is harassing her then his actions go beyond creepy into criminal
creepyPMs,removed,get his ass fired
creepyPMs,removed,what are you doing man why would op refer to this supposed female as man i think op is a fucking liar
creepyPMs,removed,rchoosingbeggars
creepyPMs,removed,how the fuck is this scary fucking pussies
creepyPMs,removed,she must be so hot to be that crazy
creepyPMs,removed,whats the problem here exactly he sent her a message seeing if she was interested whats the big deal
creepyPMs,removed,lol are you gay or something
creepyPMs,removed,girls like like are good to keep around
creepyPMs,removed,this seems too over the top to be at all believable seems fake
creepyPMs,removed,is she attractive at least
creepyPMs,removed,her entire dialogue screams daddy issues so cringey would block
creepyPMs,removed,i would have been arrested for reckless driving if a girl was talking to me like that
creepyPMs,removed,sorry op but yourr a fucking faggot that chick is everything i want in a girl girls who want sex and are fun like that are rare youre an idiot op serious
creepyPMs,removed,weird i wonder how he got her name
creepyPMs,removed,oh you know my cousin mungo my bad his dad named because he forgot to put on a condom
creepyPMs,removed,wow thats amazingive never had a woman pursue my dick like that
creepyPMs,removed,i mean to her credit if his gf isnt into anal shes probably not gf material anyway
creepyPMs,removed,did you delete all of your comments in the message thread or did he just talk as if you were responding
creepyPMs,removed,what was the original comment
creepyPMs,removed,thats so over the top it makes me think her little brother found her phone and was fucking with you if not then wow
creepyPMs,removed,are you in the nba or something ha ha
creepyPMs,removed,how old are you thats so weird shes asking all those personal questions and honestly i would have gone oh you dont smoke ok we should grab drinks sometime if you drink or appetizers or lunch sometime i wanna meet her too hope things are going well theres no reason to try to have sex omg
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt read this as condescending to be honest i had similar thoughts when reading your previous posts i almost think its worse to be doing all that considering you actually are a doctor
creepyPMs,removed,couldve blocked him
creepyPMs,removed,someone please elaborate is it just that i am missing out something or am i just too naive to notice the creeping here i mean you couldve been joking around or something did the creep say something before please i feel a little silly now haha
creepyPMs,removed,as much as i would say no id still have a really awkward boner after that
creepyPMs,removed,lets have an open discussion here since im sure you posted this in reply to my comment ops submission contains the creeps name very clearly large barelysensored images several small px uncensored images my comment contained a generic screenshot of facebook containing nothing personally identifying about tiny px uncensored images enlarged to show texture this is ops image you can see this right in your browser if you zoom in like this dont even need to enhance the contrast thats how i found the guy my tiny images were numerous but were complete unrecognizable compared to ops why did you remove my comment but not ops post what exactly did i do wrong if ops post is fine
creepyPMs,removed,thank you for the reasonable reply i got you mixed up with the other mod who i conversed with last night since its two days old just remove it the discussions done everyone had their laugh dont let people mining the archived data find it even years from now
creepyPMs,removed,paternity scam if im not on the pill was intentional
creepyPMs,removed,isnt mansplaining kind of a sexist term im new to all the shit
creepyPMs,removed,yeah but can a woman mansplain honestly people often asume that they are smarter than someone and just rant about a topic kinda dumb to only label it on men
creepyPMs,removed,ehh sure but ill stick to he is being an asshole
creepyPMs,removed,sounds good but the girl didnt post this for support the brother comes in long after fact to post on creepypms fb is probably the most common way i see ppl contact anyone new else here and makes sense the age difference is most creepy for me not that he asked he out basically i get parcels both at door or back door depending on sizes ive seen more and more non creepy pms here of basically approaching a girl to ask her out stamped as creepy
creepyPMs,removed,i see it more like saying teach men not to rape is sexist
creepyPMs,removed,ok ill unsubscribe from this sub then and stick with rcringepics instead thanks
creepyPMs,removed,uh to me it just looks like we need a society without fucking little gnomes making rape culture the explanation would need a lot more work sure this guy is entitled and dehumanizing but there are million people in the usa and billion in the world there might always be a monster here and there
creepyPMs,removed,i guess reading these creepypms posts has recalibrated me a bit this is like minor leagues creepy but yeah i guess that dude is being a creeper now if he still persisted
creepyPMs,removed,sell him someone elses nudes
creepyPMs,removed,im not projecting anything im just not allowing you to tell a half truth to be a victim and have a self pity party parade created online for you when you choose to not acknowledge the part you played in this crazy co workers life clearly im just a triggered troll though careful im psychotic and mentally unstable wouldnt wanna go on a mass shotting spree at your job
creepyPMs,removed,idk i dont think he seemed creepy just kinda awkward
creepyPMs,removed,these posts just scream mental health issues these big long elaborate stories that certainly didnt happen in the context they are given and probably didnt happen at all by that i mean the content of the creepy pm not the post itself
creepyPMs,removed,in the way i understand that sentence i come across it regularly in the subreddits i frequent its refers to how many women are driven by their emotions and how theyll leave their boyfriend as soon as she doesnt feel anything for him anymore and will then move on to a new guy who makes her feel something that said your friend seems surprisingly low on social skills with no sense of the social context he finds himself in
creepyPMs,removed,hes just sharing with mans best friend
creepyPMs,removed,this guy peanut butters
creepyPMs,removed,seriously i thought furries were the lowest on the totem pole but now foxgirl doesnt seem so bad
creepyPMs,removed,definitely not a good opener but really nobody wants an std or stds
creepyPMs,removed,man girls get all the fun pms i never get sent anything fun
creepyPMs,removed,use protection u idiot
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt even a creepy pm wtf is with this subreddit
creepyPMs,removed,he didnt seem to be that bad of a guy tbh
creepyPMs,removed,wait so whats wrong with his message
creepyPMs,removed,its perfectly normal to ask someone if they have stds am i missing something
creepyPMs,removed,where i live its uncommon to have stds which means that people are looked down on because of a disease its also perfectly normal to ask someone if they have stds just because it can be an issue on the long run
creepyPMs,removed,ugh its men like this that make us look bad
creepyPMs,removed,he seems like an okay guy honestly
creepyPMs,removed,normal one minute crazy the next
creepyPMs,removed,sometimes i forget how far people can look into someones post history
creepyPMs,removed,you just reply stop was it really that repulsive lol
creepyPMs,removed,command not recognized trumpfact™ did you know that blacks kill up to of all white homicide victims
creepyPMs,removed,it doesnt say to say no if you dont want them so i assume the facepalm is the person responding no
creepyPMs,removed,this banbot sucks
creepyPMs,removed,id say el james should be flogged for that fucking book but shed probably just get off on it anyway
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt really creepy it doesnt tell you to say no to unsubscribe just ignore the message if you dont want to subscribe its not going to keep pestering you over reaction imho
creepyPMs,removed,this is an automated message not a creepy pm
creepyPMs,removed,sorry i didnt realize this was rfunny
creepyPMs,removed,thats what my phone said too but i told it to fuck off
creepyPMs,removed,i love how this illustrates how most of the people with top posts here dont understandwant to think that not responding at all is an option
creepyPMs,removed,i dont care for trump but his wasnt creepy just dont respond it only replied when you typed no repeatedly
creepyPMs,removed,this looks fake
creepyPMs,removed,nah mate
creepyPMs,removed,what a rude little person if hes bothered about life why is he on the first place spamming the sub reddit to their everyone view hes just a attention whore and probably a retard too
creepyPMs,removed,do only men use petnames and sad stories i do understand that creepy dudes often pretend to be women but those are some really silly reasons to assume thats whats happening
creepyPMs,removed,tbd have you seen his daughter
creepyPMs,removed,whats the creepy part here
creepyPMs,removed,drink bleach lolol
creepyPMs,removed,i want to say seb didnt do anything creepy inappropriate bizarre awkward or offensive he might need to work on his english but thats neither here nor there honestly i think this girl or boy whatever overreacted to a simple comment but after reading the rules it seems im not allowed to have a different opinion from the op i guess ill find out soon enough
creepyPMs,removed,why is saying whats up gorgeous a weird thing
creepyPMs,removed,why do these tinder messages always get put here tinder is an app for hooking up in the context of the encounter not at all creepy
creepyPMs,removed,why do these tinder messages always get put here tinder is an app for hooking up in the context of the encounter not at all creepy
creepyPMs,removed,its astounding how many people post pictures on stuff like gw and are surprised when they get messages from creepy socially retarded people
creepyPMs,removed,this is at least more clever than the propositions ive gotten i would love to just put on my profile im open to casual sex but it comes across as treat me as a piece of meat i need someone im interested in talking to and we click on some level let me take you out on a date first and go from there yet somehow they think these messages are ok
creepyPMs,removed,eh i dont think this ones that bad he more or less accepted it when you made it clear you werent interested
creepyPMs,removed,man jeez so many downvotes what in the world no need to be negative also
creepyPMs,removed,tldr op im taken and not a prostitute him yeah sure whatever how much and those boobs tho
creepyPMs,removed,why did you file a police report i dont see anything here to warrant that
creepyPMs,removed,the guy did nothing wrong aside from seeming weird and desperate
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know the full context to this but it seems like some sort of dating site where a guy has expressed an interest in you albeit a slightly weird one and when you made it clear you werent interested he accepted it and backed off wouldnt necessarily say thats creepy
creepyPMs,removed,i do agree with that but still the op seems a bit highstrung
creepyPMs,removed,what app are you chatting on cuz to me it seems like he isnt really doing anything to you other than the proposition and youre the one trying to antagonize him for the internet points
creepyPMs,removed,okay lets see it took you two days to respond you my last comment posting rules like i cant read one of which starts that rude out of line comments will probably be deleted yet my comment remains yet you havent deleted my comment or banned me from this sub so you are just shit talking with idle thats once again my friend get the fuck off it asshole
creepyPMs,removed,oh yeah this man would like that tooactually no i am never saying that the element of surprise might not be as pleasant as imagined its text though you have a bit of thinking time why is this the best that anyone can do funny crying emoji
creepyPMs,removed,yeah he was being a creep but i think you were quite rude to him calling him brain damaged a dumbfuck etc a bit unnecessary
creepyPMs,removed,i think you misunderstood him he just meant that its illegal if a man doesnt want it too hes just socially disabled
creepyPMs,removed,send the biggest blackest dick back i had a friend who would do that to creeps that spammed her
creepyPMs,removed,seems like english isnt his first language so maybe such exchanges are completely legal where he comes from either way theres always a price point the question is just how many zeros are involved a creeper like this isnt getting anywhere but for a legitimate offer of say million youd have to at least think about it right at million id entertain the idea you missed an opportunity to troll him here
creepyPMs,removed,call me crazy but i dont think this is creepy by itself
creepyPMs,removed,did it work
creepyPMs,removed,lpt they are never ever the cute one if you see a picture with more than one dude first ask yourself if youd fuck any of them if no swipe left if yes swipe left because its not the guy whose profile it is
creepyPMs,removed,i do get slightly annoyed when i see girls saying no because i have a bfgf because it gives creeps the impression that she would be up for it if single therefore all single women are fair game we need to get in the habit of not mentioning our partners and letting creeps know were not interested regardless of our relationship status
creepyPMs,removed,i just dont get why op would even entertain the fool for so long i wouldve peaced on that conversation after a couple sentences i guess it makes good fodder for this sub
creepyPMs,removed,i mean this a little corny but is it really creepy
creepyPMs,removed,lets be honest here for a minute is this creepy or just normal depending on previous relationship and how breakup was maybe he had a legit reason to hope and every guy hopes for that one like it or not he came on kinda strong though so i will give it that
creepyPMs,removed,cant really fault this dude i have been there its a sort of cycling for lack of better term that some guys do odds are he recently got out of a relationship he sees his faults in that relationship andor she did to him what he did to you so he probably needed to clear things up with you way more for himself than you but thats my assessment of this randomness source used to be a real dipshit in relationships
creepyPMs,removed,nice shoes ur cute
creepyPMs,removed,this is a joke this is absolutely somebody trying to get a rise outta you
creepyPMs,removed,he has a point hes just rude about it looking at your posts you seem promiscuous christus is forgiving not an adjudicator
creepyPMs,removed,bitches love canons
creepyPMs,removed,hey bby u want sum grocrs
creepyPMs,removed,why even entertain something like that i mean really after he said he was that convo shouldve been over
creepyPMs,removed,so when i post on ramiugly im pretty much going to expect something like this
creepyPMs,removed,you shared a pic with him i would have just stopped messaging and moved on
creepyPMs,removed,getting one side of a backstory and immediately the guy is a creep you must be a keeper
creepyPMs,removed,well hes definitely a dick but you do say some pretty remarkably shitty and racist things
creepyPMs,removed,did you know that turtles can fly long distances when enough thrust is applied
creepyPMs,removed,who has unread messages on their phone
creepyPMs,removed,i used to fuck year olds and ive used the age number line countless times the irony is that if the broad doesnt care about your age and you dont care about her age then it really is just a number
creepyPMs,removed,tldr broad shacks up with psycho feeds the psycho by responding does not cut off communication andor buy a firearm typical drama
creepyPMs,removed,using the tragedy to get in her pants eh cunning strategy
creepyPMs,removed,lol i fell asleep and i have no idea if they just dropped it all of a sudden
creepyPMs,removed,everyone knows casey if you do degrees
creepyPMs,removed,yeah thats more than creepy post their number here
creepyPMs,removed,and op naively belives that girl was telling the truth saying she didnt sent any of those messages
creepyPMs,removed,i would have blocked it from the first instance
creepyPMs,removed,probably someone who wants her family arrested and needs to make some fake evidence
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair no matter how creepy a compliment its not negging
creepyPMs,removed,in my defense i have not finished my coffee
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know hes a creepy motherfucker thats for damned sure but assuming someone is going to neg is kind of silly
creepyPMs,removed,me too except no one creeps on me because no one wants me
creepyPMs,removed,shiiiiiit ill take the money
creepyPMs,removed,and this is negging p
creepyPMs,removed,cause hes a cunt who doesnt give a shot obviously
creepyPMs,removed,again i dont think he gives a shit maybe he was bored some people have no sympathy or empathy
creepyPMs,removed,so creepypms is about poking fun at furry icons now
creepyPMs,removed,proud feminist fucking vomit
creepyPMs,removed,no a realist who has seen this and lived it many many times you simply cannot feed people like this that only encourages them unfortunately the only two avenues are to call the person on their shit potentially getting law enforcement involved etc or simply ignore them all together the problem is that they are either the type of stalkerish personality that will snap and hurt you or the type that is really insecure at heart and will back off after much bitching and drama its not a pretty situation and its frustrating to hear yet another person being caught in this type of situation
creepyPMs,removed,maybe this guy lacks tact and charm but i dont think this is creepy
creepyPMs,removed,really theyre going to blackmail you and how do they actually plan on sending those pictures to your parents or friends when they dont know who you are the dude with the pink color you used to cover up the informationwhat a fucking piece of shit cocksucking nonothing asswipe really i understand hes trying to get at you psychologically by emotionally and mentally attacking you but what a waste of shit for even trying that especially since hes clearly trying hard at trying to get you to break down and do as he says blackmailreally considering how you responded youd think that these dumb fucks would stop trying to get you to send nudes considering that you obviously wont send them anything and i also assume that your friends and family know about what you do so its not like posting those photos online will do anything as a kik user myself im ashamed that people like this exist on kik
creepyPMs,removed,pls send nudes
creepyPMs,removed,wax n blood sounds delicious
creepyPMs,removed,nice guys are stupid all these beta males and omega males need to be cleansed from the earth
creepyPMs,removed,how the fuck you want it
creepyPMs,removed,wait so you get mad with guys who would have never gotten your nude of you never would have put them online in the first place the nerve
creepyPMs,removed,in hindsight maybe not be so loose with your body
creepyPMs,removed,seriously im sure your nudes are cool and all but if im going to blackmail someone its going to be for cash
creepyPMs,removed,his use of want instead of wont is actually triggering me
creepyPMs,removed,i think you both suck the guy is a creep and youre full of nerdy cringe
creepyPMs,removed,i dont get it you seem to be the douche in this conversation
creepyPMs,removed,no they fucked
creepyPMs,removed,u dont know who u sent nude pics to in and was it that many people that you cant narrow it down to potential suspects an ex lover seeking revenge think women think
creepyPMs,removed,well have they
creepyPMs,removed,this could have been easily ended if op would have said i dont want to text your number sorry or something along those lines op took it farther than it needed to go not to say the other person in the conversation was right in their attempts
creepyPMs,removed,yeah he could have definitely spared you that last line but overall this doesnt seem a creepy exchange to me
creepyPMs,removed,excuse my ignorance given the situation but you did seem kind of dickish
creepyPMs,removed,seems more cringe than creep
creepyPMs,removed,seems polite on both ends i dont get it
creepyPMs,removed,i dont mean to be a dick here but um rushing to this sub to post this polite exchange is honestly creepier than whats being said in the texts
creepyPMs,removed,why would you have sex when you met him the first time whats wrong with our generation
creepyPMs,removed,are you on a dating site while youre married
creepyPMs,removed,yeah im gonna agree with everyone else it may have been a bit sleazy but it was polite and nonharassing
creepyPMs,removed,i can not understand why a married person would seek int this kind of appsite looking for friends on these sites is not realistic you should just live in the real world
creepyPMs,removed,maybe this a cultural thing here in south america you do not do this if you wanna friends you simply leave home and technologies behind
creepyPMs,removed,i did not break any rules
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know what that means
creepyPMs,removed,it is subjective i didnt break the rules you can mark my post and a mod can delete if he thinks that my post was inadequate
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt blamed her all that i said is that i do not understand why a married person would seek there
creepyPMs,removed,sodoes that mean i was being sarcastic or the person commenting was being sarcastic
creepyPMs,removed,i dunno this is low on the creep scale for me he dropped it when you said no and overall was pretty polite about it yes a little creepy but he still seems like an okay person if hes politely telling you he didnt feel a spark
creepyPMs,removed,i read it with a sort of condescending attitude she seemed like she was trying to make the guy feel bad is all again obviously ignorant of the situation
creepyPMs,removed,i believe the same he was polite in state what he was looking for and didnt force it wasnt a random message neither but from someone who had a date with you cant say that was creepy
creepyPMs,removed,have you never played cards against humanity lol
creepyPMs,removed,shes totally flirting bitch
creepyPMs,removed,because fucking faggots get lots of creepy messages too duh
creepyPMs,removed,who the fuck looks for friends on a dating site if theyre married
creepyPMs,removed,no
creepyPMs,removed,god the mods here are so stupid the fact that you all would ban someone just because they posted a comment on a different subreddit makes no sense quit acting like youre the center of reddit mods this subreddit is dead and the posts here arent even good go ahead and ban me you insufferable idiots
creepyPMs,removed,ugh sorry at least you got it over with lol btw great post just saw
creepyPMs,removed,so who was it then
creepyPMs,removed,slept with him once or several times
creepyPMs,removed,i get thatbut lets just saysomeone made a place like a different website where people could out this kind of personwould that be legal
creepyPMs,removed,yes it tells us how overly attached this person can be
creepyPMs,removed,you can tell him that reddit thinks hes a sad piece of shit desperately trying to get attention crying himself to sleep every night wondering why women flee from him at every opportunity we also are starting a bet on whether or not hes a virgin and if so will he die alone one i got fifty on yes and yes anyone else
creepyPMs,removed,personally if i could bet itd be on off his bipolar meds but thats because i have an ex just like that but as the runner of the bet pool i cant so there ya go p
creepyPMs,removed,oh i wasnt im actually a firm believer in men and women arent that different i only asked cause we live in this version of reality like in my mind besides obvious body stuff i think a main difference between men and women is how much they are precieved to be able to get sexually like if men could get as much as women i think they would calm down about sex and it wouldnt be that big of a deal and they would actually start viewing women differently because its not about getting sex and if women were forced to only be able to get as much as men they would be just as creepy
creepyPMs,removed,no no its not like every girl has sex with a different guy like to but like its like a couple of guys are getting sex from multiple girls not to say there arent girls that get sex from multiple guys uhim gonna do my best to explain this better okay so we can agree that in general women can get sex easier than men like if we took a poll the ability of girls to have sex would greatly eclipse the ability of boys yes so assuming thats the case there is probably a lot of overlap on who girls sleep with because there arent many guys that pass the preliminaries of datinghooking upmost dudes are whack and girls will not sleep with them but dudes will definitely sleep with a whack girl therefore if we split into fractions within our genders and every new person was one women would have a higher number than men which is what i was saying if we lowered that number to be where mens number is women would be creepy too
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i know im riding really close to the line of ending up being one of the post here i just know i make this point make since i mean look at this sub as an example is it not mostly men who are mostly likely not having sex
creepyPMs,removed,why is everyone telling them theyre going on reddit and stuff thats comes off so douchey
creepyPMs,removed,damn sure wish you could give out his info so we could all take turns fucking with him lol what a dick
creepyPMs,removed,wild cunt appeared wild cunt used be an asshole its super effective
creepyPMs,removed,struggling with the genders here is this a sad lonely overly clingy read crazy woman or a desperately pathetic zeta male
creepyPMs,removed,vaginas are kind of like caves though except for penises and babys though that guy will never see one in real life
creepyPMs,removed,resisting aside from straight survival the single most powerful biological imperative in human behavior it can be challenging at times yeah people make mistakes it doesnt mean theyre not deserving of empathy
creepyPMs,removed,fair nuff i was only referencing in general people fail at monogamy pretty often and most of them are still good people
creepyPMs,removed,with a dick that small of course a normal vagina feels cavelike
creepyPMs,removed,any person who goes off on tangents like that to people is crazy as a proud heterosexual man dude something complicated i have been in a few relationships with women and it does suck i find the best thing you can do to fuck with their heads after is just completely ignore them act as though they never existed lol it works brilliantly crazy guy i hope you are watching take notes
creepyPMs,removed,cave like structure fucking gold
creepyPMs,removed,why would you have a child with a guy who writes like hes
creepyPMs,removed,the sub rules are more for post removals and bans mods cant ban the community for down voting something the they didnt like
creepyPMs,removed,theres a setting on facebook that hides your page from categories of people if you ask me theres nothing wrong with meeting people through facebook if the person has their page set up so you can see it then you can assume they wont be creeped out my friend requests
creepyPMs,removed,obviously you arent doing it right i mean the first time me and my girlfriend hooked up she just kept yelling rape and even ran away afterwards we broke up shortly after that when she took me to court
creepyPMs,removed,striketypical male strike shitty person logic to mehypocritical and irrational ftfy
creepyPMs,removed,if hes creeping you out block him dont take accept his money if you dont want to participate in whatever hes trying to do
creepyPMs,removed,you guys are the type of people that believe the myth that your hymen is torn when you have sex for the first time read a book idiots
creepyPMs,removed,i may be wrong but this one seemed okay to me sure the guy was out of line with the personal info but it didnt really seem creepy to me imo
creepyPMs,removed,oh yeah thats definitely creepy then sorry i just discovered this sub yesterday and been reading the post on and off so my perspective was a bit off
creepyPMs,removed,well the whole argument has become confused now because couldnt handle the down votes and deleted their original comment which was that hymens go back to normal after being stretched by sex or childbirth this is patently untrue once a hymen has been stretched to the point of tearing it becomes a ring of irregular tissue around the opening of the vagina it does not go back to its original structure across the vaginal opening
creepyPMs,removed,not a creepy pm he does not state that he wants to do anything with you only that he is impressed by your profile and is interested in chatting
creepyPMs,removed,do you just sit around the internet all day looking for kids with autism so you can post your chat logs or what your account is fucking weird and seriously people are getting so much more weird every day
creepyPMs,removed,haha awkward he seemed niceish
creepyPMs,removed,op how in the hell do you get so many creepy pms are you that hot that douchebags just gravitate towards you
creepyPMs,removed,thank you but im not interested in dating outside of x range like it says in my profile you can get your point across without being rude
creepyPMs,removed,porra
creepyPMs,removed,maybe he has tourettes
creepyPMs,removed,wow actually pretty rude on your end
creepyPMs,removed,link
creepyPMs,removed,you did kind of overreact though what he wanted to saydo on the video chat probably wasnt most respectful thing
creepyPMs,removed,how do find that manipulative smh
creepyPMs,removed,why didnt you just block this person after the second message
creepyPMs,removed,raaaaange i didnt know about this list welp there goes my week thanks a lot jerk
creepyPMs,removed,jep
creepyPMs,removed,tldr online dating sucks for the nice guys out there well you all need to stop sending the wrong message with your profile and pictures kidding here i had a girl reject me because i asked her if she wanted to get some chicken nuggets she said i do not condone eating fast food it is so unhealthy and a few other things her only picture was of her sitting at a mcdonaldsi normally appreciate if someone just said they were not interested because then i at least knew and would just say thanks good luck and do not be shy to message me if your opinion changes that was the one time i had to make a second effort simply by telling her that i actually rarely eat there but was taking a cue from her only photo didnt make a difference so left it be her response gave me insight that made me also not interested so it worked out for the best i think sites need to have a button you can hit to send a kind reply that lets them know you are not interested and disables replies i know some sites if you reply back then block the person to avoid unkind replies it will delete the message thread so they never see the reply to begin with rejection always sucks but it can also suck not knowing if what you think is a good person will reply or not we all know sometimes people only have time to check the messages and not time to reply at the moment so end up hoping that was the case and not just ignored sometimes i had to remind myself that some guys get kinda nasty on rejection and to not take it personally it sucked being held to the standard of crappy guys when i never did anything to deserve that treatment of course how is the other person supposed to know who is going to blow up and who is going to say thanks and move on personally i would always respond to messages sent to me i actually stated this in my profile granted i did not get a lot so that could play a part i am sure a large bust slender blonde woman would get about per day another point i needed to remind myself of lastly a rant mostly the only thing that ever actually bothered me is if the message status go to unreaddeleted especially if no profile view either i would always write an actual message not just hey or whatever i put time into reading profile looking for topics and crafting a legit opener for each person at least read the thing if you are soliciting messages from people and just trashing them without even a glance i seriously hope you step on a lego tonight
creepyPMs,removed,it all has to do with looks i know someone who acts like a scumbag upfront in his profile but still gets tons of matches because of his looks even from women who claim to want something serious in their profile
creepyPMs,removed,if he give that good succ i would
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair im of the belief that anyone can be gay if theyre in the mood
creepyPMs,removed,eh i think in about years everyone will be bi
creepyPMs,removed,sexuality is a social construct imo
creepyPMs,removed,httpiimgurcomykpcjgif completely unrelated im just happy i found this gif
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i would let a guy blow me cause bjs feel good
creepyPMs,removed,is
creepyPMs,removed,lol thanks for that you must live in a very peaceful world if my comment was pretty messed up were all complete strangers here by the way she posted something on a site for complete strangers to react to just wanted to make sure youre aware of that also youre not reading my comment because i did not suggest they rekindle their relationship annndddd you dont seem to understand mental illness either i made sure to work on it and be more mindful good for you but thats not mental illness get your head on
creepyPMs,removed,or right on it nahmean
creepyPMs,removed,calm down hes just messing its not like he asked you to sit on his face
creepyPMs,removed,the face on the right is unique
creepyPMs,removed,lmao why u mad breh
creepyPMs,removed,this aint really creepy though more pathetic than anything you turned into the creep when you went all stalkerlike trying to get to his girlfriend
creepyPMs,removed,of course you should thats someone on the other end actually communicating with you
creepyPMs,removed,tbh i think you overstepped your bounds just block him and move on interfering with someone elses relationship is just idk id leave it alone dude its not your business to get involved in
creepyPMs,removed,why is that a deal breaker tho id do it
creepyPMs,removed,what in the hell do the xs at the end of every text mean
creepyPMs,removed,dude your response is the cringe here
creepyPMs,removed,for a kitten
creepyPMs,removed,im not saying he wasnt being a creep to you but i dont see anything he said in this screenshot as creepy i know ill get downvoted but i dont see any creepy pms from this guy in this particular picture
creepyPMs,removed,please let him know that incest babies dont actually turn out beautiful
creepyPMs,removed,why were you on tinder if youre taken
creepyPMs,removed,he literally just asked how you were doing
creepyPMs,removed,id easily sleep with another girl
creepyPMs,removed,why do people keep responding
creepyPMs,removed,its a pretty big dick
creepyPMs,removed,guarantee that guy has a little dick
creepyPMs,removed,i think that may indicate you have an issue to overcome with yourself everyone else is not crazy for not being drawn to you its you bro figure your shit out
creepyPMs,removed,stop using the term rapey for everything toss the guy on ignore hes annoying as hell
creepyPMs,removed,no point answering at all any form of response is encouragement to people with this mindset
creepyPMs,removed,i think they ascribe to the idea that overuse of a term makes it less powerful i can agree in the sense that rape is something completely awful and ascribing it to someone who just wont stop messaging you when you have the ability to shut them down with a click is not exactly okay at the same time there is the argument that they are effectively not taking no for an answer personally i think using rape outside of the medium of actual rape is not great and kinda shits all over people who have been abused
creepyPMs,removed,didnt see the block user button
creepyPMs,removed,was you unsure if it was a dick was it malformed
creepyPMs,removed,probably going to be downvoted into oblivion for this but this guy clearly has extreme care for you he really wants you to be happy in life its not uncommon for brothers to have feelings for their sisters as far as ive read i dont have a sister so i dont know the feelings but as a man i can tell you that this person has genuine care for your trust and good being he obviously spent a very long time with these feeling unsure what your reaction would be he finally opened up to you in a way that would be so unbelievably hard to do hoping he didnt offend you and lose your friendship which he obviously values deeply you told him you arent crazy judgemental but your reaction says otherwise instead of not giving him the time of day why not explain to him that you dont see him that way then he can move on having no response from you would be absolutely agonizing to the point hes consumed by thoughts of you constantly i can only imagine the regret he feels
creepyPMs,removed,til being male is a negative
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair some guys really do just want to talk to girls about things to pick their mind
creepyPMs,removed,why did you keep on responding to the weirdo i do always wonder that
creepyPMs,removed,confirms the theory that all these weirdos are from pakistan or some other world islamic stuff
creepyPMs,removed,if you really didnt feel like talking why would you bother replying wouldnt it make more sense to just ignore him completely
creepyPMs,removed,why keep responding after you said you didnt want to have a conversation why not just stop did you keep responding just to post something to this subreddit
creepyPMs,removed,so how tall are you
creepyPMs,removed,oh for gods sake mute the guy or end the conversation or something
creepyPMs,removed,so what do you do when you dont want to sleep
creepyPMs,removed,rindianpeoplefacebook would appreciate this
creepyPMs,removed,what do you do when you dont want to sleep masturbate uh same except i do it to help get me to sleep refractory period helps lull me down
creepyPMs,removed,come on guys it sounds like hes tops being a dick to him isnt edgy hes probably socially awkward jesus
creepyPMs,removed,with the context of him not being a native english speaker this isnt all that creepy you were quite clearly carrying on the conversation with him
creepyPMs,removed,wow i guess i cant relate to your situation but had he done anything else that made you so fearful that you moved to the other side of the country without a trace and did you ever consider responding at all even just with pity hes obviously got some serious mentalemotional problems and that was a clear manifestation
creepyPMs,removed,thats incredibly rare the only mistake you made was replying to his pm at all if you had simply ignored it nothing more would have happened you cant feed the trolls even if this wasnt strictly trolling the same mentality applies any response is interpreted as positive never reply ever
creepyPMs,removed,hi
creepyPMs,removed,its a serious thing thats become a casually thrown around term the last thing we need is to take this type of shit less seriously
creepyPMs,removed,im not going to converse with you proceeds to converse youre coming off as pretty rapey this was pretty cringey and quite a big leap if you ask me the guy never said one sexual thing a bit weird surebut rapey thats a bit extreme
creepyPMs,removed,he means that its ok for women to be short its not a horrible miserable experience like his life is so hes pissed off at her for things she has literally not one ounce of control over
creepyPMs,removed,you never know if its the rare time though i know i find it incredibly difficult too sometimes i have to leave reddit for a few hours to avoid temptation but every time i do reply it goes bad funny my comment was removed for breaking rule which is apparently about civility im not bothered enough to argue with them about it but it seems like an overreaction
creepyPMs,removed,i get that its creepy but you really should have just stopped responding to him what did you ever hope to gain by continuing this conversation
creepyPMs,removed,old enough to give consent so is im fyi not some old guy
creepyPMs,removed,your mistake wasnt answering the askreddit question honestly your mistake was responding to his first pm and the next or so afterwards
creepyPMs,removed,dude was a creep but rapey is one of the most overused words and frankly minimizes the significance of rape rapey creepy
creepyPMs,removed,some people should really masturbate before they message someone they like
creepyPMs,removed,the guy couldnt take a hint yeesh why did you keep responding to him ive never needed to look so i dont know does reddit have a block feature
creepyPMs,removed,was an honest question
creepyPMs,removed,if you dont want to talk to somebody justdont talk to them you could have avoided this whole creepy conversation by ignoring his first weird ass message
creepyPMs,removed,i love short girls personally and honestly dont know any guys that ever say a girl is too short
creepyPMs,removed,i would be mad too if i was constantly eye level with breasts but never got to touch any of them
creepyPMs,removed,why dont you just stop answering and block him
creepyPMs,removed,wowow sorry for asking the question i guess geez
creepyPMs,removed,would you be so kind as to let me lick your female genitalia per chance
creepyPMs,removed,so you kept replying
creepyPMs,removed,you realize its easier to just not reply to the creep than continue the conversation for messages despite saying youre done
creepyPMs,removed,havent had enough conversations on reddit to have developed a system like that its a smart one though this is the most braindead excuse ive ever heard
creepyPMs,removed,if it makes you feel any better there wont be any women and goats dont have feelings hes pakistani remember
creepyPMs,removed,haha he wasnt that hard to find he seems to have also made a post that says when you think you need to masturbate it seems your comment created something xd he wasnt wrong that his english is bad
creepyPMs,removed,islam isnt a race
creepyPMs,removed,i mean in his defense he did try to save himself at the end by gauging her interest
creepyPMs,removed,my giggles turned to a look of horror toward the end if that helps the sudden turn from just retarded to no you will tell me yeah that escalated from about to
creepyPMs,removed,lol what a cuck
creepyPMs,removed,i always see posts on this subreddit and wonder why even engage with these people they clearly arent capable of taking a hint by continuing to engage with them you are giving them the impression you want to talk to them yoy could very easily avoid these situations by not engaging these types of people
creepyPMs,removed,looks like he tricked you into a conversation
creepyPMs,removed,sure but can we complain that op put up pictures that are unable to be read without a degree in image reconstruction
creepyPMs,removed,i adore him saying i love you and baby girl after insulting you so much why dont you just blockreport him though hes crazy hell try to track you down p
creepyPMs,removed,i honestly have no clue why people are stupid enough to send more than messages to people like this youre just egging him on how about you give the asshole attention
creepyPMs,removed,ops got a mangina
creepyPMs,removed,i got bored with how long she played into it
creepyPMs,removed,op i dont think continuing contact with this guy is a safe idea i know its entertaining but you might want to consider blocking him
creepyPMs,removed,pussy whimp pushover take your damn pick
creepyPMs,removed,this is gold guarantee if you call him out for being a virgin he will lose his shit as much
creepyPMs,removed,stop responding i never get why people keep responding hes obviously continuously baiting you with multiple messages and each time you respond you tell him that youve read them all and they got to you and you fall into his game he wins everytime you respond thats what he wants just ignore him
creepyPMs,removed,fucking christ dude youre still going on about this well while youve been sperging out ive been showing my tum tum all around town and it was glorious
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know whos dumber
creepyPMs,removed,you know hes right oink oink
creepyPMs,removed,so about that tummy whats it gonna be
creepyPMs,removed,yeah but are you fake
creepyPMs,removed,why ask why you know exactly why block him get on with your life
creepyPMs,removed,you know you should just block this guy he seems like a real damaged and unstable person in this guys mind the fact that you didnt block him makes him think that you two have some sort of relationship seriously block this guy
creepyPMs,removed,am i missing the rape part
creepyPMs,removed,yeah well sm stands for sadomasochism which can be spilt between sadistssadism which covers those who like to inflict certain types of pain on others sexual physical or mental and masochismmasochists who like to experience certain types of pain sexual physical or mental
creepyPMs,removed,ill be sure to use that as an icebreaker in the future
creepyPMs,removed,charge your battery youre making me nervous
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand how these people are real either i have never seen a post yet with over battery
creepyPMs,removed,if you really have to be a degenerate creep like that then why not at least own up to it and get the fuck out like he couldve said sorry about that have a good night i know it still doesnt validate the shitty first message but at least he wont try to seem like a real gentleman after that its just pathetic own up to it and get the fuck out youve already shown your true colors you utter dipshit
creepyPMs,removed,what did rape have to do with anything when someone says no and you say yes that doesnt mean rape unless its pertaining to something sexual can i have an apple no yes thats rapey what
creepyPMs,removed,dude is crazy and i agree that you had no obligation to give him the ten dollars back but why did you freak out so hard about it like he asked for it back and you just go so hostile immediately you definitely had no reason to give it back but i dont think him asking for it back the first time is nearly as bad as you made it out to be it was that bad later though
creepyPMs,removed,yes but you dont charge your friends or mom and dad for your time its mindboggling to assume you can charge randoms on the net and expect to be paid
creepyPMs,removed,i see a lot of these posts on rcreepypms and cant help but notice that they are usually sent to girls who post things on rgonewild or one of the other various spank subs i notice a lot of girls put pms welcome so guys will send them a message which gives them creepypms material now with that said i thoroughly enjoy viewing multiple gonewild posts but i am enough of a realist to know that the great majority of the girls are posting these pics because they enjoy the thrill of it for lack of a better term and by no way are they posting to try and find some random internet dude to come and fill your holes majority of the pms that these gonewild posters get are probably from some year old kids who honestly think that telling a woman all of those kinky and somewhat repulsive things is a good way to get laid i guess what i am trying to say is that if you are going to take a pic of you bending over naked and post it to reddit you should somewhat reasonably expect some pathetic loser who is also probably a virgin and will more than likely stay that way to send you some sweet nothings to your inbox maybe i am wrong tho if you are posting for attention dont make everyone guy or boy that gives you attention look like some crazy pervert or maybe include in your gonewild title that people can look but dont talk cheers
creepyPMs,removed,whyd you give him ur age
creepyPMs,removed,shouldve told em you were down to bang this wouldve got the info you desired
creepyPMs,removed,why are you talking to these people
creepyPMs,removed,why dont you just block them
creepyPMs,removed,what is with the gay male community and this whole youre clearly lying if you arent a tad bit gay bit i dont know know if its a majority or a vocal minority but its off putting to see any community act disregarding towards somebodies personal preference regardless how these gay people feel about it otherwise
creepyPMs,removed,whys his age matter just tell the guy hes a cunt and be done with it
creepyPMs,removed,in a round about way people get bitchy when i used to say i didnt date fat chicks because they gross me out
creepyPMs,removed,its a dating site not a i wanna be your friend and smell your hair brush site
creepyPMs,removed,both bro and sis
creepyPMs,removed,i never used it i never liked online dating
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,psycho
creepyPMs,removed,yea after his last line mine would be something like yea i know your dumb jew book is filled with nonsense
creepyPMs,removed,i feel so bad for the guy nothing against you op its just i can feel his pain in what he wrote being an empath can really suck sometime
creepyPMs,removed,come stay with me to avoid being homeless and we can fuck what who said that you are setting up a gross strawman argument and i love how you said sex is particularly creepy from a friend and confidante right a stranger would make it less creepy than someone you trust and feel confident with s
creepyPMs,removed,i am reading your posts its just annoying because its so hard to get laid and our entire society is around whether a guy can get laid youre mad at him for jumping on an opportunity by asking a girl upfront he pays his bills he is doing nothing wrong creeping is being sneaky and manipulative about sexual intentions this guy is honest and treating the other person with respect this is what it all boils down to if he had kept quiet about it and then hit on her after she was living there youd be like what a pig he preyed on her situation instead he treats her with respect and doesnt try to hide anything hes asking for her feelings on something but your fucking response is still what a pig he preyed on her situation
creepyPMs,removed,serves him right one can only hope someone takes the time to send a couple of dick pics his way
creepyPMs,removed,she cried that seems a bit over the top just say decline and move on unless the dude was being pushy i dont see why that should be friendshipending
creepyPMs,removed,his third choice was to just not offer her anything thats what i would have done if i knew her attitude was going to be like that if she didnt feel like she would want to have sex with him she couldve just told him and still got a place to stay but not when its obviously in exchange for something the other party desperately needs ah but the person putting her in need is whoever is causing the problem at home it has nothing to do with her friendhe is only giving her new options hes being a friend in her time of need
creepyPMs,removed,would you like some olive oil with your pasta or is it good the way it is
creepyPMs,removed,what are you talking about he asked her how she felt about being with him he never even implied that she had to have sex with him or he would throw her out on the street did you even read the original thread and it would have to be a girl anyway because im a straight guy the commentator was a straight girl and he was a straight guy so your hypothetical is a false equivalency
creepyPMs,removed,would you like some olive oil with your pasta or is it good the way it is httpswwwredditcomrareyoudeafbot
creepyPMs,removed,imagine being in this situation as a guy though being able to have sex with your landlord instead of paying him it would be pretty cool assuming shes good looking
creepyPMs,removed,have to choose those kinds of ads no other options lo fucking l
creepyPMs,removed,yes drawing a black and white line through a generalized subject the subject i was talking aboutreplying to was one of viewing sex as something of potential battering value which is an interesting topic because of the dichotomy of its representation in law pop culture and history as well as its emotional and physical connections
creepyPMs,removed,also how did he get your number i think it is
creepyPMs,removed,any response even negative ones will only spur them on
creepyPMs,removed,interesting ill check it out dont know why but i need a good laugh haha
creepyPMs,removed,this post belongs more in rdrama
creepyPMs,removed,may i ask what your butter username is
creepyPMs,removed,may i ask what your butter username is
creepyPMs,removed,may i ask what your butter username is
creepyPMs,removed,may i ask what your butter username is
creepyPMs,removed,may i ask what your butter username is
creepyPMs,removed,its a video game made by blizzard the people who make world of warcraft its like a hero shooter kinda like a modern team fortress lots of creepy dudes make really weird overwatch porn of all the female heroes and its kind of gross
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair if it is some kind of dating siteapp and you arent interested in dating only looking i can see why he might get upset assuming it is a dating thing
creepyPMs,removed,so its not from a dating site ok p
creepyPMs,removed,ok sorry im saying he would have a right to get upset if you were on a dating site with no intent on dating anyone at all it gets aggravating after a while
creepyPMs,removed,sodo you like boners
creepyPMs,removed,im not talking about his crappy line im saying if youre on a dating site and you dont want to date dont get mad when you get messages
creepyPMs,removed,i mean its literally a fact that rape is one of if not the most common fantasies amongst women
creepyPMs,removed,i do see that im saying if the only reason shes there is to make the stories then maybe they are not the bad guy girl wouldnt you get mad at someone like that if you were doing online dating if youre there seriously and theyre there for chuckles that makes it harder
creepyPMs,removed,you mean someone doing something mean just to karma whore plus im not accusing im saying if that is the case than its totally not cool to do
creepyPMs,removed,oh but cmon magnum chested queen is pretty damn funny
creepyPMs,removed,i mean hes clearly a piece of shit but you let him get to you a little
creepyPMs,removed,is this really creepy this was adorable and made me smile
creepyPMs,removed,i cant believe you agreed to a date with this disrespectful loser
creepyPMs,removed,damn some people cant take jokes
creepyPMs,removed,not gonna lie seemed ok
creepyPMs,removed,this is an example of a certain type of male on one hand it is often the case men are more driven excited by visual cues ie nice body nice face certainly at the start of the conquest on the other hand in his mind the op is the stereotypical female just wanting to hear sweet nothings his asking for pics and the endless bla bla are behaviours that fit that to a tee
creepyPMs,removed,wow guy gamers with no social skills shocker
creepyPMs,removed,you are still gonna help him get in shape right
creepyPMs,removed,honestly if youre good friends it really might have just been in jest if its obvious for both parties that there is no romantic attraction between you it can be a fun subject to joke about because nobody will get hurt
creepyPMs,removed,oh damn you really showed him you acted soooo cool damn girl or boy your messages are even more cringe than his he just wanted to chat with you lol and whats the matter if you are its legal so he did nothing wrong
creepyPMs,removed,im with you there calling someone creepy for being depressed is just outright mean if you arent enjoying the conversation anymore just stop responding this person wasnt disrespectful or creepy he was sad
creepyPMs,removed,seriously
creepyPMs,removed,im sorry for providing perspective
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know which one this post is for theyre both creepy
creepyPMs,removed,but which social media site there are so many
creepyPMs,removed,this subreddit doesnt enjoy iasip
creepyPMs,removed,it wasnt a real request tired joke maybe but just a joke nonetheless
creepyPMs,removed,fair enough ill delete it but i still think that the majority of people knew it was a joke everyone that replied at least knew
creepyPMs,removed,the only straight thing in this picture its his proposal badumtss
creepyPMs,removed,dunno ¯ツ¯
creepyPMs,removed,i think you should post the website so we can all check to see if we know anyone i mean theres just so many of those disgusting porn sites so which one
creepyPMs,removed,wow youre rude as fuck he said you have pretty eyes so you are contractually obligated to be heeis womern for the rest of your life
creepyPMs,removed,he sounds like a fedora tipping dad existence of a man and you sound as pleasant as i was going to try to say something more witty but ill just go with a complete bitch
creepyPMs,removed,you ruined someones live
creepyPMs,removed,hahaha gayyy
creepyPMs,removed,annoying yes creepy no
creepyPMs,removed,i know threatening suicide is very anger worthy ill never threaten with suicide when i get to the point where i want to kill myself ill just do it so no one else can stop me attention seekers will shout the many ways they can or have tried to off themselves some quality time in a whitecoat would stop most people from talking like that
creepyPMs,removed,she probably cheated on him
creepyPMs,removed,ew doms are gross
creepyPMs,removed,what did the girl in question
creepyPMs,removed,pussies
creepyPMs,removed,but which website there are so many
creepyPMs,removed,wondering what she did
creepyPMs,removed,you shouldnt be such a prude
creepyPMs,removed,what im not allowed to fucking objectively look at something
creepyPMs,removed,i cant have this happen says someone who violated their privacy and trust most likely because that person violated their privacy and trustthere is a way to get nudes out there and it doesnt involve telling the person or threatening them first i had looked into it once and then i decided to be the bigger person but for those of you that want to i would encourage you to do so sometimes examples need to be made im not gonna make them but i appreciate the insane people who will
creepyPMs,removed,i see this thread is full of sjw libttards if i cant objectively question a text and the motives of both parties involved then ban me now bitches you scallywags
creepyPMs,removed,why were you so adamant about not being his friend right away op i dont disagree with what you said at all just curious
creepyPMs,removed,would it have been as creepy if it was a woman who sent it
creepyPMs,removed,that smile at the end of the message in this comment is almost like getting to creepypms is a badge of honor posting this here might make it worse just saying
creepyPMs,removed,i said it before and i will say it again the real crime or creepy thing is whoever uses that as heir default font fucking weird
creepyPMs,removed,calm your tits you arent that hot
creepyPMs,removed,why are you guys acting like this dude was serious probably some troll with no life just looking for reactions i mean it was a pretty obvious troll
creepyPMs,removed,you know that moment when you realize women have twisted emotions its also like laughing at yourself you would think sarcasm works in the game but it doesnt because sarcasm doesnt bring security in a relationship i think it would work if i was making a month
creepyPMs,removed,im confused why you didnt just block them after the first go around
creepyPMs,removed,i maybe wouldnt tell him to bother someone else maybe someone else cant handle it as well as you
creepyPMs,removed,or a box
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand how people like this are even real ikr how does anyone let their battery get that low o
creepyPMs,removed,say what you will but this is fucking hilarious
creepyPMs,removed,this is not a typing style youre just a fucking idiot ftfy sidenote i dont see how this is a creepy pm
creepyPMs,removed,some people do this for funm and this looks like one of those cases
creepyPMs,removed,the guys making sure your back is alright what a perv right
creepyPMs,removed,wow are you telling me a certain percentage of culinary school students end up becoming cooks
creepyPMs,removed,damn you suck all these fuckin assholes rallying around you pumping you up dumb bitch
creepyPMs,removed,fair enough
creepyPMs,removed,this seems like a funny idea but how can she varify that they are unsolicited i could easily see this turning into revenge porn of sorts women could set men up by asking for these pictures with the intention of putting then on display
creepyPMs,removed,dile de mi parte que se vaya a follar a una cabra y se lance de un puente hijo de puta abusador i hope youre in a better place and hes out of your life one day hugs and cookies
creepyPMs,removed,is this a chiropractor practicing in austin west lake hills texas
creepyPMs,removed,i dislike you youre probably chubby reporting him to state medical board is ludacris the idea that hes a perv because he asked how your back was feeling is beyond unintelligent why does he have your cell number anyway probably because youre a loosey goosey
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt know kenm had alt accounts
creepyPMs,removed,it never fails to surprise me to what lengths these pervs will go just because they think with their dicks first time on this sub is this a womanonly sub or something your wording makes me feel like only pervs are men
creepyPMs,removed,im going to play devils advocate here why is this that bad i mean id get it if it was from someone like a professor teacher where it is obviously wrong but if op and the doctor are of similar ages why would it particularly bad
creepyPMs,removed,i think that may be due to how men are supposed to react in these situations i can tell you from personal experience that ive had a couple of women send me creepy texts but i didnt feel the need to post them to the internet having said that im glad op made this post because having a pervert for a doctor is one of the most shameful acts of betrayal i can think of
creepyPMs,removed,im inclined to believe you but just to be sure are you confident that he is actually being creepy instead of expressing genuine nonromantic interest care for his patients but awkwardly so because hes socially retarded
creepyPMs,removed,thanks for a reasonable answer
creepyPMs,removed,i guess i just dont see the creepiness wont stand up in a review hearing either fyi next time if you feel creeped out by someone let them know immediately dont wait days after they stopped texting you to tell them
creepyPMs,removed,so either agree the person is creepy or dont comment thats really one of your rules sub so meta its the poster child of creepy
creepyPMs,removed,im not sure i understand the need for something like this wouldnt it make more sense to enforce the rules in this subreddit and not worry about which other subreddits users are visiting as long as someone isnt posting hate speech in this subreddit why do you care
creepyPMs,removed,thats not what the person i was replying to said but now theyve deleted their comment
creepyPMs,removed,httpswwwredditcomwikireddiquette no its not
creepyPMs,removed,nothing cause nobody is gonna listen to a slut over a doctor
creepyPMs,removed,trust me i did not handle creepy pms on this sub ever since i was and if he could learn from her
creepyPMs,removed,just letting you know what your sub looks like to rall
creepyPMs,removed,i dont see how this is creepy anyone care to explain
creepyPMs,removed,not a chance this is real
creepyPMs,removed,s holy shit and i would not do that ever
creepyPMs,removed,i dont see what the problem is he seems to be joking to me
creepyPMs,removed,so i just stalked your profile and checked out your picture youre beautiful like seriously id love to look like you im not trying to be a creep or anything but you really are pretty and im not just saying that to be nice either your eyebrows are on point and idk what that asshole was on but your nose is not big id kill for a perfect nose like that instead of my lumpy irish nose
creepyPMs,removed,i was being sarcastic because he repeatedly said he was joking i honestly cant believe you guys took that seriously
creepyPMs,removed,brown is not blonde you kike
creepyPMs,removed,buncha haters i see lol
creepyPMs,removed,who goes on a dating site looking for friends
creepyPMs,removed,that kid went full tourettes out if nowhere
creepyPMs,removed,why are you on a dating website if youre only looking for friends
creepyPMs,removed,so you are looking for friends on the internet specifically a free dating app known for having tons of creeps i cant imagine that going very well
creepyPMs,removed,yeah those were pretty bad i laughed but i dont think i should have laughed
creepyPMs,removed,well colour me surprised good to hear its going well i did not expect that
creepyPMs,removed,i see im not familiar with how those apps work but the fact it filters it actually seems like a solid system apologies for my ignorance
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt like anything about either side of this conversation honestly it was all weird
creepyPMs,removed,this doesnt seem creepy just annoying that he ignored everything on your profile
creepyPMs,removed,good god please stop saying fee fees
creepyPMs,removed,plot twist op was the original creeper
creepyPMs,removed,how do they justify finding him guilty before a hearing or a presentation of evidence to the discipline committee
creepyPMs,removed,if you read beyond the first few lines they use pretty clear language at the beginning of each of the four sections that you dr x are guilty of x y z
creepyPMs,removed,i read the entire document thats not how that works these are all allegations you cant preface a document like this by saying were charging you with these offenses and then go on to present those allegations as facts
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt make it to the part where he got creepy but for at least pages you were encouraging it so cant really blame the guy for thinking you liked the attention
creepyPMs,removed,youre right and i completely agree with you other than the fact that the wording is improper look at it this way you cant be charged with being guilty of something youre charged with a violation of a law statute bylaw etc and are found guilty or not guilty based on a ruling by a court by using the wording on this document theyre about as close as a court can be to saying weve found you guilty and are now going to have you come in and answer questions this is the kind of shit that drives lawyers crazy if youre going to go out and pretend to be a lawyer or a court of law you have to be meticulous in the way you go about it with that said canadian law could be entirely different and i have no idea what im talking about when it comes to what amounts to a canadian complaintsummons
creepyPMs,removed,i dont insist on talking about lawyers and laws nor have i brought up any talk of criminal charges beyond that something like this would appear in an administrative or civil court before it would be brought as a criminal charge im saying this document spits in the face of the notion of due process by saying that he has to come before a medical tribunal because he is being charged with being guilty of violating some aspect of their code of professional conduct i understand what youre getting at this isnt in a court of law im just taking issue with the idea that one can in essence be found guilty prior to their hearing i understand that not all countries enjoy the civil liberties guaranteed by the us justice system i understand that not all businesses professions or even schools in the us or otherwise have to adhere to such a process im merely pointing out that the language in this document is so poorly used that if intentional is an affront to the notion of innocence before guilt i really cant understand how no one sees what im getting at you dont need a jd to understand its bullshit if you receive something like this in the mail stating that youre being charged with being guilty of violating a rule of professional conduct
creepyPMs,removed,youre absolutely right i dont believe that they think hes guilty already maybe they do whos to say i just dont like that in a document that can ruin a persons career and possibly their life so little care was taken with the language used regarding both the charges and evidence to be brought forth if you were in his shoes would you not want your attorney to hammer a point like that home as part of their opening volley what if he beats these charges and this document makes its way into the public record and is used against him in some manner in the future its just sloppy and when youre dealing with consequences as severe as what this doctor will be facing things need to be done by the book its sloppy as hell
creepyPMs,removed,whats the other sub
creepyPMs,removed,just posting for my ban
creepyPMs,removed,can you ban me pls never got it with my kia introduction packet
creepyPMs,removed,im just here for my ban ´¯ ¯ ´¯´¯¯·¸ ¨¯ ´´ ¯ ·´
creepyPMs,removed,well i hope you enjoy sitting on your high horse you twfatshaming fat fucks
creepyPMs,removed,lots of people say the word irregardless too just because we know what they mean doesnt mean theyre not a moron just because a boilerplate document is flawed doesnt mean its acceptable further i disagree i have never seen this kind of language used in a court document or otherwise which is why i posted my original comment in the first place it was supposed to be a passing jab at the ineptitude of whomever drafted this not an invitation to debate reddit on whether or not its important to use proper terminology and language in legally significant documents
creepyPMs,removed,hehe grown man here and i find the word panties a turn on different strokes for different folks i guess
creepyPMs,removed,why am i not surprised at least you can delete the conversation and ignore him
creepyPMs,removed,i mean i dont like when people mention their cock sizes out of nowhere but op i have to say you acted like a bitch out of nowhere you literally said that guy looks like a serial killer as your first text if you dont like someone put the person down directly dont call someone a serial killer look alike cos she or he is not your type
creepyPMs,removed,so according to you i can go out calling people names and if i get a nasty reply i should come cry here that all men are freaks jesus
creepyPMs,removed,point is the real freely pm here is from op and know it
creepyPMs,removed,sure ill leave it to the mods
creepyPMs,removed,bye bye lol youre a real piece of work the girl cant receive criticism cos you know her
creepyPMs,removed,do what you want ill just use my second account
creepyPMs,removed,can you please stop replying kid
creepyPMs,removed,so youre asexual and still put yourself out there on internet dating apps which as far as i can see are used as little more than hook up tools you are looking for the companionship side of a relationship because theres undoubtedly services especially for that and i swear half the posts on this sub the message receiver is often so rude that i wish a plague of dick pics on them like responding just no to someone
creepyPMs,removed,i wonder howmaybe he searched and was curious which i would think of being okayish
creepyPMs,removed,the first message was kinda thats pretty heads on but alright i guess then the answer was more like okay year old child with fake profile i guess i mean this dude is supposed to be above wow
creepyPMs,removed,cast fetish wtf hahhaa
creepyPMs,removed,yeah boys can stay ignorant and get reported though fuck those guys
creepyPMs,removed,i mean to be fair hes not wrong
creepyPMs,removed,its not like i didnt ask questions to try and understand better im not trying to call out this individual really but address an issue my questions was really if youre asexual what do you go on plenty of fish to find truth of the matter is if youre rude to people they wont be nice back and i feel thats sometimes forgotten in this sub
creepyPMs,removed,fair enough however i dont think what i said is offensive in any way
creepyPMs,removed,wowzer you dont like questions at all if i have misunderstood asexuality then apologies but i have a friend who indentifies as asexual and doesnt do romantic dates at all so forgive me for not realising that some people do and my original point was surely theres services specifically for that so why would you choose plenty of fish which in my experience is for thirsty folk who are looking for something more than friendship so matey dont jump down peoples throats maybe if someone doesnt understand something help them understand instead of being convinced theyre a monster from the go for someone who i imagine considers themselves quite liberal youve not been very open minded with me yo
creepyPMs,removed,yeah that doesnt change you being sexist yeah boys can stay ignorant and get reported though fuck those guys is sexist
creepyPMs,removed,that is astrange conversation to be having over okcupid i mean i get that it is a social vector as well as a dating one but it seems like it should be easy to disengage with a person who clearly doesnt agree on a topic not making a judgment call on the choice to continue the conversation or anything its still pretty darn creepy for someone you barely know to engage you in gendersex discussion its like some stranger on the street walking up to me and asking me how i feel about using the opposite sexs bathroom its like who the hell are you whered you come from
creepyPMs,removed,when he used the word ladykind i imagined the following he smiles smugly thinking this will show her that i appreciate women as more than objects of sexual pursuits as well as highlight my intelligence the rolls of neck fat bearing whispy catlike hair glisten in the glow of his monitors instinctively he tips his triblyfedora and thinks to himself im a mlady killer she will be my bae
creepyPMs,removed,i did but im not sure if reddit considers it harrassment they let rphilosophyofrape and exist cuz free speech so who knows
creepyPMs,removed,more funny than creepy
creepyPMs,removed,can you pm me the thread i love watching idiots argue with mods
creepyPMs,removed,they will just ban you i reported and pedofriends and i got banned twice for random reasons
creepyPMs,removed,as opposed to the normal ones like hand holding
creepyPMs,removed,rpedofriends what in the absolute fuck
creepyPMs,removed,thankfully at least just got banned so ridiculous that it existed in the first place
creepyPMs,removed,not trying to troll but if youre not a cuddler and you dont want sex what else is there in more than friends
creepyPMs,removed,understanding is the first step to acceptance im not putting anyone on trial just a frank and genuinely interested question
creepyPMs,removed,but seriously what size boobs ya got
creepyPMs,removed,not what i meant if she gets off on guys busting nuts in her basket there is no telling what types of diseases she may have
creepyPMs,removed,well got banned about hrs ago
creepyPMs,removed,thats what pedofriends is sure there are probably creeps there but thats not encouraged and any illegal activity is reported i dont know why everyone here almost literally everyone assumes that reddit is just allowing people to trade cp target children etc i only found this out because it was pointed out to me but for some reason everyone is circle jerking that all pedos need to get shot or commit suicide even if they havent committed a crime and are seeking help something a redditor literally told me
creepyPMs,removed,what game did ya get
creepyPMs,removed,how is that creepy the guy wanted to ask the girl out he couldnt have known she was in a relationship and what other way could he have used that would have been ok and wasnt stalking as in coming to her house at some other time
creepyPMs,removed,then what do you do like seriously can you tell me one other avenue he could have taken to ask this girl out given that all he had was a phone number coming back later would be super creepy sending a message like hey im the guy that delivered pizza yesterday i thought you were pretty etc is worse than asking her immediately
creepyPMs,removed,wow lmao comments removed you are the worst type of sexist hating on a guy just for innocently asking a girl out enjoy never being able to find a partner with that foul attitude sexist scum im glad you wont be procreating any time soon
creepyPMs,removed,might just be me but this doesnt seem too creepy unless he kept messaging you
creepyPMs,removed,im guessing its just really deep insecurity its the only other reason beside culturalsocietal and those arent generally a problem enough to warrant this kind of response that a person would lash out like that rejection definitely sucks and i can see how it would reaffirm a persons belief they are flawed to the point where they feel like they need to lash out
creepyPMs,removed,seeing as how op didnt post page after page texts that went unreplied to and it looks he just apologized and dropped it id say he took rejection how one is supposed to
creepyPMs,removed,i honestly think its because guys have been taught since childhood that women can decide consciously whether or not they like someone or not truth is love is irrational youre not just going to tell someone hey i order you to love me and theyll love you you have to speak to their reptilian brain
creepyPMs,removed,at its base women only feel pure visceral attraction towards one kind of man
creepyPMs,removed,id definitely tell his manager just to nip that shit in the bud at the very least
creepyPMs,removed,shit sorry i forgot i was on reddit
creepyPMs,removed,welp i feel like a creep now please tell me in not the only one that checks an ops history when they reference another part of reddit
creepyPMs,removed,dude say what you will about him being a douche and all and he is but im definitely going to have to start using the word slag as an insult
creepyPMs,removed,its a very liberal website gender equality all races are equal kill all infants white people suck type of people you know
creepyPMs,removed,god you girls dont want a nice guy at all have fun being cheated and abused by a chad
creepyPMs,removed,he was being flirty and playful its probably only creepy because hes older and youre viewing him through a lens of entitlement hes just another lonely human being hoping to make a connection i dont understand how bad flirtingentitlement anyway hes not your cup of tea move on
creepyPMs,removed,ill remove the comment for now and will amend that when they reply
creepyPMs,removed,he messed with you you guys didnt mess with him
creepyPMs,removed,promises are what i do
creepyPMs,removed,thispathetic individual
creepyPMs,removed,why would women not simply state they are offended by that kind of behavior instead of trying to outwit those guys i mean you only play by his rules when you want to have the final word
creepyPMs,removed,how about you just ignore the moron the dude made up his own delusions to make himself feel better you had done enough already before you even wrote anything
creepyPMs,removed,wtf was that retard blabbering about do you even know him all that nonsense bragging i betcha hes a pitiful creep hidden behind his display jerking off as a first advice at the first sign of this kind of conversation simply blacklist them you save yourself a lot of time second advice keep your sht private like no public profile that way you will lose a lot of friends like the one presented and third nobody cares so why do you even give a second thought to that kind of creep if he was a real danger he wouldnt approach you that way hed stalk you for weeks then who knows forget this shtter he maybe even a yrs old kid
creepyPMs,removed,stooping to his level you are a much better person
creepyPMs,removed,thats kinda sad no joke
creepyPMs,removed,i just hope no one sees her reply and tries to do it in real life reddit can be silly sometimes it loves to upvote fantasy posts and ignore all common sense
creepyPMs,removed,incels have been around forever its just that with the advent of the internet theyve only recently started banding together to swap sob stories at the risk of receiving a trillion sarcastic notallincels responses i do have to point out that these forums attract a broad spectrum of folks falling under the incel category and some are worse than others as a former incel myself i sympathize with their plight but a lot of these guys responses to it aretroubling to say the least from my own perspective i shared the same experience ie my parents marriage ended when i was four was raised primarily by women and pretty severely abused by one but this is uncommon these guys have had and had extreme difficulties forming romantic attachments until i was well into my late this causes a lot more emotional distress than youd think especially since both sexes and anyone in between regard menmales that cant obtain sexual gratification or form romantic attachments with other people as complete losers women have the exact opposite problem judging by the posts on this sub and while i respect the difficulties they face in receiving too much or a frightening level of romantic attention not to mention stalkers murder rape etc theyve got to understand that the reverse is not true for guys an average or belowaverage looking girl will have very few difficulties in attracting someone they may not be the person that the woman is interested in but she has options nonetheless the same is not true for all dudestrust me speaking solely from personal experience and what i have gleaned in discussions with other people who share the same problems women particularly seem to find inexperienced guys completely unattractive the first time i attempted to date a girl everything went swimmingly until she asked me how long my longest relationship was and because i wanted to be honest i told her id never been in a relationship before i was she literally dumped me that night she wasnt the last to do so for the same reasons im definitely not blaming the victims of unsolicited comments like the one were all replying totrust me i agree this is absolutely wrong and uncalled forbut many of the guys on incel subs are ok people but do have problems and are looking for help unfortunately they seem to end up running into guys who have become bitter and jaded who paint all womens motivations as horrifyingly predatory because theyre not getting better advice anywhere else maybe instead of marginalizing incel people and painting them all with a broad loser brush we could be giving them sane answers to their questions or at least pointing them in a direction to where the could get them
creepyPMs,removed,as we speak i have my friend tracking you what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch ill have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on alquaeda and i have over confirmed kills i am trained in gorilla warfare and im the top sniper in the entire us armed forces you are nothing to me but just another target i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth mark my fucking words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet think again fucker as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking dead kid i can be anywhere anytime and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with my bare hands not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent you little shit if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue
creepyPMs,removed,yeah what do people expect when they accept friend requests from complete strangers
creepyPMs,removed,bring it bitch
creepyPMs,removed,not trying to be an asshole or anything but did neither of you honestly expect these sorts of messages seeing as how youre on a social network for fetishists
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt know keeping sticks up your ass was a fetish
creepyPMs,removed,fuck bitch
creepyPMs,removed,ugh use the right youre op come on
creepyPMs,removed,so whos creepier its a toss up
creepyPMs,removed,gynecomastia is no joke ok hold up it really is
creepyPMs,removed,thank god i only commented once and im only subbed to rthedonald for dank memes
creepyPMs,removed,dudes creepy but making fun of how much someone makes like that you just come off as a pretentious dick
creepyPMs,removed,no i didnt the sarcasm is what makes that a dickish statement
creepyPMs,removed,fake
creepyPMs,removed,youd be angry if your fiance said a girl was cute
creepyPMs,removed,its probably about a honestly some girls like it for novelty some girls just wanna try a big dick some girls hate it and you gotta be super gentle about it which is pretty boring tbh some girls are size queens and thats thats pretty cool
creepyPMs,removed,why are sexism sexualism and racism rightly shut down here but ageism is allowed to go unchecked i honestly dont understand this place should be stricter on bigotry
creepyPMs,removed,you just grab em by the pussy
creepyPMs,removed,all over this sub mainly in the titles of posts like this one age is for sure just a number having a preference is fine whatever that preference may be but shaming the preferences of others is not on i recently read a reddit post by a young woman saying that she had no interest in men under so how should that be defined here where men under are often called old or laughed at purely because of their age it isnt fair look any kind of bigotry should be reported and this wonderful subreddit keeps itself relatively clean but for some reason it is hyprocritical about ageisim
creepyPMs,removed,i feel like thats one step too far and kinda makes the original victim turn into a creep as well
creepyPMs,removed,it im there any chance hes just mistaken you for someone else
creepyPMs,removed,if you send a photo ill post it on reddit for everyone to see nobody is interested in your dick mate ive screenshotted it were all going to have a good laugh at it
creepyPMs,removed,the way he is talking is just so personal like hes telling the truth or thinks he is
creepyPMs,removed,he got you confused for a kardashian
creepyPMs,removed,my point is your replies make no fucking sense plus you still posted it on reddit just not the image
creepyPMs,removed,swagggggg
creepyPMs,removed,i liked it
creepyPMs,removed,thats not even creepy its just unbelievably stupid its kind of funny actually
creepyPMs,removed,lmao fucker is married but that was fun you must be hot
creepyPMs,removed,wow thank god there are guys like this doing the overly funnyoverly smartoverly trying too hard thingit makes us non aspergery normal dudes go from a potential swipe left to top prize
creepyPMs,removed,good job enforcing the rules
creepyPMs,removed,is this really creepy i think the dude was just trying and he was not over sexual or agressive so its just a failed atrempt to steer the corse of this friendship well the poll was childish and dumb
creepyPMs,removed,agreed of this wasnt a friendship can we have a real conversation what does feeling violated even mean and why does it objectively matter
creepyPMs,removed,just curious how often you respond about blowjobs lol and this dude clearly never had a girl hum a song while going to town or else he would be hearing songs and not being able to think
creepyPMs,removed,come on thats an hilarious message how did posting it on creepypms crossed your mind if youre both married
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,spend a lot of time discussing blowjobs online are you like the head lol of blowjobs or something
creepyPMs,removed,stop answering blowjob questionsthat simple
creepyPMs,removed,never said that so dont put words in my mouthguy
creepyPMs,removed,well just remember to hum lol sorry bout the creep though
creepyPMs,removed,how is it that youre fielding questions about bjs so often
creepyPMs,removed,that guy wasnt creepy he wasnt disrespectful or anything he didnt try to manipulate you not every single person youre not attracted to is automatically creepy because of that fact
creepyPMs,removed,i dont want to pry but how often are you answering blowjob related questions on reddit lol
creepyPMs,removed,im serious the vibrations are intense
creepyPMs,removed,niceness
creepyPMs,removed,this is awesome show him some dick
creepyPMs,removed,ive always been a fan of the cartman response sorry im not interested in being friends with midgets midgets piss me off frowny face
creepyPMs,removed,fb eskyp mot in law
creepyPMs,removed,things bother me about your writing skys should be skies please fix that i cant stand xd not that anyone cares but it just makes the conversations cleaner and easier to read
creepyPMs,removed,didnt see that skys wasnt yours apologize for that but the xd still pollutes the chat i never asked you to change it i just noted what i found was wrong with it
creepyPMs,removed,please explain how
creepyPMs,removed,that was part of the complaint about skys which i now understand is yours i never asked you to change xd
creepyPMs,removed,dene replying to you is the best way to back out when youve lost really subtle
creepyPMs,removed,except that this opinion isnt inappropriate a comment about your use of xd is completely different from i liek ur tits
creepyPMs,removed,im sorry but why exactly am i not allowed to give my opinion on something as simple as writing exactly in what way does this inconvenience you if you dont care about my opinion you can just ignore it and move on
creepyPMs,removed,assuming its a guys because theyre acting entitled to your bodyclassy
creepyPMs,removed,im confused is this fake
creepyPMs,removed,so i have to think anyone cares in order to post it why didnt you tell me earlier
creepyPMs,removed,this is literally the most pathetic convo i have ever seen from both sides
creepyPMs,removed,geeze not even slightly creepy
creepyPMs,removed,hes a dick because his is probably or something
creepyPMs,removed,you can as well ban me because this sub has turned into a joke that i personally no longer find funny this is now sub for humblebragging with the hugbox feature on
creepyPMs,removed,somehow op managed to outcringe this guy
creepyPMs,removed,but what ifi didnt
creepyPMs,removed,youre only wasting your own time huehuehue i sure pwned him
creepyPMs,removed,what if i told youop broke rule and
creepyPMs,removed,ha rtabletop just sayin try asking the community in both rboardgames and rtabletop if youre still feeling so indignant
creepyPMs,removed,embrace the penis
creepyPMs,removed,cool story
creepyPMs,removed,pedophilia is being normalised so a lot more people are actually pretending it is a valid normal sexual orientation unfortunately
creepyPMs,removed,i hope he falls dickfirst into a blender
creepyPMs,removed,sorry but i feel like you might have helped insinuate this
creepyPMs,removed,can i give a little advice if you want him to stop contacting you then stop responding to him obviously something is wrong with this guy and no mater what you say he wont listen all he is paying attention to is the that you are talking to him and not the content of what you are saying
creepyPMs,removed,lol fuckn nerdyou must be so fat and ugly boohoo
creepyPMs,removed,tell me where i judged the person in my comment maybe take a step back from your computer and read more carefully
creepyPMs,removed,asking if somebody is transgendered is now considered transphobic how was i doing any of the stuff you mentioned in any way it was a question relating to the post i did not judge anyone i didnt even state any opinion i simply asked a question please tell me specifically where i was being transphobic also i was not being a creep or flirting in the comments i dont even know how that relates to what i asked i simply asked a question yes it had to do with transgendered identity or identifying as a transgendered person but in no way was i transphobic by asking that
creepyPMs,removed,definitely less than the number of matches it would take for me to set that house of yours on fire
creepyPMs,removed,funny yes ineffective very creepy not so much
creepyPMs,removed,lol what i dont even post there but this is the stupidest thing ive ever heard unsubscribed bye felicia
creepyPMs,removed,no cause who cares
creepyPMs,removed,too bad for that feminism is an idea with holes
creepyPMs,removed,this subreddit will always be a bunker i think you misspelled echochamber
creepyPMs,removed,you must have had a lot of fun writing that
creepyPMs,removed,if theyre asking for it its specific solicited thats what the word means unsolicited means they didnt ask for it it wasnt solicited
creepyPMs,removed,its taken up countless hours doing so what is so bad about your life that you would prioritize this as the most important thing to spend countless hours on
creepyPMs,removed,why because i spent several seconds asking if someone who is obviously in distress would like to talk about it
creepyPMs,removed,yes i was offering support in a support sub you are obviously not happy on a fundamental level would you like to talk about it
creepyPMs,removed,embrace the penis
creepyPMs,removed,you probably know this already but from what little i can see you actually have a very pretty face
creepyPMs,removed,ive seen this fetish in action over at rwtf once just be glad youre only reading about it
creepyPMs,removed,okay we have a dual fb so he can be on facebook but not on his own he doesnt get his own until he is old enough and mature enough if anything your post proves that even the age of is too young to have any kind of social media account especially the fact that someones embarrassing encounter is going to be posted on another site for upvotes by someone who claims to be their friend i will take your advice and take my son off fb i would hate for something he found embarrassing to be posted on another site by one of his friends because they want upvotes thank you for showing me that social media is not safe nor okay for any minor whatsoever
creepyPMs,removed,some of you just get trolled and take it so seriously lol
creepyPMs,removed,i am sure i can i keep a hawk eye on him because i dont want predators to manipulate him im glad your friend is smart enough to keep sickos from manipulating her i have learned that even is not old enough for any minor to have their own social media account might sound harsh but it is better than giving a predator the chance to manipulate my child i am sorry that you do not understand why i want to supervise my sons social media accounts but i am going to continue to do so until he is older and mature enough to handle sickos like the one your friend dealt with when you are a parent you can manage their online life in your own way and if you want to just give them and anyone who might contact them all your trust to do the right thing and make all the right decisions be my guest your friend was smart to react the way she did but maybe she should have reported the instance to the authorities rather than share it as something simply creepy or funny for someone to make a reddit post about
creepyPMs,removed,are so right i should totally listen to you about my parenting
creepyPMs,removed,was your friend posting pics of herself masturbating on the internet maybe parents should be aware of that are you even old enough to be showing yourself online like that maybe you parents should know
creepyPMs,removed,maybe set a better example for your friends
creepyPMs,removed,i would rather be a helicopter parent than have someone like you get ahold of my son online you claim concern for your friend yet all of your posts are either you or someone else nude andor performing sexual acts if you are someone your friend looks up to maybe you should try and be a better role model i would hate to find out that your posts are getting back around to your young friend and her thinking that posts like yours are the norm
creepyPMs,removed,i get that everyone has different ideas on whats sexy and plenty of people have strange and unusual fetishesbut damn
creepyPMs,removed,bitch
creepyPMs,removed,im not saying hes not an asshat but the second definition i found of babe basically said an attractive lady its meant that since the or probably that girl is a babe
creepyPMs,removed,op got trolled
creepyPMs,removed,damn the pm is not so creepy but the person who sent it sure does seem like one from your description the title and content doesnt come close to showing how creepy it must have been to receive it
creepyPMs,removed,telling the creep thats gonna be shared with the rest of the internet or this is going straight on reddit is a tad cringey
creepyPMs,removed,guys are so stupid like what does he have go go gadget arms or something
creepyPMs,removed,both of you are cringe seems like op was desperately trying to get a response
creepyPMs,removed,there probably isnt that many people out there that are ok with a vomit fetish hes got no time for getting to know people besides i think id rather know up front someone is a sick bastard not after i develop feelings for them
creepyPMs,removed,even though they werent forcing me to participate then what does it matter
creepyPMs,removed,wanting to eat someones vomit daily classifies you as a sick bastard in my book perhaps you feel differently and thats fine many people have a fetish thats fine i myself have some but eating someones vomit is disturbing to me they might be a fine upstanding citizen im not hating the person im just repulsed by there actions in this one aspect of their life
creepyPMs,removed,i was perfectly civil to the op although you seem to be an utter cretin fwiw
creepyPMs,removed,maybe he has turrets
creepyPMs,removed,i got ten pages in and she was still sending him hearts and initiating contact so i gave up
creepyPMs,removed,why would you even respond fuck that man i would have told him to stop being a creep the first time he tried to spam me
creepyPMs,removed,im sorry but i fail to see when he turned into a child after being rejected as well as the part of you being ghosted was a there a point in time where the both of you have texted before since being ghosted means when a person expresses love interest or affection for someone or something and the person they are speaking to only says ditto but then again that definition is from urban dictionary so i dont know how legit that is and in the texts both of you seem uninterested in each other as well as seeing you start the confrontation out of no where since he politely understood if you didnt want to waste your time with him and since youre basing your decisions likewise what your child would wouldt that in turn make you think like a child i dont know i just have trouble seeing when he acts like an asshole hopefully you understand what im trying to say
creepyPMs,removed,he sounds pretty polite and wellspoken id probably chill out with him
creepyPMs,removed,you seem awfully pessimistic
creepyPMs,removed,okay we have different opinions then
creepyPMs,removed,yeah im sure the manager is going to give a flying fuck about a harmless text message lmao that will definitely be productive
creepyPMs,removed,i dont need to have worked in a pizza place to know that this is a serious matter in any business this is a serious matter but i still would bet that this kid wouldnt get more than a slap on the wrist and a dont do it again i could be wrong maybe this place has better management than the places ive worked for
creepyPMs,removed,dont give him any reason to think maybe there is a chance just straight up flat out tell him to leave you alone
creepyPMs,removed,trollllll baited
creepyPMs,removed,sorry i offended you feminist
creepyPMs,removed,sorry i offended you feminist
creepyPMs,removed,why did you have to go and generalize men as a stereotype im male and i wouldnt put my damn phone number on a craigslist ad in a million years
creepyPMs,removed,given what youve posted elsewhere about your abuse this is like tripleplusungood we should anally rape him so he learns some respect humanity is fffffffuuuuuuucked
creepyPMs,removed,you were leading him on op these people can only be stopped if you block them and its strange that you didnt block them right away unless you purposefully led him to doing what he did just to post here these people are deranged
creepyPMs,removed,why even bother replying to such an idiot
creepyPMs,removed,oh stop with your bullshit you cant just assume someone would instantly want her to be mutilatesld if she did go along with his proposals she wouldve sent him some pics he wouldve gotten off and disappeared forever your stories of kidnapping and mutilations are complete horseshit statistically you have the same chance to die in a typical tuesday school shooting in america
creepyPMs,removed,i just want to point out that she admits to rejecting him for completely superficial reasons but it all worked out because he turned out to be a jerk anyways
creepyPMs,removed,view remaining images come on why would you not jut block them from the get go
creepyPMs,removed,it felt like you were greneralizing all egyptian males thats why i commented in the first place sorry if i misunderstood you also i dont know whats the point in making such a big fuss about some internet messages
creepyPMs,removed,hard to tell from the little info the messages have besides that hes pretty thirsty but he could just want to grab a drink sometime hope it all works out in the end for ya
creepyPMs,removed,be civil and supportive id be happy to if it were someone that was genuinely concerned with a creepy pm this is someone thats been sent loads of clearly creepy pms and yet strung it out well beyond the point of reason solely to generate internet points he fucking came on himself and they kept going for at least images consisting of multiple pms whoring at its finest
creepyPMs,removed,its the guys own fault his second text should have been i am a transasian and you are oppressing me by not allowing me to eat your pussy which is part of my culture you dont have to be attractive just kind of funny
creepyPMs,removed,out of curiosity why did you accept his request lol
creepyPMs,removed,at least they had some selfawareness and didnt seem too pushy
creepyPMs,removed,tbh just have fun with it he is a guy on the internet dont take it so personally people like that have more problems with their life so they want to take it out on other people
creepyPMs,removed,he has a fetish and made a request i fail to see how this is creepy seemed pretty respectful especially when i noted that if its too weird its fine if you pass he knows his fetish is weird and since its kinda specific im sure its a hard thing to come by he could have been a lot more unpleasant
creepyPMs,removed,its like so many forms of pretension and self opinionated overly sensitive people i had anxiety reading this whole thing the grammar the offense taken from being called things youre practically asking for dudes to call you pet names by saying you hate it
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think they want them to or should but if youre subscribed here you would see that like no one respects that just dont have a dating profile up if you dont wanna get creeped on dudes are creepy
creepyPMs,removed,lol you guys are exaggerating this so much all im saying is you said it on your profile so of course some creeps are gonna think its cute or funny to do it actually seeing as they already have no standards for what they say
creepyPMs,removed,literally all your posts are creepy guys texting you maybe theres a correlation you clearly browse this subreddit you know dudes creep it seems like youre just using it for karma if you constantly get harassed doing certain things then dont do them anymore
creepyPMs,removed,so fedupwithcreeps but keeping it up for karma pharmimg
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think he meant harm a little over reactive
creepyPMs,removed,what do people expect when they whore themselves on the net like this they gave in to the most base drive of all the people who posts the pictures should be publicly shamed its a great tragedy for our societies that this is considered acceptable in modern times
creepyPMs,removed,cant you just block him
creepyPMs,removed,holy christ on a cracker how is this normal to come out this shitsticks hands and be typed does this fucking fool do this all the time cause if so you have a patience that is admirable dis boy needs a good axe in the mouth i tell you hwat
creepyPMs,removed,yeah this guy clearly has issues
creepyPMs,removed,youre on fl what do you honestly expect
creepyPMs,removed,why accept the request
creepyPMs,removed,does doesnt seem creepy to me
creepyPMs,removed,ill never understand why girls dont just delete the first message and move on i never wasted any energy on anyone i wasnt interested in
creepyPMs,removed,of gibe nudes ples and idont tell anyone did it really happen jk just trolling adn u feell for it
creepyPMs,removed,tinder is the dtf app theres loads of dating sites not any casual dating sites around so dont complain tinder is like that its just filling a void in peoples needs
creepyPMs,removed,lol
creepyPMs,removed,aaah the good ol tom thumb fetish cool
creepyPMs,removed,bipolar is not like this please dont use it to insult people
creepyPMs,removed,because apparently being soaked in discharge and boob sweat is sexy
creepyPMs,removed,he seems nice maybe im missing something
creepyPMs,removed,i have seen people on tinder then happened across them somewhere else it was not seeking though just by chance messaging on the second platform actually got a conversation going that said it was not facebook thoughso that adds a little to the creepiness
creepyPMs,removed,try report block him hes not worth it do it to evey person that sends you a similar message sorry
creepyPMs,removed,if youre attractive enough youd be surprised
creepyPMs,removed,tbh on tinder some girls like these terrible pickup lines and theres often very little other info to start a conversation with this one crossed the line between bad in a funny way and bad in a creepy way though
creepyPMs,removed,sure its rude but it should be expected
creepyPMs,removed,why shouldnt it
creepyPMs,removed,triggered
creepyPMs,removed,meetme with a husband tho because
creepyPMs,removed,that dude was drunk as fuck source am drunk as fuck
creepyPMs,removed,i dont even think this is creepy i am dying in my chair reading that
creepyPMs,removed,im all for you doing you op buttt you kind of responded to that guy with a little to much he just asked if you had any kids and you reply saying you hate em given he was also out of line but just a piece of friendly advice dont just come out with that line if someones being polite and asking if you have kids just say no i do not if they push further then you could say that you dont want any but that guy was definitely being a jerk definitely rude of him
creepyPMs,removed,i wonder if it was an attempt at awkward humor
creepyPMs,removed,yeah you should definitely report that to the police he straight up threatened you at the end
creepyPMs,removed,yeah but if hes talking to you this way theres no saying how hes talking to other girls just send these screen caps to the local pds page
creepyPMs,removed,screenshot and send to family members on his facebook
creepyPMs,removed,yeah but it would inconvenience him so why not
creepyPMs,removed,i dont see why he would waste his time when she has a fiance and eh he has a point lmao girls clothes is way too revealing haha idk why everyone is obsessed with ass
creepyPMs,removed,both of you sound like people no one should mess with
creepyPMs,removed,wow living proof that the gene pool needs a good spin cycle
creepyPMs,removed,you are an idiot for replying to him past the why not yeah hes an idiot but so are you
creepyPMs,removed,you couldve just blocked him both sides acted childish
creepyPMs,removed,these are the type of friend request you should just ignore seems like a massive waste of time stringing him along
creepyPMs,removed,so when is your first date
creepyPMs,removed,both of you sound like people no one should mess with
creepyPMs,removed,what do you mean that all white men are pedophiles
creepyPMs,removed,dont quit your day job sweetheart
creepyPMs,removed,if someone feels so terribly ashamed when random people doesnt applaud their weird sexual fetishes perhaps do not share them on the internet
creepyPMs,removed,how should he refer to a girl who uses reddit to post her body parts for internet points
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair not that this guy really deserves it could be english is not his first or best language
creepyPMs,removed,well you were being a bit of an uncalled for bitch you couldve just said im not into pet names like you saying hey beautiful is a form of a pet name please dont do that maybe he did read your profile but im sure youre not the only girl he spoke to on there so if he made a mistake you dont need to jump down his throat just correct him if he doesnt respect you after that then he is disrespecting you and then bitchiness is called for you dont need to have such an attitude i date online too and am a girl been through all these guys but i just ignore them if i dont like how they said hey i dont go full blown bitch looking like a psycho like half the people here do you all need to simmer down men can be rude and disgusting pigs been through shit with them too but it doesnt mean you can behave like a bitch as well and go off on them when you dont like how they said hey seriously just ignore them if you truly dont care about random people online judging you then you wouldnt have posted this you also wouldnt have responded to him and you wouldnt have been so defensive so you do care people who truly dont give a fuck actually dont give a fuck to anyone
creepyPMs,removed,posts on this sub havent been so creepy lately is rrejectionpics a thing
creepyPMs,removed,here is my imagination running wild perhaps his wage emasculates him on a regular basis puts him down nags him makes him feel less of a man as a result he has a fantasy of humiliating her or putting her down by the one area she is insecure about he gets off on the idea of other women making fun of her and degrading her or his wife has petite breasts and he really wants her to get breast augmentation breast implants he hopes by gathering other peoples opinions he can say even xxx says that your bra size is flat chested to maybe manipulate her into getting a breast enlargement well those are my theories because it was bizarre
creepyPMs,removed,honestly thus is the kind of banter i have with some of my female friends and its totally fine but the backpedalling made this one million times worse if he misread a situation like that then its time to stop
creepyPMs,removed,i know im on creepypms and this shit doesnt really fly here but i think youre really just putting words in his mouth and this isnt really all that creepy
creepyPMs,removed,im not saying it isnt im just saying this conversation isnt so creepy as to translate to i am a creepy loser from just these messages this guy seems very civil for a creep and i think calling him a loser that women his age cant put up with is a bit much
creepyPMs,removed,if this is a guy he is a creep if its a girl you go girl
creepyPMs,removed,are we talking about a year old or a year old how old exactly is this teenager
creepyPMs,removed,well it definitely matters if its a year old child or a year old adult whos the creep now check mate motherfucker
creepyPMs,removed,my uncle is literally years older than my aunt he wasnt fucking her when she was a child they obviously met later on in life have kids theyre married and pretty happy wtf is your point
creepyPMs,removed,i agree with most of what you say im pretty and i wouldnt mess with any one under mostly for drinking in public reasons but also because i know there will be nothing we have in common and i will be pulling out my hair shell be snap chat ing her chicken tenders or something stupid i just wouldnt do it but i feel like some of you are being pretty mean to this guy as long as she is or i see nothing wrong him trying he wasnt super aggressive or anything from what i read
creepyPMs,removed,do you believe the things you type moron
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt cringe you got triggered ya goof
creepyPMs,removed,eh you just seem twatty to be honest you couldve just not answered its not uncommon that people are reasonable if some doesnt meet there stipulations
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think anyone has a problem with her turning him down and i dont like his last comment its kind of petty and despite what facebook thinks i dont think being petty is a good quality to have as far as the last stuff you were saying you kind of lost me i wasnt trying to oppress you but happy cake day i think thats what that slice of cake next to your name means anyway idk
creepyPMs,removed,hes a creep because he tried to talk to a girl who wasnt interested in him and you just get to decide that words having meanings whats happening to the world
creepyPMs,removed,wouldnt say its that creepy maybe the guy just wants a friend you are giving short ass replies tbf
creepyPMs,removed,youre basically saying fuck how anyone else feels its all about how i feel i cant get behind that way of thinking by some of the comments ive reads you people are acting like this dudes a fucking rapist in his spare time we dont know him for all we know he may be but just judging the post i dont see anything that badand for the record i really dont care how he feels im more just speaking on principle
creepyPMs,removed,ohhh cause i was kind of defending the creep what kind of bubble world are we living in that we only allow comments from people who agree with everything we say alright im leaving im not mad im just disappointed
creepyPMs,removed,what does it say about me im trying to become more self aware id like to know how people view me honestly
creepyPMs,removed,i think he did nothing wrong if anything op was the one being a dick
creepyPMs,removed,selling nudes makes you a strange person so yeahyou had this coming lol
creepyPMs,removed,i mean fair enough i dont care about the downvotes and if i did i would have definitely not posted yeah idk this exchange is just very mild imo and my problems were just with words literally being put in this persons mouth with the translation
creepyPMs,removed,why did she keep talking to him
creepyPMs,removed,okay i thought we had already covered this
creepyPMs,removed,now youre putting words in my mouth i never asked why am i getting downvoted
creepyPMs,removed,hes a janitor on the internet he does it for free he takes his job very seriously
creepyPMs,removed,im trying to come up with a clever line about this dude being in the closet or something but im drawing a blank here
creepyPMs,removed,oh my god this guy is hilarious i cant even stand it
creepyPMs,removed,use a dildojerk yourself off lmao
creepyPMs,removed,i dont intend to sound mean but this is kinda funny considering ops error in her title
creepyPMs,removed,youve gotta know that people will react like this though right im not saying that its ok to say stuff like that but id think it would sort of come with the territory a lot of people are uncomfortable by this sort of stuff myself included im not saying i think it should be illegal or anything like that but yeah it makes me uncomfortable by all means do what makes you happy but you know there will be people that react that way before you transition correct again im not making excuses for them but you have to remember that you made this choice knowing full well people would say things like that
creepyPMs,removed,you kind of seemed triggered yourself
creepyPMs,removed,triggering intensifies
creepyPMs,removed,thats what i thought too this sort of reminds me of how some africanamerican women believe that all husband cheat makes me wonder if this guy was molested by all his male relatives
creepyPMs,removed,soo op why not buy super cheap stockings and sell them for a lot of cash to this guy like a deal in gangster movies with suitcases suits and sunglasses lets do it
creepyPMs,removed,pretty sure mens rights boards are the ones who say men arent automatically rapists if anything this would be a form of extremist feminism aka misandry
creepyPMs,removed,as far as i know by definition they actually cant its sexual abuse or something
creepyPMs,removed,ah okay that makes way more sense
creepyPMs,removed,so nobody hates men
creepyPMs,removed,k
creepyPMs,removed,this has to be fake i mean no one is that much of a fuckwitt at least thats what id like to believe
creepyPMs,removed,well obviously not replying wasnt working in any way at all i mean surely something like just saying something simple like sorry you dont attract me message me again and youre blocked is gonna give them a clear message and at least in this case surely it was worth a try no
creepyPMs,removed,yes and
creepyPMs,removed,hello complete stranger impress me wow what a fucking twat
creepyPMs,removed,how exactly does this belong in creepy pms
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think this is creepy just because hes older than you
creepyPMs,removed,why are you pretending to be a dolphin on the internet
creepyPMs,removed,not sure why this is under creepy pms it seems like he engaged you in a dolphin related discussion and you play along both parties seem weird but nothing creepy
creepyPMs,removed,i have a couple of hot aunts when i was a teenager i used to rub their feet such good memories
creepyPMs,removed,ah the elusive selfcreep
creepyPMs,removed,i would of sucked his dick straight up
creepyPMs,removed,how old are you how old is he i am in the minority i think but i dont care for getting all sexual with someone i never even met if i hope on meeting the person get sexual afterwards once you actually know who you are talking to
creepyPMs,removed,yea idk why im being down voted i just would of handled the situation differently
creepyPMs,removed,im my ex wife is years younger than me i am find with year olds guys like younger girls for the most part but i am in a different place emotionally to deal with young girls i just went speed dating and now have for the most part stop trying to message people with the online dating sites i found it much more my style doing real life speed dating than to continue trying to be clever on okcupid at this point my messages are now just hi can we date please im really nice
creepyPMs,removed,i get it i have a kid to i used to be the guy rejecting women with kids and now i am getting rejected for having a kid im ok with that i goto the age range speed dating even though i am i think i look a little younger than though guys are just spamming mass amounts of women in hope for a reply so there are not too concerned about your age preference i used to do that i am having a lot better time with meetups in the city so i lost a lot of that energy i had to write women everyday on match have you tried events like meetup or you prefer online
creepyPMs,removed,maybe you should reply and tell him no wow
creepyPMs,removed,from your post history of insulting people of other races particularly whites i can see why youre treated poorly you act no better than the people you despise try being less racist and people will treat you nicer
creepyPMs,removed,i feel bad for him he has a crush on you you should tell him youre not available for a relationship or something or like another guy etc give him some closure so he can move on
creepyPMs,removed,no attack just trying to help op out its not my intention to hurt anyone
creepyPMs,removed,you seem to be stretching the guidelines to fit me in whatever feel free to block me from this sub im unsubscribing from it anyway after this post the mods here seem to favor racism anyway
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know why this appeared on this sub seems like a pretty good deal to me
creepyPMs,removed,we get it you have low self esteem
creepyPMs,removed,i would have agreed to his conditions for the occasional loot box or two
creepyPMs,removed,come on this is obviously a joke did someone actually think this was serious
creepyPMs,removed,it obviously is a joke im not sure how anyone can be dull enough not to get it
creepyPMs,removed,honestly this guy is obviously using pua techniques to hide his horrific selfdoubt and social anxiety hell i almost fell bad for him almost these arent pua techniques this is either a joke i hope or someone that took girls only go for assholes to an extreme level which shows such a staggering lack of selfawareness that you could probably convince a cheap psychologist to diagnose for
creepyPMs,removed,are you shitting me right now you literally only have to read lines of text to realize that this is not real i knew this sub was going downhill but this is something else
creepyPMs,removed,no thats more like trp
creepyPMs,removed,this person has unprecedented levels of aspergers
creepyPMs,removed,he probably doesnt im about sure this is a troll
creepyPMs,removed,it was on twitch and the wording of it is a bit wierd cmon this is a troll
creepyPMs,removed,blatant sexism what the fuck are you one of those deluded feminist people
creepyPMs,removed,do you seriously think that i give a shit about whether some deluded sjw thinks im an asshole you cherry picking the first line of text and then ignoring the rest just proves how stupid this is now go back to tumblr and cry about the patriarchy or someshit i dont care
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,you should probably consider killing yourself op
creepyPMs,removed,pretty sure this is a guy with a weird sense of humor shooting blanks into the void for fun alternately there could quite possibly be a few women out there who are looking for a dom to humiliate and marginalize them theres a kink for every trauma
creepyPMs,removed,hes not my alt but okay should probably expect to make some enemies when you call for the genocide of an entire gender
creepyPMs,removed,shhhhh
creepyPMs,removed,pleeese for the love of god let us have his battle net
creepyPMs,removed,obvious troll is obvious but why acknowledge the troll when we can act all righteously indignant instead
creepyPMs,removed,this is clearly a joke imo i refuse to think someone will hit so many cringe targets perfectly
creepyPMs,removed,fake and gay see what i did there
creepyPMs,removed,im not going to call it dangerous logic because thats retarded and almost contradictory terminology but its pretty silly to equate this guy to a rapist and a murderer or the user youre responding to as near rapemurder victim blaming simply because hes considering someone else might be trolling on an account that isnt theirs i mean i dont think thats an accurate assessment either this is probably a legit message but this come on textbook slippery slope lol
creepyPMs,removed,i never said she shouldnt report it i said equating this to a violent crime is a textbook slippery slope and its even worse that youre accusing people of being potential victim blamers or somehow potentially complacent in violent crimes that havent been committed simply because they suggest an alternative explanation you very much have made leaps you seem to be projecting the source of your knowledge of fallacies
creepyPMs,removed,this has probably worked for him in the past
creepyPMs,removed,not an argument
creepyPMs,removed,do you know what creepy means
creepyPMs,removed,why do you allow posts like these on your subreddit are you trying to make another rkenm or do you prefer people to play dumb and circlejerk eachother
creepyPMs,removed,nerds
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt a creepy pm for a german its completely normal
creepyPMs,removed,let me get this straight you didnt block him so you would have more shit to show your friends on reddit
creepyPMs,removed,ur just a really dumb broad and at least girl talk pls just some of the many obviously male statements the pressure and coercion the refusal to accept no for an answer the but hurt and name calling the acting like some porn star talking dirty all these markers and more show that this is no female this was just a guy trying to get a real woman to tell dirty sex stories for him to masturbate too disgusting pathetic manipulative horrible person alsois false toe nails a thing
creepyPMs,removed,i hate that this dick triggered you your feelings emotions and thoughts didnt matter to this despicable person they only cared about using you for their own selfish reasons which is unacceptable objectification when you told them to stop they pushed for more times like this i want to reverse search their email or number and find their facebook to post what they wrote for their friends and family to read about what a terrible person they truly are
creepyPMs,removed,lol how do you know those women you have seen are not really men behind the keyboard how do you know that the evidence that women do not take no for an answer is based on text that could be written by men just a thought really this level of pushy behaviour is so typical of a male as you agree however whilst i have not personally ever seen another woman act this way i suppose anything is possible after all could women also be part of rape culture not respecting no
creepyPMs,removed,i think he knows that many people see drag queens as fabulous exagerated caricature of a woman often the main stream acceptance cross dressers wear just aspects of womens clothing such as panties transvestite try to pass as a real woman head to toes those who are cross dressers and transvestites are not as accepted as drag queens often they keep their dressing as a secret life finally there are sissy fetish types who enjoy being feminized and forced to wear classic girly colours and fabrics in lingerie clothing to me this guy was easing you into to being open to either him being a cross dresser transvestite or sissy depending on your reaction to the question
creepyPMs,removed,get the fuck out i got sucked into a relationship with this type of person last year and it completely fucked up my life her neediness is a bit annoying but its nice to feel wanted right then she wants to know where you are then what youre doing then who youre with how do you know them is it another girl are you cheating on her oh look now you have to do whatever she says for a week to make it up to her and youre never allowed to talk to that lying whore again why didnt you respond when she texted you five minutes ago youre hanging out with your friends why are they more important than her do you not like her anymore oh look now you have to respond within thirty seconds to every text or she sulks all day do you want her to send nudes no why not dont you think shes pretty why do you not want her nobody loves her do they she might as well kill herself now oh look now you have to acquiesce to her every sexual need or she threatens suicide eventually shell have severed all of your toes to anyone but her and youll be trapped until she dies you die or you finally get the courage to get out and start putting back the pieces of your ruined life stop talking to her now before its too late
creepyPMs,removed,kinkshaming is my kink
creepyPMs,removed,its a little weird that youd accept his friend request in the first place
creepyPMs,removed,why is the middle bit slightly darker and doesnt have the block them and report links also why do the first two say seen and the last one seen at
creepyPMs,removed,lololol til girls can respond to lewd messages but not the lame generic ones
creepyPMs,removed,your time line captions were almost as nauseating as the dudes messages
creepyPMs,removed,creepy yes but you arent exactly being blatant
creepyPMs,removed,genuine question how did i violate rule i feel like i was very civil and wasnt unsupportive i just didnt agree with the op
creepyPMs,removed,why didnt you just block them
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,can i suck on your clit
creepyPMs,removed,it depends on their interpretation of creepy i dont think the message itself is creepy maybe given more context it could be like if creepy to them is leaving love notes around sos apartment or surprising them at work with flowers and lunch it depends on the level of intimacy of the relationship too if theyve been going together for only a short period of time or for awhile its not aggressive or unwanted sexual advances just a kinda abstract idea
creepyPMs,removed,the image and comments seem to have disappeared from imgur but from memory you didnt strongly object when your no was ignored and you continued the conversation
creepyPMs,removed,do you have any real body shots on your profile not that it makes it ok but it still seems so weird to me that guys pull this stuff out of thin air like if there was a single bikini pic or one that showed your stomach i could at least think that they saw skin and hormones took over but i just cant understand this mentality
creepyPMs,removed,doxing is a really shitty thing to do even to shitty people
creepyPMs,removed,was he not smiling in his pic did he have a creepy looking mustache
creepyPMs,removed,i did not think this was a supportive sub i thought it was meant to laugh at people im soooo sorry for the misunderstanding i pray you find it in your heart to forgive me
creepyPMs,removed,this post made me erect
creepyPMs,removed,my post i dont see how suggesting that he is socially awkward and that maybe calling him a creeper is a bit harsh is violating any of the rules i didnt use any profanity and i didnt attack anyone am i missing something i actually like this subreddit alot and most of the posts i read here are truly creepy this one imo just was a socially inept and was hiding his true feelings with crappy jokes and dumb percentages
creepyPMs,removed,you must have a phenomenal neck
creepyPMs,removed,this has to be some grade a failed negging ops is cute i can only imagine the troglodyte keyboard warrior trying his super cool totally going to work pickup tactics
creepyPMs,removed,seems like you are a bitch instead of being straight and clear you just messing with him to take this pic and post it here and of course all the sex deprived redditors will upvote because you are a grill pathetic
creepyPMs,removed,not so much creepy this guy just seems like a dick
creepyPMs,removed,if i had that conversation id feel proud about myself first manly convo ive seen here in a bit yeah i know ill get down its for this down vote away my opinion my consequence
creepyPMs,removed,you failed
creepyPMs,removed,this guy does not know how to flirt but your oh comment isnt really making it better you are really putting him down i mean you matched right you could have gone haha thanks that would have made it clear that you were not interested you could have asked you were not doing well before but oh is just terribly arrogant and offputting in my opinion i mean you are on a dating app am i the only one that thinks this is not a creepy pm this is clearly a dating app they matched the conversation sucked and the op starting trolling the poor guy
creepyPMs,removed,at first i was like damn that person is boring but then i found you interesting would send you meaningless sexual innuendos
creepyPMs,removed,i would not advise using the text them random crap until they get bored and leave routine in general i think it might just encourage most guys
creepyPMs,removed,great i fucked up to
creepyPMs,removed,yikes i get that he ended up going off the deep end but you were rcringepics material from the very start too
creepyPMs,removed,thats not really a creepy pm more like a depressingly bizarre pm
creepyPMs,removed,ms thank you theres no need for her to teee heee at him he wasnt being creepy or unfriendly or overbearing in the slightest in his first few messages he was being friendly not i was just paying her a compliment via my friendly—actual friendly and for whatever reason her response was totally frigid oh is an obnoxious response as is just oh okay and then we find out that her problem with what he said is that it didnt move the conversation forward at all to me thats just such an uppity response you didnt move the conversation forward enough so im going to stop it dead in its tracks id understand the way she responded if hed led with something sexual or overbearing or inappropriate in any way shape or formbut he didnt he was polite composed and totally inoffensive if a little boring that doesnt merit an obnoxious response
creepyPMs,removed,damn both of these people are annoying the s to the big meat stick and neither of them actually committing to a specific topic
creepyPMs,removed,since im always curious when i see in response to picture of myself so i had a peek as a woman im jealous as a bi im awestruck
creepyPMs,removed,so now were just haggling over your price
creepyPMs,removed,in fairness your friend russ sounds like a condescending jerk too so
creepyPMs,removed,i think youre just as weird for putting in all that effort to type those long ass messages
creepyPMs,removed,my bad wooh you go girl tell em atta girl well done op everything youve done in life is great and beautiful and youre a model human being yeah
creepyPMs,removed,its pretty easy to call everyone who does not act like a leftist college activist edgy to disregard their opinion isnt it
creepyPMs,removed,id say go for it op weird people who converse like that are usually pale hotties in a nerdy kind of way but still sleep with one eye open just in case
creepyPMs,removed,traveling does not make someone an interesting person
creepyPMs,removed,he seems perfectly forthright in his introduction he wasnt disrespectful he just politely let you know he was looking for a hookup wasnt trying to guilt you or anything is it because hes a man hes creepy if a girl messages this and replaced i like boobs with i like abs shed be independent and applauded for having a voracious sexual appetite
creepyPMs,removed,you may be interested in the travels but someone could travel and have all the personality of a potato thats all im saying
creepyPMs,removed,most posts in this subreddit arent really that creepy this one definitely is wtf
creepyPMs,removed,i love this respect for creepers pronouns
creepyPMs,removed,ive seen creepier
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand why he wasnt blocked straight away theres years of this dude
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,that and
creepyPMs,removed,nah to out creep a creep you gotta go thermonuclear pregnant with your child would probably make him happy somehow
creepyPMs,removed,of course he lives in seattle and of course he poses for the same picture over and over in the same place this dude is living in his own world in a frightening way
creepyPMs,removed,and they help hide his jowls right
creepyPMs,removed,you seem like a bit of an asshole the guy was just trying to give you a compliment
creepyPMs,removed,for what having an opinion
creepyPMs,removed,why dont you just block him
creepyPMs,removed,probably a schizophrenic it would definitely explain why he seems to be having a conversation with nobody
creepyPMs,removed,sounds like youre discriminating
creepyPMs,removed,show this to your local police and ask what to do next the sooner you handle this the less difficult it will be should he finally meet you one day
creepyPMs,removed,what page was it
creepyPMs,removed,block him duh
creepyPMs,removed,but also op for posting this is retarded not realizing it was a copy pasta and also this isint even creepy
creepyPMs,removed,i dont see why youre complaining about my comment when the real problem is ops uncensored screenshots i didnt post his name or a link to his profile or anything else that makes it any easier to find this guy so what exactly did i do wrong
creepyPMs,removed,i would definitely report this to the mail company
creepyPMs,removed,someones getting sacked you know with a mail sack wheeey seriously though report him to his employer this is inappropriate on so many levels
creepyPMs,removed,the white edge on the right triggered me so hard
creepyPMs,removed,you should just chris hansen this dude invite him in have cookies or sunny d on the table and pop out say shes and see if you can get him to wet his pantaloons
creepyPMs,removed,report him to his employers this is misuse of information that get gets from the job definitely inappropriate and certainly against his job rules
creepyPMs,removed,lol as far as getting messages from strangers goes that was the tamest one ive seen so far
creepyPMs,removed,i mean millennials are like strictly democrats lol
creepyPMs,removed,i never said the guy was tame i said his message was
creepyPMs,removed,what was it
creepyPMs,removed,tell your sister to sort her facebook settings out nobody should be able to find her based on her address thats crazy and she needs to deal with that immediately send this to the mail company his message was nice he seems like hes probably a decent guy but lonely and fancies his chances with a younger woman but its one of the least professional things ive ever seen and it needs dealing with from above id be having words with him myself too nothing angry just a conversation to let him know how unacceptable it is
creepyPMs,removed,you gave him what he wanted
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i dont know im not sure this is so scary
creepyPMs,removed,you wouldnt be able to find me with my phone number email address home address name age and photographs the privacy options are there
creepyPMs,removed,yeah bc everything always happens like this
creepyPMs,removed,you need to report this to the police this is not normal or funny in any way i had a woman who id never met stalk me for a few months years ago and finally called the police when she began threatening me with murder the police came filed a report met with her told her shes toast if she sends me another message or if anything happened to me never heard another word
creepyPMs,removed,you penis male boi
creepyPMs,removed,best not to be sarcastic with these kinda of people social cues arent exactly their thing
creepyPMs,removed,hey but remember he gave you bucks
creepyPMs,removed,this is so cringe the dude is and types like he is dyslexic and nearsighted maybe hed have a better time showing hed be a good boyfriend if he would put the least effort to pay attention to what he types before he presses send
creepyPMs,removed,well that escalated quickly
creepyPMs,removed,in the other post you have social anxiety how big is it
creepyPMs,removed,you could have make this shorter just say fuck off creep gentle rejection doesnt exist
creepyPMs,removed,captain doing rnofap can you explain it to me
creepyPMs,removed,dogs just trying to get a bone yall need to ease off lol
creepyPMs,removed,fuck off pervert

creepyPMs,removed,op what happened need some background info
creepyPMs,removed,the last one i dont get the last one
creepyPMs,removed,then tell him to fuck off
creepyPMs,removed,honestly its different but if you are bad at it then meet people irl
creepyPMs,removed,thats why i always say stop the fucking online dating
creepyPMs,removed,he is an alpha but tries to convince you that hes got a billion girls under yrs just in case you do no
creepyPMs,removed,hi made this account just to give you a simple advice i think they are more likely to go away if you pretend that you dont exist ie dont answer the messages at all you cant really reason with people who are messed up on drugs
creepyPMs,removed,back in the days it was so bad that i was even scared when i had to talk to the cashier this bad
creepyPMs,removed,hi there random guy here first off i wanted to say im not creepy second off as a purely hypothetical academic question have you ever considered making pie with your elbows while watching the entire lord of the rings film series
creepyPMs,removed,you need rejection therapy maybe
creepyPMs,removed,thats the problem
creepyPMs,removed,what do people expect from online datingreally
creepyPMs,removed,eh i have had attractive women say things that were creepy lewd and suggestive translated as harrassing with sexes reversed and i can honestly say that i didnt mi d too much i was only trying to point out that the guy in this case was probably disgusting
creepyPMs,removed,the comments i read herebetter than the roasts at rroastme
creepyPMs,removed,thats very sexy of him basically mispelled almost every word in every sentence
creepyPMs,removed,did you tell him the secrets words
creepyPMs,removed,he didnt even want a nude picture just your foot how dare you
creepyPMs,removed,what kinda sick fuck
creepyPMs,removed,hey op what is this messengertindersms what
creepyPMs,removed,dont do porn kids
creepyPMs,removed,why didnt you censor your picture
creepyPMs,removed,you rejected that special invite to the industry pornhub invited youand you said no
creepyPMs,removed,people dont open strangers with sarcasms about themselves probably thats why i failed to see it
creepyPMs,removed,op you got his soul and eyes right
creepyPMs,removed,thats impressive what is kik
creepyPMs,removed,question why do you women go up to dating sites
creepyPMs,removed,everytime i see something similar i cringe so hard back in the days i did something similar gotta hurl now
creepyPMs,removed,shouldve dissed him youre too nice to the creeps p
creepyPMs,removed,hey automoderator bot thanks the answer i owe you one what if i invite you to my bday party huh
creepyPMs,removed,yes i guessed so because of the theme i meant other posts
creepyPMs,removed,normal is relative
creepyPMs,removed,because men especially these kinda ones are new to this meeting girls probably they never stopped a random girl and talked to them or anything they dont have patience
creepyPMs,removed,its as fake as the hot milfs want to fuck you ad
creepyPMs,removed,step get the guys full name step add him on facebook step post it and link his name
creepyPMs,removed,he was right with huge dick
creepyPMs,removed,have anybody sent you a msg that was not this creepy
creepyPMs,removed,well boo hoo its the internet
creepyPMs,removed,thats sexist af
creepyPMs,removed,you still havent answered my question
creepyPMs,removed,well facebook is living its golden age of dating sites
creepyPMs,removed,no not really
creepyPMs,removed,that wasnt really nice of you
creepyPMs,removed,seems like you finished the convo with the dude
creepyPMs,removed,normal dress fetish
creepyPMs,removed,well tell him to fuck off
creepyPMs,removed,op which post was this
creepyPMs,removed,youve just got a fan aint that good
creepyPMs,removed,feel free to make all the inferences you want none of them are correct dont worry about reading into things you just make yourself look like a cunt
creepyPMs,removed,what were you thinking helping out your neighbours and thinking they wouldnt imagine youd be down for sexual favours this need s
creepyPMs,removed,ya this is definitely early onset schizophrenia this can be brought on and further exacerbated by drugs maybe try to find his parents and get him some help
creepyPMs,removed,do you think giving him his he gave you back would help at all not sure of the circumstances around that so im not even sure if you actually owe him money or not just a thought
creepyPMs,removed,because women dont sexually harass right
creepyPMs,removed,i seriously cant imagine being so pathetic that i would send that to someone seriously thats tie bricks to your feet and jump in a river kind of pathetic please dear universe let that ones family tree die with him
creepyPMs,removed,more egging on idiots so the messages can be shared for laughs
creepyPMs,removed,heres a novel idea if you dont want creepy dudes pming your naked photos dont post naked pictures of yourself on the internet for neckbeards to jerkoff to
creepyPMs,removed,wow that is crazy you must be freeking amazing heh
creepyPMs,removed,if someone told me i was a id be really happy thats pretty above average isnt it
creepyPMs,removed,truly creepy but i gotta give that guy a couple points for the last second dig that was pretty slick
creepyPMs,removed,i had a few girls who asked me to come over to eat them out without expecting anything in return its great i think there are always men and women who like that i personally hate blowjobs cunnilingus is great my girlfriend expects me to eat her out on her birthday
creepyPMs,removed,did you intend for it to be a onenight stand if so did you make it clear maybe you dont get back on texts right away which is understandable but clearly creeps dont understand it now that he knows where you live you should honestly see where this goes if hes actually creepy like he becomes more aggravated and aggressive you should get a restraining order on him if he doesnt maybe hes curious but in a seriously odd way which may grant a benefit of the doubt if he never texted you what were your plans this may go back on but maybe you both or just one of you didnt make it clear where this was going
creepyPMs,removed,im not condoning his behavior at all but why didnt you text him back i think i speak for a lot of people when i say that we hate when people dont text back because they dont feel like it sure if youre busy or something you cant text back right away but if someone you know is trying to communicate with you its just common courtesy through any firm of communication to give some sort of response however your lack of response is a response in itself but a lot of guys dont pick up on it because they dont have much experience with other people let alone girls id say that this whole thing wouldve been avoided if you simply texted him back about youre feelings about him like maybe at least after the or text a simple stop texting me can solve a lot of problems if he asks why tell him why not yaknow being honest and open is better than being reserved and discrete in thus situation
creepyPMs,removed,serious question when it comes to stalkers who exhibit this kind of extremely anxious way of obsessing over abandonment in this way is there a legit psychological diagnosisexplanation for this i know one shouldnt try to be an armchair psychologist but from personal experience this screams serious personality disorder
creepyPMs,removed,well i didnt get an indication from op that they every explicitly laid down ground rules some folks just dont know how to be socially polite or whatever if you tell them how it is and they continue id say its stalker type behavior this seems like no social skills and lots of insecurities to me
creepyPMs,removed,guys are dense he needs an answer
creepyPMs,removed,dont worry im out
creepyPMs,removed,replace eyes with feet and this becomes perfectly appropriate
creepyPMs,removed,tell him to fuck off seriously if someone randomly carried on coming to my house i would tell them whats what
creepyPMs,removed,if hes a chill guy then let him know straight up be blunt im sure hell appreciate it hugely rather then staying there making people feel uncomfortable itll be a life lesson for him for the future
creepyPMs,removed,found ops selfies just check her last posts
creepyPMs,removed,wait a minute bitch is not in the list of slurs you linked as are many other gendered words such as dick im confused now this is either an incomplete list or an inconsistent policy
creepyPMs,removed,it was a joke they are all pictures of dogs
creepyPMs,removed,this has been posted here very recently already are you claiming that this is your original content
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think someone sending a creepy amount of texts to someone is enough to say adding more boundaries isnt a solution they will not always ignore or overstep boundaries humans are more complex than just dichotomies they have feelings and emotions their actions are driven by these things communication is the best way to express your own feelings and emotions about creepy messages and the like
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair this guys not that bad hes surprised when you asked what do you want to see first then says he just wanted your skype because he wanted to talk while we play
creepyPMs,removed,agree definitely annoying af to even question gender i think the implication is he wanted to speak while they play something thats relatively common in most online shooter games like the one op was playing i suppose i kind of made excuses but eh
creepyPMs,removed,youre going on as if i said it wasnt annoying i agreed with you outright yes that part is creepy i really dont know what more you want me to say on that i think you and i just have different versions of what an excuse is if its improper the mods will remove it i have no issue with that
creepyPMs,removed,this guy is fucked up he talks all reasonable but he thinks gays and atheists should be stoned to death and women if they dont wear a burlap sack over their heads their entire lives
creepyPMs,removed,facebook is a good start the other guy said it first but im just copying him for karma
creepyPMs,removed,you guys are both weird
creepyPMs,removed,lol for defending the creep my comment was seriously removed because of an opinion i was offering my two cents not advice my opinion on the situation thats frowned upon opinions
creepyPMs,removed,just out of curiosity do you think you wouldve given him a chance if he wasnt so forward at the beginning
creepyPMs,removed,haha i guess so i was kidding anyway xd
creepyPMs,removed,show me yours and ill show you mine is that a girl or a fat guy
creepyPMs,removed,wish i read this comment beforehand reading experience not optimal
creepyPMs,removed,fucking hell that font gave me cancer
creepyPMs,removed,statistically south asians do have the smallest penises i bet thats why hes so sensitive but he shouldnt call out east asians for this
creepyPMs,removed,him what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch ill have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on alquaeda and i have over confirmed kills i am trained in gorilla warfare and im the top sniper in the entire us armed forces you are nothing to me but just another target i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth mark my fucking words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet think again fucker as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking dead kid i can be anywhere anytime and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with my bare hands not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent you little shit if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn idiot i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it youre fucking dead kiddo
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt think it was creepy at all he was simply answering your question his favorite author is lil wayne
creepyPMs,removed,you could be my modelbitchwhatever else you want to be anytime you are beautiful with an amazing natural body and very cool tattoos
creepyPMs,removed,could it be the slight crosseye hes got going there
creepyPMs,removed,it was sent to the op so you can remove it doesnt matter at least you cant police that
creepyPMs,removed,why is no one else mentioning this op obviously had sex with this guy after date not to justify his actions but that wouldve been good background info
creepyPMs,removed,you two seem like you had an conversation you were both interested in having why bash her here
creepyPMs,removed,i was waiting for the creepy invitation but it never came
creepyPMs,removed,unread messages fuck
creepyPMs,removed,how unless she meets up and has sex with him why is it different than advertising a cam show
creepyPMs,removed,for some reason dont pretend like theres not a very obvious reason youre failing to mention im guessing you wear a lot of plad maybe short hair boots and bad piercings if people assume youre a dyke on first impression youre giving off a vibe
creepyPMs,removed,not to say i think i was ever this bad but having kinda been that guy in the past can confirm that a solid stop fucking txting me would be the way to go lol even saying that you feel bad it didnt work out is enough for them to keep clinging to to that mind sorry it didnt work out leaves possibility that maybe it could again
creepyPMs,removed,why cant you just tell the poor dude to leave you the hell alone and the fact that youre answering gives him hope just dont he obviously isnt getting it
creepyPMs,removed,most of the time friends only has meant not actually friends only but theres social stigma so im not gonna say im here for hookups for me and people i know not sure what app that is though on tinder where i am in my age group at least thats how it is
creepyPMs,removed,followed a link on an askreddit to get to this sub i think but caught this post wow this dude is beyond nuts im really curious what fuckery led to this i would have been direct i dont want to see or talk to you anymore if he follows up first warning i will block this numberaccount if i hear from you again in any way and then follow through on your promise this is him but i will say you kind of contributed to his sappiness a bit by giving a wish washy answer im not ready im confused i need time after you texted that once the red flags were everywhere just be direct man hope you never have to deal with him again good luck
creepyPMs,removed,i am just curious what if he had responded with actual pictures of his mum would you have actually send a tit pic imho if he did that crazy of a task i would send a nude
creepyPMs,removed,all i meant to get at is you cant let someone like that down lightly they need to be told to gtfo not trying to blame you or validate his behavior if he persists block him i just dont see the point of allowing him to even msg you really unless you find it entertaining
creepyPMs,removed,its not for some reason half of these people are being retarded
creepyPMs,removed,ehh him asking for her pics is kind of suss however i think he wanted to show off his physique and get compliments by sending his which is why he was insistent he likely wanted to compare his physique to her bf too guys dont lift for girls they lift for each other just ask the homos over at rbodybuilding 😉
creepyPMs,removed,i am now very interested in her moms boobs please op
creepyPMs,removed,what were you expecting to happen when you added him on snapchat
creepyPMs,removed,if you want to build musscle just start with a ss progrem like this one httpwwwbodybuildingcomfunnoviceliftersstartherehtml i dont know if you want to bench but you can replace it with a core exresize start cutting after month and try to find some one to workout witha good workout partner can motivate you
creepyPMs,removed,i mean i feel like if he really does go through all that trouble the least you could do is driver
creepyPMs,removed,you are either insane or twelve years old or you live in saudi arabia they can give you money for pictures all day long go to bed kiddo
creepyPMs,removed,what is circumstantial about this do you speak english as a first language
creepyPMs,removed,what risk ya fuckin rhino shut up
creepyPMs,removed,yeah since i was obviously being serious
creepyPMs,removed,anecdotal data is not actual data yall thats all this subreddit is its best to take everyone as if the words they say are actually true and not try to play this oh a couple of times people were not actually being honest or changed their minds as the relationship progressed game thats literally the antithesis of this subreddit thats why youre getting downvoted anyone who doesnt immediately go oh op how cringy and creepy wow gets downvoted
creepyPMs,removed,hmmm double creepy
creepyPMs,removed,how much money should i offer for a belly button picture p
creepyPMs,removed,when facebook was new and exclusive to university students you you could search for people by occupation so i searched hooters and friended as many of girls as i possibly could had one conversation similar to this and never tried again
creepyPMs,removed,now just wondering though what if he is sincere in wanting to catch up and just be friends
creepyPMs,removed,well you must be attractive im sorry the compliments are sexual just ignore that garbage head up
creepyPMs,removed,lol a little over reacting but thats none of my business bring on the downvotes
creepyPMs,removed,i will never understand why people continue to respond to these weirdos past the first few messages
creepyPMs,removed,ok but in all seriousness has anyone managed to get an idea of what the internal rationalization for this being appropriate is because the longer i stay subscribed to rcreepspms the more i suspect its a subset of some weird mental disorder
creepyPMs,removed,i wonder if op would consider the guy a creep if he was hot
creepyPMs,removed,im not really seeing how this is creepy
creepyPMs,removed,could you tell me which specfic rules i may have potentially broken am i not being supportive is that what it is
creepyPMs,removed,some might think this is adult flirtatious talkand if it was coming from someone you were interested in then it might be construed as jokingly cuteone persons creepiness is another persons dirty talk also as a side note sometimes you get to a point in a relationship with someone where a bit of adult joking is par for the course
creepyPMs,removed,isnt harassment due to the perception of the party tons of shit i say to my gf would be harassment if we didnt have an existing relationship like me farting under the covers and then making her smell it hotness attractiveness and harassment are all about perception and context
creepyPMs,removed,a whole subreddit for people who dont know how to not engage with people online or how to close a window you did it reddit
creepyPMs,removed,ha i cant believe he sent you hentai you should upload those as well so we can see just how creepy this guy is
creepyPMs,removed,its not a huge deal just keep an open mind ya know and they use the same arguments that are used against them to deny people their age of course this isnt everyone but there are some
creepyPMs,removed,stop accepting his money owed to you though it might be then change your phone number and cease all contact with him by responding to him touted giving him what he needs to justify sticking around cut him off
creepyPMs,removed,you seem very jovial in your response def egging him on
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think this is very creepy at all
creepyPMs,removed,if you really grew up you wouldnt have bothered egging him on just to call him out you knew where it was going and kept talking to him just end it
creepyPMs,removed,im not saying it was completely okay but they seemed to take the rejection well
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i know were just friends but i really wanna fuck you honestly he might have been better off if he said exactly that
creepyPMs,removed,coolio i dont really care how she handles it just claiming that she matured but then behaves like that is ironic
creepyPMs,removed,calling this guy a creep is a tad harsh it seems like he is def unsure of himself and certainly is socially awkward but i think he was trying to say he wanted more than the friend zone he just sucks at communicating and defaulted to this cutse jokey bs maybe youre friend didnt feel the same way he did but it might help him if she was more direct and tried to fix how he communicates just my
creepyPMs,removed,i dont see how this is creepy he just too a chance and didnt kept stalking
creepyPMs,removed,smh rediculous levels that humiliation fetishists will stoop too also they think women really are stupid to fall for their stories this guy was probably into wrestling fighting women where they physically overpower and dominate physically gaining the humiliation buzz for being beaten by a woman and made to feel less of a man you see these humiliation fetishists all the time with ever more fantastic tall tales trying to get women to play along ideal reaction is to get a woman to say you were beaten up by a woman that is pathetic you should be embarrassed you sissy they dont really want sympathy or exploration simply a chance to talk in detail about their kink they devise these stories to try and fool women into thinking it is not sexual in nature but a co corned question i have seen the common i have pledged to a fray house and have to find a woman to dominate me do you know what kind of thing will happen if i go through with it or i lost a bet and have to find a guy to suck off why would they ask me to do this as a bet i am not gay and it would be so humiliating i hate how these guys have so little respect for women and think we are so gullible to believe their fake stories that just manipulate my brother who i dont speak to is sadly one of these guys who even tried this tactic on me his fucking little sister the pervert after his leg surgery he said he needed to wear a diaper and had to get a woman to diaper him in a toilet and push him around a shopping mall he said everyone could see he was wearing one and it was really humiliating he knows i know about his sissy humiliation kink because of pictures i found he is just another creep like all the rest
creepyPMs,removed,they tend to be south asian i dont know exactly what cultural thing leads to this kind of behavior though
creepyPMs,removed,okay but the genderfluid debate can be how he was brought up like im probably only as acclimated to that type of situation because of the college i went to my parents raised me to be accepting of nongenderbinary people but i dont think id be as used to it had i not gone to the college i did attend like as an example i have a friend whos the nicest guy i probably know on top of hes highly educated and understands the whole lgbt community but when someone he started dating told him that they preferred to be called by themthey he became really uncomfortable its not that he didnt want to respect them its that regardless of all his experiences he still couldnt really grasp that its simply just upbringing
creepyPMs,removed,thoroughly confused did she actually end up hateawkward fucking him or nah
creepyPMs,removed,as you didnt understand the first one and its definitely not on the same scale as the others what the guy meant is that youre so pretty you figuratively must have to carry a stick to keep the hordes of guys who follow you around at bay
creepyPMs,removed,goals 😍
creepyPMs,removed,you cheated on him
creepyPMs,removed,serious question did he spell like that before you started dating him and why would you say yes
creepyPMs,removed,sorry buddy ill back off
creepyPMs,removed,is that what youre looking for to party with couples or would you prefer more one on one
creepyPMs,removed,random question op asl
creepyPMs,removed,i guess this whooshed over your heads
creepyPMs,removed,why havent you blocked this guy
creepyPMs,removed,why dont you just block him though
creepyPMs,removed,pretty sure he was just trolling the entire time
creepyPMs,removed,my ex husband was like this id get multiple late night texts about all the revelations he was having about us meanwhile id be lying next to my live in boyfriend because ex and i had been divorced for two years you have to stop feeding him his wheels are turning because you are giving him things to think about cut him out respond as little as possible i know its hard but make yourself do it ugh gives me the creeps so my ex
creepyPMs,removed,you completely misunderstood what i was trying to say im not saying its acceptable to be homophobic or transphobic i was saying that upbringing is what it stems from and certain upbringings make it easier or harder to understand something like that its a case of nature versus nurture im not trying to say that the person in my example was right or wrong nor in the example of hamilthrowaway im simply trying to get across that its not as easy to understand as some people try to make it and was trying to clarify on why that might be in either case theres no need to get aggressive when im simply just writing what ive seenexperienced in relation to the topic at hand
creepyPMs,removed,you probably dont need to hear it but stay away from this guy he is a master manipulator and does not like that youve wised up to his bullshit youre doing the right thing by keeping the boundaries where they are
creepyPMs,removed,i guess i dont see the creepy part i mean he said she was cute but does that really count as creepy unless theres more to this story ie hed just made some extremely sexuallyexplicit comments i dont see the reason to quote this horribly annoying song to him
creepyPMs,removed,is this equating someone getting you drunk with rape
creepyPMs,removed,just from his responses he sounds like someone i would want to shoot
creepyPMs,removed,translation hell try to jab his semiflaccid threeincher into you mistake your thighs for your vag slobber over your neck and finish in two wheezing pumps before waddling off to watch hannity
creepyPMs,removed,are you by any chance interviewing someone soon
creepyPMs,removed,this is a fake seen this so many times before
creepyPMs,removed,eh fuck it just ban me
creepyPMs,removed,not so much that i think its worse that women consent i just think its worse that people egg on guys that print out paper or pull a picture up on their devices then cum on it just seems a bit on the im only a sex offender because i peed in a park at night vibe
creepyPMs,removed,you hitting on me
creepyPMs,removed,cause bitches be trippin
creepyPMs,removed,pretty dumb thing to say tbh
creepyPMs,removed,all guys all are programmed to think about sex periodically at a rate of seconds equal to their age its how humans have such a big population relative to say sloths
creepyPMs,removed,no offense but dont lump all men together just like you dont want all men to lump all women together
creepyPMs,removed,karma conspiracy
creepyPMs,removed,i am smh at your comment
creepyPMs,removed,because we cant tell the difference between a woman being nice for the sake of being nice and being nice because theyre attracted to us your gender is way too subtle when it comes to attraction
creepyPMs,removed,dont generalize some guys are like that some are not same with woman
creepyPMs,removed,alright as long as you acknowledge that you sound as neckbeardy as the neckbeard in ops post
creepyPMs,removed,why do guys ask that what are they after do they like sluts or do they want to give us a good dicking or what
creepyPMs,removed,most guys arent like this though
creepyPMs,removed,i know some of the stuff posted here isnt really that creepy but this damn that guy straight up sounds like a serial murderer and rapist
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt see much of the context scrolling through but you both looked like right dickbags and the constant spamming of meme was really really cringey
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know ive been told fuck off after saying hi and not a creepy opening line and i usually just say have a nice day bye and move on with my life its not that hard
creepyPMs,removed,but do you
creepyPMs,removed,well are you
creepyPMs,removed,how silly
creepyPMs,removed,signs mean nothing with how people are assholes and children
creepyPMs,removed,if the comment gets deleted for calling astrology what it is pseudoscientific bullshit then ive lost all faith in the mods here
creepyPMs,removed,damn your pussy can drive a man insane you must have fucked him really good
creepyPMs,removed,how was the sex good at least
creepyPMs,removed,but you asked specifically for an armchair diagnosis
creepyPMs,removed,he could be into adult baby diaper lover or abdl there a are women into wearing diapers also i read an article written by a female who loved to wear diapers and felt guilty and ashamed for her kink i imagine this guy was testing the water to see your reaction possibly hoping for some positive reaction and a way to express this controversial fetish if he has brought it up before plus his description it could be pointing to his desire to be a baby boy infantilism is a little known yet surprisingly common fetish there are even conventions and events around diaper lovers like camp abdulia dont google unless you want to see adult men and women at a camp place in diapers i know that many who enjoy this niche feel they cannot express their desires to others without being labelled a pervert
creepyPMs,removed,hmmm no one is gladly staying fat trust me get to the gym and get fit you know from the bottom of the heart that you wish you were slimmer rationalizing doesnt work i was a fat ass my whole life world is really shallow and both men and women only treated me like a human being once i changed my life i mean in real life not on facebook or reddit
creepyPMs,removed,holy shit looks like both of you have no lives if hes rude and inappropriate why not block him hes an idiot and you knew that what a waste of time if you hadnt responded to him he would have fucked off just by you telling him to fuck off like a retard waiting for him to say something he in his idiotic brain thinks okay this girl is playing games maybe he needs to win you over jesus christ ego maniacs
creepyPMs,removed,this is the one of the weirdest fetishs i have seen and i am concerned
creepyPMs,removed,im pretty sure he is super stoned and meant to say papers as in papers for rolling joints but pampers came out and then he just rolled with the weird
creepyPMs,removed,i think he meant to say papers since they were making vague plans around smoking weed and once it was pampers his stoned brain just ran with it for funsies without thinking it might get weird
creepyPMs,removed,although i dont write messages in such a batshit crazy way it looks like hes just joking and stoned to me but i could obviously be wrong having no real world context your friends replies are cold as ice though does she always text like that
creepyPMs,removed,sometimes you gotta ride a bitch like yoda give the man his nsa piggyback ride op
creepyPMs,removed,op and the neckbeard are pretty bad imo
creepyPMs,removed,are you getting messaged by here slutbag titty knuckle sounds suspiciously like him
creepyPMs,removed,this is more childish and immature than creepy
creepyPMs,removed,you met a girl on fetlife and now your ostracizing her for it
creepyPMs,removed,idk she could say yes or no is pretty good odds
creepyPMs,removed,i i i think i just came i love you
creepyPMs,removed,this is where you dont respondblock them and report to the police replying only encourages them op this isnt directed at you
creepyPMs,removed,on a lot of these threads the people are creepy but why do people keep responding you are playing their game and i think its pretty stupid
creepyPMs,removed,accept only people you know if you failed or miss go to step step ignore then block then report death threat is instant ban you protect yourself and protect the others gg wp
creepyPMs,removed,and i appreciate that at first i was not certain and thank you for pointing out to me that this was on fb i was on my phone and assumed it was from text messages as i didnt look closely enough that is my bad i shouldnt just assume i apologize for being defensive and skeptical i just am baffled that minors are subjected to this privacy settings need to be altered on her fb i am not trying to sound like an ass with this but i do this with my year old no one they do not accept can even find them on fb i also check his fb daily just to ensure he hasnt accidentally let some predator creep in i really hope you and your friend reported this creep to fb and the authorities best case scenario everyone learned how to protect themselves more
creepyPMs,removed,i feel like in this case the name and picture of the oppressor should be clear and highlighted
creepyPMs,removed,i hope other inmates find out and shove a shank up his urethra
creepyPMs,removed,jesus you sound rude as fuck no wonder he didnt show you any respect
creepyPMs,removed,block button was broken facebook gives you the tools you need to instantly stop this
creepyPMs,removed,i only use rall i didnt realize i was in a sjw hugbox ill leave cry yourself to sleep and rub period blood on the walls in peace friend
creepyPMs,removed,id wager hes a fatass who would get winded going up the stairs
creepyPMs,removed,judging by the ridiculous threats im guessin this guys account got hijacked
creepyPMs,removed,a knife in his vagina
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand why she didnt just block him straight away
creepyPMs,removed,niggas is bitches bitches is niggas
creepyPMs,removed,sigh they live here rincel nsfl
creepyPMs,removed,should have said yes at the name i was grossed out that i know i wouldnt want to happen after the election
creepyPMs,removed,what on earth are you apologising for girl you should have destroyed this entitled asshole telling him youre not interested in an arrogant aggressive dickwad
creepyPMs,removed,is years to young to know that you can block people
creepyPMs,removed,if he ends up in jail with any luck he should end up getting several inches of justice
creepyPMs,removed,dont comment with any more rule breaks what are you going to do about it faggot lol the nerve of you acting like you can tell me what to do go pound sand you useless bag of shit
creepyPMs,removed,thats guys a jerk but you cant really think hes trying to hit on you hes just trolling you douchebag guys do this shit all the time
creepyPMs,removed,i dont recall ever saying it wasnt
creepyPMs,removed,men are fucking lunatics
creepyPMs,removed,yeah he ghosted on her and then all the sudden once he tries to talk to her again all the sudden it wouldnt work out its pretty interesting behavior
creepyPMs,removed,well the biggest issue for me is that both parties are guilty of whats essentially the same behavior im not defending the creep im just pointing out that op also is also displaying the same behavior in this exchange that she is condemning the main offender of i mean she mentions that he ghosted on her so its clear she was talking to him at one point and that would have to mean she had some interest in him now that he tries to talk to her again despite already having talked to him all the sudden she has zero interest because of a picture
creepyPMs,removed,you both were kinda dicks tbh
creepyPMs,removed,honestly sounds like you were trying to piss him off because you were butthurt that he ghosted once he basically just complimented you apologized for contacting you again and that he had a different impression of what happened the thing you said about the picture seemed like a deliberate trap to upset him and make him feel judged and then hit him with the its cause of my child to make him feel bad afterward why not just say that in the first comment about his picture then if you absolutely had to bring that up he seemed polite until you lost your shit and then he acted like an ass back pretty cringey on both parts
creepyPMs,removed,no just retarded
creepyPMs,removed,i i didnt know this was a fetish how do i undo reading this
creepyPMs,removed,all those other people who say you acted like a jerk are wrong wrong wrong these people who agree with you are right only listen to the people who agree with you listening to people whose criticism conflicts with what you want to believe is a bad idea dont ever do it keep going strong and remember there will always be at least a few people who agree with you no matter what you believe as a side note trumps campaign is doing pretty great a lot of folks agree with him
creepyPMs,removed,a for autistic
creepyPMs,removed,guys might also talk to a girl on reddit in a bizarre or fucked up way if they feel shes a loser particularly a self admitted loser who has hung around their hometown too long works at target has regrettable tats has sex with old men who are their friends father and fucks reddit strangers kind of a recipe to bring on shit storm
creepyPMs,removed,why has this all of a sudden become a men issue feminist
creepyPMs,removed,really didnt seem that bad
creepyPMs,removed,what a delightfully sexist comment
creepyPMs,removed,stop trying to fit the word misogynist everywhere you dumb feminist
creepyPMs,removed,ableist 😂😂 behave
creepyPMs,removed,theres no story
creepyPMs,removed,its the head mod of this subreddits response to someone stating that the mods here are ugly
creepyPMs,removed,surprisingly understanding and polite for a creep
creepyPMs,removed,why did you add him anybody on the internet is a creep
creepyPMs,removed,i dunno ducks and dolphins are pretty rapey im just happy to not be as rapey as ducks or dolphins
creepyPMs,removed,i mean at least its original
creepyPMs,removed,are you kidding me why even post this you guys are such little bitches on this subreddit oh em gee a stranger on the internet how awkward and creepy tf do you expect
creepyPMs,removed,oh no im not part of the cool majority what shall i do
creepyPMs,removed,ah the men are dumb animals and women are trophies thing
creepyPMs,removed,im sorry but that font hurts my eyes jesus how do you stand reading like that all the time
creepyPMs,removed,that font
creepyPMs,removed,cute but with no context i cant decide if this is actually creepy im friends with mostly women and if they tell me theyre going to shower my immediate response is always send pics im not actually looking for nudesim just teasing and i get plenty of it back in return though there are quite a few who if they said yeah you know what fuck it heres me nude i would probably be a bit excited about it i cant honestly be mad at this guy without further context so help a guy out p
creepyPMs,removed,the font is literally killing me
creepyPMs,removed,that font gave me headache
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i agree with you i also agree with op that sexuality is complex but i think just by definition if someone finds both guys and girls sexually attractive then they are bisexual i mean they dont have to put a label on it or anything but its definitely not straight thats like saying youre teetotal but you still drink one brand of whiskey
creepyPMs,removed,lol makes claim asked for source doesnt provide source
creepyPMs,removed,it must be a nightmare being a woman imagine if seeing a vagina was remotely this offensive being the only creature on the planet that actively shuns and is disgusted by the sex organ of the male of their speciesit sounds like a personal hell to me i feel sorry for you all
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt the youtube comment section where you can get off making baseless claims without anything backing it up
creepyPMs,removed,try logical reasoning dont be intentionally dense
creepyPMs,removed,you should have commented on his pale and obese legs
creepyPMs,removed,only if i can suffocate you in the process
creepyPMs,removed,i know im not gay lmao i also know im not attracted to children or animals i know what i am and am not sexually attracted to and i dont see it ever changing
creepyPMs,removed,hot
creepyPMs,removed,wife someone make someone my wife why its used this way i am not sure but now you know
creepyPMs,removed,oh yiss like its impossible to get hard but you dont care at all i had a way fucked up comedown though for the better part of a week id have these irrational fear episodes come over me where i just knew that there was a psycho clown with a knife coming to murder me the first day it was constanti had to um engineer an endophin rush to get out of the shower that first morning then after a while the paranoid spells would get shorter and the okay times would get longer would do again
creepyPMs,removed,eh molly came up im not shy about it the things that get shared in this sub almost always far outstrip anything ive said on a content basis so it isnt as if i said it in the ballpit at a chuck e cheeze and you dont have to go commentdiving for that i just described my experience and not nearly the half of it
creepyPMs,removed,damn thats a lean
creepyPMs,removed,i feel like this has got to be a shitty troll
creepyPMs,removed,theres this crazy idea that some women actually like shit like that now is it wise to use this stuff as an opener probably not but we dont know the kind of experience the guy has had that uses this shit is it disrespectful yes but at some point in a relationship a girl would like reading something like this and there are girls out there who actually would get turned on by this besides that the dude is obviously interested in one thing using this means he doesnt have to waste his time
creepyPMs,removed,im a little confused might be cuz its am and i havent been to sleep but is op male or female
creepyPMs,removed,dude relax so you woke up at am stop being such a pussy she said she was sorry common man if that is your so called line then block her earlier
creepyPMs,removed,because people with genuine psychosis are lovely individuals who never harass others i wouldnt assume this person isnt legitimately psychotic i see possible delusions of grandeur and persecutionparanoia seeing things that arent there does fall within the realm of the psychotic even if it doesnt qualify her for a full diagnosis of any psychotic disorder which again i wouldnt assume this is not me speaking from stigma this is me speaking as a masters student in a clinical field of psychology psychosis can be very dangerous and its a good instinct to be wary of psychotic individuals of course there are people who get treatment who can handle their issues very well who are still able to function and have a social life thats not what is in question here here is a person who harasses to an extreme extent showcasing possible psychotic traits id say op is not out of line here
creepyPMs,removed,i dont really care about downvotes you stated something stupid i argued against it
creepyPMs,removed,well i mean he does have a point he might have disrespected your age boundaries but ds relationships arent just about sex seems like you jumped the gun as far as getting offended so early on
creepyPMs,removed,im thinking histrionic personality disorder in addition to legitimate clinical narcissism
creepyPMs,removed,assuming hes going on your progresspics post i would disagree with his assertion ive gone from to myself and awesome for you for your progress
creepyPMs,removed,sexuality doesnt change over time for people unless you get brain damage or some psychological impairment and the evidence suggests women have more bisexual tendencies than men on a biological level you offered nothing but personal feelings to counter
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know if im missing context here but if i were friends with her and i saw these messages in her phone id think she was in an abusive relationship op seems to really be blowing up over the issue as of the second message lots of accusations and insults written out in longform yeah she made an insensitive call and is being passive aggressive and not being honest when she should be but op seems to be really confrontational and quick to overreact over her every mistake this is how i would expect someone with anger issues or abusive tendencies to talk am i the only one who thinks this reading this made me really uncomfortable im also aware of course that i dont have the context of her several months of harassment and that its absolutely never my place to judge
creepyPMs,removed,please go fuck yourself psycho
creepyPMs,removed,even if the original comment was about the rules which i wouldnt be so sure of that does not change the discussion this is not armchair psychiatry even if we would consider hasty diagnoses to fall under its description as ive addressed before
creepyPMs,removed,are you like an internet psychiatrist mod guy
creepyPMs,removed,yikes you def arent gonna restore faith in humanity online
creepyPMs,removed,or social justice warscultural misappropriation just become a real thing huh
creepyPMs,removed,honestly she sounds like she might have some mental disorder its not usual for a person of sound body and mind to be this condescendingly racist to a complete stranger
creepyPMs,removed,like a picture of the crazy lady with your face photoshopped on
creepyPMs,removed,please pm me what they said the venom cant possibly eat away at me worse than curiosity is right now
creepyPMs,removed,savage
creepyPMs,removed,happened
creepyPMs,removed,sell some shorts who the hell sells shorts
creepyPMs,removed,nobody cares that you dont want to live in the us just move away
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt forget it
creepyPMs,removed,sigh more ageism still sound like a douche bag though obviously
creepyPMs,removed,oh dear nothing that bleeds once a month is going to taste good really
creepyPMs,removed,boobs huh huh big boobs
creepyPMs,removed,i see you went to a lot of trouble there but if a dude is hitting up strange women on the internet then theyre obviously pretty retarded and have problems with their real life interactions with women i think any kind of advice for them is pretty redundant
creepyPMs,removed,if you dont mind can you post a picture of yourself
creepyPMs,removed,i dont have a fetish about lactation or breast feeding but if a woman has her breasts out in view in public im going to do a double take i mean masturbation is a natural bodily function like breastfeeding is does not mean i do it at the dinner table
creepyPMs,removed,im not even halfway through this is crazy im surprised you humored this person for so long
creepyPMs,removed,i am a bit disheartened by some of the knee jerk responses from some of the people on here if you have ever delt with someone who has depression trying to offer help seems especially when you are not close to the individual like the right thing to do it is in fact the wrong thing to do as it will trigger an emotional response from them my brother is on the spectrum and has recently gone through depression he talks in a similar way to a friend that he thought to be a romantic interest albeit he wasnt talking to multiple people like in ops case you must understand that people who are going through depression are often projecting their own insecurities and emotional stress upon the recipient which may appear as them inadvertantly taking it out on you people with depression lack a certain empathy which inhibits their ability to excersize verbal constraint when talking to people like op who offer a window of opportunity to talk to them from what op has said he was clearly trying to communicate that he was depressed being judgemental and threatening to call the police might work but it certainly wont help their case dont take this the wrong way im not saying that you have to be responsible for that person and their behaviour but there person in ops post is clearly not the same type of creep that we usually see on this sub if you dont want to deal with this person then just keep ignoring them i dont think they deserve the stress of constantly being threatened by the police for trying to reach out even of what they end up saying is convoluted and doesnt really make sense they need help from someone who knows how to deal with them the best thing you could do is inform whoever is close to them like a family member that they are incidentally harassing people online if you dont know who those people are then like i said just keep ignoring them i know it takes a little effort to keep blocking them but please dont threaten the police unnecessarily unless you absolutely need to ie they are going to come round to your house or something like that
creepyPMs,removed,but its perfectly natural and normal nobody should have a problem with it as long as you have a bag and you dont make a mess im tired of unprogressive people forcing me to conform with their standards of whats publicly acceptable its damaging to me as a human being especially with all these disgusting scat fetishists taking pictures
creepyPMs,removed,well come on lets see the dress girl with a joker and harley tat necklace bathrobe pjs key chains undies mantle for all her comics and plushies etc
creepyPMs,removed,you seem really angry you should probably smoke some weed or something
creepyPMs,removed,i really dont know who brainwashed you into thinking that but there is a clear and broad consensus among academic scholars in multiple fields that sexism can affect either sex
creepyPMs,removed,so a tall mexican
creepyPMs,removed,its called sarcasm but ill let get through with it this time
creepyPMs,removed,serious question to op do people such as yourself see stuff like this and know its going to be on creepy pms so you egg him on a bit the dude is a total asswipe but you had opportunities to leave it alone one of which he initiated why goad him on no offense intended the dude is a total creep but did you think you were helping him or getting prime material for this subreddit
creepyPMs,removed,alright
creepyPMs,removed,dude is a total dick bag but how could this be considered harrassment would there not have to be continual unwanted advances while someone says to stop
creepyPMs,removed,likely a lot as i find many gals have low selfesteem and most societies generally condition gals to seek male validation and to be nurturing caregivers i find for many guys its not about genuineness they just care about the numbers and what works i had a discussion with a pustrp dude that said an ugly guy should do whatever works to get a hot girl doesnt matter if its manipulation deception coercion etc if it works it works many guys dont care if the gal is actually interested in him just as long as he gets what he wants from her theyd rather be told they can do x and get a lot of gals rather than be themselves and seek mutual reciprocation theres a reason in my opinion why males are seemingly far far more often to see dating and relationships as a game its about winning by getting the most results and even better if it is with as little effort as possible trp mra and seduction subreddits to me are a great insight in the average male mind
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know if id call dear a pet name what did he rest of the comment say
creepyPMs,removed,its not against the rules to downvote people this place isnt here just so you can get free karma
creepyPMs,removed,you may have missed my point there is no rule against downvoting anything
creepyPMs,removed,racism believing a race to be superior to another can we stop calling everything racist please
creepyPMs,removed,why doesnt she just block him at that point
creepyPMs,removed,definitely fake
creepyPMs,removed,my friends and i get drunk and look at craigslist ads then we make fake emails to reply sometimes we use burner numbers to text we do this to men that we think do this to women if they get excited we crank up the crazy lots of pants pissing laughter can be had
creepyPMs,removed,because we are crazy
creepyPMs,removed,several of the guys ive been with have suggested that pineapple juice will make it taste sweeter and such things no it did not all sperm tastes bitter and disgusting health and diet has made no difference so far as for hygiene i will not suck dick unless its clean so they had similar hygiene there may have been a slight difference in taste but in that case i never noticed
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know what the context of this picture is i dont use meet people apps i just rely on being devilishly handsome talkative confident and having a winning personality p but if this is a meeting random people app that some people use to make romantic conections and others use to make friends given that context you have posted a picture that is your breasts due to the necessity that is the propegation of the human species the male gender has genetic memory that make us measure up every single woman we see this is automatic sorry if this is a news flash for you but every man that has ever looked at you that was not related to you decided within seconds if he wanted to sleep with you or not every single one a good selection of people are aware of this they are also aware of the certain shapes features that this primal genetic decision is based on often using it to their own advantage yes you can wear whatever you like but what you wear will affect how people treat and view you this is a fact of lifeand there is nothing really wrong with it would you go to a job interview in a dressing gown and flip flops no you would be judged as a crazy person would you go for a job interview in an office wearing casual attire no you would not be seen as a serious candidate you might be the most serious and qualified person for the job but if you do not present as such especially when making a first impression that probably wont count for much as social creatures who see hundereds of people a day we are required to make snap judgments on each person we do this subconsously you state in one of your replies what i wear shouldnt effect wether someone wants to be friends with me but it completely does people make snap judgments on where to invest their time someones apearance is a factor in this it gives us an insight into their lifestyle and values we use this book cover to make decisions example if you are waiting for someone at a bar have an hour to kill and decide to strike up a conversation with a strangertwo strangers equally distant with equally open body language one is a goth one is dressed preppy your own value set is going to come to a snap decision of who you think you will have a better conversation with it might be the goth for you and for others it will be the preppy type that depends on your outlook on life clothing also alows us to display tribalism be it political sports or social sphere you no doubt have hundereds of pictures of yourself on your phone why did you pick this one to be the very first impression people have clothing also allows us to display intent im no creep but if i saw that picture on a meeting random people app i would assume you were looking for something more than friendship now i dont know perhaps on your profile you have stated that and if thats the case the guy is being a bit dickish for replying to you like that but at the same time we live in a time of fluid dynamics just because someone is a friend does not necessarily mean that sex is not going to happen or that that person wants sex i want women to be empowered knowledge is power there is no point being ignorant and then becoming frustrated and angry some of the comments on this sub and most of the ones in this thread make me sad
creepyPMs,removed,give it a go im more than happy to talk its only by engaging with those of differing views we can truly learn our about our own have an upvote
creepyPMs,removed,i feel what youre saying im an e cup and they invade majority of my upper torso reading his comments i was wondering dude what the hell and then i saw the picture now no what you wear should not determine whether or not youre looking for friends or dates and his messages were stupidly unnecessary but girl the picture was majority boobage haha
creepyPMs,removed,how exactly is this in violation of rule please feel free to be specific
creepyPMs,removed,it was a joke you goddamn inept retards
creepyPMs,removed,thats still not very specific is it perhaps it would be helpfull if you pointed out which part of the post was against your rule
creepyPMs,removed,im thinking she has a thing for asian men
creepyPMs,removed,i did and i dont see how it applies or how my comment has gone against that i can see how the comment i replied to gos against it tho certainly not very supportive is it but i still gave an upvote because im nice

creepyPMs,removed,trolling
creepyPMs,removed,compliment is compliment maybe im just ignorant of the context but i wouldnt call this creepy
creepyPMs,removed,bet he know about gorilla warfare
creepyPMs,removed,she sounds like an absolute cunt imo
creepyPMs,removed,why does this validate your trust issues there are lots of assholes out there and you cant take it so personally
creepyPMs,removed,what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch ill have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on alquaeda and i have over confirmed kills i am trained in gorilla warfare and im the top sniper in the entire us armed forces you are nothing to me but just another target i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth mark my fucking words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet think again fucker as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking dead kid i can be anywhere anytime and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with my bare hands not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent you little shit if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn idiot i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it youre fucking dead kiddo
creepyPMs,removed,its a creep if its an obvious joke
creepyPMs,removed,i mean he doesnt deserve a response but why are you on a messaging app like this if you dont want people to talk to you and then especially if youre going to get upset when someone simply wants to start a conversation with you get over yourself banned from creepy pms
creepyPMs,removed,honestly the beginning did not seem that bad he tried messaging he tried again although not in the greatest of tones then op just became rude after i personally dont know how any of these apps work but if its unsolicited messages then i guess its somewhat warranted but i thought the purpose of these apps is to interact with people
creepyPMs,removed,you guys are delusional she was rude from the getgo just like all females tend to be
creepyPMs,removed,do we have beef already dude
creepyPMs,removed,where in michigan are you if you dont mind me asking im a fellow michigander and i know the guys in my area on okcupid suck from my experience
creepyPMs,removed,i think i have met this person like the worst gaslighter on the planet right everything is someone else victimizing him even though he tries to make everyone feel like shit are his initials bd i think i just dont want to believe theres more than one shit
creepyPMs,removed,wow how rude people ask me and i say no you just had to try and make him feel bad he wasnt insulting or degrading but you tried to ake him feel as if he was
creepyPMs,removed,i just discovered both subs and im confused are there alot of non political subreddits that are now choosing political sides as a whole group why what does a sub thats not political mean by being alt right or commie im actually curious as this is the first ive seen of any of this
creepyPMs,removed,step two apply burn ointment to all inches of affected area
creepyPMs,removed,cool im gonna go ahead and unsubscribe from this barrel of laughs
creepyPMs,removed,do you want dick pics because thats how you get dick pics
creepyPMs,removed,how superior of you
creepyPMs,removed,i actually got curious about the context and looked up your comment history now i get it d
creepyPMs,removed,makes sense she was desperately trying to harvest drama from you the grown up think to do is avoid drama in this case blocking her avoids drama ergo sure she has multiple accounts and the read notification is still acknowledgement enough in her head to continue her harvesting
creepyPMs,removed,this merely seems like an small argument
creepyPMs,removed,im just wondering why didnt you block her i found her craziness entertaining but if i was getting these messages all the time i think i would have blocked her after the first baseless threat
creepyPMs,removed,best
creepyPMs,removed,if i was this girl id arrange a meetup and bring a ruler right before we were going to bed i would get the ruler from my purse and say if youre not inches ill consider this a waste of time and youll have to pay me you still have the chance to back out do you want to take the risk
creepyPMs,removed,lol are you actually offended holy shit i called your objectively annoying rules annoying i even agreed with you before i called them annoying goddamn talk about a prima donna
creepyPMs,removed,blast that shit on her twitter and amazon book review
creepyPMs,removed,is your profile picture a dirty one because it looks like a dirty one also you forgot to hide his face bottom of second picture
creepyPMs,removed,men are just horrifically disgusting creatures
creepyPMs,removed,not judging definitely judging
creepyPMs,removed,you did a shitty troll and admitted it please stop posting this
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i hate it when chicks overreact like this
creepyPMs,removed,so both are really creepy maybe you should post this over at rcringe they would like this
creepyPMs,removed,hey at least hes not a creep
creepyPMs,removed,well it seems like she was commenting on your behavior and the things youve been doingsooid say yeah you might wanna take this over to cringe pics cos god im cringing for you
creepyPMs,removed,uhyou admitted in the conversation that you actually did the ew bit sowhy should i not believe that this isnt some weird reflection of what happened because you in your own words admitted to doing a lot of what she accused you of doing she was being cringey too but if youve been banned from rokcupid and you did the ew thing then youre cringey as fuck too dude
creepyPMs,removed,people you dont know ughhhhh facepalm i do know this chick omg she like wanted me to be her second string bf at one point try to keep up also pretty sure youre breaking the victim blame rule hope ya dont get banned actually maybe pm me for her username because you two would really get along at one point she even told me im not allowed to be a feminist because im a cis white male like what ew was tame compared to the insensitive overprivileged shit shes thrown my way as i told her put down the jessica valenti and the other pop fauxmenist literature and go to httpplatostanfordedu or pick up some judith butler and see what a cancer your blind hatred and attitudes are to society even to women in general oh and i think now is the point where you a rich white girl years old are supposed to call me a misogynist i made a bingo card of predictable basic bitch comments help me get bingo i beg of you dont let this horrible exhausting boring conversation be for nothing at least let one of us get something out of it
creepyPMs,removed,oh gross how many guys have you fucked yet what age did you lose your virginity dude sounds like a total pedofile twenty bucks says hes some sweaty overweight balding man in his mid to late thirties sitting in his moms house
creepyPMs,removed,not sure what else you expected
creepyPMs,removed,why are you friends with this person in the first place
creepyPMs,removed,ohhh gotcha
creepyPMs,removed,not even that bad better post it on reddit
creepyPMs,removed,no not clicking anything have fun on your pedestal this doesnt even belong in this sub which votes will reflect
creepyPMs,removed,mansplained there it is bingo
creepyPMs,removed,youre already annoying enough as it is im not gonna wade through your worthless post history to confirm both that and the fact that youre making all this up youre supporting a person who thinks its okay to harass people on the internet what a hill to die on you do not have a degree in feminism or whatever the hell you called it youre not a feminist you care more about your own ego than you do about ending oppression when was the last time you bought a homeless person dinner and how much did you spend here ill answer for you never and zero dollars youre not oppressed your parents didnt spank you enough growing up youre one of the most entitled immature privileged people ive ever talked to on this stupid website check your privilege and please stop replying to my comments
creepyPMs,removed,im so confused i dont even see the cringe hahaha i feel like it was just a super bad inside joke or something its just soweird
creepyPMs,removed,the second comment on imgur was basically what i was going to say on here i know youre just seeking attention but youre trying too hard
creepyPMs,removed,i see your point and i agree women absolutely should not be treated that way its just that on craigslist i expect only creepy guys to be lurking
creepyPMs,removed,i can see this working as a joke
creepyPMs,removed,this is a little different to the others you have posted on craigslist seeking work people dont want to employ you for hospitality work they are however prepared to pay you for sexual services craigslist is a true melting pot the offers themselves are weird as hell and thats where its creepy the correct way to ask would be simply to say they dont want to employ you in your requested role would you be interested in some sort of escort job if not cut dead there if so further conversation like it or not people dont want to employ you in your chosen roles which i guess is why you went to cl in the end dont want to jerk a guy off for a couple hundred bucks fine your prerogative always there will be people on there that will though
creepyPMs,removed,thats not an issue thats exclusive to women but whatever
creepyPMs,removed,im sure that a real hacker or not even that someone who knows a little bit will tell you that the whole conversation is cringe worthy point of attack cross reference info to a server what
creepyPMs,removed,you know you was askingcringe
creepyPMs,removed,i knew a guy with a hairy fetish he wont even consider touching a woman if its less than wks since she shaved anywhere
creepyPMs,removed,little bit too much usage of the word fuckboy but the dude was lying you knew it he kept refuting it to annoy you even though you both knew he was a douche no reason to feel like you overreacted
creepyPMs,removed,id say you did get a bit worked up dont give him the pleasure of annoying you and yes he very much is backpedaling trying to save face hes being sleazy and both you and him know it
creepyPMs,removed,fuck off with your stupid little shitty s tags they ruin reddit they are cancer they are absolute shit every single time that i see a s tag my eyebrow twitches with fury and i feel like murdering a hundred cats one by one dont you fucking dare use stupid s tags because they are literally terrible and i do not approve of them at all get rid of them and stop using s tags because they are literally the worst thing of this here site yes we do get sarcasm we dont actually think that you were being serious and you actually managed to ruin your own stupid little insignificant joke
creepyPMs,removed,if anyone insults me i say if i respected you or your opinion your insult would hurt me since i do not know you or respect your opinion i am sorry but your attempt at insulating me is pointless this guy just wanted to try and hurt you by using the lowest insultd he hoped your body mass in dec was linked to your self worth may i suggest though try not to tell someone who is trying to emotionally hurt you and break your self esteem that any of their comments are effective it only spurs them on
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt realize you where a mod and i insulted you only in your mind i have only love for you
creepyPMs,removed,send them
creepyPMs,removed,to me the following replies showed him that he was upsetting getting to you emotionally it may explain why he continued the verbal abuse that frankly you do not deserve in your life people can and are terrible to one another him whatever pig you pig is kinda a low blow shows him him comment hurt him good i have ur face pix tho so watch out you oh wow thats beyond awful showed that his threat got to you him you retard you oh you shouldnt use that word i take offence to that again his insult upset you i am saying he is in the wrong but you did show him that his verbal abuse was getting to you emotionally with those replies
creepyPMs,removed,udoorbellguy thought he could pull a fast one
creepyPMs,removed,lol what why do you assume he was lying this sub seems to have some man hating culture omg he said he injured himself he must be trying to lure you into a gang rape the guy could have just injured himself and wanted to share with op correct me if im wrong but from the conversation it sounds like his first language isnt english and neither is his culture things dont often come of the way you want them too when youre typingspeaking in your nonnative language
creepyPMs,removed,why would you reply to messages why would you be replying to him for years id not reply and block him after first message
creepyPMs,removed,why do you accept
creepyPMs,removed,is this really that creepy though he just showed an awkward lack of social skills he didnt stalk you threaten you or say anything about what he wanted with you other than being willing to risk personal harm in order to get a date with you which he probably isnt serious about since it is actually a quote
creepyPMs,removed,i guess i dont understand this fb stuff when someone i dont know adds me i click ignore if i get anything else from them and i dont know them then i block them and i dont go back and forth a hundred times with them in between any of those steps
creepyPMs,removed,hahahaha that is so awful but so hilarious
creepyPMs,removed,is this satire or something cause it doesnt seem very creepy
creepyPMs,removed,jfc yes thank you for being the fourth person to tell me this the other three didnt get their point across now i understand as i said maybe their management is better than what ive worked with so obviously i havent had good managers who give a shit and take action in situations like this im just speaking from my own experience
creepyPMs,removed,i wish guys like this would just kill themselves
creepyPMs,removed,this reads more cringy to me both ways op kept the conversation going multiple times mixed signals mixed signals everywhere
creepyPMs,removed,this is kinda funny
creepyPMs,removed,beepbeep im a bot your comment seems sad to us cheer up have a ps this bot is powered by ai
creepyPMs,removed,i really hope that dude doesnt know where you or anyone else lives cp is no fucking joke dude deserves a bullet not foodstamps
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think this is creepy just weird that he continued to message you but every message is so far apart it doesnt even matter
creepyPMs,removed,yeah it seems like kind of an unfair question im not arguing with the rule and in this case he was definitely trying to crap all over your boundaries but were really only allowed to give one answer op
creepyPMs,removed,i would say youre overthinking it not that that means you have to like him your boundaries are your boundaries they dont have to be the same as what other people have this guy seems more assholeish than creepy but luckily hes pretty outgoing so hes willing to share it with everyone
creepyPMs,removed,honestly i think this guy has a good sense of humor and hes not being vulgar or disrespectful in the slightest
creepyPMs,removed,call me crazy i believe him seems like a real gent
creepyPMs,removed,obviously youre right to keep him away from your kids but not enough people realize the mental health aspect of this he probably does need help and literally has no where else to turn the government locks you up for being sick and then throws you on the street when theyre done with you thats why so many homeless are sex offenders hopefully theres a public program he can get in touch with to help him hes still a person just with a sickness
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know or care about this guys story i just thought id share a little something for the yeahim sure its not what it looks like people a guy i used to hang around with was when he received pictures of his girlfriends breasts on his computer when they broke up he deleted the pictures when she asked him to he was when the files were found and he did three years again i dont know the story of the guy in ops post but it is possible for things to not be how they seem sometimes
creepyPMs,removed,read my comment lower in the thread you aggressive dipshit
creepyPMs,removed,kids need parents to protect them when parents hand them over to abusers they are sorry excuses for parents i will not change my mind on this so you can save your time this is not a kidnapping case the shithead went to prison and she decided to take him back to be around her kids and then make more for him its fucking sick
creepyPMs,removed,shit the wanna get a pizza and fuck sometime line would win me over
creepyPMs,removed,idk i think its funny the guy is a good sport
creepyPMs,removed,the creep thinks op is stupid but the explanatory notes under each screenshot make it seem like op thinks we are stupid as well
creepyPMs,removed,no you fucking spam them till they simply answer and then go for the kill
creepyPMs,removed,lol settle down please dont contact this number anymore this sub sucks sometimes smh dudes just dicking around with random numbers
creepyPMs,removed,ok dearydairy youre right ill start taking this kind of mostly harmless thing a lot more seriously from now on
creepyPMs,removed,your comment has been removed in accordance with httpiimgurcomvkforaspng httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,removed,seriously i have to get in on that action
creepyPMs,removed,that doesnt mean you shouldnt try
creepyPMs,removed,i work at sears going to need a few mops in here for the ladies i mean that kind of earning potential
creepyPMs,removed,they said fat as a whale because usually curvy now means obese just saying to avoid idiots dont use curvy anymore
creepyPMs,removed,its one of the words thats been hijacked by the tumblr generation like trigger warnings pronouns and oppression its just been misused so much that the meaning is starting to change im like you i qualify as curvy as im not overweight but do have me some feminine curves but i cant describe myself as curvy online or people add lbs to their mental image of me
creepyPMs,removed,itll probably be safe to guess its more of a mini mushroom though
creepyPMs,removed,this is a very delicate subject that needs further investigation go ahead and send nudes and ill get back to you with a verdict
creepyPMs,removed,not enough context
creepyPMs,removed,lol wtf thats not weird at all guys want a some with women because theyre attracted to women lmfao a some with another guy its like you dont want to seehear a naked guy im not homophobic at all but i would not want a some with another guy i dont think its weird that other guys would want that but i just dont see how you cant understand how some straight men wouldnt want it
creepyPMs,removed,youre being super weird right now
creepyPMs,removed,have you seen the post where someone demanded an account flag all their space related articles because outer space was triggering to her the account she demanded flag their posts was an account about space phenomenon actual trigger warnings like some of these posts contain sparkly gifs if such things cause you seizures be careful thats a good thing or warning what follows is a graphic description of child abuse but i want to get it off my chest also a good thing warning cishet males are mentioned here thats just dumb if half the species makes you uncomfortable you need therapy demanding that other people either tag or stop posting things that you disagree with is absolutely childish being triggered used to mean that you had a ptsd or similar episode that fucked you up in a big way now the way they use it they mean that someone made them mildly uncomfortable as someone who does have panic attacks and actually has triggers for them the overuse of the word has gotten so bad that if i warn people they think im making it up but hey watching someone forget how to breathe is always fun
creepyPMs,removed,you seemed ready to pull that card out weird on your end just say no instead of bringing mom into it hope she gets better
creepyPMs,removed,relax ya fucking hot head im just going off context he said he wanted to see her im here for creepy shit and never defend creepy pms so im just saying she was probably emotional cause of her mom and expected everyone to know what she was feeling
creepyPMs,removed,waaay too much text not enough juice
creepyPMs,removed,your first mistake was looking for like friends not already in your normal life
creepyPMs,removed,i think the important question is what did this shower photo look like i mean this could have been completely justified 😂
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair that site is geared specifically for sex and hook ups its not like he sent this message on a dating app or something
creepyPMs,removed,to be completely honest i dont think he was creepy at all he was dense af tho and i understand your annoyance i mean dude shes not interested in that type of bond let it go already
creepyPMs,removed,youre practically the norm in japan they are calling asexuality an epidemic there meh
creepyPMs,removed,he has a point
creepyPMs,removed,i am not creep defending i am merely wondering why youre offended about getting sexualized messages on a site thats is explicitly about the sending and receiving of sexual messages i was a regular on that site for about i am well aware what that site is all about and my reading of it was the guy was just being upfront about what hes into
creepyPMs,removed,get a education you dumb freak i totally agree with the yearold victim of sexual harrassment
creepyPMs,removed,i dont see it as a story im still creepypming girls and trying to figure it out
creepyPMs,removed,hah nice joke but seriously i think part of the issue is that most men me included are the opposite i love it if you say i am funny or cool or whatever but i really like it if a girl say i am good looking even if it is a girl i have no interest in i do think that is the norm for most men without me having much to base it on maybe because a you are hot from a girl is usually harder to get than from a man
creepyPMs,removed,shared passion for ice cream and concerts older than my dad jesus fucking christ call the cops
creepyPMs,removed,this comes with online dating dont take it personal some guys cant help themselves
creepyPMs,removed,indian men disgust me
creepyPMs,removed,youre such a lucky lady im jealous and im a dude
creepyPMs,removed,i mean this is just life for the near future atleast for whatever reason a lot of them have rage and it makes them feel good to curse etc i dont defend them actually i figure they should be making me look good by being normal
creepyPMs,removed,while yes that guy was definitely creepy your comment about indian men was not okay
creepyPMs,removed,im surprised op and a lot of other ops on this sub actually hasnt blocked him yet or waited so long to block someone i just feel like for anyone on my friends list right now that isnt my girlfriend that if i did this randomly to one of them and my random messages were nothing but you want my cock lol lol fuck me lol with dad lol you whore lol lol lol lol sex lol id have gotten blocked like immediately
creepyPMs,removed,in all honesty uandreagassi is right you didnt do a very good job of telling him off sounded like you would give in at any second
creepyPMs,removed,why do you keep answering
creepyPMs,removed,im ok with being rejected my overblown self esteem helps me with that i never liked using any energy towards hating or being negative about anything so it makes no sense to me i am online dating recently single
creepyPMs,removed,why would you continue to answer this guy
creepyPMs,removed,why would you even respond to kind of want to stuff it in ur ass you pretty much fueled these flames yourself
creepyPMs,removed,asking if the creep is hot violates rule two
creepyPMs,removed,why the hell are you responding or even initiating conversation with hey
creepyPMs,removed,this literally isnt even that bad if you kill yourself its not due to the secret rather some more severe underlying mental health issue
creepyPMs,removed,could just be from mississippi or english teeth are a big deal when you dont have them
creepyPMs,removed,naw im good i read it and rolled my eyes like anyone else who read it
creepyPMs,removed,my profile is set to friends only as well why are you two geniuses still on a dating website then i really dont get it
creepyPMs,removed,naw dog
creepyPMs,removed,wellyou dated him
creepyPMs,removed,a goalie doesnt mean i cant score
creepyPMs,removed,as cringey as it is i do think he was just trying to cheer you up or make you laugh obviously he missed the mark
creepyPMs,removed,thats right up there with the neighborhood girl who the first time she saw me after both my parents died said have a nice day and when i suggested to her mother that it was highly inappropriate said mother got on my case because she was only trying to be nice
creepyPMs,removed,its even worse because he could have said a shoulder to cry on or a dick to ride on the fact that it rhymes would have eased the impact of his creepiness
creepyPMs,removed,ive sold used panties but this guy who asked if i sell used panties is disgusting k
creepyPMs,removed,oh daddy oh jeez
creepyPMs,removed,i think hes in isis
creepyPMs,removed,okc had a feature that filters out messages from people outside of your area and age range
creepyPMs,removed,you were more annoying than he was in my opinion this post reminds me more of a person carrying around a camera with the intent to fuck with cops instead of doing it to capture misdeeds
creepyPMs,removed,can you at least try to have a conversations with this douchbag instead you just asked pointless stuff like why why why over and over again d still enjoyed the stupid try of this fuckface to convice you of his godlike cock
creepyPMs,removed,hes not wrong hes just an asshole emotional comfort comes in all shapes and sizes this one is ill timed once you start to travel the world you see not everyone is like everyone else and people want and need different things i wish you well on your extensive travels ¯ツ¯
creepyPMs,removed,when i had it it sent it to an entirely different inbox called filtered
creepyPMs,removed,was going to say exactly this
creepyPMs,removed,please learn what httpknowyourmemecommemesfagsuffix is before overreacting to an innocent phrase the suffix fag is not derogatory in this usage it is more of a term of endearment than anything the culture of the two sites is different
creepyPMs,removed,hands down the second weirded fetish ive ever seen
creepyPMs,removed,so what was his house like
creepyPMs,removed,did you at least read the context that i linked
creepyPMs,removed,a penis when seen in the right context is the most wonderful sight for a woman
creepyPMs,removed,all good im only here for fun there are other accounts and other ips to use friend d
creepyPMs,removed,hate me for it but it made me chuckle comparing it to most on this r its very low on the creepy scale imho no its not me pinky swear
creepyPMs,removed,youre not wrong but just to add a little compassion consider the basis of trppua these men feel emasculated by the perceived sexual scarcity of women they feel they are constantly rejected and reduced to begging or worshipping to meet their needs the goal of trp is to alleviate that condition first off men women do foolish things when desperate its not the month dry spell that does you in its the gut fear that you are hungry and will never be full this makes them susceptible to ideas they might never otherwise be susceptible to second the trp community isnt wholly evil they are a supportive community place an emphasis on aggressive selfimprovement and are wholeheartedly antiselfvictimization i dont say this to rationalize their actions but to explain why a reasonable person could choose to remain in that community lastly negging works not always or with everyone but the pua community has been refining and fieldtesting these routines techniques for years now its unethical but its no surprise that a desperate man might use a weapon if it is placed in his hands
creepyPMs,removed,is this guy a perv oh god yes the perviest saddest creep of the bunch what makes creeps feel it is acceptable to just open a conversation with a nude picture request is beyond me tbh not sure why youd ever do that even if you know the person quite well but is he a pedo ehh year age difference not really of course he could be a creepy year old who is saying he is and either way nothing good could come from talking to him but really a relationship although weird isnt that gross or disgusting
creepyPMs,removed,that wasnt a neg you paranoid weirdo neither was that
creepyPMs,removed,so you ban people who disagree with you
creepyPMs,removed,both of those things vary from person to person girls also tend to hit puberty before boys ive met year olds who have had sex and it makese sense to me that they would others itd horrify me if i found out that they did its really incredibly contextual
creepyPMs,removed,its definitely not an assumption
creepyPMs,removed,i guess thats fair if the only reason that a creep would ask a year old for pictures was because they were not funny developed then that would be the case its just that that information is not given and said year old could look much more like a year old basically as creepy and gross as this person could be it feels wrong to give an allegation as serious as pedophile when it isnt obviously clearcut
creepyPMs,removed,understood im a detractor of trp but an apologist for compassion and balance ill show myself out
creepyPMs,removed,as a clarification pedophilia is when a child is prepubescentunder and the predator is or over in a lot of states it is legal for teens between to have sex with each other because they are close in age it is not however legal for him to send you nudes or ask for yours that is sexual harassment and if he send you nudes or extorted yours then he is by law trafficking in child pornography also this guy is a fucking creep and im sorry that you were treated that way
creepyPMs,removed,not if youve had a look through ops profile nsfw obviously
creepyPMs,removed,whats the site for research purposes for a friend of course
creepyPMs,removed,most year old have hit puberty obviously they have not come full circle yet but they are in the mix i male lost my virginity when i was to an year old female i knew what i wanted and it was literally my dream to fuck a college chick my year old mind was very simple im glad i was the prey
creepyPMs,removed,how did i violate rule number everything i said was factual op often posts to rgonewildhairy and the comment i replied to didnt know that i was only hoping to provide context to the messages the only thing i agreed with is that the op does have hair
creepyPMs,removed,i totally back you up on that without a doubt is that guy an asshole pig no one deserves such nasty words and i hope his comments did not make you feel bad because he just said it out of his own insecurities but if you really have low confidence in your appearance maybe instead of posting pics of yourself online you should go talk to a therapist trust me every girl including myself has those days where they feel like shit how could we not with all the flawless people all over social media thats thrown in our faces and whatnot if you ever need a girl to talk to message me ive worked with young girls with confidence issues so i have experience in trying my best to help you are a beautiful woman and you dont need strangers to confirm that you need to believe it yourself or itll tear you apart
creepyPMs,removed,that last line wow up until then he was kind of okay
creepyPMs,removed,the reality of threesomes is so different than porn it really isnt something i care to do ever again the gf isnt doing that because she wants to give you some magical gift of two women shes doing it because shes into women and youre going to spend most of your night with your dick in hand watching your gf get down with someone else hopefully youre not the jealous type hopefully shes not either threesomes disaster
creepyPMs,removed,from a guys perspectivehe is just trying to be a nice guy and have a conversation with her she is kinda using a which hunt tactic to try and demonize this man for some reason you people are doing a lot of judging of this guys character based off of one txt convo the pretentiousness makes me want to throw up
creepyPMs,removed,wait legitimate question what about this was wrong unless im misreading he seemed to get that you didnt want anything but was interested in being friends
creepyPMs,removed,trying to lure me into conversation no bitch i want to fucking talk to you because i think youre cute no wonder you are single a guy tries to have a convo and the first thing you think is this guy is luring me into a convo holy shit the entitlement by you is ridiculous how much is a convo from you worth obviously not much because you are a pretentious cunt that cant even find positivity in a guy talking to you
creepyPMs,removed,wow a friendly person offering help and giving you compliment dafuq
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand how people this stupid walk around and function in the adult world continuing to say lets be friends please and expecting a different result each time is the actual definition of insanity
creepyPMs,removed,i think every girl is subject to bouts of horrible self conscienceness but its true that the most important thing is how you feel about yourself and what you are comfortable with it can certainly by supported by peoples positive attention but you would do well to disregard people who just point judge and say your ugly save your acceptance of constructive criticisims for people you are close with whom you know have good intentions not strangers as i side note i looked for your post you do look alot more approachable and friendly with less make up i was taken back by the first pic because your makeup makes you look virtually identical to the girl behind you it could have been the lighting if this is one of the friends you said always gets more attention from boys be careful not to just copy them doing so might make you feel worse if it doesnt work for you the same way as it does for them personally i think you look fine but once again present your self the way you feel happiest
creepyPMs,removed,you said youd add the s to the whole thing for me
creepyPMs,removed,straight male here ill suck his dick for free rent
creepyPMs,removed,how did this get upvotes in hours that is a huge amount of upvotes for this sub
creepyPMs,removed,your spanish is fucking horrible or googles whichever it is it sucks
creepyPMs,removed,what other kind of pms do you expect to get though theres basically zero reason to pm someone most of the time
creepyPMs,removed,its not worth your time to lecture idiots especially when their obviously low opinion of you will make them disregard whatever you say just block and move on
creepyPMs,removed,i dont believe i participated in the offers made to me either and any offer in exchange for sex is disgusting so the woman making sex exchanges to me are disgusting
creepyPMs,removed,i just stated that something that was very similar to ops post theres nothing wrong with what i said its not kink shaming not if they want something in exchange for sex
creepyPMs,removed,youve got to be kidding how is it that the top comment doesnt qualify for kink shaming i must be a pretty big target
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know its been an hour and its got a hundred more upvotes and its just a typical post there is nothing amazing about it there is definitely traffic coming from somewhere to this post in particular for some reason
creepyPMs,removed,please egg him on for more its gold
creepyPMs,removed,do it pussy
creepyPMs,removed,this shit is just all trolls right dudes laughing as they fuck with people who give weak awkward come backs and stuff the cringe goes both ways on almost all of these not that anyone is expected to say anything witty in response to these creeps no idea why anyone responds in any capacity
creepyPMs,removed,sure thing it was only meant with intentions to cheer her up after such negative commentary in the posted picture but no problem ill keep that in mind
creepyPMs,removed,well hey at least you get to express some feelings he gets the feeling of joy thinking he trolled someone win win
creepyPMs,removed,dont feed the trolls
creepyPMs,removed,paging unosefetish
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know if this is open since i was browsing top rated comments after finding this sub but so you think women hate dick pics because they are so avaliable like if for years us men went on dick strike and hid them away refusing to let you see them women would be like man id love to see a dick again or is a dick just so inherently not attractive its just never welcome
creepyPMs,removed,honestly i felt kinda bad after reading the mental issues postarmy part he doesnt seem like that bad of a guy just lonely and probably overdramatic so many guys do a tour and come back fried i guess i got a soft spot for them
creepyPMs,removed,thank god makes me feel much better about millimeter peter
creepyPMs,removed,i feel ya girl i just want them to that they did wrong i just wanna be like bai whatever you probably have a little penis anyway
creepyPMs,removed,thatactually didnt seem so bad seemed like a sad lonely dude
creepyPMs,removed,its not the only way but its sure as hell the fastest way
creepyPMs,removed,poor guy is lonely he just wanted a friend you should have guilt trip sex
creepyPMs,removed,how would a woman nut in your muff though
creepyPMs,removed,it actually does look really weirdly shaped i was turning my phone around trying to work out whats going on in there obviously some kind of vegetable
creepyPMs,removed,i came to your sub because it was linked from somewhere else it looked kind of interesting at first but i now realize i stumbled into the wrong place a safe space ran by angry bitter women is not somewhere i should really be have a good one
creepyPMs,removed,why is your wife on a dating website
creepyPMs,removed,stretch marks rolls and cellulite all make me cute would you find my athletes foot ingrown toenails and halitosis cute everyone has flaws the moment you define them as cute you dont have to do anything about them his message wasnt the most tactful but he was still trying to be nice that could have been your future husband you just let slip by
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think this is all that creepy but more desperately creative
creepyPMs,removed,dude jackpot are you kidding me
creepyPMs,removed,why even reply to retards just ignore
creepyPMs,removed,i do not know what you are complaining about he seemed pretty polite to me
creepyPMs,removed,you dont have any context so dont judge why shouldnt girls not be allowed to do stuff like that if he says its inapropriate and she stops afterwards everything is fine if he joins the dirty talk its fine too some women enjoy that kind of dirty talk orand are sexually aroused when treated like a whore thats absolutely ok its their life and like lesbiansgaysetc they dont choose it just respect other peoples choices as long as they dont do any harm dont be that dickhead that thinks his realitymorals isare the only right ones
creepyPMs,removed,its what they want i think you by not giving a crap stand above him why answer someone who is not worth your time unless you did care he thought that because you are a woman and above his rank if it was true he is in the navy he automatically thought she fucked her superior that is annoying but people with that way of thinking arent worth it
creepyPMs,removed,so how many dicks did you suck
creepyPMs,removed,holy shit did the crazy surface at all during the hangout or just afterwards in these messages
creepyPMs,removed,ops gonna get some
creepyPMs,removed,this is normal flirting
creepyPMs,removed,whens the second date
creepyPMs,removed,the fact that this seems absurd reveals how sexist you are women sell panties likes this all the time dont be a yumyucker
creepyPMs,removed,you should get your ass back over there
creepyPMs,removed,hows your wifes son doing
creepyPMs,removed,this is a while other level of creepycrazy
creepyPMs,removed,there are girl versions of those messages that go around for all major holidays i think theyre funny and im pretty sure theyre meant to be taken that way just saying
creepyPMs,removed,i think you should have got pictoral proof
creepyPMs,removed,this sub is making me so mad who is actually like this in real life and does anyone have an address list we need to find them all and bury them in the hole deepest enough to hell
creepyPMs,removed,its a little heavy but i could have rolled with this if she warmed me up a little bit
creepyPMs,removed,i hope people realize the guys just a troll
creepyPMs,removed,whoa creepy so was it fun
creepyPMs,removed,yikes well it is always nice when the crazy out themselves so you dont stick your dick in it seriously dont
creepyPMs,removed,sounds like a keeper to me
creepyPMs,removed,why did it turn me on 😐
creepyPMs,removed,so using a shitty copypasta from another reddit is worthy of a post
creepyPMs,removed,i guess im the only one that doesnt see a problem with this op ill gladly take her off your hands pm me her digits okay but seriously my name is doctor creepy and even i think this woman is a creep thats saying something
creepyPMs,removed,you still got her number im into whatever this is
creepyPMs,removed,i dont really get how this is creepy though hes just kinda dumb and a little confused
creepyPMs,removed,why would you turn that down she might not be girlfriend material but you could still fuck her
creepyPMs,removed,op you need to tell us more about this girl you went out once was she cool how would you rate the date was she attractive did you do any or all those things she requested so many questions
creepyPMs,removed,send her my way
creepyPMs,removed,role playing rape is kinda common
creepyPMs,removed,does this post need to exist its a copy pasta from another sub
creepyPMs,removed,this was hot id drive to her house so fast
creepyPMs,removed,clearly shes ugly or this wouldnt be a problem
creepyPMs,removed,i cant tell which of these people we are supposed to be supporting they seem to e equally horrible to each other
creepyPMs,removed,were in boys
creepyPMs,removed,you dont need a relationship
creepyPMs,removed,did you do it
creepyPMs,removed,lol you have no reason to be jealous of anyone i like your style
creepyPMs,removed,hey at least she knows what she wants
creepyPMs,removed,creepy i dont think so this girl is hot to trot and is letting my man know big deal need to get over there and tcb
creepyPMs,removed,judging by this i take it the initial meeting went well
creepyPMs,removed,id do it anyways
creepyPMs,removed,love the profile pic
creepyPMs,removed,httplmgtfycomqearnt
creepyPMs,removed,thats an interesting way to recruit you must be a really attractive guy
creepyPMs,removed,plot twist the response was from your brother im not sure why someone would think this would be appropriate to ever say absolutely disgusting
creepyPMs,removed,for uh science
creepyPMs,removed,anxiety
creepyPMs,removed,take it as a compliment
creepyPMs,removed,i think you forgot to also upload httpmimgurcomzqlsfmc message
creepyPMs,removed,youre taking the piss yeh
creepyPMs,removed,im the top sniper in the entire us armed force one of my favorites httpknowyourmemecommemesnavysealcopypasta
creepyPMs,removed,im definitely in the wrong place to be having this opinion but he didnt seem that bad besides a classless hi sexy theres nothing there that screams creeper quite frankly felicia is a bitch sorry to hurt your feelings princess he was rejected he said goodbye why throw in that extra jab
creepyPMs,removed,so a guy compliments your skin and you classify that as creepy
creepyPMs,removed,this guy is actually way more polite than most of the people on this sub
creepyPMs,removed,i have to give him a little leniency he sounds like he is in pain and cant keep his shit together
creepyPMs,removed,us military americas rejects
creepyPMs,removed,kill kill kill
creepyPMs,removed,so despite your bizarre and creepy messages she inexplicably flirts back she asks a question about your general location perhaps to suss out if meeting in person is in the cards it looks like you said something above about planning a date you dont respond half an hour later she asks what gives you dont respond an hour and a half after that she sends one final message to indicate that shes exasperated with your hotandcold asshole act and you are asking us if you should be worried yes you should be worried but not about a based on just this she sounds lovely and better than you deserve
creepyPMs,removed,weak
creepyPMs,removed,what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch ill have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on alquaeda and i have over confirmed kills i am trained in gorilla warfare and im the top sniper in the entire us armed forces you are nothing to me but just another target i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth mark my fucking words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet think again fucker as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking dead kid i can be anywhere anytime and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with my bare hands not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent you little shit if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn idiot i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it youre fucking dead kiddo
creepyPMs,removed,maybe ive just been on this sub too long but this doesnt really strike me as being all that creepy hes a douche for sure but didnt really do anything creepy like what most posts on here display
creepyPMs,removed,yeah calling it a foul fetish is pretty damn rude to people who have it but can control themselves and treat others respectfully
creepyPMs,removed,u shouldve fucked him imo ive never seen someone start a convo with how many animals he owns and because u said unwere on a dating site i think its a lil more acceptable to just jump straight to the point of wanting to fuck and how long he can last haahah who knows man he coulve been real cool in person
creepyPMs,removed,because no one wants to help me every damn time obviously looks matter more than personality and if you truly dont believe that then your a complete idiot httpwwwtinderseductioncommalemodeltindercasestudy seriously stop being so damn stupid and grow up
creepyPMs,removed,if my face didnt look like complete utter shit women would actually be chasing me for being such a dickthey love that stuff but only from attractive guys
creepyPMs,removed,i was with a woman who was still lactating but far beyond the point of breastfeeding her child she encouraged any uh play
creepyPMs,removed,your comment has been removed in accordance with httpiimgurcomvkforaspng httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,removed,please resubmit with a different title thank you
creepyPMs,removed,i really dont think this was bad at all op was kind of a dick
creepyPMs,removed,he was trolling it looked like
creepyPMs,removed,is this even a reportable offense harassment could be very subjective on a dating site
creepyPMs,removed,this is really bad but i wouldnt say it the same as rape
creepyPMs,removed,fuck this guy but hes most definitely better than a rapist
creepyPMs,removed,iberalism is a cancer well duh
creepyPMs,removed,its a fetish people can have fetishes for strange things most people may nearly all people can control themselves besides seeing a mother breastfeed a baby would at most make someone think of themselves as either the baby or the mother and if as the mother they would most likely think of a partner with them if at all it isnt like people with lactation fetishes see a mother feeding cant control themselves and start viciously jacking off in the corner the baby would be the biggest turn off to anyone who doesnt have pedophilistic tendencies people have foot fetishes right that doesnt mean that they uncontrollably start moaning and ejaculating whenever a pair of flip flops saunter by
creepyPMs,removed,unless youre into that sort of thing
creepyPMs,removed,otherwise i treat it like religion its a personal thing that nobody wants to really hear about unless theyre into the same thing yeah but a key difference is you can go to church by yourself
creepyPMs,removed,awwhhh this story is tyt in all seriousness though is using the word smooching a common thing it seemed super awkward to me
creepyPMs,removed,give darius my warmest regards for putting this guy in his place
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt knew you didnt like it what the actual fk running away multiple times isnt enough
creepyPMs,removed,that last part had me rolling good job op
creepyPMs,removed,twrape you said rape like twice already was this really necessary
creepyPMs,removed,there are just so many things about this guy that make me cringe
creepyPMs,removed,absolutely owned at first i thought it was a bit much to go on but op played the long con beautifully so beautiful thanks for the chuckle
creepyPMs,removed,from the way this reads it seems like this guy would be perfectly happy to have cybersex with the httpwwwifictionorggamesplayzphp it would continuously furnish him with replies indicative of the futility and senselessness of his messages but that seems to be all he needs
creepyPMs,removed,oh my god imagining someone saying mmmmmch in any context is just horrible
creepyPMs,removed,then wat
creepyPMs,removed,darius you into romantic chat
creepyPMs,removed,what the fuck kind of sound is ummmch gag
creepyPMs,removed,rmeirl
creepyPMs,removed,didnt think it was possible to use the word rape times in a title
creepyPMs,removed,awesome although i have no idea how the words smooching and boobs didnt do it for ya that and all of the misspelled words made me feel like it was a year old its weird how he didnt like it when he was the one getting manhandled go figure
creepyPMs,removed,i definitely love myself some juicky pussy
creepyPMs,removed,meh it was a question about seemingly contradictory information on your okc profile admittedly it is a weird question to open a conversation with
creepyPMs,removed,thats against company policies lol
creepyPMs,removed,how did he not know you werent role playing since youd already said your not into it i worry ive started a conversation wrong just by asking what you up too this guy just jumps into talking about grabbing boobs wtf
creepyPMs,removed,you shot him down umm he just fucked you your cyberpregnant now
creepyPMs,removed,thats no way to speak to your assistant manager
creepyPMs,removed,what site is this
creepyPMs,removed,nothing wrong with rape roleplay as long as its consensual
creepyPMs,removed,thats against company policy has got to be my favourite part of this
creepyPMs,removed,good job as a man thank you as a human im sorry that happened
creepyPMs,removed,im really strong for a girl i doubt that youre probably just really strong we kind of need to stop with for a girl and such its kind of sexist and even though in this case youre a female using it thats reinforcing the whole for a girl thing just stand up for yourself youre not strong for a girl youre just strong in general
creepyPMs,removed,obviously on your side but it isnt fair to use paedo as shorthand for child molestor
creepyPMs,removed,tell me more about yourself no thanksi d rather know someone better and you look like an idiot from the text boxes sure thing k bye oh mani was totally playing with my ass right now and was to send you super hot pics i didn t read the whole thing but i got a glimpse later on and then op is trying to be a victim more than he is trying to have an actual conversation with someone who has been kind of ok
creepyPMs,removed,lmfao at those sound effects who says uumch or whatever the hell it was
creepyPMs,removed,awwhhhh
creepyPMs,removed,worst text based adventure ever
creepyPMs,removed,shit post
creepyPMs,removed,lol the last line is to prefect of an ending to this story that was hilarious
creepyPMs,removed,feel like his partner work needs development a lot of no but and rejection of the premise his inflexibility and lack of ability to respond to ops world building is disappointing unfortunately i dont think hell be getting into this years ucb rotation
creepyPMs,removed,user name checks out
creepyPMs,removed,op has a rapist wit
creepyPMs,removed,so romantic
creepyPMs,removed,that final shut up bitch had me cackling fantasy got too real for him
creepyPMs,removed,hilarious
creepyPMs,removed,he won he got what he wanted and she could have just blocked him he blocked her he is supreme
creepyPMs,removed,i see this comment section devolving into a discussion of moral absolutism v moral relativism
creepyPMs,removed,shut up bitch
creepyPMs,removed,youre the guy in this not the girl youve posted this on about subreddits and everyone has called you out for being a complete tool and a creep why are you so desperate for attention and or karma
creepyPMs,removed,okay cool
creepyPMs,removed,roll tide
creepyPMs,removed,fuck you and your trigger warning
creepyPMs,removed,smooch you deeper and deeper had me dying
creepyPMs,removed,it was pretty cringe from both sides to be honest one clingy person trying way way too hard and one self obsessed playing the exact complicated woman rom com role yuck
creepyPMs,removed,smooch deeper
creepyPMs,removed,he is like the adult rapist version of the kid that wouldnt adhere to rules andor listen to your input
creepyPMs,removed,what was with the cabin why would an assistant manager baker have a cabin
creepyPMs,removed,you know whatbetter love story then shades of gray
creepyPMs,removed,did you really need to add trigger warning to the end its about rape by the title itself if someone is uncomfortable with rape they should know not to click it please rethink this youre playing into triggerbots
creepyPMs,removed,did he actually go to jail any follow up news on that
creepyPMs,removed,awhhhhhhh
creepyPMs,removed,you took that opportunity and fucking went with it i love it i probably would have responded something like this creep pulls off bra creep what would you do creeptell me creepwhat would you do then me i pull you to my desk letting out joyful giggles me i sitting on my cold desk as i softly grab your dick me i sigh oh this is gonna be real fun i slowing back up onto my desk reaching toward the drawer me do you wanna have fun i whisper me i grab the toy from my desk revealing a shiny new box knife then faster than you can react i slice up your pathetic hotdog and old man nads i might have done something along these lines in omegle a few years ago
creepyPMs,removed,wow he chat raped you even before the roleplay started do like intimate chat no role play no its up to you not interested proceeds to do intimate role play
creepyPMs,removed,your pussy is juiky
creepyPMs,removed,got a little racist at the end there homie
creepyPMs,removed,awhhh
creepyPMs,removed,ummmch
creepyPMs,removed,these arguments would make more sense except on okcupid youre essentially broadcasting that information you publicly answer questions and state your heterosexuality shes publicly stating that she is straight and also publicly stating that she has had relations with women in the past most people would be curious about that contradictory information its an awkward opener like stated above but it is an understandable question
creepyPMs,removed,why not just not chat with him block him and move on
creepyPMs,removed,well generally speaking a lot are though a lot of sex attacks on children arent the result of uncontrollable sexual desire but other reasons such as plain cruelty and abusiveness i meant it the other way around though being a paedophile doesnt mean you dont think its wrong to sexually abuse children and most dont for the same reason most people who are attracted to adults dont rape them
creepyPMs,removed,shut up bitch that line alone was worth reading the rest
creepyPMs,removed,didnt see the more image was disappointed you didnt press the prison line further had to check a second time because i just didnt believe anyone could manage to not keep going with that more image ah perfect
creepyPMs,removed,omfg i was wondering if your post was going to just be you putting up with his fantasy because for so long it was run to the cabin door but then finally the police prison and darius well played great execution at the end i hope he lost his tiny erection
creepyPMs,removed,but thats the way it had to be they locked him up and threw away the key but i cant take pity on men of his kind even though he now takes it in the behind
creepyPMs,removed,im amazed at how patient you were if i were in your place i wouldve sent him something disgusting far earlier into the chat well done
creepyPMs,removed,i understand that youre upset but this does go against rule so its been removed
creepyPMs,removed,which one i just looked and the only thing that seems close is criticising ops handling of the situation which i wasnt really i was asking why not just move on if the situation makes you uncomfortable i see now that people probably milk or go seeking for content to post here this is reddit after all anyone says im claiming people never get harassed online and its all in your heads
creepyPMs,removed,i dont want this but i do so its okay gee where have we heard that before also so maybe you have a cabin for yourself what bakeries is he going to where assistant managers have cabins for themselves
creepyPMs,removed,what are you wearing right now my work clothes mmmmmnice lmao
creepyPMs,removed,thats too far lmaoooooo
creepyPMs,removed,creeper
creepyPMs,removed,aww he found romance in the end haha the was a pun
creepyPMs,removed,aw man should have made it weird sooner or just end it quick with and i pull out my penis
creepyPMs,removed,best part by far was when he interested his dick in your back
creepyPMs,removed,i laughed so hard youre amazing op
creepyPMs,removed,lolk
creepyPMs,removed,nice op seriously loved that and i have to say calling it romantic chat was hysterical to me for some reason i mean forcing you to the ground and throwing your brapanties away has such a romantic feel to it
creepyPMs,removed,my name is darius and youre my prison bitch now fabulous op fucking fabulous
creepyPMs,removed,fyi segue is pronounced segway please know that i dont want to be one of those annoying pedants who love to correct spelling errors i just think that segue is a word everyone uses when speaking but are often unsure of spelling myself included for a long time
creepyPMs,removed,lol at least hes being honest
creepyPMs,removed,i mean you understand not everyone shares the same sense of humour right
creepyPMs,removed,its a man
creepyPMs,removed,youd only think that because you frequent subs specifically highlighting it its no where near the norm

creepyPMs,removed,i know this is not the point but i really dont get why people find completely shaved vaginas attractive its kinda creepy to me almost like they want to look like a child
creepyPMs,removed,could she fit in a rowboat
creepyPMs,removed,cringing at the poor masking of identity more than the content next time op dont forget to block the quotes too 👍
creepyPMs,removed,i have a fiancee i get more than enough sex just saying if youre single you wouldnt pass it up
creepyPMs,removed,dont go on tinder if you cant handle awful pickup lines
creepyPMs,removed,twas a joke
creepyPMs,removed,well you did make a reddit post about it just to show how mature you are
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt exactly a comedy sub though

creepyPMs,removed,lol what you turn ths into a baseless anti trump post
creepyPMs,removed,it bothers me that pics like this get on the top of rtinder and they think its just a funnywitty pickup line
creepyPMs,removed,id take it thats like bucks a mn for me
creepyPMs,removed,looks like i found my number after being homeless i would totally take this offer instead one night of fear instead of a few months so easy
creepyPMs,removed,ill probably get downvoted to hell but wth he should lose his job at what point is it okay for a man to admittedly creepily pursue a woman shes a legal adult and no longer a student of his is the line can never have been a student of his cause that seems ridiculous what if hes and shes can he ask her for nudes then
creepyPMs,removed,im pretty much positive it was just a play in words and this guy is way overreacting
creepyPMs,removed,thats because theyre all cancerous newfags those of us who actually adhere to the rules have moved on to better things and no reddit is not one of these things
creepyPMs,removed,is he mentally ill there has to be something wrong with him blech
creepyPMs,removed,would tbh
creepyPMs,removed,i implore you if your friend wont report this then please report this yourself anonymously even do you know his name if so look him up if hes saying this to your friend hes likely doing this to other girls and possibly grooming students while theyre still enrolled seriously nobody is safe when you have a sexual predator employed by a school
creepyPMs,removed,wish i commanded that kind of a price
creepyPMs,removed,just send an email do something anything obviously this dude had these disgusting thoughts when you were in his class and it definitely wont stop at you two god forbid a naive girl falls for this while it wont be illegal since hes messaging year olds but its still creepy ass unacceptable behavior
creepyPMs,removed,women are often culturally expected to be in competition with one another at all times to attract the attention of men theyre expected to be catty and mean and backstabbing to even their friends especially if theyre both professionals or similarly in a line of work with prestige for a man to complement like this hes alluding to this by saying she is superior to her competition which is intended to flatter
creepyPMs,removed,block and walk away this guy doesnt deserve any attention not even a lecture
creepyPMs,removed,youd report him to the police is it a crime hes committing dudes clearly a jagbag but idk if this is criminal seems like the cops should have more important things to work on than somebody who is easily blocked bugging you
creepyPMs,removed,please report him he might get ballsy enough to try and molest a student do you really want that on your conscience your friend and you could of done something about it but instead meh i dont feel motivated you and your friend are whats wrong with this damn world your friend is basically telling him that its okay nice going
creepyPMs,removed,which rule did i break if its about slurs newfag is a slang term from its not intentionally derogatory like other derivatives of english cigarette
creepyPMs,removed,what the hell are you waiting for this bastard needs to be reported he can eventually rape or molest someone this is not okay
creepyPMs,removed,thats actually pretty fucking hilarious
creepyPMs,removed,eh you came off pretty bitchy right off the bat
creepyPMs,removed,he didnt go about it very smoothly but as someone who has converted to of them myself i can tell you it is one of those situations that the customer doesnt knnow what they want until you show them it only takes won hit of the dope dick to get her hooked
creepyPMs,removed,speak for yourself at least at the very least bisexual
creepyPMs,removed,lol more funny than creepy
creepyPMs,removed,lesbians trying to turn straight women is quite common in my personal experience same with gay men hunting straight maybe its just funinteresting
creepyPMs,removed,i worked with a girl who went out of her way to let everyone know she was a lesbian and all of her girlfriend problems two years later she is with a guy different strokes i guess literally
creepyPMs,removed,i worked with a girl who went out of her way to let everyone know she was a lesbian and all of her girlfriend problems two years later she is with a guy different strokes i guess literally
creepyPMs,removed,this was actually pretty funny
creepyPMs,removed,opportunity for a some
creepyPMs,removed,you get bored you get horny and instead of masterbating to pictures they want to get off talking to someone but chatting with a girl online is basically impossible so they go download a lesbian app or go to a lesbian chat room to try and get off eventually they cum and either forget all about the app they downloaded or feel like an idiot tldr men do dumb shit when their dick is hard source i have a dick and i do dumb shit when its hard
creepyPMs,removed,please stop responding to this guy as long as you engage with him hell keep harassing you if you ignore his messages he will eventually get bored but it might take awhile
creepyPMs,removed,dont mean to sound like an asshole but i know lesbians that strictly go after straight women just saying
creepyPMs,removed,just cuz ur stupid and think u like girls dont me u aint got a pussy that needs a good man fuckin
creepyPMs,removed,my mother is lesbian she has several friend that will not go after any women but straight dont know why
creepyPMs,removed,can we just once show this guys full name so we can give him hell please
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know why people dont use the block feature more often
creepyPMs,removed,there are times when i hate the no personal info bitcause id like to find this guy myself see how he looks with a knife in his balls
creepyPMs,removed,cause you posted to rabid radfem hivemind that cant be reasoned with thats why any questions must be silenced since their tiny little brains cant handle them
creepyPMs,removed,i would have blocked him before it escalated to all that probably right after im not your buddy all i want is a date
creepyPMs,removed,trolls gonna troll
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i know why do you think the sub gave him like downvotes seems a bit unreasonable dont you think because its an unreasonable sub filled with unreasonable people
creepyPMs,removed,i think this guy deserves it i would not mind if he was not around anymore
creepyPMs,removed,am i the only one that laughed at that
creepyPMs,removed,people like him should die in a fire not remotely funny if some dumbass did it as a prank or joke
creepyPMs,removed,theres really nothing at all creepy about salty year olds mad about halo
creepyPMs,removed,this guy is obviously nuts but if she never met him why does it look like his name is saved in her phone it says jacob and the last name is crossed outi say its fakejust my opinion otherwise i dont understand how she has his name and number in her phone without putting it in there at some point if this is realif someone else ever got into a similar situation definitely need to call the police and give them these screen shots along with the phone number if this man maybe even set up a fake meet up so the police can take a sicko like that down
creepyPMs,removed,calm down i already gave my opinion on the guy sorry i read this from my phone app and didnt see that it was facebook as first screenshot was taken from an fb app and at first glance i thought it was a text convo i never doubted that the guy was a dangerous nut pardon me for my skepticism a lot of ppl make fake posts like this for attention tldr i didnt notice it was a facebook message using narwal on my own phone still thing man is bad calm your tits
creepyPMs,removed,lol thats just wrong but people do always ignore the nice guy
creepyPMs,removed,i mean how do we know it wasnt ops throwaway and he wrote the whole letter to himself to create a rise fuck you short arms
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt very creepy though hes quite polite unless im missing something
creepyPMs,removed,hes probably just shy and has been trying to work out how to approach you
creepyPMs,removed,maybe the dude is just shy this is far from creepy
creepyPMs,removed,hows that creepy did someone politely asking you out for coffee offend you
creepyPMs,removed,you are a fucking piece of shit female who is shallow as fuck and is rude towards every guy who does not meet the standards she desires in a face you care only for sexy rich guys who cheat abuse and rape women you think cheating and sexual abuse is amazing and that every physically attractive female should be required to experience such torment since you believe cheating and rape are healthy facets of life you wish there was a genocide towards guys not meeting your physical standards including the one you just described you settle for abuse and cheating because you see no problem in it as long as the guy is sexy and rich this guy is most likely shy he is probably not even staring at you some people do have a condition in which they will stare and not realize they are staring you are one of the most shallow females i have ever seen on here maybe approach him and say hello and get to know one of your coworkers instead of judging them without knowing them all too well i hope you experience abuse and cheating for the rest of your life due to your heartlessness and shallowness
creepyPMs,removed,well when she is going to assume inaccurately about the guy based solely on his appearance that is extremely shallow like i said some people have a condition in which people will stare and not realize they are staring
creepyPMs,removed,oh wow so reddit is now a social justice arena every word i said was appropriate this is the internet if you are unable to handle the heat get out of the kitchen if someone is going to get offended on reddit they need to leave this is the issue with democrats especially you your party has created safe zones due to you social justice warriors militiamen are now allowed to show a card if they are too sensitive to certain activities in military training this is why isis will destroy us fuck you and your sensitivity grow up
creepyPMs,removed,he is obviously wrong but why you dont even say hi to your viewers
creepyPMs,removed,i imagine the writer is full retard
creepyPMs,removed,not that odd maybe hes too shy as the others said talk to him about it or just politely decline his offer more than a creep i see a guy who couldnt work up the courage in person good luck to you
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know man i to enjoy a good comeback to shut creepers up but that was just unnecessarily savage
creepyPMs,removed,damn i think after the first time he showed no respect is when you should of just blocked and moved on
creepyPMs,removed,well i dont think this all men i am not like this nor are any of my friends we all just move quietly and wish that person well not their fault for not being into us there are what i am finding are a larger number of creeps than i thought that respond like children in the most sour grapes way possible and take it to scary extremes however i still dont believe this is the majority of men even if there is a scary vocal minority
creepyPMs,removed,unfortunately women do crazy ass shit like this too
creepyPMs,removed,while hes being really creepy youre kind of being violent and disturbing
creepyPMs,removed,holy shit if hes then you should try to find his mother and send this
creepyPMs,removed,sure what he did was fucked up but you straight up said you wanted to murder him and dance on his grave because no one would mourn him sure what he did was creepy but that is fucked up
creepyPMs,removed,oh thats my bad i dont know how that app works i figured she hadnt because she replied some times
creepyPMs,removed,hes being a sick fuck no doubt but then she goes and says she wants to kill him and thats ok i just feel that people shouldnt stoop to their level telling people they wont be mourned because of a creepy message thats a little extreme if he said that to her hed be on rcreepypms for that
creepyPMs,removed,id actually say yes just to screw with him even more you know build his hope up actually engage him then bam
creepyPMs,removed,do some research about him if you would you know bit of past history for all i know he could be a shy guy or a psycho so yeah
creepyPMs,removed,i promise most men are pleasant or at the very least dont act like this in real life
creepyPMs,removed,im too superior to resort to slutty willing women i require the power trip of coercion
creepyPMs,removed,you do realize what subreddit youre on right this isnt even a hint of being creepy guy just likes you
creepyPMs,removed,or a bullet perhaps
creepyPMs,removed,for every one of these guys there is thousands of normal ones
creepyPMs,removed,i think you should report him to the police its illegal to threaten someone like that
creepyPMs,removed,im gonna have to see some proof
creepyPMs,removed,k
creepyPMs,removed,lets get a look at that snatch
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i think not
creepyPMs,removed,i take it you already know how to squirt then s
creepyPMs,removed,i tend to agree im a female in the us and op sounds like she would be cool but when i saw that this was on okcupid my first thought was that i never would have looked there for friendships
creepyPMs,removed,justewwww also this whole throat fucking thing ive seen creeps talk of lately it just sounds so wrong and horrible
creepyPMs,removed,you have been banned from reddit
creepyPMs,removed,that medical information is so interesting thanks if he does have that condition i hope stress is one of the triggers mwahahahahaha
creepyPMs,removed,yeah girls day must be pretty ruined when someone not a chad tells them they are hot
creepyPMs,removed,why is this even being upvoted op is the pos here
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair though your use of emojis make it seem like youre really not that offendedbotheredirritated by his comments
creepyPMs,removed,this is why you dont give out your info to strangers tbh
creepyPMs,removed,idk why you just didnt outright say not interested bye the way you ended it is leaving yourself open to more messages tbh
creepyPMs,removed,block dat bitch
creepyPMs,removed,hearts and smiles arent required to avoid being rude or offensive
creepyPMs,removed,so do you like bush or shaved
creepyPMs,removed,i hope i never see a cock with hair
creepyPMs,removed,whats your size then
creepyPMs,removed,well did you let him suck and lick you
creepyPMs,removed,red or retard
creepyPMs,removed,agree or disagree that continuing the conversation with the creepy text is just as creepy as opposed to ignoring and moving on with your life lot of text there but youre the boss
creepyPMs,removed,ah thats the reddit i know sweet sweet freedom of speech
creepyPMs,removed,i have serious mixed feelings about reporting people even if they are truly remorseful or whatever once upon a time i had a roommate who dated this emotionally immature guy i didnt much like him but only because he was always behind on rent and so it did wonders for my budget and since i knew the roommate first i often sided with her along with the three of us there was one more roommate f i went for a vacation to another country leaving the three of them in charge of the house when i returned i got this weird typed out message on my computer did i lock it maybe its set to auto log in on reboot from my roommate saying she missed me and this and that didnt think much of it but nobody was home eventually roommate the female told me what happened there was a drinking party and my roommate trolled her boyfriend too far and he freaked the hell out and started breaking shit and smashing up beer bottles and ended up cutting said roommate and a guest in the ensuing explosion they kicked him out and i guess that explained why the house was empty i was livid and wanted to call the cops but my roommate begged me not to i guess i didnt bc she told me that such a call might ruin his lifefuture and blah blah blahsigh
creepyPMs,removed,cyber tourettes
creepyPMs,removed,what is it with gay people and their affinity for contracting aids
creepyPMs,removed,im schizophrenic no im not
creepyPMs,removed,awe hes a giver
creepyPMs,removed,op is hot imo
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair i wouldnt know what that meant either wtf minus what i mean im reasonably sure that i would not have come to the same conclusion that your chatting partner did
creepyPMs,removed,how do characters like this get matches and i dont xx
creepyPMs,removed,no contact doesnt apply to all breakupsnever said it did however for men it is pretty sage advice not to engage in further contact with a female ex once shes made it clear shes notno longer interested for one there are a lot not all of women who will continue to engage in contact with an ex until she finds a better guy thus giving the guy she broke up with false hope for reconciliation its a way for her to gain emotional validation that would normally come only from a boyfriend but instead is coming from someone to whom the woman owes no obligation its somewhat akin to the friendzone but in this case there was an actual flame that could theoretically be rekindled this rarely happens so its best for most guys to discontinue hanging out with an old girlfriend for a very long time at least until hes managed to put his feelings for her behind him the second and most important reason is that it can put a guy in very hot legal water if he continues to engage with a woman whos clearly not or no longer interested a woman can show up at a mans workplace after he broke up with her over the phone to discuss the situation and no one will care hell if she goes nuts and starts destroying his car and films it the video could very well go viral if promoted properly if a guy does this it sends out all kinds of red flags and could net him a stalking charge im not defending men who terrorize their exes not one bit but i am saying that there are different rules governing how we can communicate with exes and for the most part not contacting a former flame if you were born with a penis and testicles and your ex was born with a vulva and ovaries is pretty solid advice its not fair but thats the way it is
creepyPMs,removed,yet another creepy pm post where its a race to the bottom of petty immaturity that the guy wins by a nose
creepyPMs,removed,this shows how much entitlement men online have since they see a woman online and think they have a right to demand anything from them they imagine that all women can be bought or ordered to comply with any demand simply because some women are sex workers who charge for a service so they think all women who show sexuality are sex workers too the manipulative dont be shy or dont be scared is used so often to try and push a woman to prove them wrong a classic negging technique i had a flat mate for a short while that i really did not want but he had good references and was the only application i needed someone to show the rent i found out that he saved his earnings each month to pay for a session at a dungeon he told me that he paid someone to remain perfectly still as though unconscious or dead as he caressed or touched them but they were not to move or make a sound i bought a lock for my room the final straw was when he watched criminal minds where a killer dug shallow graves for his female victims and left their faces out the ground so he could kiss themthe flat mate kept rewinding and making guttural turned on noises he said he just loved the idea of a woman looking dead and being lifelessi demanded he move out this guy in the op sounds like my last flat mate possibly into that horrible fetish beginning with n that we all know
creepyPMs,removed,since the moderators believe the rules only apply when it is a topic that doesnt affect their beliefs let me make it clear that you all are not only being unsupportive of the op but you are wrong about that i meant i do not think there is anything wrong with sex work i do however think that sex workers and whores are different sorry i triggered your anger so hard that you ignored the rules i do not think sex work is being disrespectful to your body this comment was made in reference to being open to every ass hat that has a dick sex workers arent open to that either i made the comment about my of partners in reference to being outraged that he would think me so sexually permiscuous that a disrespectful person could tare up my ass whenever they wanted so in summary back the fuck off i thought moderators would have more integrity and would do as they suggest to others here if you dont have anything nice to say to the op dont say anything at all
creepyPMs,removed,whelp thanks for the fucking sluts for making people think this shit is ok to send to me all the god damn time
creepyPMs,removed,i get that still would advise a more diplomatic way of saying that though generally ive noticed the mods and users here tune the rules and customs of the sub to encourage posters and some of the more unusual posts on this posts and rletsnotmeet ive read have come from stories involving female creepers
creepyPMs,removed,probably because people have to think their mutilated cock is perfectly fine and in their madness they perpetuate the barbaric procedure
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,i think its the angle of the shot unfortunately i had to view the gross penis again in order to make that observation thanks
creepyPMs,removed,both people in this conversation are cunts
creepyPMs,removed,wow youre both ignorant is it really creepy if you instigated this i feel like youre just seeking validation on your views which is not what this sub is about
creepyPMs,removed,so having disagreement is creepy now could i post your response here and where did you find out this was a she did i miss something or are you assuming genders
creepyPMs,removed,if you think who the fuck are you is anything even remotely calm or polite then theres nothing i can do for you she was downright nasty in engaging this conversation and while hes just as much of a shit you cant go around acting cunty and expecting the people who reply to act like peaches and cream
creepyPMs,removed,the creep was right that was an incredibly weak post
creepyPMs,removed,lol i cant stop fucking laughing it looks like a little squid
creepyPMs,removed,i know it sucks that a girl has to deal with ignorant shit like this but do you find it convenient that you automatically know that the guy is an idiot imagine you started dating some guy and then later on down the road you find out hes exactly the kind of guy who would send unsolicited dick pics its almost like theyre saving you time
creepyPMs,removed,good thing i saved all your pics is it safe to unfriend you or are you gonna post more nudes later
creepyPMs,removed,all of your male friends are harboring thoughts like thisall of them
creepyPMs,removed,dont be disparaging retards they can put a serious ass whipping on you something this huckleberry is sorely in need of
creepyPMs,removed,wow get lost hes just another internet dick
creepyPMs,removed,anyway adios them you message again yeah dudes a full on creeper and stuff but it was over then
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i dont know op i personally love that eggplant i think you overreacted
creepyPMs,removed,sorry guiz i think the convo is out of order start with to see this really creepy convo
creepyPMs,removed,that font gave me cancer
creepyPMs,removed,i think op is the creep here
creepyPMs,removed,ummmam i missing something is there more context to this
creepyPMs,removed,thats what i dont get you were so polite and he was a total dick but if you had been a bitch about it or when other girls are guys bitch about that you cant fucking win can you im starting to see why so many girls start their conversations with guys especially in places like bars and clubs with i have a boyfriend i used to think that was rude ive been in two serious relationships which have spanned the last years since i was so i hadnt been exposed to it as much as some i guess subbing to this subreddit and joining a social chat site briefly really has shown me why girls can be like that
creepyPMs,removed,now im curious are you really asexual
creepyPMs,removed,to know whether you were lying or not
creepyPMs,removed,i actually identify as a large buoyant seafaring vessel check your privilege
creepyPMs,removed,you were just as cringey as him
creepyPMs,removed,nope both she was equally as cringey as the fat caller
creepyPMs,removed,try zapping him with a cattle prod maybe hell become not interested or dead although that works just as well i suppose
creepyPMs,removed,id get just say give me a second i need to get my magnifying glass
creepyPMs,removed,aww how cute a second belly button
creepyPMs,removed,man i had meetme for a few weeks im a guy my profile pic was a pic of me and im married my profile said i was just there to chat with people and that i was happily married i had several pics of me and my wife on my profile i was just there to chat and i chatted with a few guys about atheism star trek and other cool stuff but every single female that i messaged would instablock me id say heya how are you doing and then im blocked i guess i can see why considering that many guys open with that and then drop dikpix but still it wouldve been nice to just chat with a stranger i dunno i guess ill have to settle for chatting with strangers on reddit
creepyPMs,removed,seems pretty normal to me unless he sent more after that
creepyPMs,removed,you know this is so wrong but hes got some moves some very annoying and persistent moves but hes got moves 😂
creepyPMs,removed,and then you made him pay for you thats where you messed up if you dont want a second date then its kinda your responsibility to pay at the end of the night instead of using tinder to get free food thats what makes you the asshole in this situation
creepyPMs,removed,well im a woman so seriously i cant believe nobody here sees a problem with her going on a date ignoring him the entire time and then making him pay literally sounds like her goal was mooching off some sad guy and that should be a worse crime for some reason you see no problem with that
creepyPMs,removed,reading the way she types and the way he types it sounds like he just offered and she didnt protest its literally unheard of for that to happen to a woman and if it did holy shit would that guy get destroyed for it and he certainly wouldnt be able to post it to the internet and get support
creepyPMs,removed,im not saying it was her goal im saying her actions were akin to someone who had that goal
creepyPMs,removed,so youre saying its the mans responsibility to pay for a date
creepyPMs,removed,you dont start a date expecting free food you follow through with the date in order to not have to pay for the bad date thats the strategy
creepyPMs,removed,under the assumption he couldnt pay a man shouldnt have to clarify he isnt paying for you if he does its because you expect him to
creepyPMs,removed,he needed some value back foe his spent money
creepyPMs,removed,no the replies can get so cringey too i respect people who dont take the bait and let those idiots brain hamster away
creepyPMs,removed,can you explain the douchey part how do you mean specifically
creepyPMs,removed,i added him as a friend before we met just curious why do people facebookfriend strangers theyve never met
creepyPMs,removed,depends on gender on how much sexual frustration
creepyPMs,removed,pardon me madam may i send you a picture of someone elses dick
creepyPMs,removed,thank you for being a polite user on reddit this bot was created by httpredditcomukooldawgstar if this bot is an annoyance to your subreddit feel free to ban it httpwwwgithubcomkooldawgstarpoliteusersbot
creepyPMs,removed,thats because you think the police have a money and care fountain they dont care about people sending you snaps unless they contained child porn or something nor do they have the resources to investigate everything so they prioritize do you honestly think theyre going to assign people to monitor ops cellphone and start sending subpoenas to snapchat or something lol and yeah all the local criminals are likely known to the pd and if they really wanted to bust them they could theyre not waiting for some brave op to bring in her snapchat records
creepyPMs,removed,rhacking i am a bot i link the subreddits mentioned in the title for easy navigation
creepyPMs,removed,i like his honesty though sometimes being straight forward will work
creepyPMs,removed,its just the face that hes so persistent i think its funny stop being a dick and give me your number some shit i would say 😂
creepyPMs,removed,yeah im saying op shouldnt waste police resources when there is nothing they are willing or able to do cheers
creepyPMs,removed,i cant bring myself to block a good creeper its a neverending source of hilarity to get a good one dont you wonder what gems youve missed think of all the starving subs here you could feed
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know seems like a nice guy
creepyPMs,removed,haha are you actually abrasive personality ticking bioclock above average bfno wonder youre online dating
creepyPMs,removed,he gets upset with me never responding to him so he wanted my phone number left with no choice i had to give him it you didnt have to give it to him and you did have a choice
creepyPMs,removed,you have both a bf and fwb i cant even manage one how does that work
creepyPMs,removed,youre cheating on your bf eh god speed
creepyPMs,removed,okay hug boxes happening here
creepyPMs,removed,through no specific fault of your own you happen to be a geekboys dreamgirl im in a position to know if youre unwilling to pretend to be a large hirsute individual named boris i suggest you polish up your very best oneliners and snappy comebacks because you will have what certain militaristic types might term a targetrich environment lol firefly rules btw what character do you most resemble personalitywise i favor wash
creepyPMs,removed,youre only saying that because your penis is so tiny s
creepyPMs,removed,you hit the nail on the head about dicks not being attractive appendages dicks are not an attractive looking organ
creepyPMs,removed,hi we have a copypaste message of resources we put when underage people are creeped on paging unosefetish
creepyPMs,removed,i sexually identify as your heels
creepyPMs,removed,i wish dudes sent me dick pics but all i get are african princes who want to give me money
creepyPMs,removed,op you are fully blown retarded this dude is just playing your strings and youre goin ape shit having a hard time understanding who it is here thats the creepy one
creepyPMs,removed,why insult him
creepyPMs,removed,i cant stand the empty profs either but both of you seem like the worst
creepyPMs,removed,could be your looks
creepyPMs,removed,i think the important thing here is you were friends what happened op
creepyPMs,removed,oh okay
creepyPMs,removed,at first i thought you were jane but reread and saw you were ignorant and a slut but not an ignorant slut
creepyPMs,removed,he is a lot more respectful than others on here
creepyPMs,removed,if someone wants his kik to have something to laugh about i send it via pm
creepyPMs,removed,can totally relate op ive been told i must be a guy because i called someone out on their bullshit too
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know whats creepier the text or the fact that someone has been in a committed monogamous relationship since the age of seventeen and that they are over the age of nineteen
creepyPMs,removed,i dont need to have worked in a pizza girl for my house had to change their pizza guy has bots maybe
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think the first message was creepy at all but he killed it with the second
creepyPMs,removed,jesus christ that font
creepyPMs,removed,ok maybe im weird but im not really that creeped out by this message is a little weird and he shouldve taken the hint though
creepyPMs,removed,well yeah i was just saying it didnt really creep me out was all im not saying anyone else cant feel different obviously like im not saying dude is in the right just that i didnt get creepy vibes off it
creepyPMs,removed,thats sucks but id just tell him youre not interested itd be a pretty sorry move to get the guy fired over this like others are suggesting
creepyPMs,removed,just show him the font youre using and hero back right down
creepyPMs,removed,and what exactly are you expecting would happen from that he sees the error of his ways
creepyPMs,removed,it may be outlandish and inappropriate for him to reach out like that but why not just say no thanks i agree you shouldnt have to and the dude could take a hint but a two letter text could drive the point home and end the bs alternatively call management as others here suggested
creepyPMs,removed,if your story is true its like way past the point of the story this post is about on the inappropriateness scale call the damn management at that place if not for you then to save some other poor girl from making it onto his list
creepyPMs,removed,i wouldnt call this creepy i mean sure its a bit weird and makes it awkward if its a no but cmon he sent messages that were perfectly nice and respectful i know i wouldnt have the balls to do that
creepyPMs,removed,i acknowledged this in response to the other answer to my comment which was really similar to yours ill say again that this isnt about him being entitled or owed or being in his rights because i think i was pretty clear in my first comment that i agree he was not it was simply a suggestion of a quick way to get him to stop and leave her alone
creepyPMs,removed,personal safety come on dude its just a neckbeard being creepy
creepyPMs,removed,rinsanepeoplefacebook
creepyPMs,removed,just say no
creepyPMs,removed,probably incels or red pills
creepyPMs,removed,lets be honest here was your friend really going to reply to him if it was hours later his response was totally uncalled for but come on atleast reject them so they arent over thinking and wasting their time
creepyPMs,removed,well if you dont respond within a reasonable time frame it ethier means your busy or you think the other person isnt hot enough or good enough to even deserve a messege back which would honestly make most people pissed and is probably the number one reason you wouldnt talk to some one on a dating website and dont pull that i care about personality crap because every one has standards
creepyPMs,removed,how much more of a robot can you be he wanted to reach out to someone who he thought was attractive and maybe he thought they could have a future together just because he pulled a small amount of strings to get her number and text her doesnt make him some evil and soulless human who thrives off of womens disgust to him to me trying to see if someone you like likes you back is worth it and nothing about this is creepy to me except for maybe the second message
creepyPMs,removed,double cringe this is new to me
creepyPMs,removed,its very unprofessional and should not happen however what exactly makes it creepy
creepyPMs,removed,meh lets say she meets a nice guy shes interested in at a coffee shop she doesnt know what that guy is capable of either so im not sure you can use that as an argument and if you know where someone lives youre not allowed to ask them on a date again im sure there are lots of examples where a guy or gal knows someones address and its not at all creepy to ask them out or show interest however i do agree that its a breach of privacy and hes taking advantage of having someones number im not defending the guy as i believe what he did was wrong i feel the need to point that out before the assuming downvote brigade appear
creepyPMs,removed,i love it
creepyPMs,removed,didnt seem that creepy based on the subject you were on
creepyPMs,removed,is there like a certain age that single lonely men just go full weirdo and creep because that theme is extremely common on this sub
creepyPMs,removed,gonna need some burn heal for that
creepyPMs,removed,calm down i meant you as in general maybe others here were asexual so they might want to explain i didnt mean anything by it i also asked for directions to where i might be able to learn more by myself i dont feel like i did a barrage of really personal questions since i didnt mean for them to be addressed directly at op
creepyPMs,removed,rroastme
creepyPMs,removed,if you wouldnt ask your grandma the questions you send random girls online you shouldnt send it at all
creepyPMs,removed,did you even read my comment she wasnt forced to say a word and didnt as i was walking out of the restaurant i just handed her a card and made a statement not a question theres not a comment in the world thats more noncommittal than if you ever want to hang out call me maybe if i stood there and forced her to give me an answer but like i said i didnt
creepyPMs,removed,did you even read my comment she wasnt forced to say a word and didnt as i was walking out of the restaurant i just handed her a card and made a statement not a question theres not a comment in the world thats more noncommittal than if you ever want to hang out call me maybe if i stood there and forced her to give me an answer but like i said i didnt
creepyPMs,removed,why are you making a list of things no woman ever is going to let you do put both of them down then
creepyPMs,removed,that chin alone is scaring me
creepyPMs,removed,what app is this anyway
creepyPMs,removed,i bet woolie willy didnt appreciate that
creepyPMs,removed,thats an ugly looking thumb
creepyPMs,removed,looks at own thumb
creepyPMs,removed,i like that hes only offering one if you want morning action accept nighttime dissatisfaction
creepyPMs,removed,rmeetme
creepyPMs,removed,what does this guys appearance have to do with it how dare you send me a a creepy message and be ugly like obviously an inappropriate message but why attack his looks
creepyPMs,removed,at some point you could have stopped replying
creepyPMs,removed,here is my complaint im scoring just about as much as this idiot is by being polite and engaging that and the staggering number of prospective individuals who are overweight
creepyPMs,removed,so you have at the same time slooot
creepyPMs,removed,im just wondering why keep answering their questions like if you chat on other apps
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand why you continued the conversation for so long like just end it its so easy
creepyPMs,removed,can you block him back and report his account for bullying inappropriate pictures
creepyPMs,removed,why didnt you just block him
creepyPMs,removed,damnboth of you need some more english competency in your lives
creepyPMs,removed,mine is slightly beyond adequate ladies
creepyPMs,removed,while this guy was a total creepo i also feel you like to have the last word like you egged on the convo and encouraged conversation by replying when you could of just ignored him
creepyPMs,removed,i go on this sub often and every time i try to initially side with the creeper i hold this dwindling hope that maybe it is just some rude person and sometimes on rcringepics that can be true but this is just exemplerary of what i come to find wtf is this dudes end game fifty nos is the threshold before true love emerges honestly i have been the creeper before but man this is too much
creepyPMs,removed,honestly not trying to criticize or anything mostly just curious because it seemed incredibly out of the blue why did you ask do you like someone that doesnt like you after he responded with ok i see i would have saw that as a good way to end the conversation unless there was more that i didnt connect but wow some people just dont understand basic human functions sometimes
creepyPMs,removed,op i know you said you didnt want to talk to that guy but would it help to know hes only a year older than you
creepyPMs,removed,why so vague just be straight with him
creepyPMs,removed,well thats fairly schizo friend bitch youre so hot
creepyPMs,removed,why not just remove straight away did you really just let this go on so you post here if someone is annoying me like this i just delete them
creepyPMs,removed,you definitely are validating yourself by keeping talking to him no wonder he continues
creepyPMs,removed,sorry came from rall didnt know there was a rule against logic
creepyPMs,removed,you could of also not like clicked the link
creepyPMs,removed,i see this shit all the time girl i dont wanna date you guy why are you leading me on girl i dont like you guy why cant you make up your mind we are taught as women that no means no but i strongly believe even as a rape victim and a child that was molested no means nothing that word doesnt exist it doesnt help and it never will punching someone in the balls helps blocking someone immediately and not going round and round with a crazy person helps too girls stop being nice if you even get a single whiff of perv tell them to go die in a fire of aids and tuberculosis and then block them
creepyPMs,removed,why do you keep responding and saying youre going to remove him and then keep responding
creepyPMs,removed,just the pro tip
creepyPMs,removed,i wouldve just removed him after the first couple of annoying messages
creepyPMs,removed,whats even going on in that picture it looks like open legs and cheetoh dust
creepyPMs,removed,wait a minutewhy does he thinkknow ops got a hairy pussy
creepyPMs,removed,is it just me or does it kind of seem like they were engaging just to say no where else do you chat sometimes kik want to chat there no remove him like you said and move on you both look like dicks
creepyPMs,removed,no like the example i provided from your conversation you are engaging saying ill remove you but still answering his questions on where you chat you were very clear but you did keep engaging and responding say no and remove him no need to engage further you kept it going just as much as him this conversation makes neither of you look good both guilty
creepyPMs,removed,no you just make me cringe seeing that you continue to bait for karma thanks for helping me unsub by being so contrived
creepyPMs,removed,dont support obesity on this sub
creepyPMs,removed,both sides of the convo are pretty cringy
creepyPMs,removed,are you dtf okay okay what does that mean exactly all the cringe everywhere
creepyPMs,removed,sounds like a muslim or foreigner western women are gonna deal with this shit more and more with muslim migration
creepyPMs,removed,ah okay i see without time stamps its very hard to tell haha
creepyPMs,removed,they think men and women think alike they cant understand that dicks are actually ugly weird looking and flat out nothing special what makes the actual cock desirable is who it is attached to the connection chemistry emotional attachment and then the way all those concepts get together during intercourse and the way the cock is used combined with all that energy and attraction for some men if a girl sends a boob or vag pic it has pretty the same effect as the previous paragraph they are the ones who do not understand women thinking and im sure theyve never been in a relationship aside from porn an escort or a hooker thats why they cant fool anyone with the other women like it or the classic i have tons of girls i make love to on the side they wouldnt have the money to pay for that many girls
creepyPMs,removed,can we start a separate one that works in tandem with womens rights and call it a shortened form of everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect period regardless of differing traits so how about we all just leave each other the fuck alone then
creepyPMs,removed,its like they think theyre entitled to you or see you as subhuman thats not unique to older men there will be guys in every age group that act like that youre expecting to see it with older guys now and notice it more when they do its confirmation bias
creepyPMs,removed,there was one who was even married with children who thought he was going to woo me by telling me hes married with children then when i rejected him he started calling me ugly and fat while claiming hes a respectful man its like they think theyre entitled to you or see you as subhuman narcissistic personality disorder
creepyPMs,removed,ya know i dont like to be a killjoy when it comes to fetishes but what the fuck is with that giantess stuff its so weird to me
creepyPMs,removed,hey i never said joy and peace but the fem in feminism has always bothered me despite some saying feminism is about equality for everyone and calling a movement andrism would sound like it was mainly focused on men a word that clearly declares the movement to be for all people would be better thats just my opinion
creepyPMs,removed,well now you made me look at your post history you planned that didnt you
creepyPMs,removed,i miss you
creepyPMs,removed,yeah that guy was probable white and a man and probably donald trump see totally safe we are good no one is offended whew gotta avoid those down votes
creepyPMs,removed,youre also probably one of the few odd guys who kiss ass way too much for approval i guess username checks out in a notsofun way almost anyone who sends unsolicited dick pics isnt alright fact they must have some big issues like not being able to attract women for example jumping on a wagon to compare yourself to a subnormal dickpic maniac just exposes your own personality flaws your high horse is stunted
creepyPMs,removed,id get with her any day
creepyPMs,removed,see this is the correct way to shut this type of shit down instead of dragging it on for hours
creepyPMs,removed,why is he still on ur messenger u idiot
creepyPMs,removed,it looks like you struck a nerve a very tiny nerve
creepyPMs,removed,why are you like this
creepyPMs,removed,i realize this isnt directly related but if you tell someone no blowjobs and they give you a blowjob isnt that sexual assault not in any way trying to defend this creeppedo apologist
creepyPMs,removed,doesnt that describe some of the posts here
creepyPMs,removed,i was just saying it doesnt matter whether hes a paedophile or not what he did is just as terrible i just think it is dangerous to demonise innocent people who happen to be paedophiles there are many i have met some the reason why it is dangerous to casually use the word paedo to mean child molestor is that being demonised by careless use of language makes people feel that they cannot be a part of society and when we push people out that is when we risk them becoming dangerous
creepyPMs,removed,please just ignore his attempts at contact he doesnt deserve any emotional investment
creepyPMs,removed,geez calm your tits you cunt whore dyke bitch show the man some respect
creepyPMs,removed,i deleted my own comment no one seems to be able to tell me which rule i broke
creepyPMs,removed,i wish you didnt validate him by trying to prove him wrong by offering up your numbers for him to shit talk
creepyPMs,removed,for fucks sake then i hate that you acknowledged that his criticisms have any weight at all by trying to invalidate them with personal information they poke because they want a response his entire diatribe is absolute bullshit whether she weighs or fuck that dude and his opinions on anything
creepyPMs,removed,my opinion is appropriate thats the reaction i had i wasnt offering any caw thats my reaction i hate seeing them validated period
creepyPMs,removed,ohhhhh you always do this ok got it
creepyPMs,removed,enough let it go
creepyPMs,removed,do men just have no control
creepyPMs,removed,yeahhh thats just called being a cunt to a stranger he wasnt even slightly creepy
creepyPMs,removed,only female for men i should save a few emails they send me
creepyPMs,removed,thats funny because her father wanted your snatch
creepyPMs,removed,this is so fucking lame
creepyPMs,removed,really ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° tell me more
creepyPMs,removed,could have been a test from the fiance you passed
creepyPMs,removed,between that and a city of four million people and mention of proximity to a subway stop near downtown this is a very findable op delete some details
creepyPMs,removed,the problem lies with lack of understanding when it comes to the alternative bdsm community and those outside of it i made a complaint and was met by a representative i said that i understood it is hard to understand what consent is when related to bdsm for anyone who is not involved in the intricacies of boundaries limits and positive consent i said how the police dealt with me was the same as them saying you wore a slutty outfit with your husband what dod you expect when another man realised you wear a slutty outfit they of course raped and assaulted you it is your fault that he did this because of what you wore the rep agreed that it was very similar and offered that the policeman was a very traditional muslim religious culture and therefore had no basis for reference or understanding for the complexities when people say go to the police in matters for co sent violation i do think they appreciate that bdsm us not understood and very difficult to appreciation from a vanilla mindset the photographer i met was married in a vanilla relationship with children knowing i was married and monogamous but was there to show my portfolio as a fashion designer for fetish wear decided to force his fetish on me he put on leather gloves and as i thought he was getting a drink came up behind me and clamped his hand over my nose and mouth suffocating me as he held me down i tried to fight him but he was stronger he kept saying shhh just let go as oxygen ran out i managed to break free a moment but he grabbed me again somehow i got free and ran for it as he went after me apologising saying he didnt know what came over him he was sorry i felt violated and distraught like how it was after being raped the police however hearing this went to him and he said yes he did it but that i had asked him too and showed pictures of me proving i did bondage the police saw that and decided it was obviously something i was into it it is incredibly wrong but highlights that the police do not help in these matters of consent it is a nightmare navigating photographers i admit i am frightened of male photographers now despite anyone saying they never would act the way of the op i do not trust them be careful op
creepyPMs,removed,i am kind of leaning towards fake on this one
creepyPMs,removed,modded to death
creepyPMs,removed,wowww people are absolutely retarded
creepyPMs,removed,omfg are you me i also went on exactly two dates with a guy who then started on the i love yous so i had to immediately cut contact this is disgusting i cant believe you let him go on for so long without blocking his number but also really glad you did for my entertainment haha
creepyPMs,removed,you should expect this when using kik just saying
creepyPMs,removed,be wary this can be very well be interpreted as illegal and could get you in trouble especially if they actually give you the money and later regret it
creepyPMs,removed,hate to say it but best aphrodisiac next to money is a wedding ring for some women its a form of quality control that since someone married him not everything must be bad maybe she could even fix him other women like it because it means the relationship will remain strictly casual since he would never leave his wife and kids im sure theres tons of other reasons too
creepyPMs,removed,my comment will probably get buried but im coming here with some advice always listen to the voice in your head if something didnt feel right with it then something isnt right dont try to let people down easily be blunt and honest without being mean its simple and effective just from the few beginning texts it seems like yall both have some issues i wish you luck on the drinking thing its rough when youre not doing well
creepyPMs,removed,what app is this that married people are hanging out looking for friends never heard of such a thing
creepyPMs,removed,this phones battery is at and needs charging i am a bot i use ocr to detect battery levels sometimes i make mistakes sorry httpsnpredditcomrphonebatterylevelbot
creepyPMs,removed,why respond
creepyPMs,removed,dude is definitely jealous as hell however people like that need clear calls or they will never understand i dont want to see anyone cut it the low selfesteem of this guy is dripping off his messages
creepyPMs,removed,dont you have other texts to respond to before you post on reddit
creepyPMs,removed,you sound kind of stuck up i see your point i a way but if he sends you a clothed pic and you send that back then you look like an ass down vote me thats fine my message is still sent to op and they hopefully will look at their attitude towards this in a different light
creepyPMs,removed,they do get messages back how else do you think the most of them act this way its expected its a sex app
creepyPMs,removed,in his defense maybe he thought this is probably a good person so they might not be a cheater
creepyPMs,removed,what a cunt he says dont mock me when he has been insulting you the whole time im just surprised how civil you were to him
creepyPMs,removed,you acted like a total cunt youre both cringey and creepy
creepyPMs,removed,last year isnt old
creepyPMs,removed,haha seriously this dude in the navy tattoos piercings
creepyPMs,removed,no but the mod said i shouldnt post comments like that
creepyPMs,removed,thatll be quite hard since you retards state the interpretation definition and enforcement of these rules is at the discretion of the mods fascist fucktards ban that
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,whats creepy about this he sent one message and followed up with another one couple of days later i assume he never responded to your message and that probably pissed you off messages from a guy over the span of couple of days is creepy lol enjoy your short stay on front page
creepyPMs,removed,whatever i didnt think it was creepy but thats just my opinion
creepyPMs,removed,single mothers are pathologically unreliable they are selfish narcissistic and neurotic there is nothing wrong with choosing to avoid them
creepyPMs,removed,i really do not see the problem with ops post the man is simply saving time by advertising his disinterest in single mothers no woman gets divorced without a good reason unless she is a widow single mothers should be treated as though they are the bubonic plague you can insult if you want to honey but im simply sharing my experience and knowledge
creepyPMs,removed,i mean you were on omegle
creepyPMs,removed,i usually just use that second message as a last chance if that doesnt work then she isnt interestedbut this nice guy how do people assume so much about people theyve never met
creepyPMs,removed,not that hes in the right but why did you swipe right if you had no intention of messaging
creepyPMs,removed,i really dont know why you keep on messaging me yeah probably has something to do with the fact that you kept responding cringe
creepyPMs,removed,maybe its his thing to be weird or confusing sometimes when i ejaculate i reach up a hand towards the sky and flatly say messiah i just love the look on the prostitutes face when i do it
creepyPMs,removed,ohhhh
creepyPMs,removed,come on give this man a chance he just needs a cunt nothing more
creepyPMs,removed,is she on a dating app lol
creepyPMs,removed,why not block off the start and avoid it all i
creepyPMs,removed,stop responding you moron
creepyPMs,removed,i get off on creeps talking to me because im a fucking whale
creepyPMs,removed,you fatties gotta stick together its the law of gravity
creepyPMs,removed,why do i get the feeling girls join these chats just hoping someone like this starts talking to them
creepyPMs,removed,i guess the longer the conversation the more creepy and cringey but why not just block after the riveting opening
creepyPMs,removed,please remember to not body shame thank you
creepyPMs,removed,nobodys forcing me did this shit all of my own volition
creepyPMs,removed,so youre cool with getting creepy messages from dudes whose heads dont look like thumbs
creepyPMs,removed,it does if theyre a proctologist
creepyPMs,removed,why attack her with unwanted sexual messages obviously op is going to use whatever limited ammo she has to tell him to fuck off the feelings of crreps dont matter when youre fending them off
creepyPMs,removed,this is really cringey but is there anything here that constitutes a creep nothing overly sexual nothing even remotely misogynistic nothing that befits a stalker no allusions to his penis considering that op never responded no disregard of the word no overall nothing that suggests that this person is thinking with creep mentality i mean i would never go out with this person but does he really deserve to be labeled as creep
creepyPMs,removed,dude is mad cuz hes missing chromosomes
creepyPMs,removed,that would actually impress me
creepyPMs,removed,up vote for pokemon reference
creepyPMs,removed,thats the saddest nude ive ever seen
creepyPMs,removed,jeez you could reply to him once in a while
creepyPMs,removed,ok satan
creepyPMs,removed,omg her response was like really aggressive and made me v uncomfortable
creepyPMs,removed,i mean its not long red pill or incel folks dont brigade anyway
creepyPMs,removed,this guy was just trying to push your buttons if you say you dont want to be called a pet name in your profile of course hes going to call you by a pet name id suggest you remove that particular part from your profile otherwise other trolls will zero in on that and will keep on giving you pet names just because you dont want to be given any
creepyPMs,removed,that response made me cringe more than the original proposition yuck why are you so edgy why did you waste so much effort typing that message just for some random guy
creepyPMs,removed,which is supposed to be the creepy one here
creepyPMs,removed,well to be fair ucraigsliststripper maybe they just saw your username and went with it
creepyPMs,removed,so you feel wild
creepyPMs,removed,you of all people huh
creepyPMs,removed,httpimgurcomipafrtn so i guess he wasnt blocked on my laptop and it recorded more messages from him
creepyPMs,removed,will they be a little hairy later on asking for a friend
creepyPMs,removed,err block him like right now maybe
creepyPMs,removed,seems like an obv joke
creepyPMs,removed,but why even respond
creepyPMs,removed,when you keep replying to him it just makes you look immature as well but i guess you gotta get karma somehow
creepyPMs,removed,maybe he should put his profile on private if he doesnt want people looking at it orrrrr not add people who hes not comfortable with if she had found your profile on her own then i agree super creepy but if you added her i dont know what else to expect
creepyPMs,removed,obviously not to me
creepyPMs,removed,if i really dont want anything to do with someone i either dont respond at all or i end the conversation with one line anyone else have a hard time sympathizing with people who take the time to have a full conversation of ill keep talking to you but pretend im not interested instead of just ending it
creepyPMs,removed,you probably didnt know but midget is considered a really derogatory term
creepyPMs,removed,australias golden son
creepyPMs,removed,meh dont respond to him at all eventually hell stop if he never gets responses
creepyPMs,removed,man logic obviosly what he said isnt acceptable but man logic all men act like this hm i didnt know i did this good to know
creepyPMs,removed,just making an easy observation
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know how you can compare a perfectly nice penis to a vile and disgusting cucumber oh wait it probably belongs to a vile skanky pedoi guess comparing it to a cucumber is justified thenplease carry on
creepyPMs,removed,gotta be a brown guy
creepyPMs,removed,i knew what he would ask yeah but i wasnt expecting him to be such a pussy there was this other guy who pm very similar im wondering if its the same person he also got super upset w me i should post that message too
creepyPMs,removed,men problems women problems
creepyPMs,removed,dunno how im going to move on from these downvotes i guess ill just try my hardest to continue life as normal day by day seriously though i dont get it add me on facebook but for the love of god dont look at my facebook but like i said since she found it herself then it does make it super creepy but if you dont want your info shared to world maybe dont make it public you have complete control over what people can see of your shit on facebook
creepyPMs,removed,ha his pics are still up httpsimgurcomauedgr
creepyPMs,removed,aweee this poor guy needs a friend try just sending him pictures of cute baby animals may keep him distracted
creepyPMs,removed,so do you think hes gonna get some
creepyPMs,removed,ive seen girls act that way olds but only once have i been lucky to hook up with a yr old that acted like this fuuck it how she look op keep that bitch in the booty call list and use her when needed
creepyPMs,removed,he needs to shut er down hes being too nice and leading her on
creepyPMs,removed,is nobody going to talk about the fact that he seems into it the whole time at no point does he seem uncomfortable he doesnt overshare as much as she does but he sends back winkfaces and promises to get drinks with her soon i wouldnt say shes creepy considering shes not pushing a disinterested person to engage with her her grammar and phrasing are definitely a bit much but just because you wouldnt be into it doesnt mean this guy isnt
creepyPMs,removed,why did you post a picture of your ass online if you didnt want people to look at itcomment on it
creepyPMs,removed,hey crazy is great in bed
creepyPMs,removed,how hot is your friend op
creepyPMs,removed,this is usually the sign of a toxic individual usually a personality disorder like borderline histrionic or narcissistic you dont want to stick it in crazy unless your willing to pay with your own sanity
creepyPMs,removed,she must be pretty hot for him to still be thinking about it and not blocking her immediately
creepyPMs,removed,well when you post nudes online youre gonna get this type of shit duh
creepyPMs,removed,im gonna need a photo no hot chick is that desperate hahahah
creepyPMs,removed,ahh a good old fashioned love bomb been a while since ive seen it in the wild this woman without doubt has a npd run to the fucking hills
creepyPMs,removed,dont be a creep here your comments have been removed you will not get another warning
creepyPMs,removed,just want to check somethingbefore i read the comments i thought this looked like an innocent confession that the guy worked really hard to say and i felt bad for him thats ok right if i didnt know he was actually your brother then its ok
creepyPMs,removed,oh hey thats me
creepyPMs,removed,so obviously some people go wayyy over the line with some of their comments but honestly dont most people who post on subreddits like rgonewild likewant the attention i know i as a female would expect most of these if i were to post pics of myself and not think they were too crazy i mean thats kind of expected when you post on subreddits like that i think am i missing something here is it just that you have not consented to having people message you stuff like that so you feel uncomfortable
creepyPMs,removed,right and like my first sentence states i absolutely agree that people cross the line but for instance the first example in your post is more of what im talking about
creepyPMs,removed,yes people cross over the line like i said in my first sentence and this line is different for everyone but what im getting at is arent sexual responses to a sexual picture that you willingly posted online to be expected
creepyPMs,removed,what exactly does healthy attention entail in this case rgonewild is a sub for sexual exhibitionists and sexual voyeurs it involves people sharing pictures of their genitalia with strangers in order to provoke a sexual response why is it offensive that one of those strangers might respond by saying that theyre aroused when the entire point of the forum is to arouse people and why is it offensive that one of them might respond through exhibitionism of their own this entire thread is absolutely bonkers
creepyPMs,removed,you missed the perfect opportunity to say well obviously thats not your dick that picture wasnt taken with an electron microscope
creepyPMs,removed,seriously
creepyPMs,removed,when a guy asks if they can send a tribute pic showing that they have cum over your picture i just shake my head when they ask if a woman wants to see their cum i just head desk i akin this type of scenario to a dog that drops a sodden saliva covered toy in front of you and expects praise and joyful appreciation these guys are dropping their cum covered gift and expect praise and joyful appreciation for it ew
creepyPMs,removed,so did you do it
creepyPMs,removed,how r u still friends with him
creepyPMs,removed,i dunno man me in high school had bad social skills this is kinda mentally disabled
creepyPMs,removed,how is this creepy
creepyPMs,removed,gahhhh she is so stuck up her own ass if people really truly only befriended people who were just like themselves there would be no friendships anywhere because we are all individuals and capable of unapologetically thinking for ourselves
creepyPMs,removed,go for it
creepyPMs,removed,why do i even tinder you like the attention
creepyPMs,removed,ok i get dead deer its a cultural thing person is proud of their ability to kill thingsfeed their family honestly their ideal match would be ok with hunting so dead deer photos may the an efficient way to filter out incompatible folks i dont get frigging sideways pictures of dead deer some photos are better taken landscape mode also the bit about the deer heart ugh
creepyPMs,removed,so how was the blow job
creepyPMs,removed,yea i hate the new view of feminism it makes no sense i dont know who started it but they did a good job created confusion feminism want from equal rights between men and women to i want more pay and for him to pay for the meal anytime you have a conflicting opinion on a womens right issue they cry feminism
creepyPMs,removed,when you set aside a belief that one gender is more superior to another or that one gender is somehow always under the thumb of another suddenly both become equal if you believe in anything other than equality how is that right how is that empowering how does that help anybody sure there are people out there who do and say things that are harmful to women and there are people who do the same to men the feminine persuasion as a whole is not a victim by default because of the actions of a few they are not delicate and do not need coddling i support womens rights i support mens rights i support equal rights i think men and women are great i am a woman and i find feminism oppressive i do not need a tenderheaded movement to feel empowered i can handle that on my own
creepyPMs,removed,havent been on this sub long but i have already learned a very important lesson if you want to get rid of a creep just tell them you have a penis solves everything
creepyPMs,removed,both sides are cringy
creepyPMs,removed,wtf lol no it was around before mr was a thing
creepyPMs,removed,eh he asked politely didnt get into overt details he gets a pass
creepyPMs,removed,isnt tinder explicitly for sex i figured people would be more forward there than usual
creepyPMs,removed,why though people want to watch people theyre attracted to going at it
creepyPMs,removed,op be a gem and try to get this person some help instead of posting this on reddit for karma
creepyPMs,removed,this guy are sick
creepyPMs,removed,why would you tell him your name
creepyPMs,removed,he can find your facebook page and all hell breaks loose from there lets just hope he doesnt know how to hack
creepyPMs,removed,he was a creep for sure but he kind of made a few points along the way just sayin
creepyPMs,removed,nah thats really not you cant be sexist towards men because men arent a marginalized group of people
creepyPMs,removed,you need to chillllll
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair he wasnt that bad
creepyPMs,removed,why would you be texting someone whos name you didnt know makes sense to me
creepyPMs,removed,what the fuck can this be considered some kind of social personality disorder like autism how can a functioning adult think that kind of communication would help him achieve his goals
creepyPMs,removed,the drugs may have triggereddeveloped his condition ive lived next to a schizophrenic before and he was the most charmingnicest guy id ever met in hindsight im not sure if that was just him in control of himself and abusing the situation they often will worm their way in all friendly to get what they want anyway he got back in to drugs and went totally off the rails the kind of messages youre receiving is the exact same kind of rambling we would hear from this guy we also tried to get him help we contacted his mother via facebook within a few weeks he had been sectioned and deemed unfit to care for himself i felt bad but the guy needed help
creepyPMs,removed,agreed still a very sexist statement
creepyPMs,removed,how bad was your picture that he thought you looked disease ridden
creepyPMs,removed,and we all know means at best
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,im pretty sure he was a bit more disappointed than you
creepyPMs,removed,well were waiting
creepyPMs,removed,well are you
creepyPMs,removed,sour much
creepyPMs,removed,wow youre a dickhead
creepyPMs,removed,its fucking south park the point is to be offensive
creepyPMs,removed,so are you
creepyPMs,removed,not like the world is gonna miss sergio
creepyPMs,removed,are you
creepyPMs,removed,play along gain his trust then post his dick pick and phone number
creepyPMs,removed,close but i think he gave the answer several times himself bipolar bipolar type one people can experience hallucinations delusions etc bipolar and schizophrenia are actually very similar and often misdiagnosed as each other and schizoaffective disorder is kinda like bipolar and schizophrenia had a baby
creepyPMs,removed,this sub is getting less and less creepy and more and more whiny if the other part of the convo was creepy why didnt you post that
creepyPMs,removed,he seemed genuinely nice tho
creepyPMs,removed,thats the weird part like okay if your fetish is big butts and its impossible to deny it at least they exist in real life and you can find someone with one to be a partner when it comes to this or those hyper obsesses bronies who straight up fall in love with cartoon ponies or whatever that particular thingdoesnt exist its so weird to me
creepyPMs,removed,that is one smallll emoji
creepyPMs,removed,it takes a lot of guts to post a full body pic with your face in itl
creepyPMs,removed,his legs are totally weird looking
creepyPMs,removed,dudes built like a rectangle hes the same width from knees to shoulders and its really weirding me out
creepyPMs,removed,well the naked man does work out of every times

creepyPMs,removed,ok that bear was pretty funny tho
creepyPMs,removed,youre that one friend thats always talking hella shit on her friends boyfriends but never has one of her own huh
creepyPMs,removed,rude maybe wrong nope
creepyPMs,removed,but if a girl did it to a guy it would be welcomed with kindness
creepyPMs,removed,i dont get how someone thinks sending nudes to a guy it would be welcomed with kindness
creepyPMs,removed,but thats what happens when a guy it would be welcomed with kindness
creepyPMs,removed,her responses were weird
creepyPMs,removed,i thought she responded with interest
creepyPMs,removed,who said anything about the body we are talking emojis here
creepyPMs,removed,so shes not dtf
creepyPMs,removed,it gets less cringeyweird when she starts toying around with ittaking it lightly
creepyPMs,removed,thats one tiny emoji
creepyPMs,removed,checked out your link which bit of what was said is bullying
creepyPMs,removed,why didnt you just block him
creepyPMs,removed,and just like that ive lost all sympathy for you mansplain is a really shitty word that is misandristic regardless of the current situation thats a really misandristic thing to say
creepyPMs,removed,not op but check out rate my dick pic genuine advice
creepyPMs,removed,mansplained loving the casual sexism
creepyPMs,removed,i was more distracted by his unbelievable paleness like damn he looks fairly well built go stand in the sun for a few
creepyPMs,removed,heres an unsolicited picture of my cock positive feedback only please foh
creepyPMs,removed,found the sjw
creepyPMs,removed,yeah honestly its too bad you clearly learned nothing from all that time you spent in class
creepyPMs,removed,never said any of that as i commented i was wrong about the meaning of the word and thats why i thought it was harmless
creepyPMs,removed,i have a crooked dick and i am offended
creepyPMs,removed,as strange as it is ive always found it weird how being attracted to year olds is so taboo in the states being attracted so a or year old is bizarre but it shouldnt apply to
creepyPMs,removed,yeah but this is ucreepypms the point is basically to shame people who deserve it this is at best harassment and at worst some kind of sexual crime if the worst thing that happens to him is a little criticism online he should consider himself lucky
creepyPMs,removed,its quite common for people in southeast asia to spray gallons of spicy diarrhea everywhere
creepyPMs,removed,im a teenager myself so i mean i am biased but most year olds i meet these days could easily pass off as being or
creepyPMs,removed,hahaha well see
creepyPMs,removed,what if you thought they were over and then you found out they were underage i once had a crush on a guy at work only to find out he was only not my age i lost interest in him i was or when it happened
creepyPMs,removed,its confusing because the logic is wrong it may make me intolerant but women do have pussies and men dont its pretty straight forward
creepyPMs,removed,liar
creepyPMs,removed,windows phone ew
creepyPMs,removed,fuckin saudi aurora
creepyPMs,removed,sure but initially we were talking about the word not lolita complex right
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think this is that creepy just his attempt at humor
creepyPMs,removed,i thought everyone knew of it since time immemorial i mean havent you read the most famous rule of the internet rule if it exists there is porn of it no exceptions
creepyPMs,removed,til all european lawmakers are pedophiles
creepyPMs,removed,if you wanna body this thread technically you have that right but imho this scumbag deserves worse than your dick is hairy crooked lulz as i said not particularly damning the same could be of me tbh let op live
creepyPMs,removed,i mean the differences are important but dont message someone like that
creepyPMs,removed,technically he is correct in the uk the age of consent is so describing someone older attracted to a old as a peado would be incorrect creepy as fuck but not a peado i am not supporting creepers a grown man hitting on someone in their teens is creepy as fuck but am just pointing out that technically speaking he is correct and in the eyes of the law in uk a yr old dating a yr old is ok albeit very much frowned upon by society i should know my year old cousin is dating a guy in his none of us are pleased and im actually quite worried
creepyPMs,removed,dick is slightly tilted not butt hurt also this guys not asking for it
creepyPMs,removed,seriously i feel sorry for people with paedophillic desires because i cant imagine how awful it is to just sit on those feelings forever while society tells you that youre scum just for having them oh wait no thats happened a lot anyway if youre trying to justify why its not that bad its that bad and you should seek help
creepyPMs,removed,why did you keep talking to him
creepyPMs,removed,what if this guy is a social worker or case worker criminal attorney law student you literally have no idea where this knowledge derives
creepyPMs,removed,why is a married person even talking to an internet stranger in the first place let alone putting down her husband making fun thats horrible then the ambivalent answer about would she answer questions about sex ask by a stranger shes basically baiting him into getting super creepy by exchanging phone numbers to chat in the first place she quickly lets him know shes married good but then immediately begins making fun of her husband she doesnt want him near her get away and hug a pillow after sex the going out for snacks story its like shes saying i have a husband but i dont really respect or like him then when he asks about sex questions she doesnt say no i dont talk like that with strange men she encourages him by saying maybe ill answer your questions maybe i wont then he starts getting creepy like shes been hoping the whole time so she could snap back with her little right funny to her comeback then post it here for people to see and like maybe even hell her good job or so funny this doesnt belong in creepypms maybe more like tryingtohard or
creepyPMs,removed,omgi read this sub a lot but this guys line which i would guess he thinks really gets the ladies excited has been the only one that was so unappealing that it may have prohibited me from every being about to feel turned on again
creepyPMs,removed,what is rigging his nipple wtf is going on there
creepyPMs,removed,oh yes thats exactly what i said of course married people can talk to however they want but it shouldnt disrespect their spouse obviously married people have same opposite gender friends same with coworkers they may go out with that is not what this is this is a stranger shes never met in person but for some reason is having this chat the immediately turns sexual and she notes she has a husband but then makes of him and when he turns sexual shes doesnt shut it down she leaves it open until he says something she seems worthy of posting here i am the exact opposite of the way you are describing i think couples that only interact with each other are ridiculous and doomed never did i say she should only speak to her husband but you has to twist it into that bc there is no valid argument against what i actual said
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt say she has to be affectionate their dynamic how they compromise is between the of them i dont judge or have a right to my problem is with telling someone that you dont even know and that is a male who made his intentions towards her sexual clear to her from the first comment maybe im wrong maybe they met online in a group for people interested in a specific hobby and they text to discuss their shared interest however nothing from this conversation which is all we were given for context does remotely suggest thats the case the point is the disrespect was in her telling some random guy yea my husband is more affectionate that me im like okay were done get off me hug a pillow sleep is important its so dismissive of him and while youre probably right that he gets her snacks as a way to show appreciation but she didnt share that story as part of a this is how my relationship dynamic works it was just part of her o like sleep snacks dont touch me schtick so far both consents that have disagreed with me has to add extra layers to what i said like shading spouses can only speak the each other or in this case arguing if her marriage dynamic works im sure it does but thats not my business to discuss as i dont feel its the strangers business shes telling it to
creepyPMs,removed,i agree with most everything you said and really appreciate the way you approached the response youre absolutely right that people have different points at which they say ok thats crossed a line were done here mine would be a comment or two before she stopped some people would stop exactly where she did some would go a message or two more i definitely was looking at the situation with bias from my own comfort level as im sure most people were the point that made me want to make a comment was it just seemed inauthentic maybe theres no backstory why a stranger is texting her about cuddling and so our are left to sort of put this story in a context and thus assumptions are made it was definitely an error on my part to use the word baiting it gives of a victim blaming vibe im not sure what the correct word would be but it felt false to me in that her first couple responses were kind of ambiguous then suddenly she brings the hammer down which is her right to so however i just feel that the conversation was dragged out on her part in order for a have a funny internet post again thats an assumption im making bc and here is no context given the part about the husband we will just have to agree to disagree to me it sounded dismissive of her husband which in another situation like speak no to a close friend wouldnt make me bat an eye but in my opinion making that to person she doesnt know well or at all and who is clearly interested in her sexually is disrespectful to the husband finally if youve gotten this far thanks for hanging in their one thing im not is concise again i want to tell you how appreciative i am of the approach you took when commented it was respectful well said and really made me think comments have been flooding in and a lot are taking great leaps or arguing against things i didnt say however like i said above i think the word baiting was a horrible choice of words and not accurate in that way im a bit deserving of the backlash but hopefully i was able to clear that mistake up thanks 😁
creepyPMs,removed,omg its lolidaisuku or whatever the fuck i dont even care hes a fucking creep had the pleasure of him trying to defend his pedophilia by saying that and then correcting a grammatical error thinking hes coming out on top nope creep fucking pedophile
creepyPMs,removed,yup you got me im actually still in bed bc my husband hasnt come to let me know if im allowed to get up yet we are obviously not going to agree or even some a here and not discuss further hopefully master will come unshackle me soon 😉
creepyPMs,removed,ok 👍🏼
creepyPMs,removed,everything about this post is creepy everything
creepyPMs,removed,you both really suck
creepyPMs,removed,darn i was grocery shopping and missed all the fun did i miss my chance lol again i appreciate youre insight and agree with many of your points especially when you brought up the fact that a lot of posters do drag out the conversation in the interest of being friendly or polite with an old friend or someone there went to school with i caught one last week where this guy had been sending this girl poorly spelled messages on facebook for years if he said how are you shed answer then it would turn to ive loved you grade and shed kindly remind him that she thinks hes a very nice person but she doesnt and will never look at him as more than a friend this went on and on and on but i think she prolly thought blocking him was mean and hoped hed move along i guess maybe the reason i saw this from such a negative pov was there wasnt any background provided at all and im a big fan of a good backstorysetup to something bc then im like alright got it ready to read lol so when something gets posted with out its like my brain must fill in the backstory and to me it seemed like a first message that she had given her phone to someone who clearly didnt know her well enough to know she was married and had only one interest in contacting so with that this husband comment seems unnecessary and mean but if i were to switch the story to a guy that messaged her on facebook maybe they used to belong to the same softball league did they chat here and there the husband comment no longer seems wrong of her to say its interesting how one very short conversation can look different thru everyones eyes or change depending on the backstory thanks again for discussing this with me
creepyPMs,removed,im sorry that is happening to you block their number he sounds like a loserpsychopath
creepyPMs,removed,does your phone not have an option to block contact from numbers i can tell my phone to not allow anything from certain numbers that are annoying
creepyPMs,removed,youre both morons
creepyPMs,removed,not sure which is cringier op or her ex
creepyPMs,removed,no harassment like that is awful why put up with it if you can avoid this altogether
creepyPMs,removed,youre kind of an ass arent ya
creepyPMs,removed,what about flaccid dick doesnt turn you on appropriate username
creepyPMs,removed,you must do hella kegels
creepyPMs,removed,he cant be that gross if hes your ex jst saying
creepyPMs,removed,didnt take disrespect from a monkey in human form you obviously deserve to be beaten and dishonour brought upon your family send this retard to saudi arabia 🇸🇦
creepyPMs,removed,he seems genuinely hurt and hes not hitting on you hes asking you a simple question thats all
creepyPMs,removed,all these negative comments wishing hed get fired he sent you a compliment get off your high horse i bet you would have liked his compliment had he been your type
creepyPMs,removed,did you hit it
creepyPMs,removed,with me it sometimes happens too only here though i dont use other forums or chat apps i guess because my username doesnt give away my gender and reddit users are in fact predominantly male its partly excusable for people to make this assumption that one time was particularly nasty though because it was a female reddit user i was disagreeing with and paradoxically they accused me of being sexist hurled all sorts of insults at me even though they were the ones who couldnt wrap their head around the fact that a woman might disagree with another woman anyway long story
creepyPMs,removed,dont feed the trolls dont even reply or it gives them fuel
creepyPMs,removed,can never understand why they keep responding and giving him pretty much what he wants
creepyPMs,removed,uhm yes it did wasnt going to mention it but dont you recognize my username
creepyPMs,removed,your wit makes me want to e at your pu ss y
creepyPMs,removed,that feminist post gave me a headache it makes it sound like theres thousands of rapists with custody of their children had from said rape i get that a lot of that stuff is true and fucked up but a lot of it is over sensationalized i dont know one guy who still thinks women shouldnt have rights jobs orgasms etc if it was the still then yea but its not
creepyPMs,removed,til
creepyPMs,removed,wait why is this creepy i get that you dont like him and you did reject him in a swift and efficient fashion but all the man did was try and make a move he didnt do or say anything creepy honestly explain anyone
creepyPMs,removed,so he basically acted like a feminist
creepyPMs,removed,im confused are you calling the message itself creepy or the fact that he sent it to you in a private message im guessing its the latter seeing the subreddit you posted it in correct me if im wrong
creepyPMs,removed,you are so incredibly dense if you think that hashtag was meant with honesty it was a ironic joke from the beginning to garner media attention im surprised you arent used to this kind of shit coming from the trump crowd
creepyPMs,removed,i know this will probably get down voted because reddit tends to favor the op in almost every instance but i think hes right you use a lot of over generalizations and not all men are the same there are a ton of great people out there that dont deserve to be lumped in together that way he has a very reasonable well written response that was neither disrespectful nor incoherent i think that in this case it is you who needs to rethink the ideals they value
creepyPMs,removed,you honestly think thats going happen i dont
creepyPMs,removed,uemotheatrix i know this will probably get down voted because reddit tends to favor the op in almost every instance but i think hes right you use a lot of over generalizations and not all men are the same there are a ton of great people out there that dont deserve to be lumped in together that way he has a very reasonable well written response that was neither disrespectful nor incoherent i think that in this case it is you who needs to rethink the ideals they value the only thing creepy about this post is you really parasites you should be ashamed of yourself you use a lot of over generalizations and not all men are the same at no point does the post say that all men are the same or act the same its almost entirely about society of both men and women will see women and treat women as such his post and yours is almost entirely incoherent from the start as it is responding to an attack that was never made
creepyPMs,removed,your postcomment has been removed in accordance with httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,removed,hey op you forgot to censor the guys name on image number four once you take care of that ill be happy to reapprove your post
creepyPMs,removed,his response to you was obnoxious and overblown to be real though the feminist rant you posted was pretty terrible there are a handful of factual statements and then just random opinions that the author doesnt like its not a cohesive case for anything just a list of things that make the author mad with no sources im a woman and a feminist but i think that statements like women who dont want any attention or sex for any reason are villified without anything backing it up distract from the real issues of our movement and show intellectual laziness
creepyPMs,removed,yea i meant guys i know in person smh
creepyPMs,removed,was the point that there will always be a small minority of people who still are sexist racist etc
creepyPMs,removed,buttstuff
creepyPMs,removed,all im saying is that post made it sound like the majority of men in this world all think and act in a horrible way towards women which is just blatantly false its not the dark ages
creepyPMs,removed,its unlike any other post ive seen here nothing sexual whatsoever looked like a political argument to me
creepyPMs,removed,so you all are offended because someone else was offended by something someone posted on facebook and communicating that in a albeit heated but nonetheless civil manner is creepy lol
creepyPMs,removed,so you honestly believe most men can and will try to sexually assault a women in their lifetime do you believe women can sexually assault a man if women are so horribly oppressed today how was it years ago if you say its worse thats just a flat out lie
creepyPMs,removed,so do i just have to agree with you or get downvoted for not thinking its as bad as you make it out to be why do you hate it when people have different opinions than you
creepyPMs,removed,sorry i meant to reply to umoxitude they seem to like to talk down to people who have differing opinions
creepyPMs,removed,that facebook post was purposely inciteful you got exactly the response the post called for though wouldnt have gotten it from me id have simply unfriended you as i dont keep drama on my friend list after basically daring someone to disagree with you youve labeled the person who disagreed creepy the post is also highly negative immature and whiny you wont change any minds or attitudes this way
creepyPMs,removed,huh reminds me of the journalist who tried to make the and then got disgusted so many guys were messaging her and op your heart was in the right place but i dont think it can fix a sociopath
creepyPMs,removed,that post is not true there may be some truth in it for some women but the tone is that everything in the post applies to all women thats not reality not even close this post isnt feminism its just hateful rhetoric i agree with the majority of the posts here that the losers who send the pms are creepy dudes who should be outed and humiliated but this one just isnt right
creepyPMs,removed,fetuses are not parasites that is not a biological fact parasites and hosts are always of different species also a human spawns offspring rather than being invaded by a parasite
creepyPMs,removed,didnt realize i couldnt have an opinion
creepyPMs,removed,no im not blind to what happens in this world fucked up things happen they have always happened and most likely they will continue to happen but its not just women who are being oppressed black people have had it so much worse and i know that most dont believe that most white people are racist so why do you think most men are sexist and will assault you do you judge every man you see before you even get to know them do you automatically believe they act and think a certain way because you knew a guy who did dont sit there and tell me im wrong because youve experienced the bad side of humanity it doesnt feel like your arguing for equality between men and women it feels like your trying to prove that all men are sexist ignorant backwards thinking morons
creepyPMs,removed,buy a gun thank me later s
creepyPMs,removed,was she at attractive at least if not she might be lonely for a long time poor thing
creepyPMs,removed,i kinda feel bad now because i side with him
creepyPMs,removed,are you unable to block creeps messages because that seems like a sensible thing to do you know after the first or the unwanted pms are unacceptable but it seems a bit daft to not block them if thats an option just saying
creepyPMs,removed,if i was offered money during internet dating i would take that as a sign that i need to do it more not less
creepyPMs,removed,how is my advice any different than uxplosm yet my comment gets deleted and theirs gets upvoted
creepyPMs,removed,what a bitch
creepyPMs,removed,this isnt really that creepy unless theres more messages
creepyPMs,removed,he might be joking but from what i know of people that go on tumblr they do not like white people if it was from u would agree with you id be trolling but since its tumblr i have to disagree
creepyPMs,removed,last ditch attempt for the tiny dicked and desperate
creepyPMs,removed,wow i remember back in my young days when learned about yahoo chat messenger i would message many women telling them this of course it was all for a wank and somehow it would definitely workguess times sure have changed lol
creepyPMs,removed,as long as were doing the unpopular and downvotes generalization the strong cultural meme of older men and younger women makes perfect sense if looked at as an evolutionary strategy men can father children much older than women can bear them the experience status and economic security an older man brings are advantageous to the survival of the offspring im not remotely saying these things should dictate modern behavior but most cultural mores have pragmatic reasons at their root
creepyPMs,removed,but how in hell do you guys think saying something like that will work first of all youre making assumptions about all men and at the risk of receiving yet another cliched hashtag notallmen response i will tell you that most men are acutely aware that these kinds of approaches will not work the majority of the time but to your point if the roles were reversed and a woman coldapproached a man and asked him to make out he very well might accept the offer depending of course on a number of circumstances yes for some men this is all it would take speaking for myself i can totally divorce sex from emotional intimacyit can sometimes be a purely physical desire there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting just sex or solely a physical relationship with someone provided of course the other party is consentingthis never seems to be an issue for womens rights advocates when discussing female sexuality granted there are a number of factors in ops post of which i am not aware namely the age and romantic history of the guy in question but judging from his approach id say hes very very very inexperienced if i were a betting man id say hes probably never been with anyone before honestly you mentioned that women arent exactly trained for dating couldnt agree with you morewomen dont have to be trained for dating in the same sense as men do though someone usually does explain the dangers certain men situations etc present for women in the dating fielddangers i do not want to minimize for the record meaning that society requires men to approach women decide where and when the date is going to take place and when to move the relationship to the physical level the latter of which he has to intuit solely by a womans subtle responses in my experience women dont typically like to be overt about signalling their readiness for sex at least not in the early stages of a relationship without sounding too crude women just have to show up where men are and theyll likely be approached and once they are the onus to make the kinds of decisions ive just described doesnt fall upon them as someone who was a late bloomer myself i can tell you how difficult it is for inexperienced or virgin men to navigate the dating scene if they have the misfortune to be in their early i mentioned that i made a similar blunder out of sheer nervousness and immediately realized it as such after id made it in my defense and probably in defense of the guy in ops post i never had anyone around to teach me how to approach women or how dating works once shes agreed to go out with you of course guys in those circumstances are going to make a few false steps along the way and for most guys in my position who start out at such a late age success perpetually eludes them all im saying is that the creeper in ops post made a mistake but it wasnt to me a vulgar mistake it was a rookie mistake and i didnt feel her response was appropriate given the situation bring on the downvotes
creepyPMs,removed,almost as as when you got roasted in your ramisexy post lmao
creepyPMs,removed,what makes this creepy
creepyPMs,removed,greetings userdelvinmcelroy im a lawyer in ri and i read your post and wanted to see if i can help give you some information do you know who this lowlife is as in do you know him personally do you know if he is in america or another country generally this kind of harassment is not considered illegal unless this individual forces you to engage in felonious behaviour harm yourself harm others or uses fraudulent information for the purpose of committing a crime as of right now he has not done anything which could be considered illegal there are no laws against people being gigantic assholes its also important to note that these laws would only apply if this individual is a national of your home country im assuming you are from the us or canada if this person lived in any other country besides where the charges are filed you wouldnt have any ground to stand on if this person lives in the us or canada like you then you would need to get their isp number and file a report do you know if the individual is in the same country as you if it is found that this individual is not in the same country as you then even in that case it would be up to his country of residence to charge him reporting this kind of activitiy to local police or investigators would accomplish nothing im sorry to say that your case seems much more difficult unless he had forced you engage in some kind crime he is not yet guilt of committing a crime himself my advice to you would be to either a report him to the admins if you know who is responsible b delete your current account and start a new one or c try to adopt thicker skin and endure this i know its not the best to hear that scum like this can keep doing it but try to understand that people like are looking for some kind of reaction if you are able to move on without giving this the time of day most likely the individual will also move on try not giving any acknowledgement whatsoever hope this helps clear things up hope you have a good night and im sorry for assholes bullying you
creepyPMs,removed,im probably going to get down voted to the depths of the earth but am i the only one that finds the whole say hello to creepypms thing kinda cringy
creepyPMs,removed,its cringe as hell just prolonging the conversation in hope of posting a silly screenshot on reddit for minutes of fame what a great personality indeed besides ive had exs who dated men years older than they were im before you say anything and that didnt shock me just a bit out of the norm but im an open minded guy i guess
creepyPMs,removed,how the fuck is this creepy its naive childish maybe one could say boring and flat but creepy it is not
creepyPMs,removed,okay this one was definitely cringy to read not like of the shit that gets posted here
creepyPMs,removed,i understand and respect your desire to only have friends your own age but as a with a few friends i can say definitively you are missing out on some awesome friendships by shutting down due to age range that said for every amazing friendship ive maintained ive lost at least others due to them acting inappropriately eg trying to marry me or marry me off to a relative or acting like a parent and attempting to control me because they know best i dont put up with that sort of behaviour from my own family i sure as hell wouldnt think about permitting them to treat me like that so yeah food for thought maybe
creepyPMs,removed,you are full of y
creepyPMs,removed,i mean im not that interesting myself but i feel sorry for this guy
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think that qualifies as being creepy op you went aggressive was too fast
creepyPMs,removed,i wasnt asking why its on the sub i understand that if someone feels its creepy thats a reason to post if here i was asking why op thought this was creepy its certainly a little stiff and awkward but is that really enough to be creepy are we now creeped out by anyone who isnt great at first messages on dating sites
creepyPMs,removed,just wondering whats the point of having transgender gaming group isnt gaming like totally not relevant to gender
creepyPMs,removed,im pretty sure this was a joke then lol
creepyPMs,removed,😳 im usually against kinkshaming but why the fuck are fiot fetishists so gd creepy
creepyPMs,removed,rchargeyourphone
creepyPMs,removed,im old and arguably a creep but in the most benign way see pretty girl think shes pretty i couldnt imagine making a lewd comment or even a gross suggestion i will never understand the red pill approach to life and women
creepyPMs,removed,it actually looks like he panicked cause some replied haha
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think profile disclaimers dissuade creeps like this burning a hole in my screenshots lol
creepyPMs,removed,i wish there was a way to downvote creeps like this burning a hole in my screenshots lol
creepyPMs,removed,tfw youre older than the old guy in the story feelsbadman
creepyPMs,removed,im guessing hes from india just a wild guess
creepyPMs,removed,dude i keep seeing your comments everywhere theyre always way too long and rambly like an elderly person talking on and on about their youth its kind of sweet
creepyPMs,removed,why are they always feet people
creepyPMs,removed,i admire women like that sometimes twice in one day even
creepyPMs,removed,he has a point on the grey thing but at the same time he should work hard to be as successful so that hed be able to afford to do what grey does pushing like that doesnt work its far easier to become an alpha than to convince women not to chase and sleep with alphas hence that should be his goal
creepyPMs,removed,he has a point on the grey thing but at the same time he should work hard to be as successful so that hed be able to afford to do what grey does pushing like that doesnt work its far easier to become an alpha than to convince women not to chase and sleep with alphas hence that should be his goal
creepyPMs,removed,didnt watch the movie or read the book but the bottom line is that the guy is right when he says that usummac would have skipped work to hang out with a high status billionaire the only problem is that hes not some high status billionaire hes just being childish by insulting usummac shes not the enemy his enemies are other men and specifically men who are higher status than him they are the only ones keeping him from getting in usummac panties as she rejected him because she feels shed not missing out on anything special and therell always be men like him around also his rage is good he should just channel it against his competitors not against his customers you never insult customers just because they are not buying he should improve the product
creepyPMs,removed,gag this is a thing it amazes me the weirdest kinks people have and then i wonder how they developed them bet its interesting
creepyPMs,removed,lol i thought it was kind of funny
creepyPMs,removed,if you bothered to read carefully youd see that he actually did have a chance i stopped listening what women say in high school i am much more interested in what they do and how they act you mentioned people in this thread well i guarantee you that every women in this thread gets wet thinking about johnny depp even though hes a controlling psychopath alcoholic drug addict piece of shit who thinks hes entitled to other peoples time and lives wanna know why because he has status and status trumps all those other things tell you what all those other things become features not a bugs as long as the guy has status plus johnny boy has thousands of hours on tape where hes the leading man alpha character so his status in real life is amplified by his status in his roles and history has shown time and time again how humans dig good stories again the guy is right hes just using the correct information in a stupid way
creepyPMs,removed,well the correlation is pretty strong anyways so all things being equal high status would get you laid more often thats why johnny boy has fucked hundreds of year old swimsuit models and still does while zero status zero money men like homeless only fucked their own left hand
creepyPMs,removed,oh really that should explain why becoming high status and banging swimsuit models is so fucking hard while being homeless and jerking off on the streets you literally have to do nothing to get to that point its not like billions of men are competing with each other to get there right
creepyPMs,removed,so keep trying to figure out what kind of person i am it amuses me again instead of but still smart feminist nerdy overweight and not manipulablenope
creepyPMs,removed,other people eh that must mean me i should send some lascivious pms your way
creepyPMs,removed,wouldnt call it creepy more sleezy tbh
creepyPMs,removed,while i totally get the bdsm lifestyle i have a dom as well but i feel like you could have left it at boyfriend mentioning his sexual top relationship to you feels like it just welcomes that kind of discussion into the conversation just a suggestion from my pov regardless he obviously was missing some cues theres to back off
creepyPMs,removed,is there an app that gives people like this creepy dude testicle cancer if not we need one
creepyPMs,removed,pretty creepy you responded
creepyPMs,removed,totally creepy you responded
creepyPMs,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikischizophasia in the mental health field schizophasia or word salad is language that is confused and often repetitious symptomatic of various mental illnesses it is usually associated with a manic presentation of bipolar affective disorder and other symptoms of serious mental illnesses such as psychosis including schizophrenia it is characterized by an apparently confused usage of words with no apparent meaning or relationship attached to them in this context it is considered to be a symptom of a formal thought disorder in some cases schizophasia can be a sign of asymptomatic schizophrenia eg the question why do people believe in god could elicit a response consisting of a series of words commonly associated with religion or prayer but strung together with no regard to language rules schizophasia should be contrasted with another symptom of cognitive disruption and cognitive slippage involving certain idiosyncratic arrangements of words with this symptom the language may or may not be grammatically correct depending on the severity of the disease and the particular mechanisms which have been impacted by the disease im assuming he was going for riamverysmart and rimaspecialsnowflake which should be a sub but it sounds an awful lot like some of the schizophrenic people ive had the pleasure of meeting
creepyPMs,removed,this is not negging this is just a bad attitude negging is subtly introducing insecurity so the woman feels the need to try harder to impress the guy a remark such as im not really into brunettes but you seem alright a minor insult makes the woman feel self conscious about this sudden minute flaw of hers that he just crafted so she tries harder to impress the guy because he appears to be going out of his way to interact with her even though hes claiming to be unimpressed with some aspect of her
creepyPMs,removed,i have a boyfriend and another guy i see looking for potential relationships maybe he was making fun of your loose behavior
creepyPMs,removed,creepy this sub fucking blows unsubscribe
creepyPMs,removed,fake
creepyPMs,removed,im not able to say anything else or ill get banned quite a community youve got here
creepyPMs,removed,bruised knees my wifes used to it wooooooooooo
creepyPMs,removed,behold ladies and gents we have a specimen who has never had any kind of shower sex or probably any sex at all it is not rare to see a pathetic pissbaby in the wild but this one has new angle
creepyPMs,removed,what a dick
creepyPMs,removed,she is engaged not married obviously she hasnt forgotten how to suck dick yet
creepyPMs,removed,yeah but you should be used to that by now heyooooo p
creepyPMs,removed,why are you on a dating app if youre engaged
creepyPMs,removed,i never thought of billing people for thisfucking genius
creepyPMs,removed,did you really think youd avoid something like this posting nsfw material
creepyPMs,removed,hang on its not normal to give your digits to a friend ill have to tell all mine to delete my number
creepyPMs,removed,socan i have your number
creepyPMs,removed,lmao he ended up closing with the dick pick after all savage now of course i realized that women on here got dick pics but i never considered people trying to start real relationships on here the only thing i really use pm for was to call someone stupid in a subs where im banned im looking at you rthedoofus so how long had you been talking to cause him to go full nuclear crazy oh and can i get them digits
creepyPMs,removed,theres nothing creepy about this unless hes an english major
creepyPMs,removed,id like to see that post that started it all if i may
creepyPMs,removed,sounds like a typical trump supporter
creepyPMs,removed,how come this is creepy youre posting nude picturessome more riskier than others isnt to get attention and when you get it you expose comments if you dont want to read those messagesjust delete or dont lookits sadly a part of beeing onlinejeeez
creepyPMs,removed,to be far its hard to type with one hand 😜
creepyPMs,removed,at least hes not asking her where she wants to get lunch at
creepyPMs,removed,yer holes
creepyPMs,removed,reading your message it seemed like you often posted quality pictures on gone wild so i went to your history to check them too bad for me you mean you didnt answer to a message like that or a dick pic what else do you want this man is husband material d
creepyPMs,removed,i always find it weird when people who post their bits online for attentionfeedback are surprised by these pms i do understand sheer volume of messages can be annoying but its like this subreddit is mostly comprised of these sorts of posts where people are flashing their privates online and then recoiling in disgust when people pm them filthy things i still understand that its unsolicited but i guess the men sometimes women expect you to be open to advances for exposing yourself i know this is not necessarily the case though ill wait for my downvotes
creepyPMs,removed,holy shit that was so crazy why didnt you just send him back the in the first place if someone gave me and asked for it back citing being poor i would have taken pity and returned it then again it wouldnt have been as entertaining if you had do you know him in person
creepyPMs,removed,jesus christ you wont give me back ten dollars i gave to you consensually therefore you raped me and i will tell the whole world and people wonder why theres concern over the power of rape allegations without evidence people are fucked stay away from this psycho op
creepyPMs,removed,i dont like any part of this conversation tbh
creepyPMs,removed,congratulations your text is pedobear approved
creepyPMs,removed,i dare you to quit being a bitch i know its not possible for you but i thought id try
creepyPMs,removed,why did you continue responding
creepyPMs,removed,creepy ok sure bud
creepyPMs,removed,dat butt doe
creepyPMs,removed,is hot hot pic plz
creepyPMs,removed,im a bit confused about this sub is it supposed to be saying someone is a creep for the sake of it or are people trying to bait guys into being creeps or what dont particularly think his first comment was obscene and then you are straight up dismissive of him obviously he went full dickbag after that but im curious as to if im missing the point of this sub here
creepyPMs,removed,whats it like that quest for validation does it really feel that good
creepyPMs,removed,i bet he came ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
creepyPMs,removed,typical drug addict behavior
creepyPMs,removed,that font gave me cancer
creepyPMs,removed,just because something hurts your feelings doesnt make it a crime
creepyPMs,removed,i will never understand the whole punish me thing they are already like a whiny wimpy ass bitch when they say stuff like that why would they want to be tried like a bitch low selfesteem or something i guess
creepyPMs,removed,youre attractive
creepyPMs,removed,maybe his name was wan nafuck and it was just a mistyped introduction
creepyPMs,removed,my money is on the friend being the same guy and your actual harasser i dont think it was a good idea to unblock him you just gave him more hope block both accounts and be over with it he will create new accounts but if you avoid feeding his infatuation with you he will eventually move to someone else as you said and already know there is not much he can do against you save everything and start a report with the authorities of your andor his city so there is a trail in the remote case something escalates like real life harassment andor stalking stay safe and best of luck
creepyPMs,removed,you know what is worse than people who send creepy messages or people who still use fb like its people who screenshot this shit literally the bottom of the barrel when it comes to humanity
creepyPMs,removed,be very careful about actually calling the police though
creepyPMs,removed,im trying so hard to figure out what your story has to do with anything is it the fact you didnt know who was messaging you and then you later figured it out the story wasnt even that interesting in fact it makes you look like an ass im so confused
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think this is creepy to be honest sure if youre not interested it might come off as unwarranted but its not incredibly pushyfilled with scary as fuck remarks could be worse tbh
creepyPMs,removed,women am i right fellas
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,hows that creepy
creepyPMs,removed,im old so help me understand both of these people are seemingly unstable and are upsetting you since it doesnt appear you have much if any connection to them as friends or otherwise why didnt you block them when it became clear they were making you uncomfortable or pissed off i see this a lot on here where people will continue arguing with someone with whom they have no interest maintaining contact why not just block
creepyPMs,removed,this is more rnice guys than creepy i think i mean it sucks and its awful but idk about creepy
creepyPMs,removed,did you really unblock him at the end
creepyPMs,removed,games designer you mean graphics designer or level designer
creepyPMs,removed,what word
creepyPMs,removed,look at the history folks named him ex in contacts giving him significance username foreverex more significance only thing user has ever posted about in short history coincidence youre all fish in this sub keep upvoting though mahalo
creepyPMs,removed,sounds hot
creepyPMs,removed,just block the next person that does this to you they dont even deserve an answer
creepyPMs,removed,the chic didnt delete the chat history for how long thats saying something
creepyPMs,removed,just to point out from a female perspective there may have been a few instances where you encouraged them that being said this fixation on your breasts is ridiculous have you tried changing into a different photo something that isnt showy ive met a few girls that struggled with fashion due to big breasts so im not trying to belittle you at all im just trying to be helpful with strengthening your chances of weeding out all the guys that sees you as an object 😊 wish you all the best
creepyPMs,removed,both of you just need to grow up honestly lifes too short just my opinion
creepyPMs,removed,lol looks like we are the minority fuck us right
creepyPMs,removed,yearh in all honesty i thought the creepy bit was the guy who bugging the woman so much her bf kicked off both sides of this are creepy the fact that the person being creeped on isnt even involved makes it worse
creepyPMs,removed,youre as immature as him
creepyPMs,removed,you could have ignoredblocked this joker and actually gone to the police but you kept typing
creepyPMs,removed,if she knows hes threatening you just ditch her not worth the kind of crazy that itll bring in your life friend
creepyPMs,removed,conservatives find dumbass racists funny too lol log cabin republican here ive met rapist racist liberals too they just hide behind different words
creepyPMs,removed,was just about to say this send them the screenshot of the messages without the guys name censored to the admins and hell receive a ban granted it wont stop him making alt accounts all i can say is sorry for people like this and just learn to immediately block them and not reply back to the message replying back to messages to people like this is like tossing oil in the fire
creepyPMs,removed,ill need to check your pubic hair to see if is classy
creepyPMs,removed,first of all fuck that guy hes an idiot trying to make himself feel better by tearing others down second of all you are beautiful like a creeper i checked sorry you had to encounter that subhuman
creepyPMs,removed,maybe you shouldnt have posted on raimugly you ignorant bitch also muhammad could prove no divine calling could do no miracles and slept with a year old
creepyPMs,removed,definitely not a hoe he was wrong there definitely edgy someone calls you gorgeous obviously as a compliment and you pull a dictionary definition on them super prude and then you call him a creep when he didnt do anything particularly creepy and post it edgy at most he was rude and you were overly aggressivedefensive kinda sad
creepyPMs,removed,this is so weird guys where i live would line up around the block to date a girl like you looked through your pics
creepyPMs,removed,you posted your picture on reddit thats like as desperate as it gets and youre mad that someone is commenting in a negative way
creepyPMs,removed,that could be it too jesus what a freak
creepyPMs,removed,so im not allowed to share a fucking opinion i didnt say he was a good person i didnt agree with what he did i simply said it was an ok question to ask considering the level of shite some people come out with he didnt say anything controversial he didnt go into detail on anything he politely asked thats it
creepyPMs,removed,what gets me is how he uses the fact that a lot of posts are by new accounts as some sort of evidence to his claim does he not realize that some people create throw away accounts specifically so their post is in no way associated with their actual account a great example would be the people that post to nsfw subreddits and then like to post some of the terrible messages people send them or want to vent about the scum bags trying to blackmail them with their nsfw posts why on earth would you want to post their comments here under the same account someone is trying to blackmail and give the lurker creeps an idea to try the same by your post history i hope he gets stabbed for real like real real
creepyPMs,removed,is that supposed to scare me straight ooh banned from a subreddit
creepyPMs,removed,is that supposed to scare me straight ooh banned from a subreddit
creepyPMs,removed,i think saying lol after he sends you a dp is not keeping it low girl
creepyPMs,removed,urge to message you the same thing as that creep rising
creepyPMs,removed,maybe dont wear a corset in your profile pic i should stick a vibrator inside my pussy and post it hoping to get charming responses
creepyPMs,removed,its more humorous than anything because you know its more than likely some pound sloth that lives off taco bell that is just a little sexually miffed because he hasnt seen pussy since the day he exited the womb but its still quite fucking gross regardless
creepyPMs,removed,goddamn that whole convo was so cringy
creepyPMs,removed,yeah i feel really bad for him
creepyPMs,removed,honestly i enjoy this sub but he has a point about the censorship and obvious feminist bias pls no ban im not trolling
creepyPMs,removed,ive never understood the giant fetish
creepyPMs,removed,this is definitely creepy and belongs on here but i am really quite certain he is just baiting you
creepyPMs,removed,yall are always way too polite id just respond please die to like of these dudes
creepyPMs,removed,and you had sex with that dude s
creepyPMs,removed,you know they do shit like this because it works right
creepyPMs,removed,your boobs look nice tho
creepyPMs,removed,it would be nice if such a nice guy with a broom handle
creepyPMs,removed,seriously call the cops over this what kind of fantasy world do you live in
creepyPMs,removed,hahaha
creepyPMs,removed,implying being trans is not bizzare
creepyPMs,removed,heres the thing though as a guy who has actually spent his entire life championing gender equality gay rights defending against injustices etc the idea that some other group would think its okay to take power based off of work that i helped with and then abuse that power is fucking horrifying like even if i were to concede that it was men and not rich people who were in control of everything i would hope that the women i am trying to empower dont decide that they would turn that around on mebecause the whole point is that if you are not as powerful as me i want to make you as powerful as me and if youre more powerful than me i want to make sure that i can be as powerful as you when there are mainstream feminist figures talking about women taking the wheel from men as though this is a world where only one of us can be in power guys like me feel absolutely disgusted even betrayed by the movements we support theres a certain subset of every social justice movement that does feel a need to cut down rather than to build and when those people get loud of course people get scared i dont want to lose power i want to share power if your mission is to take men out of power instead of putting women into power then we were never on the same page in the first place more and more those extremist voices are getting way too much media time like how many stories do we need about lena dunham being an out of touch dipshit before we decide maybe she doesnt have any place talking about feminism anymore
creepyPMs,removed,this guy is in the spectrum for sure high functioning maybe
creepyPMs,removed,you must get around if you knew this was some kind of fetish because this just sounded like an interactive story where you tell the next line back and forth if someone could explain why this is creepy so i dont make the same mistake please let me know or is it only creepy because this person thinks its a fetish i am lost helppppp
creepyPMs,removed,its just a prank bro
creepyPMs,removed,right but then acting as if there is no reason for anyone else to be afraid of people misusing these movements to disenfranchise others is exactly why people fall away from feminism like yeah this guy is fucking crazy but people need to be damn careful and realize that just because hes crazy doesnt mean everyone who calls out people trying to establish female supremacy are crazy its kind of like that adam saleh guy from a few days agoyeah he probably got kicked off an airline for a good reason but now thanks to his bullshit other muslims or even nonmuslims who are just arabic who may actually be discriminated against might have to fight an uphill battle to be recognized because this asshat made everyone doubt them from the getgo by making some shit up
creepyPMs,removed,the font harassed my eyes
creepyPMs,removed,didnt think i needed it oh well
creepyPMs,removed,i would say this is more cringe than creepy
creepyPMs,removed,i believe you posted on the wrong sub
creepyPMs,removed,this cringey ass subs and its shitty mods ya wouldnt roast shit ya dumb bitch
creepyPMs,removed,seems like youre just acting like a little bitch over nothing
creepyPMs,removed,that eggplant ejaculating onto her peach tho
creepyPMs,removed,anytime i see the say hi to reddit or im posting this to rcringepicscreepypms it makes op look worse and cringey it looks better if you dont tell them at all youre going to screenshot the convo and post it to reddit
creepyPMs,removed,youre totally right this is really creepy but girl you need to plug in your phone im worried for you
creepyPMs,removed,im cringing at this both sides why did u let him kiss u
creepyPMs,removed,got weird when he said he would throat fuck a dead guy
creepyPMs,removed,the irony in this post is unbelievable
creepyPMs,removed,not a pm
creepyPMs,removed,it was a joke cool your jets tumblrina
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair i am a high functioning alcoholic
creepyPMs,removed,someones insecure
creepyPMs,removed,he hasnt mentioned you cant take a selfie with her using a selfie stick thoughts
creepyPMs,removed,did you tell your friend about this
creepyPMs,removed,well luckily he accepted it and ended it
creepyPMs,removed,waitwhere did she meet this guy
creepyPMs,removed,this is outrageous your battery life is very critical
creepyPMs,removed,dear op please remain in contact with said friend i deem it highly likely this person is abusive and will turn on your friend she will need help then make sure youre still there please
creepyPMs,removed,same thing happened with me ive had a friend for about six years now and we only talk like once a month or so she got a boyfriend and we talked about it a bit then like two months later i texted her and i got a whos this her boyfriend had made her delete my number she was saying how it was cool now and whatever but i just said that if our friendship meant so little that shed opt to never speak to me again because some insecure dude that she just met told her not to then i didnt want to be her friend anyway
creepyPMs,removed,youve not saw enough internet today till you see the guy fucking the manhole cover
creepyPMs,removed,does your friend want you to stop talking to her too
creepyPMs,removed,ive had people do this to me before its always confused me certainly my friends can pick who they are friends with but guys like these really do think that the only thing any guy wants with his partner is to date her
creepyPMs,removed,i had a similar experience with a friend of mine then she broke up with him because of how controlling he is
creepyPMs,removed,ive had a couple female friends delete and stop speaking to me because they got into a relationship and the guy didnt want her having close male friends
creepyPMs,removed,did you sleep with her i have a very close friend that this happens with because we hooked up when we first met like years ago and she picks real winners like this
creepyPMs,removed,this guy needs to
creepyPMs,removed,uh this has never happened to me because i feel it is disrespectful to not include a females boyfriend into our friendship if i care about hed and she cares about him then hes got a pass in my book this is considering you really are okay with being just friends with her and arent flirting and doing weird shit to her you wouldnt do to a homie then you are crossing the line personally when im in a relationship my lady can talk to whoever she wants even if it is innocent flirting anyone who has the privilege of that much free time and such a lack of big boy responsibilities that they can sit there and monitor their ladies social life so closely is either daddy rich or is a complete fuccboi and if thats the case it seems your female friend is just as much as a fuccboi too they deserve each other let them be miserable in peace
creepyPMs,removed,did you tell your friend want you to stop talking to you anymore they either stop talking to her too fun fact
creepyPMs,removed,bros before hoes
creepyPMs,removed,ill add to the chorus of people saying it does happen i have a friend ive known since first grade were in our twenties now who spent the last years not speaking to me or any other of his other past friends because his wife is a jealous controlling monster hes actually decided to finally get a divorce and get his life back but the power of a bad significant other to control your life is a sad reality for many people
creepyPMs,removed,i wish there was more you could do for her but it looks like from the comments that youve put here that shes in that honeymoon phase of this i hope that it doesnt get worse than it is and she gets free soon but id probably step back and wait until a better moment to contact her because it seems like you are an aggravation to him and it might escalate
creepyPMs,removed,pretty much why i cant long term keep a friend thats a girl they usually end up abandoning the friendship once they get a boyfriend hell same thing for some guys too
creepyPMs,removed,is he wearing mom jeans in his profile picture because it looks like hes wearing mom jeans in his profile picture
creepyPMs,removed,ummmanyone else been on rcreepypms so long that reading this message while sure is true feels like this is two bubbles of conversation and for all i know op could be the actual creep trying to pass it off on the bf again thats only a thought but definitely a thought i think this sub has jaded me a bit
creepyPMs,removed,i feel like were only getting one side of the story here new boyfriend may be completely off base but then again without seeing what youve been sending her he may not be its tough to pass judgement without all the facts can you provide some context
creepyPMs,removed,its an elegant gif of a bad significant other to control your life story to the point of rcripplingalcoholism but we have fun
creepyPMs,removed,my bad i thought the sarcastic comment was you thinking that actually doesnt happen
creepyPMs,removed,i hate this i have an ex that im still really good friends with and now shes dating a younger guy who has never been in a serious relationship before he threw a fit when he found out that were not just friends but used to be in a relationship and had plans to move in together until we both realized that it was companion love and not romantic love between us so he told her that he doesnt want us to be friends anymore because he cant comprehend how two people that were intimate could be just friends after that and he is concerned that there may be deeper feelings or at the very least still some sexual attraction i get that he feels threatened by me but this insecure controlling bullshit makes him look like a child more than an adult and the worst part is that my ex has two children that totally adore me and i had to actually explain to them that its not that i dont want to see them anymore and that i dont hate them the youngest asked if i hated them and thats why i havent been around its just that i cant come around anymore because of adult stuff i may dislike the new boyfriend but im not going to sabotage the relationship by turning the kids against him immature insecure people are jerks and i feel bad for the weakwilled people in a relationship with them that allow them to shut out a friend
creepyPMs,removed,op got exposed
creepyPMs,removed,you r probably more important to her than him wtf
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair you posted his response to what you said to his girlfriend how do we know you didnt say some weird shit to her
creepyPMs,removed,your postcomment has been removed in accordance with httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,removed,why would you go on app like this to vent about your sexual abuse ptsd and then complain about the quality of messages from random anonymous guys if you have a boyfriend and are easily creeped out by strangers on the internet getting personal then only share intimate details with people youre comfortable with it looked like you wanted some attention or sympathy for your story but you got more than you bargained for
creepyPMs,removed,ha i kinda feel like you have to give the little shit some credit
creepyPMs,removed,wish you would post the creepy pms you send his gf looking at your post history you are friend zoned and he saw through you
creepyPMs,removed,scottsdale reporting ill round up a posse of rich housewives to hunt this fucker down
creepyPMs,removed,why did you black out your name
creepyPMs,removed,theres a lot of horny indian dudes out there a lot
creepyPMs,removed,i would have maybe made it all the way to screenshot and then he would have been put on the ban list i hate that random messaging shit like who actually gets that to work pedos i guess
creepyPMs,removed,while i agree this is so uncalled for and creepy as shit ill never understand responding to this crap it more often than not just goes away if you ignore it these creeps feed on being replied to negative or not
creepyPMs,removed,so you two did hookup
creepyPMs,removed,lol none of what that creep said is insinuating he would rape you you cant punch someone in the face because theyre an asshole and call it self defence youre not defending anyone youre attacking someone and thats a fucked up way of trying to resolve issues why does everyone agree its fine to punch someone in the face thats not an acceptable way to act at all regardless of what the person did
creepyPMs,removed,i meant a traditionally feminine breast i know breasts come in many different shapes as sizes but from the most part i meant and i think most people understood by the upvotes was a feminine breast im also making this comment in hindsight which means if you saw all the pictures you would know that it was relieved to be a man meaning the joke played on him was he so desperate to see a womans breast but they were mans all along i felt to be masculine breast and it turned out to be so if i was wrong i would not have made the comment all my life i have never seen so many claims of these genders so i wouldnt have the knowledge to use that for an assement its not really an attack on nontraditional genders its just a statement from what i observe in life in comparing masculine and feminine breast
creepyPMs,removed,dont ever get with someone who treats you like that i dont know if you have had any bad prior relationships but always have high standards
creepyPMs,removed,its finsta not throwaway get with it op
creepyPMs,removed,do not disgrace the wonderful experience that is drugs used in moderation of course by comparing it to this lunatic
creepyPMs,removed,i dont expect someone to use the term cis womans to describe a traditionally feminine breast shape and i feel sorry for other trans people that would i dont think that not being conscious of the of the population that is trans is not being sensitive
creepyPMs,removed,if you eat plant based and a guy does how many extra points is that i dont normally by myself but i have in the past and totally could again
creepyPMs,removed,hey at least the boobs are perfect
creepyPMs,removed,less creepy but funny pm though p
creepyPMs,removed,men are pigs you should learn how to not generalise and respect others as youd like to be respected yourself
creepyPMs,removed,more like rcringepics material good god
creepyPMs,removed,i have never been harassed for being trans or bi so i guess im used to not needing people to be sensitive towards me
creepyPMs,removed,not to far off in the end
creepyPMs,removed,lol never mind i checked your post history and found out you are you have zero life experience your preconcieved notions will be beat out of you not literally i hope you seem pretty smart so im confident you will get it keep plugging away at those ap courses they are a big leg up for sure
creepyPMs,removed,so im being down voted because i havent experienced harassment and dont expect people to be sensitive towards me i didnt say i dont think any minority should be respected in the slightest just that i dont personally expect it
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think it really added to the conversation the main issue people have with trans people on reddit at least is the tumblrina stereotype where they butt their way into unrelated conversations making it about them and take offense at extremely minor things see trigger warnings ive never seen reddit say anything against trans people but they do mock otherkin genderfluidity etc in this specific scenario utitansallthewaydown corrected a comment by adding the term cis this was unnecessary the previous comment wasnt even about sexuality it was talking about physical body parts i was simply trying to correct your comment to be a bit more sensitive referring to someone with breasts as a woman is insensitive no because were literally talking about someone elses attraction to a physical body ive worked with a mtf trans person as my subordinate and i called people out when they referred to her as him i have no problem being sensitive to people in proper contexts however expecting people to append cis to every conversation that they have just to avoid hurting your tumblrina feelings is ridiculous jumping in out of the blue to correct people is narcissistic theres no need to make the conversation about you
creepyPMs,removed,how is this unfair to trans people i downvoted it because i dont think it really added to the conversation the main issue people have with trans people on reddit at least is the tumblrina stereotype where they butt their way into unrelated conversations making it about them and take offense at extremely minor things see trigger warnings ive never seen reddit say anything against trans people just for being trans but they do mock otherkin genderfluidity etc in this specific scenario utitansallthewaydown corrected a comment by adding the term cis this was unnecessary the previous comment wasnt even about sexuality it was talking about physical body parts i was simply trying to correct your comment to be a bit more sensitive referring to someone with breasts as a woman is insensitive no because were literally talking about someone elses attraction to a physical body ive worked with a mtf trans person as my subordinate and i called people out when they referred to her as him i have no problem being sensitive to people in proper contexts however expecting people to append cis to every conversation that they have just to avoid hurting your tumblrina feelings is ridiculous jumping in out of the blue to correct people is narcissistic theres no need to make the conversation about you
creepyPMs,removed,my boyfriend thinks i have cute feet and he doesnt even have a fetish he just thinks all of me is adorable af
creepyPMs,removed,im more concerned about the fact that you just invited everyone you talk to what seems like everyone you had a minor fling with to your party
creepyPMs,removed,cash me outside how bow dah
creepyPMs,removed,am i missing something i dont think this guy is creepy at all but maybe there is some backstory to this
creepyPMs,removed,whats more embarrassing the message or your lack of spelling a word they spelled right
creepyPMs,removed,because the comment was specifically speaking in the physiological sense of a biological female pointing out the difference between a male and a female body is not an attack on your gender identity
creepyPMs,removed,idk why but whenever i see a really crooked dick i want to call it the teeny tower of pisa
creepyPMs,removed,yknow i couldve guessed most of that description tbh
creepyPMs,removed,it kinda looks like it had a knot in it making it lean to the side and thats why i asked
creepyPMs,removed,a little self righteous maybe
creepyPMs,removed,an ex had a leaning penis and he said it was due to too much fapping with one hand as a teenager
creepyPMs,removed,ohhhhh boiii here we go
creepyPMs,removed,you but thank you i just got out of rehab
creepyPMs,removed,are you kidding utitansallthewaydown was the one that said people should be sensitive towards the trans minority i was saying that personally i dont expect someone to actively consider trans people when engaging in a conversation about sexual organs youre blowing this way out of proportion and putting words in my mouth by taking the way you perceived what i said and deciding that i implied it that way
creepyPMs,removed,send nudes
creepyPMs,removed,send nudes
creepyPMs,removed,bet hes an indian
creepyPMs,removed,womens sexuality is far more malleable than mens for some reason thats why women are more likely to be bi
creepyPMs,removed,wait youre offended by the word retarded in all contexts or only when used as an insult
creepyPMs,removed,that poor abused penis is likely years a slave and was likely trying to exit stage left
creepyPMs,removed,tell him his cock leans left
creepyPMs,removed,im sure im digging myself a hole here but can you help me understand why you dont consider yourself bisexual clearly youre attracted to men just an exceptionally small number of them thus far exactly one theres nothing about bisexuality that insists you must be attracted to some minimum number of males it seems like this would add needless confusion to the topic of sexuality which is already hard enough to talk about curious what your thoughts are here and hope that ive only ruffled a small amount of feathers
creepyPMs,removed,doesnt change much but dont worry all of the salt has washed away my original comment
creepyPMs,removed,creepy yeah but you sure seemed to enjoy going along with it
creepyPMs,removed,if you are a dude who is dating another dude then you arent straight be whoever you want to be im not judging but dont kid yourself you arent straight
creepyPMs,removed,oh come on theres creepy pms then theres people going along with it egging along the conversation but im out of line for pointing it out got it
creepyPMs,removed,im only one who finds both cringy downvotes here i come
creepyPMs,removed,now take a u turn just like your dick did
creepyPMs,removed,i want to appeal my post delete because it didnt violate any rules
creepyPMs,removed,how does your boyfriend feel about the fact that you consider yourself straight yet hes a man idk im a lesbian and if i dated a girl that considered herself straight id feel very invalidated and insecure
creepyPMs,removed,that dude could fuck you from around the corner holy shit
creepyPMs,removed,what do i mean i mean that online people say shit they wouldnt to in person hence there is little to no accountability i thought it was a pretty straightforward comment i do appreciate you asking rather than being a douche though it shows a nice level of integrity and self respect
creepyPMs,removed,your life sounds amazing ignore that fuckboi
creepyPMs,removed,did he bring it up in the chat with you at all though
creepyPMs,removed,if you think about it the idea of getting it on with your sister is pretty hot when you look at it from the perspective of other people since their sister isnt yours but if you were them it totally would be
creepyPMs,removed,i just feel like he took the response well and was just telling a jokeim the only one i guess
creepyPMs,removed,hit too close to home denial is strong reality is a tough pill to swallow i dont mind once yoy have like up votes downvotes dont do shit i like them even keeps it more real i know i hit the mark then i have plenty to spare
creepyPMs,removed,thats not highly gay or anything wtf
creepyPMs,removed,just say nothing
creepyPMs,removed,it seems to me like hes trolling i am amazed at how you kept replying to him
creepyPMs,removed,you could have just said thanks and moved on but instead chose to instigate the guy into becoming creepy dick behavior op
creepyPMs,removed,i like how you are cool with posting a picture of your ass on reddit haha good luck with some more creep pms god bless ps i think your behind is lovely me not hurt you plz let me in your apt
creepyPMs,removed,whyd you keep talking to him
creepyPMs,removed,youre both deaf but want to call each other
creepyPMs,removed,the topic is to make fun of the creepy pm normally im game for that im saying that given his situation while hes still threatening and creepy as fuck its a dick move for the rest of us to make fun of him and we should all lay off a bit thats on topic
creepyPMs,removed,man that sucks on a lighter note can i get your digits do you live alone are you alone is anyone home are you home can i meet you at your house hello i tried to call you
creepyPMs,removed,he seems a bit slow upstairs
creepyPMs,removed,you dodged a bullet if he wasnt literally dumb you may have found out he was a crazy ass way too late
creepyPMs,removed,wow both parties are super cringeworthy
creepyPMs,removed,murica really though why does this always happen in the usa
creepyPMs,removed,you shut your whore american taco eating ass
creepyPMs,removed,
creepyPMs,removed,i mean you shouldve just let it end when the person said bye but you decided to say that there salty
creepyPMs,removed,its a liiittle funny
creepyPMs,removed,sometimes its better not to reply at all i know it is polite to respectfully decline etc but i dont think anyone is really under obligation to respond a lack of response says as much also rep it
creepyPMs,removed,im correcting and educating you and white dudes wonder why everyone hates them
creepyPMs,removed,if you dont want guys to comment on your boobs you have to make your profile picture a crop of just your face
creepyPMs,removed,im a guy its more like i can only assume the other of creeps are autistic very stupid or just mentally ill
creepyPMs,removed,the internet cant hurt you if you dont let it
creepyPMs,removed,here have a tribute
creepyPMs,removed,kinda obvious hes fucking with you though le science xd gives it away
creepyPMs,removed,just went to your post in roldschoolcool to see the picture in question found httpimgurcomatoicv seems your grandma is quite popular
creepyPMs,removed,thats a lot of talk for a guy with pubes for a beard
creepyPMs,removed,i dont get it shes not even that hot
creepyPMs,removed,this is just a theory but i know a lot of asian guys who go ballistic when they see an asian girl with a white guy i looked at your posted pics and create fake accounts to instigate racial hate the fact that he made a point to state he was a white guy made me suspicious of this why would anyone anonymous need you to know what color they are just to insult you unless you did something specific that really bothered them like not dating within your own race ive been seeing this lashing out at asian femalewhite male couples on the internet a lot recently especially when the girl is really attractive like you are and its not coming from white males this is a textbook example of that
creepyPMs,removed,please report them
creepyPMs,removed,it doesnt seem likes theres any point in responding just a total shit head
creepyPMs,removed,come on this is funny
creepyPMs,removed,okaycan we stop saying im posting this on creepypms i feel like it just makes more work for the mods
creepyPMs,removed,oh yeah
creepyPMs,removed,tbflots of women are turned on by dick pics dont belittle other womens proclivties just bc they dont appeal to you
creepyPMs,removed,because it basically asking for the person to come to the sub and post which means the mods have to block their posts
creepyPMs,removed,pretty sure the i cant compete was true i smell the three inch from over here
creepyPMs,removed,man you are no fun
creepyPMs,removed,so im the type of person that would find this hot but not as an opener
creepyPMs,removed,hmm kinda hot but would prolly feel extremely uncomfortable if they dont respect you as a human being with a life as well as their personal prostitute
creepyPMs,removed,i dont know why you message back it would just make them think you are interested i would be pissed at my wife if she kept messaging this creep
creepyPMs,removed,you should find his mother etc on facebook and share these with herthem wouldnt the women in his life be proud to know he is harassing women online
creepyPMs,removed,he was drunk
creepyPMs,removed,now i wanna see you post in ruglyduckling
creepyPMs,removed,hah i cant help but wonder was he depressed and feeling lonely or was he just horny
creepyPMs,removed,how is this not fake i dont understand posts like these
creepyPMs,removed,if you read what she said youd realize thats not her hair
creepyPMs,removed,this is actually pretty scary guy typical sociopath personality deceitfulness hostility irresponsibility manipulativeness risk taking behaviors aggression impulsivity irritability lack of restraint
creepyPMs,removed,mental illness is a real thing
creepyPMs,removed,girl you have got to start embracing your natural shadethey try to put that in bottles and yet here you already have it ugh p
creepyPMs,removed,youre dating a dude with a manbun lol
creepyPMs,removed,i dont believe you for a minute not that it isnt ashen red but that it clashes with your skin tone
creepyPMs,removed,my place is a mess is never a real excuse if she wanted to see him shed invited him over end of story
creepyPMs,removed,well did you go out with him
creepyPMs,removed,i suppose in a monochromoatic universe such as the one you live in this would be true but i do not i have no qualms in inviting others to leave your monochromatic universe behind either eh
creepyPMs,removed,why do people have people like this on their friends listsfacebook if i havent spoken to someone within the last year theyre not on my goddamn lists anywhere and they def dont have my number if we dont talk there is zero reason to have any connection with them
creepyPMs,removed,i have no idea why its getting upvoted probably because op replied
creepyPMs,removed,poor guy probably in a horrible state of mind
creepyPMs,removed,yea chick you better come post it on reddurp bc people give a shit
creepyPMs,removed,chick you seriously couldnt just ignore the guy you have to make posts screencaps and come to reddurp and type out long blogs like this holy fucking shit reddit is cringe as fuck
creepyPMs,removed,i think he was just a bit salty you got hot after you broke up no big deal regular guy stuff
creepyPMs,removed,bro you sound like a mad scientist with all those has and all caps
creepyPMs,removed,i looked at your history and you and your bf from what you write about him seem really weird
creepyPMs,removed,hey honey
creepyPMs,removed,ignore him dear
creepyPMs,removed,based on this something like this happens to you about once a month interesting
creepyPMs,removed,this sub is getting really boring
creepyPMs,removed,ha ha ha ha hahow you can connect that to being a rape victim blameris soweirdlol another thing is how you want the attentionyouve been away for at whileand to reenter the scene you find some of the mails you got from that time when you posted a lot of nude pictures if it was you in the forums here on reddit its funmost it here in rso be it for me its not real lifeits textpictures in front of a computeranything can happennothing is realeverything is produced so be nice to suck me sideways and yes in pouty fishnetstyle d
creepyPMs,removed,ive blow more than my share of straight guys discretely
creepyPMs,removed,action dan here im and still like me a fresh out of high school girl but i also love single moms they are my bread and butter but yeah i dont get it either you dont ask some one about their mother
creepyPMs,removed,action dan here i have a old im rasing on my own your game loses the closing touch after six years of realtionship all and all that dudes super creepy but girls on meet me might respond to that where im at its nothing but skin drugs and a selfie contest not saying thats you there are nice girls scattered about found one myself but if his meet me looked like mine you cant blame the dude im sorry this happened
creepyPMs,removed,speak to me 👍 toesuckerlad
creepyPMs,removed,your friend is probably a pedo btw
creepyPMs,removed,okay maybe lay off the facebook groups for a while yeh its really not that serious
creepyPMs,removed,okay this is a troll who cares
creepyPMs,removed,really lame post haha wow okay cool
creepyPMs,removed,edgy
creepyPMs,removed,trump is more prowomens rights than hillary ever was genius his campaign manager was literally a woman do you even read the shit you type
creepyPMs,removed,just looked at your posts i want to throw up
creepyPMs,removed,its a band a band people please stop trying to figure this out
creepyPMs,removed,i had to take a second look to make sure i read that right more like rsadcreepms
creepyPMs,removed,your type of joy is very weird also op has a lot of published pics of half nudes and suggestive captions on reddit so creepy pm is a probably suits her needs b is something to post about how man are creeps and she is a saint sorry for another joykill there
creepyPMs,removed,something along the lines of your friends a pedo btw then he pmd me faggot after i responded so i just think someone shit in his cheerios xd
creepyPMs,removed,as cringey and lame as that was pretty sure the reply of being so well known belongs on the humble brag subreddit
creepyPMs,removed,why are you even responding to her messages when youre in a relationship
creepyPMs,removed,did i say you were cheating no did i know that the conversation hadnt started that way no would i dislike if my bf was friends with a girl who was asking for pics yes this is facebook messenger yeah so you obviously know this girl why are you friends with a girl who would disrespect your relationship like that
creepyPMs,removed,dude i wasnt saying he wasnt allowed to talk to ppl this screenshot made it seem like the entire conversation was like this which is why i was wondering why he kept responding to someone who was obviously only interested in stuff he shouldnt be involved in
creepyPMs,removed,i guess im alone in thinking that your response was disproportionately rude and his message wasnt creepy
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think your gender really matters but okay replace all the hes with shes
creepyPMs,removed,i see that it is a little inappropriate yeah but the guy said twice he wasnt actually into beastiality
creepyPMs,removed,all im saying is that the guy said twice he wasnt actually into beastiality i think he just made a really bad joke and he flubbed nothing more
creepyPMs,removed,im not sure what melatonin is but he was creeping and misspelling more words so i concluded that he was more in the wrong sorry there are members of my gender that do that this sub blows my mind
creepyPMs,removed,honestly most people app dating are all fucked up tinder was fun years ago now its just dangerous and pathetic it takes more effort to meet people like this the only time it was worth it for me was when i was working hours a week you cant lose with organic interaction
creepyPMs,removed,congrats on swinging your big mod dick down on the table
creepyPMs,removed,while i get that what he thinks is wrong somehow dismembering another human over those thoughts is better
creepyPMs,removed,uh oh weve got a couple of fellas hanging around who are going to think you are serous about setting people aflame
creepyPMs,removed,oh lighten the fuck up he said he was sorru
creepyPMs,removed,out of curiousity is this deer park in toronto
creepyPMs,removed,number one rule is not to engage them op youd have more luck reasoning with a teaspoon
creepyPMs,removed,hi can i be mod i will do a good job and keep the streets of reddit safe sir thank you in advance for recruting me to the team
creepyPMs,removed,youre playing along you have no one but yourself to blame at this point
creepyPMs,removed,oh didnt catch that sorry
creepyPMs,removed,the true reason dude wasnt hot why dont they get this you cant just mimic the charming guy you see in movies you also have to be good looking and act like you dont want them
creepyPMs,removed,something i have a problem with this subreddit is how nearly every woman here has this women are angels and never do wrong bullshit and thats what it is bullshit women can be just as cruel as men can so i looked for reasons of that mentality here i saw the subreddit info feminist community that explains it
creepyPMs,removed,i want awkward formalities and chit chat giving the look as if they were running around with a sharpie cock scribd across their forehead piercing gaze to make you regret that very thought you think i care for fuck peach cobbler viva la revolution and fuck zamasu tired of his shenanigans
creepyPMs,removed,laughing at literal inconsistencies and fear of threats of violence that arent able to be made in this plane of existence isnt a hissy fit its laughing at ridiculousness using your head about what constitutes an actual threat vs a fantasy takes a few seconds more than just mindlessly hitting like a robot you claim youre not a button crazy thought
creepyPMs,removed,bullshit im a guy and had plenty of creepy bagging girls bother me throughout the years the fact that i always get downvoted here just shows this sub is filled with self pitying feminazis whi ironically probably depend on their husbands so they can hang on reddit all day
creepyPMs,removed,lets say he hasnt seen a vagina before is that a bad thing
creepyPMs,removed,of course youre right but sometimes this sub seems to me like the female version of that man pill sub or whatevers the name of that misogynistic place so sometimes i ask myself why do the mods tolerate manhate here i get that some girls need to have a place to vent and revenge or whatever but make a different sub for that i come here for genuine creepy pms not some whiny women talking like tv show characters thinking the world revolves around them and becoming a circlejerk
creepyPMs,removed,yeah giving a girl loads of money to spend and deriving pleasure from it is so gosh darn creepy
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt shame anyone its still weird
creepyPMs,removed,well if any girls want to spoil me with their credit cards and fly me to them to take me out to dinner just pm me
creepyPMs,removed,this guy has a penis so small he probably has to use tweezers to jerk off as soon as a guy humble brags about size i just assume the opposite is true
creepyPMs,removed,being female or pretending sounds like an easy way to get money i wonder whos exploited this
creepyPMs,removed,instead of wanting to cause as much distress as possible id rather say they have no idea about the real world and dont have some mental capabilities needed to process a sentence fast enough to reply in a reasonable time frame
creepyPMs,removed,you know he got a small wang
creepyPMs,removed,im not gonna lie its a fuckin honest question the struggle is so real but thats nothing youd say to a girl any time before the or date and he shouldnt have said it serious or in text
creepyPMs,removed,everyone is someones idea of hot
creepyPMs,removed,my only question here is why you talked to the guy for so long
creepyPMs,removed,what were you expecting if im honest
creepyPMs,removed,your day is about to improve best line
creepyPMs,removed,well lets ponder on that mostly what i said is a joke hence the star wars reference in no way was i actually shitting on ops for not taking money but the thing is is that a lot of people here do have money issues so while they wouldnt take their money which is fine others would love the opportunity
creepyPMs,removed,i think the biggest difference between us is our bank accounts
creepyPMs,removed,hey do you like chap stick and a good tickle cause i have a tiny penis im talkin grub worm with a turtle neck
creepyPMs,removed,this is what virgins would call a pick up strategy
creepyPMs,removed,oh well shit you took my only argument
creepyPMs,removed,my dick is not small whatsoever suuuuuure thing dude sure thing
creepyPMs,removed,what a fucking beta hes trying so hard to be alpha it hurts
creepyPMs,removed,not sure whats creepy about this hes awkward but polite
creepyPMs,removed,dio can you hear me i am lost and so alone im asking for your guidance wont you come down from your throne i need a tight compadre wholl teach me how to rock my father thinks youre evil but man he can suck a cock
creepyPMs,removed,jesus youre a fucking bitch how do you handle guys coming on to you in public like it is human nature to want to fuck and what not unfortunately for you guys are expected to be the one to make the first move and get the ball rolling to see if a girl is interested again youre a huge fucking bitch
creepyPMs,removed,is it beyond you to just block someone when they chat with you and you have no interest in chatting back
creepyPMs,removed,k
creepyPMs,removed,theres a difference between reading about an experiment and actually performing one and yes fatties welcome to the male perspective it comes with its own problems
creepyPMs,removed,thanks for the browbeating ill be sure to not share any proactive measures i take when it comes to improving malefemale dynamics anymore
creepyPMs,removed,t r i g g e r e d r i g g e r e d
creepyPMs,removed,i see it as a social tool to motivate members within a group to conform to societal norms that advance the interests of the group your groups societal norms are clearly different from mine and thats fine we have different goals and objectives embrace diversity
creepyPMs,removed,i agree because ive noticed that fucking feminists will always find a way to sneak in some snarky comment or browbeat when a guy is genuinely trying to crawl out of the bullshit its better to just stay quiet thank you for helping me learn this on reddit instead of in real life
creepyPMs,removed,different tribe different societal norms not everyone thinks like you do
creepyPMs,removed,different group withing this society different norms my particular groups norms are clearly different from yours
creepyPMs,removed,thank you for the feedback i just felt that i was being attacked by the other posters when i was genuinely trying to improve myself the comment clearly was against the rules i apologize for it
creepyPMs,removed,thank you unfortunately the dig at fat people wasnt the best way to convey the analogy i was trying to make
creepyPMs,removed,i dont understand you repeatedly tell him youre not interested but you keep responding isnt that the opposite of what youre supposed to do
creepyPMs,removed,you didnt actually open it did you you know for science for him to claim it was smaller after the picture was sent his was fake wasnt it
creepyPMs,removed,i was on board until they compared words to rape
creepyPMs,removed,ive never claimed to have a incher dont overgeneralise
creepyPMs,removed,you still have to pretend that it tastes amazing though 😜
creepyPMs,removed,you didnt say acting like you said no better than those are two vastly different things for instance i could say someone was acting like a murderer because they were pissed off at another person and conceptualizing different ways in which theyd like to kill them however if i said to someone youre no better than a murderer they would have had to do some fucked up shit equivalent to that like causing the deaths of people indirectly without regard for them or something in the realm of that thats where youre missing the point no better than very plainly implies equivalence or even insinuates that its worse sexual harassment and rape are in no way equivalent thats why sexual harassment is almost always handled as a civil matter with no jail time while people can spend the rest of their lives in prison for rape so its settled that you definitely phrased it inappropriately now onto rape culture the entire concept of it undermines how horrible rape is and how much of a piece of sociopathic shit you have to be to commit it can parallels be drawn between what this guy did and rape sure i guess so they can be drawn in the same way that parallels can be drawn between shoving or slapping someone and murdering them but we dont go around saying thats murder culture every time someone shoves another person this is because to do so would be considered ridiculous and to even compare the two would be to undermine how heinous murder truly is onto the last straw you were grasping at the fact that rapists also refuse to hear no from women in other regards so stuff like this leads to that i can compare this to murder and assault once again do i think that murderers are violent in a lot of other aspects of course however that doesnt mean that everyone thats assaulted someone for one reason or another is going to become a murderer or that should be classified as one those are two entirely different ballparks just like sexual harassment and rape are
creepyPMs,removed,i love you girls like to disenfranchise men of their opinions solely based on their gender with discriminatory made up words and terms like mansplaining and rape culture the level of delusion and ego someone has to have to think that they dont have to justify their own words when questioned because in their minds theyre automatically correct due simply to their genitalia is astounding
creepyPMs,removed,id like to cruise up your sweet candy vagina
creepyPMs,removed,im triggered by trigger warnings check your privilege you cis het shitlord
creepyPMs,removed,please tell me which rule specifically i have broken
creepyPMs,removed,thank you for specifying which rule i have broken very helpful ill be sure to mend my ways s unsubbed thanks for verifying i dont want to be here
creepyPMs,removed,ok ive been reading these for a long time now im sure this has already been brought up many times in the past but this has to work say of the time i see entirely too many creepy ass guys doing this so if it is repeated it must work i think i need to unsubscribe from this sub because i really think less about humanity being a part of it
creepyPMs,removed,make sure to notify me if this sub gets any useful mods might come back at some point
creepyPMs,removed,okay and
creepyPMs,removed,you didnt specify any rule i broke you gave a reason for giving trigger warnings which is not a rule we are a support sub we have trigger warnings as a warning to users who might be upset after seeing specific content there is no rule there come on at least try to be a nazi mod
creepyPMs,removed,oh hey look an actually helpful reply thank you
creepyPMs,removed,benzodiazepines benzodiazepines bzd bzs sometimes called benzos are a class of psychoactive drugs whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a benzene ring and a diazepine ring the first such drug chlordiazepoxide librium was discovered accidentally by leo sternbach in and made available in by hoffmann–la roche which since has also marketed the benzodiazepine diazepam valium in benzodiazepines were globally the most prescribed medications stolen straight from wikipedia all i had to type was what are benzos youre on the internet bud use it
creepyPMs,removed,the god help us if you sneeze was a good one though
creepyPMs,removed,on
creepyPMs,removed,variety is the spice of life ive got a number of kinks i guess so his request seems pretty tame in that respect but as it crosses all the boundaries in how youre supposed to address someone its still pretty shitty even in the kink community i wouldnt address someone like this not until the conversation had reached that point assuming that it did people are retards is the long and short of it i guess i hope your retardday ratio remains low
creepyPMs,removed,my inner sociopath wouldve forced me to do some jewishrelated research online and then force me to pretend that i was jewish
creepyPMs,removed,thats not even a text though thats a note on an iphone
creepyPMs,removed,looks identical to when i type on my note pad
creepyPMs,removed,trust me proud feminist im a man i know what im talking about
creepyPMs,removed,dont you have someone to yell at for saying hello to you and literally raping you with his words
creepyPMs,removed,im going to assume the post bs and just some feminist bs its a not on the iphone that op is using to make it look like shes being oppressed
creepyPMs,removed,go blow water out that blow hole atop that head dont you have a large supreme pizza to eat for breakfast followed by two liters of mountain dew only to be followed up by posts on tumblr about how the pizza delivery driver oppressed you by asking you wanted your change back realizing you cant change anything
creepyPMs,removed,no i got distracted by my job where i make more than you because men work harder
creepyPMs,removed,not trying to justify what the creeper said but can i ask why you have an okcupid profile if youre just looking for normal friends
creepyPMs,removed,i hear you i just think this situation is pretty much a given when you decide to put something up on an online dating website
creepyPMs,removed,dates year old man uses emojis
creepyPMs,removed,yeah thats why the mods are deleting the people harassing us instead of deleting our statements were the trolls in this situation not you i
creepyPMs,removed,what if he wrapped his dick in the money wat then
creepyPMs,removed,go to hell
creepyPMs,removed,no its easy money
creepyPMs,removed,id put my money on indian
creepyPMs,removed,ask for the money upfront no context
creepyPMs,removed,logged in to say this
creepyPMs,removed,aside from the horrible manners this guy has doesnt he have a point though
creepyPMs,removed,if it works times better to spam everyone to even the odds of getting laid
creepyPMs,removed,dont conflate foot worship with a humiliation kink or something similar to bdsm youre doing a loot of projection generalisations and speculation someone with a foot fetish has just that someone with a humiliation kink has just that one doesnt necessarily imply the other why not just think that this kid is a bit awkward and rude in his manners and leave it at that
creepyPMs,removed,he deleted this account he makes so many throwaways so im not gonna cover his name sorry if this breaks any rules mods but no use in covering a deleted accounts name
creepyPMs,removed,because hes probably he went right to hacking her phone after insulting her size and orientation year old btard alert
creepyPMs,removed,it takes all of seconds to make a throwaway your a fucking dick i will now log out and never see your reply or your hypocrisy ever again peace
creepyPMs,removed,super weird but easy money id consider it tbh
creepyPMs,removed,faggot whale 😝😝😂😂😂
creepyPMs,removed,well thats a bit harsh it is too easy to say you said something nasty to me therefore i find your arguments invalid the way i see it him calling you cunty is attacking your actions not attacking your person which is almost always unnecessary you could have made a better case by addressing his points instead of calling him out on using a throwaway which you are also using afaik and focusing on the cuntpart so in short i hardly find this creepy this is just bad manners from both sides as far as i can read from the context
creepyPMs,removed,masters in therapy and i have no idea what this disorder is it seems to go way beyond aggression and misogyny to the point of rambling delusions any psychiatrists or psychologists here this guy really doesnt seem well or safe op i hope you are able to stay far away from him just reading it was scary
creepyPMs,removed,its possible he doesnt understand what he did wrong to me he doesnt seem like an extreme creep rather an awkward foreigner however ignoring his awkward messages will only leave him confused and possibly angry if you want to help you should clearly tell him you want to be honest with him for a bit also emphasize the fact that you wish to help him and to help him he needs to face some hard truths point out that there were some messages which made you feel uncomfortable ask if he acts similar towards other people and if yes suggest that he might be more likable if he improved some of his social skills primarily selfassurance also subtly point out that people might be avoiding him because of his social skills suggest that he could find a hobby or muslim groups in the country there is a lot of assumptions from my side but i hope ive helped you a bit in short i find honesty to be the most effective treatment to these cases
creepyPMs,removed,seems like a bipolar manic episode
creepyPMs,removed,guys dont have the monopoly on this ive had women pull the same on me very scary when anyone does it
creepyPMs,removed,apparently you missed the part where i said ive had women pull the same on me i think that qualifies as personal experience but thank for sharing your vitriol without any experience and adding no value
creepyPMs,removed,you must be a lot of fun at parties please go troll elsewhere
creepyPMs,removed,i think he meant do you think that i would go out looking for you in the whole city is it weird that i dont think this is weird ive asked the same question before to progress the conversation oh you live in x area there is a great restaurant over in that area have you been
creepyPMs,removed,four years old thats old enough to have sex with in my eyes s the fact i need to put that s here is proof of whats wrong with the world thanks for all the good you guys do mods
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair you didnt have to keep pushing it after they said okay
creepyPMs,removed,can you just block him or does he make new profiles to message you with
creepyPMs,removed,ha do you see my handle
creepyPMs,removed,of course not everyone is the same and professionals usually dont distinguish between bpi bpii and cychlothymic but manic episodes can be this extreme however dont take this as there is nothing to worry about op should protect herself
creepyPMs,removed,i think its a real apology
creepyPMs,removed,or maybe you did misinterpret it and he is sorry he did a poor job articulating his point tldr you suck at receiving information sorry if i come off awkward in stating this
creepyPMs,removed,i am sorry if i came off harsh wht i meant to say was that you have no sense of humor and likely take things the wrong way because you cant detect obvious jokes and sarcasm
creepyPMs,removed,i said this the other day but because i wasnt sorry she was acting like schizophrenic cunt and when she later apologized for flipping out on me because she didnt like my tone i said sorry you got offended didnt mean to wouldnt have bothered saying it but she was clearly expecting a yeah im sorry too
creepyPMs,removed,on a site note tho how is this message creepy its a dating app and the dude is just thirsty nothing creepy about that
creepyPMs,removed,so you instigate the guy and get your panties in a twist because he fires back at you last i checked this subreddit was about people who get creepypms from other people not troll people into sending creepypms
creepyPMs,removed,id be more concerned my partner has a mentality similar enough that he thinks youre being too harsh maybe thats just me though
creepyPMs,removed,eh looks like your typical awkward high school exchange hopefully that guy is still young and can laugh at his goofy thirsty attentionseeking past self later on
creepyPMs,removed,shouldnt need to apologize for people having thin skin im surprised they have wifi in your safe space smoothskin
creepyPMs,removed,how good looking was he for you to even give him a second chance
creepyPMs,removed,if he thinks you answering is setting yourself up to be harassed further i think maybe you need to have a serious chat with your boyfriend about where responsibility for ones actions lies you attempting polite conversation does not make you responsible for the conversation partners rudeness
creepyPMs,removed,i wouldnt talk to my girlfriend that way and i worry good luck with everything
creepyPMs,removed,this is more sad than creepy
creepyPMs,removed,people say that in response to women who keep messaging the guy without saying she isnt interested or when she lets the guy keep messaging her over and over again every day without responding and then telling the internet shes sick of it blocking is the solution to all of that but so many people in this sub dont understand that that is a thing apparently
creepyPMs,removed,i get what youre saying but even blatant racists can have exceptions just like having a wife doesnt guarantee a guy isnt a misogynist for example my parents have friend who is from laos hes one of the good ones whom they bring up all the time yet their political views are deport all mexicans deport all arabs deport all muslims and round up all the native americans and jews
creepyPMs,removed,hi this is federico and i just want to get acquainted to u u are beautiful
creepyPMs,removed,i think greybunny isnt realizing that all relationships have different dynamics and that all men and women are not the same and thus act differently what is good for you may not be for him and that is beautiful
creepyPMs,removed,eyyyyy
creepyPMs,removed,httpiimgurcombfkizbqjpg
creepyPMs,removed,sexism is prejudice or discrimination based on someones sex if youre prejudiced against men or discriminating them because they are men youre being sexist please dont listen to extremist propaganda
creepyPMs,removed,i dont have any pants
creepyPMs,removed,youre not a lesbian
creepyPMs,removed,i didnt violate any rules
creepyPMs,removed,you askin to get hanged
creepyPMs,removed,looks sounds like he has learning difficulties of some kind
creepyPMs,removed,block this chick dude shes crazy i reckon your own mental state will thank you for it p
creepyPMs,removed,dont think this guys serious thats what im going to tell myself anyway
creepyPMs,removed,tbh id take the pizza and run
creepyPMs,removed,finally a creepy pm thats not about some desperate dood and some entitled girl
creepyPMs,removed,whos playing hide and not letting you seek now bitch
creepyPMs,removed,op why did you sit on this one for over a year i demand an explanation it better be true and it better scare us
creepyPMs,removed,what did it smell like
creepyPMs,removed,yes but did it also taste like pussy
creepyPMs,removed,wait though if this wasnt appropriate than what is the only thing that i can think of that was inappropriate here is age other than that he was honest and respectful and apparently backed off
creepyPMs,removed,why not im seriously asking if youre physically attracted to someone but just want to have sex with them and nothing else isnt it better to be honest and clear about it wouldnt it be wore behaviour to just sit through a date with someone you have no interest in dating just to maybe get them to sleep with you of course one should always be polite and respectful when asking
creepyPMs,removed,its only somewhat new for it to be socially acceptable for women to be upfront about it
creepyPMs,removed,action dan here maybe you can be his mrs robinson either way he is always going to remember you as maybe the one that always got away anyway that wasnt as creepy as the title made me believe im hoping kid gets laid soon and doesnt get to odd with you
creepyPMs,removed,nah i think some people totally would if youre not a total dick about it not everyone wants to be wined and dined and i think period its a good idea for everyones intentionswants to be laid out fairly early on so no one gets misled
creepyPMs,removed,am i missing something how is this remotely creepy they stumbled across one of your postings recognized your picture and then were friendly enough to message you along with the friend request you accepted
creepyPMs,removed,but if you literally only want sex and they also only want sex why would you bother with spending money on a date its kind of like leading the person on or something why act like its something its not im still not sure how you initiate something like that without offending anyone though theres such a fine line between being honestand being a dick
creepyPMs,removed,foot dudes like no one else make it very difficult for me to adhere to my vow to not fetishshame
creepyPMs,removed,you probably are hot maybe just dont recognise it also hot is the eye of the beholder i have a thing for fat nerdy guysfat alt chicks so yeah they are hot to some people
creepyPMs,removed,thats because that is a creepy as fuck way to do it like seriously its not that complex is a concept that there are people out there who are just looking to get off and get on with their lives if thats what youre looking for then you should be upfront and honest about it because imagine they already very common situation of if you went on what you thought was a date with someone who was hiding what they really wanted thought it was going great and then never hear from them again after the sex
creepyPMs,removed,meh i dont think thats always the case but its starting to sound like im defending the creep and that wasnt my intention so unless i can find somewhere else to discuss this with you imma have to bow out
creepyPMs,removed,well dont ask a bunch of girls and dont ask right off the bat i meant like after some conversation maybe i just meant the whole wine and dine first part seems misleading to me
creepyPMs,removed,well that wasnt creepy unless he kept going after that
creepyPMs,removed,not honest calling it a phase now the dude will just wait until it passes without developing the skill and mental capacity to control himself kind of like how girls dont develop themselves and wait for their prince charming
creepyPMs,removed,why dont you report the creep before posting to reddit even if nothing is done right away there is a report that there was a threat
creepyPMs,removed,when i was i had sex with a yr old surprisingly neither of us are trashy either it was fun for the time being
creepyPMs,removed,admit it you would have fucked him if he was hot
creepyPMs,removed,why did you shame a year old kid who obviously doesnt know how to approach the situation and in no real shape or form is creepy or abusive not right
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think its really appropriate to be shaming a year old boy for a crush especially considering how respectful he was after you told him no
creepyPMs,removed,i mean i give him points for balls and also taking no for an answer you miss of the shots you dont take neighbor kid
creepyPMs,removed,i see people calling the kid an asshole but those other people are either younger than him or havent gone through puberty the kid seems fine though hes acting upon impulse and following his dick instead of his heart he didnt call you a slut or anything hes going through puberty so uh congratulations i guess
creepyPMs,removed,well already he was polite
creepyPMs,removed,seriously not trying to victim blame here but i have to say this tere are real steps you can and should be taking to handle this and you seem to simply refuse to do anything but post screenshots on here and then make excuses as to why any suggestion doesnt apply to you youve received tons of good solid advice as to how to proceed and protect yourself for fucks sake do something already
creepyPMs,removed,if i were you id say no because id be too worried that his balls would kill me with courage like that they must be smashing hos to pieces on the daily
creepyPMs,removed,it works for me usually i know them for a little while first but ive gotten numbers literally texted eyyy bb u dtf and took them to showers in a secluded part of the college i go to its not uncommon im short and furry but i have a muscular build and confidence out the wahzoo it happened more often than you think i dont know if youre a grown ass adult and people grow out of it or what but being its no problem
creepyPMs,removed,if youre a woman not in the obese category of body fat percentage and go around asking people if they want to have sex it will not be long before you get a bite as a guy its a little harder i dont have a ton of difficulty putting in little effort to slay but id be lying if i said that i was successful more than times if youre a male feminist youll have some serious issues though i dont want to get into an argument here because itll probably get me banned for having an opinion
creepyPMs,removed,good on him for being so honest haha
creepyPMs,removed,they should politely respect your decision to decline too you know thats what was implied i cant help but feel like youre being disingenuous here because it couldnt be more obvious
creepyPMs,removed,you talk to women like that you cant talk to women respectfully see this is what im talking about when did i admit to that ever show me where i said that i go around offering random women my dick because ive asked about somebodys specific sexual preferences on a dating a site when they explicitly said they were looking for casual sex and that person appreciated it what a monster i am but i dont need to point out to you what a stretch that is you already know youre full of shit
creepyPMs,removed,i went ahead and read the rules on the sidebar i deleted my reply to you in the thread can you please explain how that is unfriendly towards anyone rather than just preventing there from being any actual dialog taking place also i have a genuine question i looked at your profile to try to message you as i am not very knowledgeable on how reddit messaging and saw that you replied that animals cannot give consent i am vehemently opposed to beastiality and agree that they cannot give consent to humans however regarding the topic of consent do they need to give consent to each other if so how do they go about doing that
creepyPMs,removed,a good looking girl is a good looking girl id go for an attractive year old at the same way id go for an attractive year old now when im
creepyPMs,removed,isnt she the arsehole
creepyPMs,removed,i dont see what is creepy about him to be honest seems like a good guy
creepyPMs,removed,yeahhhh that seems like a bit of an overreaction just because hes into you and wanted a date doesnt mean he cant help you on a class project meeting somewhere like a library to study doesnt qualify as a date in my opinion he seemed like he was just genuinely trying to help
creepyPMs,removed,this girl straight sucks
creepyPMs,removed,i feel like this should be on rcringepics for the opposite reason that its here
creepyPMs,removed,ive been out of the single life for some time so maybe things have changed if i liked a girl generally speaking i would hope she did well in her class if anyone asked me for help and it was feasible to do so i would try to do so also if i liked a girl i typically hoped that something might eventually happen in conclusion a person can genuinely want to help while hoping something might happen helpful and horny are not mutually exclusive
creepyPMs,removed,honestly he offered to help you in a library and wrote nothing about demanding something in return or even your gratefulness you are basically projecting what you think he means onto him now if he had told you to come over to his place or coming over to yours then you could have said how you are uncomfortable with thet based on him asking you out earlier you rejecting him and therefore not wanting to be in an intimate space with him but a library is as public as it can be and if he were to ask you out again or demand a date for helping you study there then it is a place where you can just get up and leave sorry to say it reads as you overreacting and projecting onto him
creepyPMs,removed,youre golden for calling him out especially when he was trying to act like he didnt have other motives for wanting to help you sorry theres a bunch of assholes who cant sympathize with how insulting it is when someone pretends to just wanna help you when theyre secretly adding up points in their head to eventually get to fuck you
creepyPMs,removed,that isnt too creepy he took a chance and went for it and took the rejection like a champ
creepyPMs,removed,i found this more funny than creepy
creepyPMs,removed,well it worked didnt it he got you to respond so good for him
creepyPMs,removed,we need multiple accounts just to post without you banning us i dont get what problem this solves dont downvotes typically take care of this kind of thing this seems like a big hoop to jump through just so you dont get douchebags in here
creepyPMs,removed,created by anita sarkeesian and modded by a man who is only a feminist to get women wew thats a spicy sub
creepyPMs,removed,nice encouraging rule breaking ban me pls
creepyPMs,removed,gonna have to unsub as much as i liked the occasional wacky pervy pm posted here i think this bot is a bit persecutiony and baity in my opinion but have fun if this is what you guys like
creepyPMs,removed,retards
creepyPMs,removed,if cousin is hot ask for threesome i think youd get it
creepyPMs,removed,i love how this asshole is trying to put quarantining reuropean as a bad thing i love how assholes think censoring is a good thing
creepyPMs,removed,what saying gas the jews is illegal on reddit way to go tolerance
creepyPMs,removed,thats like saying that because mernards doesnt sell socks its censorship how exactly i dont see the comparison
creepyPMs,removed,apparently your unaware of the subreddits that exist that are not censored
creepyPMs,removed,where in reddit s policy does it say its illegal to say gas the jews i mean surely they are aware they have a sub called rkillthejews
creepyPMs,removed,yu must be sexy to get that kind of attention pm me yur
creepyPMs,removed,your not her please dont respond
creepyPMs,removed,im just lookin for some fire ass pussy
creepyPMs,removed,feminism is gay
creepyPMs,removed,look at me guys im attractive enough to get unwanted sexual attention ohoo so triggering intersectional transgenderal feminism xdd yaaasss dae white people are literally triggering omg yaaasss black lives matter white tears patriarchy xxrefugeesrcoolxx donald drumpf lol xdddddddd got im
creepyPMs,removed,what even is this sub reddit this shit makes no sense
creepyPMs,removed,oh shit waddup
creepyPMs,removed,thats the saddest looking dick ive ever seen
creepyPMs,removed,should show cringe anarchy they would love this stuff
creepyPMs,removed,rihaveautismandihavenoideahowtotalktowomenimsoaloneimgonnablackmailastrangerintotalkingtomesoicanfeellikeanormie
creepyPMs,removed,sooooooo how did the date go
creepyPMs,removed,does not make any sense
creepyPMs,removed,holy crap is this a confusing post
creepyPMs,removed,ban me cunts
creepyPMs,removed,has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like
creepyPMs,removed,rtitlegore
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair you do seem to be harassing the profoundly handicapped
creepyPMs,removed,is english your first language
creepyPMs,removed,op makes out with a guy then says she is not interested and then she complains that logic
creepyPMs,removed,wait your a mod on that sub ha and you think you can judge other people for being bigoted definition of a hypocrite
creepyPMs,removed,it was a free speech sub you could be a communist a nazi or an anarchist and the only thing you would have to fear are downvotes people like ulovelyleah didnt like that they could say whatever they want and got that subreddit quarantined and im not going to say there werent white supremacists there they were very very open about it but that doesnt mean we should ban them now instead of a bunch if pacified neonazis shitposting on a small subreddit you have a bunch of pissed of neonazis wanting to find a new place to vent their frustrations
creepyPMs,removed,oh im sorry i didnt know giving an honest opinion wasnt allowed
creepyPMs,removed,here we can finally chat with those who know how uncomfortable some people make others agree with us to get that warm impression that we are right ftfy
creepyPMs,removed,oh yes please more of this i love strawmen
creepyPMs,removed,dont know what you expected using an app like that
creepyPMs,removed,how much was he paying lol
creepyPMs,removed,try hello next time you respond to variations of hello whatever ive read about online dating always states that a bland hello is the quickest route to no reply
creepyPMs,removed,tldr being poor sucks and makes people grow up stupid its really impressive how completely uneducated people can be especially if they grew up poor i work with a lot of people like that and some of them make this guy look like a poet i imagine if youre growing up and mom is fucked up all the time dads gone you get all your vitamins from faygo and doritoes you get your ass kicked every other day and every few months someone you know gets shot etc etc its probably pretty hard to pay attention in school or to give a shit why bother when youre just counting down the days until you can get a minimum wage job because thats about all you can hope for by the time youre old enough to think seriously about your future assuming youre even capable of expending that energy and assuming youve somehow figured out that you need more education despite having zero role models in your life the rich kids have been taking ap classes sat and act prep learning how to use computers etc for like a decade and where would the money come from in the first place
creepyPMs,removed,he was extremely polite and you were actually ruder to him adding you is weird but he might know someone in real life with the same name and genuinely got confused whilst that may be unlikely you just assumed he would be creepy and so this entire post is unjustified
creepyPMs,removed,i dont think this was negging or creepy looks like he was honestly trying to make a convo unless his list was offensive
creepyPMs,removed,sounds exactly like you have ihahfeateaedsbomatnfbt syndromei have a huge fucking ego and think everything and everyone does something because of me and think no further beyond that oh dont get me wrong guy sounds like a total loser has no idea how to talk to a girl negging gets by unnoticed in person basically and you only do it when you think the other person is a complete loser sorry to tell you op
creepyPMs,removed,pretty clear and obvious to me
creepyPMs,removed,my badi mean i should have realized this was a feminist group when women are surprised to be getting dick pics sent on a dating site as if it was the most surprising thing not to mention posting literal nudes and then being creeped when guys treat them like a girl who literally posts nudes for everyone to see
creepyPMs,removed,wow really sorry once again i mean i would hope i have other things to do besides offend a feminist
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair mistakes do happen and the hour gap could have been time differences and stuff dont assume that peson is a creep
creepyPMs,removed,seems to me like youre flattering yourself this same scenario occurred to me earlier today i accidentally added a girl i thought i went to hs with we were good friends but turns out it was someone completely different with the same lastname i normally laugh at all the nice guy posts on here but this one i think could genuinely be real and you cameoff like a bitch
creepyPMs,removed,thats right i forgot how no guys ever shave their back or shoulders or face to come off as clean or how many places of work force men to shave for work to give a professional look
creepyPMs,removed,i know im not supposed to but i always start feeling more sorry for the creepy guys as soon as someone messages them back the old selfrighteous have some respect for yourself and others routine
creepyPMs,removed,this cant be real
creepyPMs,removed,this may be me being a lesbianbut isnt all sperm the same
creepyPMs,removed,not to play the devils advocate but it kind of seems like he was going for is this ops number still robs number this senders number is still my number in case the person might have deleted their number or whatever else and he just made the emphasis weird obviously i dont know the guy if op says hes creepy hes probably creepy but this just seems like a poorly written text
creepyPMs,removed,how dare they not speak perfect english fuck having culture amirite
creepyPMs,removed,lol this sub cracks me up genuinely creppy pms and the other stuff like this sorry but you were just being needlessly hostile like seriously its like you have done your very best to try and find fault or some such nonsense lets break down his first msg compliment compliment compliment compliment compliment revealing something about himself mild self depricating tongue in cheek ref compliment question asking about a specific event invite to afore mentioned event you replied with no thank you no thank you to what going to gencon going on a date well its not overly clear because you are on a dating website looking for lurveso clearly a date is on the cards with someone his reply optimistic brushoff genuine opening question with all be it a little dig at your previous answer which tbf was cold so perhaps deserved your reply indignance cut down piss take cut down direct insult cut down and purposfully taking his words out of context cut down cutdown insult next message cut down now at this timehe really should have just nexted you and not wasted any more time talking to someone who is happy to act as much of a penis as you to a complete stranger human being at this point he is just msging you for the lols yet in your mind hes still trying it on lol hardly he doesnt ask you out again doesnt even hint at itand if you were not so cynical you could tell that what he is saying is actually completely true and noim not making excuses for the creep but i completely fail to see how this guy is being a creep you posted this with the title guy who wouldnt take no for an answer lol he totally didafter your msgany chances you had with that dude were gone lolthis is seriously misstitled correct title would be guy invites me to gencon i turn him down then he takes the piss out of me
creepyPMs,removed,i dunno if i turned down the women who hit on me so bluntly i would be called a bastard there is no need for it sometimes i wonder why people cant just be nice
creepyPMs,removed,lol
creepyPMs,removed,i would have been a lot more direct some people cant take hints over text especially if theyre horny
creepyPMs,removed,the comments on imgur are as retarded and stupid as ever almost funnier than the post itself
creepyPMs,removed,why this isnt even that creepy yall just got in an argument not really sure why this constitutes as creepy outside of a shitty pickup line and him talking about his job
creepyPMs,removed,do people actually do this weird roleplay sex shit yearning for your instruction what
creepyPMs,removed,i have but its ultra cringey and its
creepyPMs,removed,i mean you guys were both graphically bdsm roll playing something something pot something something kettle and all
creepyPMs,removed,so is he not down for picking cotton obligatory s because of vague sub rules
creepyPMs,removed,i have a good paying jobbut grand is grand
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair mansplaining is a pretty stupid thing to be mad about just because im a male i cant help you understand something if i have a better grasp of it
creepyPMs,removed,how red is your hair dye
creepyPMs,removed,this is the kind of stuff that makes people not take feminism seriously jfc
creepyPMs,removed,being offended by being called a female surely isnt going to help
creepyPMs,removed,lol ok
creepyPMs,removed,some of you have to admit its a little sexually confusing my lady bits are tingling its probably the whole punishing thing
creepyPMs,removed,oh no doubt its passive aggressive and annoying i can see how thats frustrating just not sure id say its creepy per se more frustrating but yes it is a matter of opinion
creepyPMs,removed,i know hes being a bit annoying but i cant help feeling bad for the guy
creepyPMs,removed,did u just assume soundclouds sexuality
creepyPMs,removed,im a sucker for cheesy id give him av chance but thats just me
creepyPMs,removed,its a really good thing to have a witness in any type of domestic abuse because emotions tend to cloud stories women are always the victim no matter the circumstances
creepyPMs,removed,wut
creepyPMs,removed,nobody speaks your weird language english please
creepyPMs,removed,i hate it when people send messages in ching chong speak like that out of times its a niggerfaggot
creepyPMs,removed,this looks like something a niggerfaggot would say
creepyPMs,removed,huh wheres racism im not too familiar with this
creepyPMs,removed,how does this post have so many up votes lol anyways glad youre safe next time dont wait to leave cause you might not make it out
creepyPMs,removed,forgive me if i was unfair to the wife beater but i wasnt trying to compare him to anyone his was the behavior of a crazy person
creepyPMs,removed,nearly everyone i know that isnt white loves it when we make racist jokes about them and they do the same thing to us
creepyPMs,removed,shouldve gone all the way and ended with was that over the rine
creepyPMs,removed,clearly a joke but a terrible way to open up a relationship maybe with your girlfriendboyfriend that you actually know but not a stranger
creepyPMs,removed,so your argument is its only illegal if its a highly active sub yea thats genius too there are plenty of active subs discussing illegal acts like zoophillia but i guess since those victims are voiceless its ok because noone speaks up great logic
creepyPMs,removed,if youre engaged why are you here
creepyPMs,removed,test
creepyPMs,removed,definitey dont see a creep i see you being a dick though as long as you get that karma right
creepyPMs,removed,he was rightshed annoy the hell out of me too
creepyPMs,removed,you shouldnt be surprised to get a response like that when youre tactless he was wrong saying what he said but you didnt need to be rude
creepyPMs,removed,this guy is a total fucking nutcase piece of shit if he is not a troll does he honestly think men should just go have sex with women they find attractive because animals do it and that a husband owns his wife what a piece of shit but i also dont understand why the op is acting like such a victim if you dont want to talk to him dont answer him you clearly wanted a response from him whether it be to post here or just to argue with him because that is entertaining sometimes since you kept answering him if you honestly felt so uncomfortable that it led to a bit of a breakdown why didnt you just block him some people on this sub need to calm down
creepyPMs,removed,hes proably trolling or hes a fucking dumb cunt who thinks it is funny
creepyPMs,removed,this could potentially dark joke they seem like friends
creepyPMs,removed,i have always said the mods on this sub do a great job and held this sub as an example of how a subreddit should be run but i hate this policy a lot i once posted on reuropean which i didnt even realize was a racist sub to call out a homophobe and immediately got banned from roffmychest the fact that i was grouped with a bunch of racists and treated the same way as if i was one of them was just upsetting second i was angry at the mods of that sub and now i think they are incompetent for having such a misguided unfair policy and worst it made me sympathize with the people on that sub who got banned from another sub for doing absolutely nothing wrong and i appealed the ban and was completely ignored presumably because i didnt state my case thoroughly enough or maybe didnt grovel enough even though i didnt break their subs rules by the way is this even in the rules of this sub that you cant post in those other subs even if i was unbanned why should i have to go through that effort to defend myself when i did nothing wrong what happened to innocent until proven guilty oh and another problem i have with this is just how spammy it is youre sending ban messages to thousands of people who dont even read this sub it is really abusive if i were running reddit i would never allow someone to run a bot that sends out so many ban messages for no reason and by the way did you ever consider that by banning these people youre just provoking them and giving them incentive to cause trouble on your sub when a lot of these people may not have even known or cared about this sub there are just so many things wrong with this
creepyPMs,removed,racist d
creepyPMs,removed,you certainly are revolted at him ego problem thats indian english
creepyPMs,removed,oh they probably wont rot prison has a way of exacting karma upon those depending on the crime
creepyPMs,removed,like httpiimgurcomfdeprhkpng
creepyPMs,removed,well in all fairness you seemed pretty mean after their first comment he sounded like he was just trying to be confidentwanting to know how he could improve his profile before you stopped talking
creepyPMs,removed,oh come on man im gonna assume he meant it as a joke i really really hope so anyway how can you massively fuck up a sure thing
creepyPMs,removed,he was some kind of arabic i hate to generalize because i know many muslim and arabic people that are wonderful but i think the quran is extremely sexist homophobic and dated and its awful that many middle eastern counties follow it as the law of the land
creepyPMs,removed,women who have sex with multiple partners arent sluts and slut shaming isnt cool
creepyPMs,removed,nope he was white maybe jewish doubt it though because jewish parents raise normal children
creepyPMs,removed,to be fair buzzfeed is somewhat cancer like not fullblown cancer but theres at least a couple tumors here or there
creepyPMs,removed,op never said he lived in the us though most countries in the world have a much lower age of consent
creepyPMs,removed,was that guy from a country where that behavior and idea might be considered okay otherwise i think hes a troll and you were the unlucky one he chose to play with
creepyPMs,removed,i guess it was a really misguided attempt at being flirty like hey youre so hot i totally want to rape you
creepyPMs,removed,nonnonbinary dimension genders genderstring theory
creepyPMs,removed,lol if someone says theyre only looking for indian men with a urine fetish everyone is aww thats nice you love whoever you want say youre only looking for a healthy fit conventionally attractive person of the same race and oh my god youre so shitty liberalism is a fucking joke now its the horseshoe theory in action circling back around to telling people who theyre allowed to want to fuck all over again i think thats way way shittier than someone who only wants to date redheads jesus fucking christ
creepyPMs,removed,if someone called me any internet insult in real life id feel extremely bad for them but thats why they are internet insults sorry if im responding to a really old post its a sticky thread and i cant find your post date on mobile
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not here for sex but do you likemy penis s maybe you should save the penis info for the thrid date atlest
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes big in australia
creepyPMs,not_removed,did he introduce himself with the wrong name
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry dude only micropenises turn me on is yours less than inch please send a timestamped picture and then we can discuss your penis further
creepyPMs,not_removed,my feet are big too but im not into the foot fet craze thats sweeping the planet i like playing with people who send me stuff like that its like earlier i saw someone on rokcupid get a message by someone saying i bet you would like to suck on my juicy cock yeah i like chicken too grilled usually
creepyPMs,not_removed,hm i want to tell this person that i have a big dick but i dont want to sound like a sick pervert so what can i do i know ill use toddler speak
creepyPMs,not_removed,third message maybe if you can hold off that long
creepyPMs,not_removed,no the right one that was my point that he didnt need to tell me his name i was splitting hairs on that just trying to be critical i guess he later clarified that some people use a fake name on tindr and so he was just telling me his name
creepyPMs,not_removed,two days later humiliation fetishists were politely lining up in front of her door
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh no no no no no no unanticipated outcome mission terminated
creepyPMs,not_removed,mission abort i repeat mission abort
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think those are the guys you tell youre into enormous balls and unless the diameter is at least inches its time to politely show them the door the ones that have enormous balls do they have the inch penises to go with it maybe an individualized response based on whatever they do have telling them youre only interested in the exact opposite
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow its not like you couldve been busy for hours
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha i like how he wrote high to indicate that hes just putting you on a pedestal and not saying you seem to be hallucinating either way im almost sure the overall experience was hallucinating ps foot fetishes seem to be on an all time high
creepyPMs,not_removed,what does the part in korean say this guy is a catch though he can even lick your feet if you want hed do even that for you its all for you its definitely not like its his fetish or anything also noble white girl like you op are u a knight
creepyPMs,not_removed,no mystery its bona fide funny
creepyPMs,not_removed,is he pointing up or doing asian eyes the second one wouldnt surprise me at this point tbh
creepyPMs,not_removed,almost makes me think of that hamster face shivers
creepyPMs,not_removed,it merely says chat request accepted it does that in the source language of the person that chatrequested me also yes noble white girl remember
creepyPMs,not_removed,﻿ｓｔｕｐｉｄ ｆｕｃｋｉｎｇ ｈａｍｓｔｅｒ ｆａｃｅ ´・ω・
creepyPMs,not_removed,´ ω but its so happy
creepyPMs,not_removed,should i confess to denko under the cherry blossoms
creepyPMs,not_removed,oooh girl ur so ethical show me all ur morals babii yassss cringe
creepyPMs,not_removed,is it too early in our new friendship to ask you to sit on my face oh gosh no sounds pretty standard for any new friendship s
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes almost a caricature of a creepy guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,when is it ever not too early in a friendship to ask someone to sit on your face
creepyPMs,not_removed,merchandise like in a bloody grocery store holy fucking hell
creepyPMs,not_removed,i saw your first response of kill yourself before reading what hed said and was like hmm that was harsh after reading the rest i realize youre absolutely right
creepyPMs,not_removed,on top of that i didnt even accept the guys friend request
creepyPMs,not_removed,erotic photos of cabbages
creepyPMs,not_removed,see that was his problem he was using the new friendship timeline rather than the new acquaintance timeline for when its appropriate to ask them to sit on your face it all makes sense now s
creepyPMs,not_removed,bahaha
creepyPMs,not_removed,hope youre into this but youre gonna force your fetish on her anyway asshole
creepyPMs,not_removed,be a good girl ugh no matter what else they say this is always the creepiest part to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,nah i think pretend killing you would be better so creepy whyyyy
creepyPMs,not_removed,yyrrggghhh puke
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont open with your fetish i feel like i say that a lot on here but good grief creeps ignore it so much and this is a fetish in which to begin with hes going to murder someone
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i dry retched at the end so sorry you had to deal with this op
creepyPMs,not_removed,ill be his safe word is murder
creepyPMs,not_removed,we may want to rethink that whole free speech thing id be ok if the government were to track this one down and do the chemical castration thing on him
creepyPMs,not_removed,why would someone lead off with that
creepyPMs,not_removed,serial killer alarm bells are ringing
creepyPMs,not_removed,you know choking is a weird universal sex act done in both vanilla and kinky relationships that is the most dangerous and widely used choking to those who research it can cause death even hours after the act i always tell people to read this because if you do and still want to do choking then you should win the darwin award for tempting death choking can cause cardiac arrests rupture of the windpipe fracture of the larynx damage to the blood vessels in the neck dislodging a fatty plaque in a neck artery which then travels to the brain and causes a stroke damage to the cervical spine seizures airway obstruction by the tongue and aspiration of vomitus there is a great deal of ignorance regarding what actually happens to a body when its suffocated or strangled and that the actual degree of risk associated with these practices is far greater than most people believe
creepyPMs,not_removed,complete asshole 😓
creepyPMs,not_removed,its such an uncle badtouch thing to say makes my skin crawl every time i see it or any variation on it
creepyPMs,not_removed,its so infantilizing and domineering and gross
creepyPMs,not_removed,i should have titled this be a good girl
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know i really dislike this it sounds like theyre talking to a dog or something it automatically makes me think that theyre really creepy and pervy and gross
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh yeah baby end my life god help this guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,it sucks done with posting for this and so many other creepy pmsi could post for months sadly
creepyPMs,not_removed,imagine how i felt 😖
creepyPMs,not_removed,they probably are
creepyPMs,not_removed,true at least its a warning to stay away
creepyPMs,not_removed,no one likes boring people and even though hes boring you should give him a chance anyway good logic dude
creepyPMs,not_removed,his daytime secret is sending long rambling messages to people who he finds attractive on facebook nothing mysterious and sexy just pathetic
creepyPMs,not_removed,by day a secret unemployed andor drug dealer that was my experience on dating apps
creepyPMs,not_removed,reverse batman
creepyPMs,not_removed,so he loves your profile that he admits he should have paid more attention to but he loves your profile
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats exactly what i thought
creepyPMs,not_removed,i totally get that i would just say retail instead of the company i work for if someone gave me a general description education medical field science restaurant industry etc they were usually legit it was the dudarinos who said their job was a secret that usually told me later they sold weed lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,so yes wont oh okay good point
creepyPMs,not_removed,he writes like an indian pineapple
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know why but this guy made me weirdly angry
creepyPMs,not_removed,well he does have a point being a bitch wont get anyone far just look at him
creepyPMs,not_removed,lmao was he assuming you slept in the streets wtf
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think youre cute enough to be an even bigger bitch master of compliments
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah and you the creep not op are too entitled for a stranger
creepyPMs,not_removed,so thirsty
creepyPMs,not_removed,he wasnt naked in that one pic but its still kinda gross
creepyPMs,not_removed,hi ive removed your post for containing identifying info could you edit out the guys face and his name and reupload or edit the post thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,reuploaded
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats my main fear of craigslist too many creeps and fakes i feel for you op
creepyPMs,not_removed,i find it funny when people hit on you and then when you say youre not interested they then make a big deal about how they didnt find you attractive in the first place and arent interested they clearly were otherwise they wouldnt have messaged the only purpose for having a hissy fit like that has is for them to feel better about their ego what a weirdo
creepyPMs,not_removed,its bad enough hes on there braging about trying to seduce straight men but then goes on to brag about doing it with married men that doesnt make you more desirable it makes you a fucking home wrecker among other things its like he thought somehow telling you how much other men wanted him would make you change your mind good call op id say this guy has a huge chip on his shoulder
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol thanks never used it before but thought to give it a shot i posted pretty tame ad just asking if anyone wanted to go get a drink or go out for the night and got this
creepyPMs,not_removed,i agree completely and then to be a middle aged guy responding to an ad for women on top of it makes it so much worse
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah thats ridiculous dude
creepyPMs,not_removed,there have been far too many rule breaks in this thread please keep httpswwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules in mind before commenting thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,the ones that pretend they dont care while sending a stream of messages are the funniest along with the ones that compliment you on your looks and then switch to calling you unattractive when you turn them down hey look at that this guy falls in both groups
creepyPMs,not_removed,we had talked for a bit and then he sent me that poetic cringe fest so i lost interest and stopped answering
creepyPMs,not_removed,and still havent unmatched me creeplogic its her responsibility to control my bad behavior
creepyPMs,not_removed,how fare thee o lovely maiden of unsurpassed beauty and virtue
creepyPMs,not_removed,til that rejecting someone turns you from lovely maiden to deadbeat mom s
creepyPMs,not_removed,its incredible the amount of tantrumthrowing some of these guys will do after being rejected just so they can try and patch up their bruised ego and by incredible i mean sad
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love how every rejected man always has to go after your looks
creepyPMs,not_removed,that first message was so fucking cringey who even thinks to type that to someone
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy teenage tantrum batman
creepyPMs,not_removed,i thought vogan poetry was bad
creepyPMs,not_removed,aww thinks hes not a loser
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit its like a look inside a thesis on fragile ego
creepyPMs,not_removed,beauty unsurpassed and virtuous so ey ma what that mouf do tho
creepyPMs,not_removed,every time i read one of these exchanges where you can watch a guy spiral into a tailspin of selfdoubt and anger i cant help but think how lucky the recipient was to avoid a relationship with future trips to the emergency room for running into a door knob
creepyPMs,not_removed,amazing what is wrong with people
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey at least hes for the greater good s
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre supposed to learn how to handle rejection in high school i know it still hurts but lashing back helps the situation precisely of the time the right thing to do is to just move on without being a jerk or a baby about it what a dweeb
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was used to being unmatched being blocked being hung up on so he demands you do it first because its his way of trying to control things and make himself feel like he wanted it this way very sad
creepyPMs,not_removed,fleksy is best keyboard
creepyPMs,not_removed,not related but does avocado bubble tea actually exist and is it good
creepyPMs,not_removed,the greater good
creepyPMs,not_removed,that reminds me of
creepyPMs,not_removed,average looking deadbeat mom is a pretty good name for a punk band
creepyPMs,not_removed,men are so god damn sensitive
creepyPMs,not_removed,rniceguys rjustneckbeardthings
creepyPMs,not_removed,not related but what keyboard is that it looks really nice
creepyPMs,not_removed,meh my tea is better than yours
creepyPMs,not_removed,sweet thanks ill check it out
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,tip tip tip mlady
creepyPMs,not_removed,remember though women are the ones who are hysterical and the only ones i feel a little bad knowing probably none of these guys had decent father figures to teach them what being a man means
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should have started flirting with him after all those hateful messages he would have immediately changed his tone then shoot him down again and watch him become bitter and just rinse and repeat these guys embarrass me
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,there was more after this but it was very redundant so i didnt post it where he just starts giving himself ego rubs
creepyPMs,not_removed,this made me literally snort and laugh out loud
creepyPMs,not_removed,perfection
creepyPMs,not_removed,nice one
creepyPMs,not_removed,im moved by this
creepyPMs,not_removed,it must be horrible for you fair juliet to deal with awful poetic idiots i bet being so cringeworthy what a lout so er yeah wanna go out
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would lose interest too it comes off as riamverysmart sub
creepyPMs,not_removed,what are those lives you keep saying people have and how do i get one without leaving my basement sanctuary of dorito wank stains
creepyPMs,not_removed,thy fedora tipith for thou
creepyPMs,not_removed,its science
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think he knows what maiden means
creepyPMs,not_removed,she didnt even reject him properly like omg wtf is wrong with her i bet shes too busy working jobs and looking after her kids while blowing dudes on her break for drugs s
creepyPMs,not_removed,well its all they value so they assume thats all that anyone values
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know if it makes me shallow but i was dating a guy who discovered or was hiding it until after a few dates this way of texting and promptly broke it off i cringed every time he texted me and still do when i think of some of the gems he sent my guess is theyve watched a few too many disney movies and think they need to be a romantic prince charming when theyre just repellant
creepyPMs,not_removed,niiicccccee
creepyPMs,not_removed,im a nice guy as long as you do exactly what i want and even if you do ill find a reason to take my anger and insecurities out on you
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh yeah hes all about that which is why he told her she was belowaverage looking and called her a deadbeat mom smh
creepyPMs,not_removed,so was grindlewald and we all saw how that turned out
creepyPMs,not_removed,a few messages later he tried to apologize
creepyPMs,not_removed,i kinda got that which is why i just left him talking to himself
creepyPMs,not_removed,it does and its amazing
creepyPMs,not_removed,its the best ever
creepyPMs,not_removed,fleksy its really awesome makes typing really easy
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe slightly but i think at that point i was annoyed about his inability to understand social cues
creepyPMs,not_removed,ehhh it wouldnt have been that hard but then again it isnt that hard to act like an adult either so
creepyPMs,not_removed,removed for violating rule read the rules before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,this place is full of posts here where guys heap abuse on the woman because they did reply with polite not interested that happens enough times and you just stop replying if you are going to get verbal abused hurled at you either way may as well pick the option that requires less effort
creepyPMs,not_removed,removed for violating rule
creepyPMs,not_removed,removed for violating rule read the rules before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,it seemed like you gave us a good idea of what this guy was about you were right to post just the two pictures
creepyPMs,not_removed,boo body shaming
creepyPMs,not_removed,if i say no are you going to insult me too
creepyPMs,not_removed,what is wrong with me that i cant figure out the poem where is it
creepyPMs,not_removed,subs i didnt know i needed
creepyPMs,not_removed,that was one of my favorite episodes of mr wizard
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah the issue is charming phillip eric etc were genuinely nice to their princesses and showed courtesy and a guy who puts you in a pedestal is doing neither of these things
creepyPMs,not_removed,probably makes you shallow but i definitely cant blame you its too much
creepyPMs,not_removed,well youre not even attractive anyway i wouldnt ever go out with you even if you payed me youre below me you know that
creepyPMs,not_removed,forget this white it would only be right to give me a chance you dont even know em and i wrote this poem so please let me get in them pants
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah but that mlady shit was totally this guys fault and if youre going to make things awkward you cant really blame someone for backing away
creepyPMs,not_removed,d
creepyPMs,not_removed,well technically she is in the middle of you
creepyPMs,not_removed,blame the dude from the original post because of him my vagina is forever shut down
creepyPMs,not_removed,im kidding bbz come here
creepyPMs,not_removed,im birthing her
creepyPMs,not_removed,all of your comments have been removed for violating rule do not comment with any more rule breaks
creepyPMs,not_removed,well i am a glutton for punishment
creepyPMs,not_removed,i tried being nice i tried being mean why wont you love me
creepyPMs,not_removed,ill get the whip
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre putting op on trial and sympathizing with the creep please message us via modmail if you have any questions about a comment removal
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really dont get it i mean fine some guy doesnt want to date single mothers thats his issue but why would you display such hatred and contempt on your profile also he acts like widows arent a thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,he expresses a strange balance of responsibility here that i dont quite get he wants a woman who is a crazy fun wild kitten in private at the same time he derides women who dont know how to use protection and get pregnant somewhere in this whole process a dude is involved unintended pregnancy is a two person act it is true that there is a biological disparity in the consequences of unintended pregnancy but it is not as though this is a secret to anyone there seems little point in lamenting that i guess what im getting at is that a single mother can be the result of a dude who cant use protection correctly or scarpers when the pregnancy arises from an act that can cause pregnancy you cant know what their situation is at a glance so why the overarching criticism to be totally forthright i am behind a single mother is a deal breaker thats a person comfort and life goal thing no matter their reason for it but putting people on blast with generalizations and rude behavior is just no good and having someone who wants a wild kitten message you with this sort of thing is wellrude and creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love how he just assumed single mothers couldnt keep the father of their children like damn i should tell my boyfriend his mom could control his dads cancer
creepyPMs,not_removed,high eq
creepyPMs,not_removed,god damn it stop with the stereotypes already aaaargh so irritating edit the irony he wants someone with a high eq aka emotional intelligence pretty sure his is negative
creepyPMs,not_removed,how to be a lady in public telling women how to act is not something you do in the current century
creepyPMs,not_removed,dude wants to talk about getting off high horses maybe he should stop judging people over situations he knows nothing about
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am so fucking confused im just baffled that he thinks his profile will work no sane person would look at that and say yep he seems like a winner people like this exist what the fuck
creepyPMs,not_removed,even if his views were not abhorrent the fact that he thinks its acceptable to flood ops inbox with pompous lectures is enough of a deal breaker can you imagine what a mansplainer hed be on a date ugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow what a fucking dimwit
creepyPMs,not_removed,i once had a guy message me on okc to let me know that he had no intention of being sloppy seconds to my kid which aside from the ick phrasing was baffling maybe just pass on the profile and dont send a message
creepyPMs,not_removed,he had some points which i might concede like how sad it is knowing that you take the risk of loving a child as your own who if you and the parent break up youll never see again but the whole thing swerved wildly away and into total asshole territory with all the insults and vitriol he spewed my mother is a single mother and it was not because she was not good enough to keep my father it was because he didnt want or deserve to be my father he still doesnt and youre fucking right that her child comes first what the hell kind of mother would put a boyfriend before her own flesh and blood what kind of man would want to date and potentially reproduce with a mother who would do that what kind of man would have the arrogance and audacity to demand that she do that would he want to have kids with someone he knew would put someone else before her kids wellbeing scratch that of course he would if it were him she put before them my mother would never put a man before us and i have always loved admired and respected her for that fuck this selfish narcissistic prick oh my god sorry he struck a nerve
creepyPMs,not_removed,totally feeling that awesome energy he reportedly spreads around him
creepyPMs,not_removed,gtfo seriously dude a mother who puts her child first has an attitude i cant even wrap my head around this
creepyPMs,not_removed,heres to hoping this nitwit never reproduces
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think i ran into this guys spiritual sibling on fetlife when i was a single quiche you have my sympathy
creepyPMs,not_removed,a crazy fun wild kitten in private
creepyPMs,not_removed,damn i think hes angry that someone he dislikes who is also a single mother is in a happy relationship and hes not im guessing an ex either way this screams that he has baggage and tons of issues
creepyPMs,not_removed,please can we all work together to define high eq
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a fucking asshat
creepyPMs,not_removed,he got burned by single mother because she wouldnt make him her priority because she has a small helpless human being to raise and hes so entitled and narcissistic that it filled him with rage that a woman would dare prioritize someone else other than him and still hasnt been able to mature enough to get over it so hes trying to pushing all the single mothers by loudly declaring he refuses to date them single mothers everywhere breathe a sigh of relief
creepyPMs,not_removed,i completely back this single parents or coparents are not in my top list because im not at all ready for kids my friends that are with people with children get really stressed about it especially if the other parent is being an asshole its a big commitment you cant just walk into a kids life and then fuck off its confusing and hurtful because they dont understand i wouldnt go for single parents for that reason im not child orientated i try to amuse them and talk to them and often i get a positive reaction and thats awesome but theyre so little and impressionable it would kill me to think a kid could be hurt in the process of a relationship not working as i mentioned above my mum raised me but my dad when he came back to our hometown was such a serial dater some would be there a week some were longer and one he almost married but he introduced me to every single one and i was so so confused as to why they wre there one minute and gone the next its s serous commitment to make because a parent and child are a package deal you dont get to ignore their kid and just be with them the kid is number one because they are a child people feeling threatened or in competition with children reeeeeally need to reevaluate their life choices
creepyPMs,not_removed,right this makes me so angry what about the widows of fallen soldiers law enforcement officers or firefighters should they be shamed as well fucking dick
creepyPMs,not_removed,emotional intelligence its like iq but with reading people good communication and being empathic instead of traditional book learning i find it amusing that hes looking for someone with high eq but has none himself
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,i guess he was defending himself but it really was unnecessary im not a single mother and i didnt ask for or hint that i wanted an explanation
creepyPMs,not_removed,he launched right into it as well you dont answer then ill insult your honourable intentions thatll teach you as if she was going to reply oh my god youre right my bad
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah like im passing on this but you have to know exactly why i am passing on it immediately uhm no just dont click the fucking profile
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know its so awesome it makes me want to gouge my eyes out after reading that
creepyPMs,not_removed,so whats dating like as a quiche if you dont mind me asking
creepyPMs,not_removed,they are selfish narcissistic and neurotic i wont get started at how wrong it is to judge someones character based on that they are a mother but then again i shouldnt be the one to talk after all i personally judged you as the filth of human society there is nothing wrong with choosing to avoid them indeed there is nothing wrong with choosing to avoid them you can avoid the single mothers as much as the entire female populace should avoid you to dodge this bullet edit
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment has been removed in accordance with httpiimgurcomvkforaspng httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah im guessing he probably had a really bad experience and has just decided to write off all single mothers hes so im guessing in his age group there are probably a lot of single mothers online dating i could see how it would be hard to meet people and get out especially if the kids are young online is pretty ideal and he has obviously reached breaking point
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is what i dont get i just got out of a long relationship with a mother who has a fantastic son hes a bonus not a piece of baggage this kind of person would be an absolutely awful stepfather yes the kid always comes first and yes sometimes thats hard but people have priorities and a child should be both peoples priority or they have no business raising that child
creepyPMs,not_removed,or even single mothers that are survivors of an abusive relationship holy shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,are you really sure he didnt just mistype iq and never notice because lets be honest he didnt seem like the smartest guy on the interwebs
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes a narcissist looking for narcissistic supply he wants someone super caring because he gets angry if his ego isnt placated
creepyPMs,not_removed,came here to say this no eq at all
creepyPMs,not_removed,okay because in my head the only eq is everquest
creepyPMs,not_removed,its under nine thousaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
creepyPMs,not_removed,so you arent even a single mom but he still lost his shit about single moms at you thats fucked up also his characterizations of single moms and their kids is laughable i know a number of guys who married a woman with kids and ended up adopting them so he could enjoy all the rights that come with being a kids dad
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dunno he struck me as the sort of blowhard that lectures people especially women at the slightest opportunity
creepyPMs,not_removed,when of course the correct response is either tldr or k cant decide which one would make his brain explode faster
creepyPMs,not_removed,hit or miss and wobbly
creepyPMs,not_removed,wowzers im glad you quoted that because its gone thankfully thats so fucking gross calling all single mothers selfish and narcissistic and neurotic found the creep edit to mention i applaud your entire comment hes going to need an ambulance directly to the burn unit
creepyPMs,not_removed,i find it really funny ie not funny but disgusting how so many men will pester a woman if shes been burned by men and doesnt want to date any but will freak out and go full postal after heartbreak men are so fragile
creepyPMs,not_removed,i personally wouldnt be that great of a step mother and my dad dating random people and then them disappearing was confusing as a kid however if i loved someone and they had a kid then you make it work i know im not really child orientated so it wouldnt exactly put me off but i would think seriously about it if it arose of course their child would be more important its their own flesh and blood they fucking birthed that kid and anyone should be happy or respectful of the fact that she was trying to do the right thing in a difficult circumstance single parents have to work harder to fill the role of two people my mother raised me when my dad left and she always tried her best to make me happy when she met someone when i was around he was young like and he didnt bat an eyelid he jumped into the role of dad and did an amazing job i never felt in competition for affection or care because they both worked hard to make the best of it yes my dad left but not once in my childhood with my nonbio dad did i feel out of place or anything but completely loved i understand very well that people have preferences year old guys probably wouldnt immediately jump at a single mother aged with a small child but you know what he was in love with her and i came with her as a package deal in my opinion my non bio dad showed more maturity at than this guy in his amount of years on this planet make it work for fucks sake its not a difficult thing to not fill your online dating profile with such an aggressive atatement im not a single mother but if i saw that shit id be swiping the fuck left so fast what woman would want to be with such a horrible judgmental human being its an instant turn off
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes absolutely but of course he seems the type that would blame her for the abuse maybe if you would have donenot done a b and c he wouldnt have hit you
creepyPMs,not_removed,i guess its possible but whos to know the only person that knows what he meant is him and i aint about to go ask him
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly exactly
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you for sharing my sentiment ♥
creepyPMs,not_removed,that was my stepdad and thank god for him too he was easily more my father than my biological douchbag father
creepyPMs,not_removed,well it i like to think his head imploded
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats two removed comments lets keep it at two shall we please read the subreddit rules and have a think on them from the daughter of a single mother
creepyPMs,not_removed,in my experience i tend to agree i think its to do with the ego being so breakable hes obviously been told hes special all his life that he doesnt have to actually work to get somewhere romantically he doesnt have to respect anyone because he should automatically have women falling at his feet and shock horror women are actual human beings and perhaps dont appreciate the lack of respect and maybe just maybe wanted some sort of equal footing or maybe hes a fucking man child who felt a woman raising a child by herself should put him before her kid i cant understand how people are actually like this i want to push them down a fucking well
creepyPMs,not_removed,or you know treat women like shit because they are fearful of certain situations or intrustng towards them due to a significant a ount of experience with harassers or untrustworthy people or abusers with their notallmenz bullshit and getting angry over women expressing discontent with such shit as street catcalling seeharassment etc but holy shit a wittle babyboy gets rejected by a girl once and its just so hard to be a man amd you crazy bitches just dont know what its like
creepyPMs,not_removed,im also not a mother and i would also be swiping left also your non bio dad sounds just like my grandfather
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is fucking beautiful if youll pardon my enthusiasm thank you so much for sharing that story
creepyPMs,not_removed,i made the mistake of showing this to my boyfriend and his responses are killing me send halp oh im sorry that your mommy and daddy had such a perfect marriage that resulted in your idiocy your parents must be so proud of you wow your dad must be so happy he stayed in your life
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow this guy you really got to him i think he just cant let it go can he
creepyPMs,not_removed,how could you not fall for him after seeing that totally real message that a woman definitely sent him s
creepyPMs,not_removed,unebelkrone did you really need to add that edit
creepyPMs,not_removed,i owe that man everything my ethics my morals my empathy and my compassion i havent seen him since i was the man my mother married told him he wasnt welcome without my knowledge and i lost the best person in my life one day ill get enough courage to find him and contact him to tell him how important he was to me and your grandad sounds lovely its nice when family members step up and try to make you the happiest they can i dont think theyll ever know how much they mean no words can accurately explain it but just having them there is all you ever need x
creepyPMs,not_removed,i appreciate the enthusiasm i feel pretty proud that i had that man in my life to raise me ill always be grateful for that and i dont mind sharing i love talking about when i was that age it was a good time
creepyPMs,not_removed,clearly i did he even updated his to take a few digs at me guess hes not drowning in women as much as he claims if one person can get his panties in such a twist
creepyPMs,not_removed,whispers innocently i absolutely do not know what you are talking about wait huh ah you can talk
creepyPMs,not_removed,just had another thought i gotta wonder now how much of the text in his profile is in response to other specific rejections
creepyPMs,not_removed,and he has no clue at all about how transparent he is
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cant see anyone jumping on his pennis after reading that train wreck
creepyPMs,not_removed,waaat
creepyPMs,not_removed,what in the fuck is this even
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes i think youre right surely he must know that hes driving any woman who could potentially be interested in him away though why would he think its appealing to have a big rant about women who have rejected him as his bio on a dating site
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh that typo made me laugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats the bot
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have no words
creepyPMs,not_removed,cash up front
creepyPMs,not_removed,so like a cam girl
creepyPMs,not_removed,ha it doesnt say in my instagram profile if youre interested in buying pics dm me 😐
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cant screenshot on that phone lol backstory we fell off as friends because we would argue a lot he has no self awareness always emotionally unstable and would constantly tell me whats wrong with me all i did was be by his side and listen to his problems and if i gave any sort of advice he would trip especially when i suggested he work on himself instead of blaming others all the time i ended up telling him to no longer speak to me he would just call me immature dumb and so on i blocked of his numbers and he would just text me from another one or message me on snapchat saying im a immature for not wanting to talk about it he saw me sunday at a bar and again texted me from another number he said you cant be mad at me forever you cant be mad i finally replied i can im disappointed then he became angry that im disappointed and that i shouldnt reach out to him without an explanation he fucks with my head he wants to be in control of everything i cant deny him he has to deny me it seriously creeps me out that someone can mentally be like this
creepyPMs,not_removed,first you cant be mad forever deserves a youre right i just dont care anymore go away second as has been said but just to solidify the point hes a douche keep him blocked and go out and do something nice for yourself because you are awesome tell him to kilgrave someone else
creepyPMs,not_removed,ignore him either he is unintentionally rationalizing his continued attempts to talk to you by thinking that youre initiating which is both charitable and more likely ir hes being deliberately manipulative either way he probably isnt going to stop so the only way to end it is stop engaging with him particularly because youve indicated that you argue with him a lot he likely enjoys it or sees it as an excuse to continue do not try to engage him in oneupsmanship you might win the battle but you will lose the war if your goal is to stop this person from reducing the quality of your life your course of action is clear pretend to be a brick wall mimic a rock he will get bored and leave
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank goodness he added period at the end so now you know he means business
creepyPMs,not_removed,some people with huge egos just do theese crazy mental gymnastics to warp their memories into thinking they are the upper person i believe the guy that it is you who reaches out to him i believe him that he believes it is you feel sad for him 😢
creepyPMs,not_removed,so things i can see most of their phone number probably should be hidden better as per rules a screenshot would be easier on the eyes but thats low priority
creepyPMs,not_removed,he is an emotional vampire he will feed on you for as much as you let him you know what to do with toxic people
creepyPMs,not_removed,we fell off as friends because we would argue a lot he has no self awareness always emotionally unstable and would constantly tell me whats wrong with me all i did was be by his side and listen to his problems and if i gave any sort of advice he would trip i ended up telling him to no longer speak to me he would just call me immature dumb and so on omg i have experienced this exact same thing except in my case im a guy and the other person was a girl i cant tell how many times i considered posting screenshots of our chat over here held back for some reason i guess a part of me didnt want to let others think ill about someone i liked as a friend for a long time but i dont think i care anymore ill just go ahead and post them
creepyPMs,not_removed,a fellow dinosaur user also yeah thats creepy as hell ive known a few people like that they always just feel off
creepyPMs,not_removed,now that you said it i just realised how this sub is a scary reminder of how many people would be kilgrave shamelesly given the opportunity
creepyPMs,not_removed,kilgrave
creepyPMs,not_removed,bonus points if you ignore him completely properly hell lose his fucking mind it will be delicious
creepyPMs,not_removed,its actually moved in patches so whatever number you do make out aint real cause its not in order also in my note i say i cant screenshot on that phone
creepyPMs,not_removed,yea i mean as their friend you kind of deal with it for awhile because thats what friends do but when you step back and look it at it it is a creepy mental fuck it makes me anxious thinking about it
creepyPMs,not_removed,please post op and send a link here
creepyPMs,not_removed,jessica jones reference kilgrave is the baddy he has mind control powers and is very manipulative and abusive
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh and i noticed the thing about screenshots after i posted my bad
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am sorry you had to go through that stuff like that never makes me anxious but i can understand how you must have felt when this girl went full on crazy at first i found it amusing then eventually it became annoying i didnt respond for a long time but when i did the first thing i said was ask her to not embarrass herself cause essentially that was what she was doing im glad you posted its good to let it out get over these and move on
creepyPMs,not_removed,waswas that last image he sent you can that even count as a meme intended to be proof that white girls love him
creepyPMs,not_removed,having not realised that there were pictures involved the first screen shot left me with mild emotional trauma such sad times
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit thats a rough
creepyPMs,not_removed,jfc clearly younger ppl arent the only ones who take too many selfies
creepyPMs,not_removed,whered the second guy come from
creepyPMs,not_removed,is it just me or does that first pic make him look like jayz face wise
creepyPMs,not_removed,well you tried
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had some guy do almost the same exact thing to me a few years ago i told him to go ahead and send me a few pictures i used them to find his facebook profile and sent the pms to his wife never heard from him again after that
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is just horrible to me so he can respect the way you feel about it but what about his so no respect for her obviously ugh disgusting
creepyPMs,not_removed,im the type who gets all the information i can on guys like this and finds their wives on facebook
creepyPMs,not_removed,super intimate message and then gives the name weird
creepyPMs,not_removed,eh some people in open relationships prefer discretion and to appear monogamous being nonmonogamous and out about it can have potential career and social consequences guessing thats not the case here and even if it were its still a creepy opening message
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is from okcupid ive met some nice dudes in it but once in a while you get gems like these
creepyPMs,not_removed,nah i think theres enough salt in his butthurt to salinate of the lakes in minnesota
creepyPMs,not_removed,they say the dead sea became the dead sea from his tears alone
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not salty you are bitch s
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont believe it just scroll through his comments and see for yourself p
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre the puppet
creepyPMs,not_removed,no youre the youre the puppet
creepyPMs,not_removed,its like polite conversation to this guy is just the id you flash really quickly before shoving into the door
creepyPMs,not_removed,no idea how youre single i bet no one ever says that to him
creepyPMs,not_removed,was having a polite conversation about my dance hobby and then i got caught up with some family stuff so i hadnt checked in for hours got this response this morning and been laughing since apparently my butt should be in a relationship maybe not the rest of me xd
creepyPMs,not_removed,she doesnt seem interested two days later maybe if i talk about her butt shell want me
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had no idea that good butts relationships is that the foundation for a good one s
creepyPMs,not_removed,no idea how your single what your single butt twerks your single moon shines i need to know how that sentence ends punctuation makes all the difference guys learn how to use it
creepyPMs,not_removed,did anyone else start off thinking of the movie tango and cash or just me
creepyPMs,not_removed,ಠಠ y tho
creepyPMs,not_removed,i bet he still wonders why though
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahahaha
creepyPMs,not_removed,the foundation of any person is the butt when sitting of course lmao
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats not technically punctuation just use of the wrong youryoure although youre does have an apostrophe in it
creepyPMs,not_removed,actually dat ass is what allowed early humans to survive and advance because the large rear muscles allowed cavemen more walking stamina than any other animal prey might be able to outrun them in the short term but the booty allowed humans to walk for hours eventually catching up to their hunt
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey now come on op youre not an abomination just your beliefs are
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol i dont even specify my beliefs this kid was too much his profile pic was kinda scary too not even a hint of a smile swoon of course im only looking for friends
creepyPMs,not_removed,i did report him 👍
creepyPMs,not_removed,keep plugging away someone will want the harsh response
creepyPMs,not_removed,my actual life i feel mildly bad about it but i just dont respond when im positive that were not compatible at all if youre very conservativetraditional very religious or very country youre not going to like me at all and im doing you a favor haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,ok at least he didnt ask for nudes i figured that was coming next
creepyPMs,not_removed,that wasnt too bad at least i expected some metal hardcore insults from him after you told him what you were looking for
creepyPMs,not_removed,shh he might hear you and realize theres an unexplored option

creepyPMs,not_removed,im not asking this as any sort of attack on you im genuinely curious if theres something more than just the two pictures you posted because all im seeing is one person inviting you for a drink before having you in their home or studio for several hours and another one using an emoticon and somehow those things imply that they want to have sex with you how is that the case im really trying to understand
creepyPMs,not_removed,or course if youre naked in the same room as them you wont be able to help but have sex with them s idk if thats the modeling theyyou were thinking of but considering what sub were on im guessing that was where they were going at least
creepyPMs,not_removed,i came here to ask exactly this
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry to disappoint you and unoollab but the ops comment karma somehow tells me you shouldnt expect a reply that link karma though o
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus isnt the whole point of bumble to make it so women have to contact the men first
creepyPMs,not_removed,in before someone else names him merv the perv
creepyPMs,not_removed,im actually thinking of contacting his company and making them aware of his inappropriate behavior thoughts
creepyPMs,not_removed,geez dude do you want a professional relationship or a romantic one pick one
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should prob jump his bones he bothered to actually read before he scrolled through your pics so clearly hes an intellectual
creepyPMs,not_removed,change the m to a p
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would have swiped left anyways
creepyPMs,not_removed,and so the woman actually indicates interest before the guy freaks out on her
creepyPMs,not_removed,id never heard of bumble before figured it was a workplace collab app or something based on the context im so out of touch
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive contacted several recruiting agencies to please stop contacting me at email addresses and phones i never posted publicly or provided and this is so much worse id personally hit the company up especially if he emailed from a work account or cited his employer
creepyPMs,not_removed,id do it ask his employer if they normally encourage their recruiters to online stalk dating profiles of attractive candidates and if so how they ensure that theres not the blatant appearance of a prid pro quo situation would he ignore reporting other qualified candidates if you go out in a date with him etc im guessing the company would be none too pleased but hey im guessing he has some industry contracts hell be fiiiiinnnne
creepyPMs,not_removed,do you really wanna have to be involved with this dude in any way in the future its a risk youd be taking honestly id advise against you could develop yourself a fullyfledged vindictive stalker if hes the unbalanced sort hes already easily found you on linkedin if he could find ways to make your life hell he might be one of those guys whod do it in retaliation for reporting him to an employer
creepyPMs,not_removed,i couldnt work it out
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre out of touch i cant even figure out which mode of communication he used to send her this message
creepyPMs,not_removed,why did he say she can do it
creepyPMs,not_removed,these kinds of posts give me flashbacks to an ex boyfriend of mine
creepyPMs,not_removed,bae please die as a word please please please
creepyPMs,not_removed,why did he say any of the stuff he spewed really
creepyPMs,not_removed,how can she slap
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have an online friend who would frequently start msging me with there she is until i told him to stop it i dont know why but i find that really creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,bae lol d ttyl useavarg she can do it yeah idk what that was all about wayy to clingy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i always tell my friends that if i hear them use the word bae they better mean bacon and eggs
creepyPMs,not_removed,reasons beyond our comprehension
creepyPMs,not_removed,find out next week on mystery hunters
creepyPMs,not_removed,rofl yeeeess
creepyPMs,not_removed,garage door g door if you werent sure
creepyPMs,not_removed,wtf kind of profile picture is that
creepyPMs,not_removed,actually my is my yes yes and i sometimes dress it up in tuxedo and have snack time with it
creepyPMs,not_removed,did this motherfucker really just call it a no no
creepyPMs,not_removed,wait you mentioned playing xbox and hes asking if you used that word to refer to your vulva 😳
creepyPMs,not_removed,a literal manbaby what the fuck 😂
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol i didnt think id done that great a job but i actually stuck that on there to cover his face
creepyPMs,not_removed,my mom and i call the vagina a nono square sometimes because we think its hilarious its weird to see someone else say it in a serious tone
creepyPMs,not_removed,hhow would anyone even make that mistake oh i love to play my xbox and i play thisthisthis oh she like her xbox i bet she loves to show people too s
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh lol well you did a good enough job to trick me
creepyPMs,not_removed,you fooled me i saw the pic and grimaced because i thought it was going to be another sordid tale to put into the let me tell you about my fetish oh you didnt ask too bad file
creepyPMs,not_removed,im stealing that
creepyPMs,not_removed,box is slang for vagina so like it kind of make sense but its still ridiculously presumptuous to think thats what someone would mean by xbox
creepyPMs,not_removed,i thought the same wondering if the guy was baby huey
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus someone call the fucking fire department that was a thing of beauty op
creepyPMs,not_removed,amazing comebackshut him down quick good job op
creepyPMs,not_removed,was the head of cadburys also disappointed
creepyPMs,not_removed,chocolate eggs i dont get it
creepyPMs,not_removed,well played
creepyPMs,not_removed,perhaps he works for cadburys thats my guess anyway
creepyPMs,not_removed,confusion is the best repellent
creepyPMs,not_removed,eww
creepyPMs,not_removed,did he mean no
creepyPMs,not_removed,just curious and honestly not trying to a shitstorm but why are dude selfies so frowned upon i mean girls sometimes do bikini photos and whatnot is it that he took the time to oil up and find some angle or just basic that guys probably really narcissistic or is this something that should be a private photo like a girlfriend sending a personal naughty photo
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes horny
creepyPMs,not_removed,i always wanted to see a smiling face in guys pics why because when we go on dates im not going to sit across from him and gaze longingly into his abs im not going to light up when he gives me a flash of his pectorals if i was just out for a casual hookup i might not be interested in much more than a guys body still a good face is necessary as its still not acceptable to ask a guy to please wear this bag on his head while we bang thanks but in someone i want a relationship with the body is secondary really
creepyPMs,not_removed,you mean with or without the opener of horny the context makes a big difference
creepyPMs,not_removed,my take in general with these types of pics is that this dude is so self centred that he can literally only think of the type of picture hed want to receive and has no concept of what anyone other than him would want to seehear from a stranger or he has nothing else to offer he wants to see oily topless chicks so all chicks must want want to see oily topless men it just reeks of desperation mixed with ego and ignorance not a turn on for me at least
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean id feel the same way about girl bikini photos a mix of reeks of desperation inflated ego and photo inappropriate for venue
creepyPMs,not_removed,oily
creepyPMs,not_removed,your postcomment has been removed in accordance with httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,im under the assumption that its the same person who sent me the other submission i posted and the last messages on my tumblr he fullnamed me as well which just added to the creep factor
creepyPMs,not_removed,if i got that message it would seem more incredibly random than creepy tbh wait no that first part is genuinely unsettling okay i get it now
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is a super sad and pathetic level of lonely maybe if he didnt open with fantasizing someone he could actually hang out instead of getting high and reading tumblr
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats so gross it be nice if places like tumblr had shadowblocks that way ppl wouldnt realize they were blocked and you wouldnt have to deal with this shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,im actually hoping he sees my posts on reddit super unlikely and realised how awkward and embarrassing his behaviour is
creepyPMs,not_removed,one can only hope
creepyPMs,not_removed,definitely different saying thought id read out tumblr as we have some stuff in common vs im fantasising about full name reading your tumblr is like were hanging out in person
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly wouldnt have been as creepy if he didnt lead into it with that yeah
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment has been removed in accordance with httpiimgurcomvkforaspng httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wouldve reported them but unfortunately tumblr wouldnt let me do that
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah the whole fantasising thing is really weird
creepyPMs,not_removed,you can turn off anon asks at least then hed have to be bothered to make accounts you can block and idk how but ive heard theres a way to find the ip of people who send you asks not sure on that for sure though if you block the account you can also report for harassmentspam also change your messaging settings so only people you follow can message you so he cant contact you that way
creepyPMs,not_removed,that sucks
creepyPMs,not_removed,commented somewhere else but mightve gotten lost i did turn off anon asks after this and he did create a throwaway tumblr to message me further i have blocked it but couldnt find a way to report it
creepyPMs,not_removed,its whatever at this point unfortunately i wish i was left with even an email to trace but alas ive got literally pretty much no clues
creepyPMs,not_removed,you have to go to your blocked users to report it i think
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe try and make them think you like them and as soon as you get identifying info use it to block em
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had no idea thank you ill try that
creepyPMs,not_removed,i did originally first few messages respond to one or two that were a lot more tames and more just compliments saying something along the lines of thanks thats flattering but would mean more if you know me if you werent on anonymous or something like that in an effort to find out who it was but they responded with no i promise im not trolling i really think that etc etc or something so i realised it wasnt going to happen
creepyPMs,not_removed,tumblr is fucking goofy you would think if you block somebody you can immediately report them but no
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i kept looking around trying to figure out how i was meant to block them just checked and not found any way to report but perhaps im going to the wrong spot ive never had to block somebody before so not sure
creepyPMs,not_removed,idk if theres a way to do it on mobile but ill see if i can remember how to do it on the actual site i have done it before mostly to bot accounts
creepyPMs,not_removed,from tumblr itself from blogs on the web report an entire blog by hovering over the blogs avatar clicking the little person silhouette and clicking flag this blog so if you go to his blog directly you can do it looks like i remember there being a way to do it without having to look at the persons blog but maybe that way isnt possible anymore idk
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you figure it out and can share itd be greatly appreciated
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg your username ❤
creepyPMs,not_removed,bed english nice substitution there
creepyPMs,not_removed,listen
creepyPMs,not_removed,a perfect example of bed english actually
creepyPMs,not_removed,weirdly appropriate in all the creepiness
creepyPMs,not_removed,didnt you know lesbians make massively exaggerated noises super loud moans and high pitched screams when they have sex because theyre different from normal women see and thus their audio is turned up to s fiiiine i added s just in case
creepyPMs,not_removed,right
creepyPMs,not_removed,the type of guys who get pissed off because you start dating a male more alpha than them are pathetic did you ever tell the girlfriend that hed asked you to sleep with him while they were together
creepyPMs,not_removed,at least he said chump instead of chad i guess but whats up with all of the guys who blame op for their unrequited feelings theyre his feelings and his problem and some of them write messages years after any interaction they ever had with the op so bizarre
creepyPMs,not_removed,its so freeing when you finally get rid of these dudes when i met my husband there was an unexpected exodus of niceguys™ from my friends list that i apparently had no idea were waiting there in the wings for me
creepyPMs,not_removed,k bye
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel bad for his girlfriend too tbh being stuck with a guy like that
creepyPMs,not_removed,me too
creepyPMs,not_removed,i ended up not having to contact her at the time because as soon as she found out we had hung out they broke up obviously there was other stuff going on and this was the tip of the iceburg i should have just unfriended him years ago
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats what i find so weird about a lot of creeps after years of nothing more than awkward his at best they still have feelings for somebody i think after years of no regular contact you dont even know that person anymore any feelings are entirely projection or worse theyve been feeding off a fantasy so long that they dont realise how awkward it is that so much time passed
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes probably lying
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wasnt sure which one it fit in morethere seems to be a lot of posts on here there arent really creepy as much as jerkface behavior so i figured it fit should i remove it
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment has been removed in accordance with httpiimgurcomvkforaspng httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,lmao probably
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont worry your post definitely fits in here creepiness is pretty subjective in the first place if you found that creeps message even just a little bit offputting then you have every right to post it here i personally found the message creepy on its own but knowing the backstory just makes the message even creepier
creepyPMs,not_removed,the point isnt whether somebody else found it creepy if they dont like the post they can downvote and move on as per rule you are the poster you found it creepy the end
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes creepyjerkface i agree with gattofila
creepyPMs,not_removed,is this for any tangents that might go offtopic or something more deliberate
creepyPMs,not_removed,both essentially some of the threads end up wandering waaay off topic but more for when people do stuff like argue or insult each other etc on a thread it gets to be like a food fight at a banquet after a while
creepyPMs,not_removed,post we broke up months ago and he keeps trying to have these conversations post we broke up months ago and hes been escalating update httpimgurcomabzywb post i am not bothering with a throwaway anymore next stop police for harassment charges 😡😡😡 my ex definitely has some mental illness problems he has harrassed and stalked me for months now i have requested over and over he not contact me unless its about the debt he owes me from when we were together he refused to do that and continued to harass me i am beyond done with it and have decided to follow through on the threat for filing a police report because clearly no amount of pleading or demanding that he respect my boundaries will actually make him do that i would feel the smallest amount of sympathy if he hadnt given me this same speech i dont romanticize you anymore ill respect your boundaries please dont punish me speech at least times this year alone i know without any doubt he isnt sincere and will continue to harass me unless i let others step in and stop him i super love that im the one that needs to take a chill pill over being stalked for months hey brendon you can go fuck yourself also he promises to not stalk me anymore but goes through my post history to see what tv i am watching dude not to mention he realized only today that people care about him so much that hes finally ready to move on then why the fuck try to contact me again when last time i threatened you with a restraining order for any further contact liar manipulator my parents and i will be speaking to our lawyer tomorrow to discuss the best course of action my family has been great seeing me through this year and they want to help me end this once and for all they realize how fucking psycho my ex turned out to be lastly brendon you brought this on yourself i didnt make more trouble for you you harassed me until i had no other choice but to get help update on monday morning he is still messaging me similar stuff as above begging me not to submit a report and saying he is so over me yeah right i am still going to submit a report
creepyPMs,not_removed,i remember you i am so sorry this is going on please take this son of a bitch down
creepyPMs,not_removed,from all the previous posts he sent it makes no sense that he is posting this current one it may seem that the restraining order part made him realise that youre not messing around and that its time you took the wheel so its either that hes afraid or his other personality has come out to play either way i suggest to just file it anyways so if ever anything does happen youll have a file on him
creepyPMs,not_removed,my money is on him still trying to manipulate you into having you in his life with a ro that hope is shattered for good in his mind and he cannot have that if i were you id go and get that ro just to be in the safe side i know its none of my business but this sub has lots and lots of people being harassed and toyed with by sociopaths who enjoy giving some string and then pulling it multiple times i really hope thats not your case but you already have gone through a lot stay safe and cheers
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you know hes a manipulative liar give him absolutely no rope i know exactly the kind of person youre dealing with ive been there you should absolutely report this bullshit no remorse
creepyPMs,not_removed,the language is so desperately trying to imply that its totally not his fault and that you just have troubles disgusting
creepyPMs,not_removed,op if he knows where you live just be careful now that youre doing this he could possibly resort to violence in his desperation so just watch your back and carry mace or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,if youd like it you might find some additional support on rlifeafternarcissism this guy screams narcissist or having some personality disorder and the gaslighting with those texts is verrrry well done its so subtle that it took me several texts to see it and ive lived with an n my whole life so thats saying something ugh im glad you got away and youre not feeling guilty and also glad youre filing a police report going through with your threats and enforcing boundaries is the only way to show him you wont be messed with
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre making the right call with any luck the police will be able to get him the help he clearly needs and theres no reason for you to suffer his manipulative ways hes saying anything he can to gain any bit of control over you and the situation and im glad youre taking a stand simply ignoring him is obviously not going to work i hope everything turns out for the better and you can hopefully move on from this stressful ordeal
creepyPMs,not_removed,file the report and block him from your phone from social media and everywhere else you can think of ask friends to not tag you on social media when youre out and about
creepyPMs,not_removed,how much does he owe you
creepyPMs,not_removed,harasses you faces consequences and then has the nerve to ask you not to make trouble for him it baffles me how harassers always find ways to blame the women theyve inflicted themselves on
creepyPMs,not_removed,eeeeeugh why is this awful man in washington state where i live
creepyPMs,not_removed,file the report dont let anything stop you
creepyPMs,not_removed,ill move this over to pm
creepyPMs,not_removed,file the report
creepyPMs,not_removed,shaking pompoms for you over here
creepyPMs,not_removed,its great that youre taking action no one deserves to be harassed like this
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my god this is exactly how my ex sounded its uncanny absolutely file the report i wish so much i had sooner than i did i waited over a year and it escalated much further than this he would start out saying im absolutely over you i have no interest in you to threatening me and telling me i ruined his life and that he wanted me to feel his pain then right back to this shit again he wont stop make him stop
creepyPMs,not_removed,good i admire you for sticking to your guns no amount of whining like a baby should let him escape consequences
creepyPMs,not_removed,gladly my dads lawyer will help us figure out options hopeful its just filing a report and then ignoring the hell out of this guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,he gets all whimpery and apologetic when he feels hes gone too far because i get angry enough he does this to try to circumvent consequences
creepyPMs,not_removed,reporting is the plan and i hope it keeps him away from me forever because im tired of dealing with this bullshit its annoying and exhausting as hell
creepyPMs,not_removed,i live with family and theyre aware of the situation so hopefully they can help be safe too
creepyPMs,not_removed,it was originally from living expenses we loved together and the loser thought it was too hard to work and any money he did make went to weed and alcohol he has paid me back over the past months but very inconsistently he still owes about
creepyPMs,not_removed,if he was remorseful then i wouldnt but he has given me this same speech every week or two since we broke up no amount of me begging him to leave me alone or ignoring him or threatening him with a police report has stopped him from harassing me so i need to follow through with the report i wouldnt report someone who was sincerely remorseful either
creepyPMs,not_removed,if he was remorseful there wouldnt be a whole spiel at the end about if you ever want someone so great back in your life ill be here there would be ive moved on goodbye hes trying to manipulate her into getting back with him thats not remorse thats a strategic alteration
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am sure he has some sort of personality disorder he has separate personalities he can become when hes stressed and voices that speak to him he wears this as a badge of honor really hes just scared of therapy or medication and thinks he can use pot to fix himself
creepyPMs,not_removed,he is mentally unstable and knows where i live i dont want my family or friends to get entangled in his bullshit so getting something on file will be good at least
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love having good cheerleaders 😂
creepyPMs,not_removed,well i know the type ive seen the type too so its smart that youre getting a proper file on this so if he ever tries anything stupid he has the law to face
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should probably give up on trying to get that money back guy low him will just use the debt to keep contact with you and try to win you back best to cut this guy off completely it sucks but its for the best
creepyPMs,not_removed,can confirm based on ops other posts as recently as this morning ex needs help and does not seem remorseful
creepyPMs,not_removed,entirely correct its awesome that you can recognise his fake remorse as just an attempt to try and get close to you in some way i really hope the report goes well i cant imagine how horrid this would be to go through
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg he sounds exactly like my ex it was so hard to break contact with him and he would send almost the exact same messages to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,at this point i just want him out of my life the remaining debt would be nice but if it means i have to deal with him i would rather bleach my eyes
creepyPMs,not_removed,certain of my siblings believe i am over reacting and should just ignore him but no amount of ignoring him has stopped him this whole year im out of patience i feel like ive aged years in months
creepyPMs,not_removed,edit dividing this because i started out replying to one thing and then i kept reading and it turned into like replies and got kind of long as someone who has bpd i was thinking this is a little bit reminiscent of untreated notselfaware borderline like you said that doesnt mean it would be at all appropriate to diagnose him with anything as far as personalitiesvoices theres a possibility he could be multiple but it seems really unlikely theres a fracturing of identitymay decentralization is a better term pretty much universal in borderline such that in general we dont have a stable identity and different aspects of our personality can change drastically with our moods or environments this is originally an adaptive mechanism as well as a remnant of identity interruption as most of us are abuse survivors it can be really maladaptive though in the real world note bpd identity decentralization is not the same as split identity in did or theres no such thing as a bpd system theres a chance of course that everything from the different personalities to the voices is a manipulation tool ill or not theres no excuse for his harassmentstalkingabuse even with the suggestion he may be borderline id advise staying away from a lot of the popular literature on bpd as a lot of it tends to be very skewed stereotyped and ableist if you think it fits and feel that learning about it might help you deal with him during legal proceedings or might help you gain some closure id suggest talking to people who are borderline there are a lot of forums for us and we tend to be pretty welcoming we usually appreciate the opportunity to help someone understand and like i said most of us are abuse survivors as well so we sympathize again this isnt meant to be any kind of diagnosis take it as he may have bpd or bpd traits and if so this might be why xyz happens also like unewnumberorder said if he attempts or completes selfharm or suicide whether hes using it to manipulate you or not it is not your fault and its not your problem i second the suggestion to seek out a therapist if you can but i would extend that to a suggestion to do so whether youre presently feeling guilt or not things like the kind of harassmentabuse youve been experiencing often have a deeper longerlasting effect than we originally estimated and that can manifest in ways we dont always recognize its always your call of course but its something i would consider good luck with throwing and keeping this abuser out of your life op im so sorry you had to go through this edit i realized i started out by replying to unewnumberorder also question what was the third personality disorder you referenced and ended by replying to uforeverex edit as im reading through more of your comments and your previous posts its actually pretty irrelevant whether he has x y or z disorder because it looks like hes really consciously and deliberately manipulating you pretty much everything hes saying seems really thoughtout and calculated every time he mentions his mental illnesses he uses it as an excusetool he may actually have real problems meaning beyond just depression and anxiety but if he does then hes using them as a crutchexcuseweapon and it seems to me he is very aware of what hes doing i say this as someone with experience with abusers and as someone who goes to great lengths not to use my mental illnesses as an excuse if he really was trying really trying he wouldnt be framing any of this the way that he is whether he has real problems or not hes definitely using them and everything else against you hes pretending to acknowledge the things you say but hes negating almost every important part everything he acknowledges or pretends to acknowledge is calculated and everything hes negatingignoring is also calculated because thats his real game like when you say that you cant open up with him and then he thanks ou for opening up to him thats a really slimy way of negating your reality in terms of your statements your actions and your boundaries its not done outright but kind of sideways because theres more chance itll slip part the radar like that he goes on to try to make himself look goodfriendlyaccomodating its overly enthusiastic and almost condescending and then goes on to negate your statement that you dont have anything in common thats all really really insidious and calculated he knows exactly what hes doing and exactly how manipulative it is iiuc this counts as gaslighting hes also putting everything on you as much as possible hes framing himself as again warm and accommodating and friendly and everything is about you deciding differently or having a change of heart he wants you to second guess your decisions both active and passive and essentially trying everything he can to overwright your reality as much as possible hes trying to make you question your statement of having changed hes trying to bring you back into the mindset you were in when he had all the power and hes trying to make you feel guilty for having broken up with him and for now considering yourself detatched from him thats what all the im interested in seeing how youve changed and curious to see if i can find any shreds of the woman i once knew bullshit is thats just the first couple paragraphs in that one post but it doesnt change imo this isnt some emotionally distraught person or at least its not coming from a place of emotional anguish this is just straightup calculated abuse idk what he may or may not have besides anxiety and depression but its pretty much irrelevant as it doesnt seem to be the driving factor for him to continue this behaviour hes playing up his problems but theres no one disorder or combination of disorders that makes someone abusiveact this way hes milking it and tbh might be making things up or exaggerating edit repayingepic lengths thaaaat sounds like a threat thats maybe something to highlight when you go to the police its phrased to sound superficially benevolent but its like the opposite of that pretending to accept nominal responsibility then using it as a jumpingoff point to continually blame you trying to unseat your securitysense of self and trying to guilt trip you its so god hes so awful and relentless trying to make you feel bad for requiring he pay you back trying to make you feel like hes making some kind of huge sacrifice and you dont deserve it blaming you for not talking to him i can kind of see the depressionloneliness kicking in but even with that he doesnt miss you he misses the emotional outlet he used you for he misses being able to control and hurt you sorry for harassing proceeds to harass you so condescending so disgusting the gaslighting oh my god im so sorry you had to go through this the relationship itself and all of these messages hes a genuine menace i hope every single part of the legal proceedings goes your way i hope its quick and decisive and at the end of it you never have to see or hear anything from this piece of shit ever again
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks for your view i dont have much experience in mental disorders he would shake and lie and tear up his clothes when he didnt get his way or his drugs he would lie and then later on try to tell me he had no choice because i put him in a situation where he had to lie he has separate personalities when we met he apparently had wanted to start living as a woman i forget what her name was his father is emotionally abusive and he attributes it to that though i think it goes deeper he has fascinationsfetishes with being babied and coddled and taken care of he again attributes this to his fathers abuse he gets obsessed about things he is unable to stop discussions about politics he firmly believes the world is about to come to an apocalyptic end if you look through his reddit post history youll find he is trying to escape the country where hes sad his family will die but it doesnt make sense for him to die with them due to the impending nuclear apocalypse he becomes obsessed with politics conspiracy theories and becomes extremely concerned that the world as we know it is about to end he wants to flee to the country side where they cant find him he also believes a zombie type scenario is entirely possible he says he hears voices and he doesnt want them to go away he doesnt want to go to therapy because he firmly believes they will lock him up he doesnt want his family to know how fucked he is so he hides it fairly well around them only to unleash it al in private he uses psychedelics and weed because he believes you cant reach enlightenment without them he talks about reaching different planes and knowing secrets no one else knows about thatcould just be drugs but he goes very far into it if i think of anything else ill tell you oh when he gets drunk hes violent he isnt a big guy but if hes drunk he cant stop drinking and he will throw himself at people he will vandalize places or try to get into fist fights he will steal mail or hit shit with his fists or a bat or shit like that
creepyPMs,not_removed,do you work in therapy or the medical field
creepyPMs,not_removed,im at work at the moment and can only briefly check messages but i want to read through this big long reply soon thanks for taking the time 🙂
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes never hurt me hes fairly scrawny but he shouts and shakes and literally rips his clothes to pieces off his body when he doesnt get his way
creepyPMs,not_removed,easy for them to say i guess if they havent been going through it its good youre doing what you need to to keep your sanity which is whats important at the end of it
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive finally read your post and thank you for better explaining why speaking to this guy is so infuriating i am no eloquent enough to explain it other than its manipulative he tries to come off as sweet but it feels like he ignores of what i say and he replaces it with the version he wants to hear you explained my frustration and his manipulation perfectly maybe its harsh of me but if he were to kill himself at this point i wouldnt really care i would feel relieved he would finally leave me alone i havent felt an ounce of caring for him in over months i moved on very fast but he wouldnt let it go i am out of care and patience for him and i dont care what happens to him so i feel no guilt maybe i would have a year ago but i am very beyond that now
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow i really appreciate this thought out reply once i have a moment to read through it all currently at work i will 🙂
creepyPMs,not_removed,so he definitely sounds mentally ill of course thats never ever an excuse for abuse his separate personalities sound like the kind of fragmentation you get with decentralized identity but they dont quite sound like multiplicity at least as theyve been described age regression for instance doesnt sound like a separate identity eg an alter like youd have with did but its a coping mechanism used by some survivors of abuse wanting to live as a woman doesnt necessarily indicate this but it might gender dysphoria can often be tied into dissociation or issues with identity i say this as a nonbinary trans person who has dissociation and issues with identity for anyone who may be reading this comment an identity informed by past abuse andor mental illness is not made invalid by those things thats not to say that he isnt multiple but it seems less likely than him having the one personality with various dissociative emotional states the hallucinations obsessions and paranoia sound like psychosispsychotic symptoms none of this is a diagnosis of course and mental illness is never an excuse for harassmentabuse
creepyPMs,not_removed,it sounds like he has some form of autism
creepyPMs,not_removed,the nice thing actually is that my brother who was thinking i overreacted actually came to me earlier today and said he would go to the police with me so i didnt have to be alone so at least he is supportive even if he doesnt get it 🙂
creepyPMs,not_removed,im glad youre not feeling guilty over this thats a really really big thing and its a good thing too honestly coming out of an abusive relationship guilt seems to be one of the things that makes life the most difficult for the victims its good that youre not entrapped by that
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks for your reply thank you also for being a mental health professional who views pds as valid and recognizes the stigma as flawed unfortunately as youve noted there are a lot of people in the field who take the stigma for reality its always heartening to see someone who doesnt
creepyPMs,not_removed,perhaps with some of the other things i mentioned about him you would have a better idea of what his deal is no pressure of course and clearly no one could be diagnosed online but its helpful to have insight into what could be causing this insane behavior
creepyPMs,not_removed,im sorry its so long that was kind of an accident at the end though all the information seemed pertinent albeit to different things so i just kind of cleaned it up a little bit and parceled it out
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks for your perspective im gonna read up one some of this stuff do you recommend any reliable resources
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh cool well when i have time to thoroughly read what you said soon hopefully i will give you a better response 🙂
creepyPMs,not_removed,i added in more in another comment about his behavior if it helps you understand him better by the way
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol its all good i appreciate people care enough to really discuss it in depth i still havent had time to give it a good read through but i promise i will soon 🙂 and then i will actually have a response for you
creepyPMs,not_removed,not off the top of my head but ill try and find some
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you again for taking the time i really will take it all with a grain of salt since diagnosing this sort of thing is clearly difficult even in person and this is all second hand internet stuff to you he is almost i dont know about his family history of mental illness outside of the fact that his father has alcoholism and really bad mood swings and issues with rageviolence theres been a couple times when my ex was really going through a weird moment of stress or anxiety and he would be talking to me but it wasnt him it was a different personality and he wouldnt remember it the next day and accuse me of making it up to make him feel crazy he did the same when he was drunk he seemed to identify with these other personalities over time though and he could recognize them and give them specific identifiersnames i have gotten some therapy for this and it probably would do me good for more counseling i work and go to school full time while pulling myself out of the debt my ex caused so i am a bit tight on money and time right now but i am looking into school counselor options too i am going to re read your post and think more on it thanks again
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,no worries
creepyPMs,not_removed,im guessing someone sent the sext to your bestie and they responded otherwise
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hate it when silencea nonresponse is a hmmmlet me go ahead and send an unsolicited videophoto of my penis to this person it really goes to show how little people care about boundaries and only for their own selfish gain ie getting their rocks off
creepyPMs,not_removed,i must get too many of these videos as i clicked the play button to see
creepyPMs,not_removed,harold coming to save the day our hero ❤
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes this douche blew her off and then sent her an unsolicited masturbation video
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah that title was a little misleading
creepyPMs,not_removed,so youre saying that i shouldnt just send every girl i even come in contact with a video of me jacking off who woulda thought
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i thought op meant that their best friend was the one sending the video i figured the title was sarcastic
creepyPMs,not_removed,uhh context
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow justwow
creepyPMs,not_removed,wait was it a bad batch i personally have never heard of anyone overdosing on just a gram of meth thats really not much even for someone inexperienced
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh i definitely agree was just curious about that as an ex addict myself dealers are heartless losers but i started off with that much also by injection and introduced by a shitty dealer and im a one hundred pound female must have been some strong shit or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,i never had to rob anyone because i was somehow able to maintain a job during my short fling my negative perception about dealers comes from being robbed by one for some reason dealers were the most desperate where i live they had access to everything but never had the money because they couldnt keep it they relied on addicts and the more drugs they could introduce you to the better for them they hardly ever wanted money they just wanted some of whatever you were buying idk if thats how it works in less rural areas nobody gets murdered where i live so we obviously come from different realities we havent had a murder in six years
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes sorry for not clarifying those were the only kind of dealers i ever knew
creepyPMs,not_removed,of dealers are addicts
creepyPMs,not_removed,uh holy shit the junkie in the op was shot
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy fuck shit seems to go down in your city only manslaughter what about the other dude she shot that should be an attempted murder charge as well
creepyPMs,not_removed,what the fuck
creepyPMs,not_removed,sheesh i hope he was reported what a cockwaffle
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is easily the worst way to try and get in someones pants ive ever seen
creepyPMs,not_removed,i could rage my heart out instead be safe everyone be safe and be good to each other
creepyPMs,not_removed,that smarmy smile at the end is so infuriating
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think some people just i dunno dont understand how bad rape is and use it thinking it means assertive dominant alpha as fuck sheltered shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats fucked up even if your with someone even if you have that sort of fantasy that isnt how you bring it up what a charmer this one is
creepyPMs,not_removed,him op us ಠಠ
creepyPMs,not_removed,and judging by his profile pic hes probably an actual nazi
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes threatening to rape someone a classic pick up line
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was raped i have nothing this guy can rot in hell
creepyPMs,not_removed,this isnt a great way to bring up that you have a rape fantasy
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus christ
creepyPMs,not_removed,chilling fucking chilling this is a person whos never had to fear anything in his shitty life but being laughed at by a girl zero empathy total human garbage
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,theres alot of fucked up people out there
creepyPMs,not_removed,this person is a straight up piece of shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont understand why people jump right to rape when they dont like an answerresponse do they not realize how disgustingly immature and ignorant they instantly become
creepyPMs,not_removed,i literally just said wow about times in a row just now
creepyPMs,not_removed,previously on amcs reddits rejects
creepyPMs,not_removed,i sincerely hope this guy gets banned from fb if not reported to the police seems like it could be considered a credible threat depending on circumstances
creepyPMs,not_removed,cockwaffle i like it
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre beautiful you should get into a car accident that rips off your fucking face and kills your parents want to grab a drink some time
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes trying to be edgy and haha i dont care about u but really you can tell he cares sooo much about what she or he thinks
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah the girl is jewish go figure
creepyPMs,not_removed,is that israel giving america a treat is that what im seeing jfc
creepyPMs,not_removed,seconded people like that make my blood boil they have no fucking idea how fucked up it is no one can know unless it happens to them and it makes me furious that anyone else has or had to go through what i did i hope youre okay
creepyPMs,not_removed,as a man whos been assaulted sexually i wanna watch his cock burn off his body
creepyPMs,not_removed,so was i its taken a lot of work to accept a lot of things about what happened what happened to me and me seeing people like this i dont know i dont think any of these people know anyone who has been raped i dont think they understand how it hurts so many other people how much it hurts one person in particular what it takes away from them i dont know if they think theyre being playful and confusing rape with just aggressive lovemaking or something similar or if theyre genuinely a sick fuck who wants to rape someone
creepyPMs,not_removed,same stuff like this boils my piss
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats being generous shit is actually useful in certain situations
creepyPMs,not_removed,reminds that i use the term slutmuffin ie i was a slutmuffin when i was a teen
creepyPMs,not_removed,damn thats one romantic pickup line
creepyPMs,not_removed,only a pickup line
creepyPMs,not_removed,this negging is getting out of hand
creepyPMs,not_removed,youve sold me
creepyPMs,not_removed,get out
creepyPMs,not_removed,are you trying to be funny
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont care bro is she still looking
creepyPMs,not_removed,you cant fix rape by raping its not a fire
creepyPMs,not_removed,no your comment has been removed
creepyPMs,not_removed,what you said sings from my heart what makes it worse is when statements like this are fantasy fuel like for this pathetic excuse for a human he or anyone who spills garbage like this whether trolling or not does not have an ounce of empathy about them and they dont deserve mine thank you i hope youre okay too
creepyPMs,not_removed,right it takes a lot to offend me but this shit i just have no patience for
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think theres any logic to their behaviour but if i were to guess about of people who say stuff like this minus the one percent of sick fucks who actually want to rape someone just have no fucking clue what a devastating thing a rape is to experience one of the worst things in the world to go through in my opinion they just have no fucking idea and no emotional maturity to even begin to comprehend what it entails and how could they since anyone who hasnt experienced it cant really understand but whatever their reasons its not okay there is never an excuse to say anything even remotely like this to anyone nobody deserves it also thank you for being so kind wishing you all things lovely
creepyPMs,not_removed,what is a slutmuffin
creepyPMs,not_removed,well i am a silver tongued devil s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i gotta watch that with my cinema group
creepyPMs,not_removed,you ready to put the soda can to your toasty mustache
creepyPMs,not_removed,no im not
creepyPMs,not_removed,i whole heartedly agree they dont get a second thought past my first one of kicking them in the teeth years and still here ill be fine
creepyPMs,not_removed,there should be no patience tolerance or acceptance of this behaviour it should be punished promptly and with thorough conviction and he should be reminded daily that he is sick and lucky if he gets to keep his little pecker
creepyPMs,not_removed,im sorry that happened to you hope youre working through it and not just repressing its not healthy to repress it will probably bite you eventually i hope youre ok
creepyPMs,not_removed,would watch again for open wound sex
creepyPMs,not_removed,you ready to put the soda can to your toasty mustache already did that now its a glass of makers mark
creepyPMs,not_removed,couldnt agree more almost two years for me just started going to counselling its not nice going in there and saying all the disgusting stuff out loud but it must help me in the long run
creepyPMs,not_removed,todo bien i cant sleep anyways
creepyPMs,not_removed,it will help i didnt get help then and i wish i did im working on it best wishes to you dear youll be okay no mater how long it takes

creepyPMs,not_removed,mermaid among clown fish is a great line tbh
creepyPMs,not_removed,flattering but confusing in a way i mean yes im an elegant mermaid but i dont know about the veggie delight part
creepyPMs,not_removed,a mermaid would not be vegetarian food
creepyPMs,not_removed,suddenly the crazy makes sense
creepyPMs,not_removed,are you vegetarian maybe its his way of showing he vaguely skimmed your profile
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am a vegetarian that didnt cross my mind well since he acknowledged my vegetarianism thats a sure way for a message back totally
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly obviously acknowledging one aspect of someone is a dead guarantee that youll get laid immediately what are you waiting for run to him s
creepyPMs,not_removed,time to go get my man 😂😂
creepyPMs,not_removed,really sorry you had to suck this guys balls he really backed you into a corner with that logic you alright
creepyPMs,not_removed,what the fuck does he even mean about more wifi capabilities wifi is an on or off thing like a brain you either have it or you never mind i think i just answered my own question

creepyPMs,not_removed,this is what happens when abs learn to talk
creepyPMs,not_removed,that was painful to read i feel dumber from having looked at his messages
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit it just keeps going
creepyPMs,not_removed,what the hell is this dude on
creepyPMs,not_removed,noisnt an answergive me a reasonwhy i shouldnt rape you
creepyPMs,not_removed,stop misusing ellipsesellipsi pull yourself together dude and form a coherent sentence op you are a very very patient one a diamond in the rough no a sparkly diamond or whichever gemstone you prefer edit i cant stop laughing blablablabla whatever you say bitch u dont want to chat with me once i dont want to chat with you twice im dying these are the foxiest sour grapes that ever were edit as someone who speaks italian this guy doesnt for sure id like to just apologize this is the funniest one ive ever read by far im bookmarking it for when i need a laugh edit he spelled whore wrong troia i usually use those words in the masculine form to throw people off their game puttano etc fun times
creepyPMs,not_removed,he makes about as much sense as omar the crazy homeless guy who lives near me and stands in the street and yells at cars
creepyPMs,not_removed,wtf
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a foul individual
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont live in italy and i wont tell you where i live yes but which city in italy are you from brainpower
creepyPMs,not_removed,i will be i will survive
creepyPMs,not_removed,yea i didnt understand that either haha he is pretty dumb
creepyPMs,not_removed,of course it is who would not use there own picture s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i bet hes not a fucking guy just a guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,but no reason is good enough for insane people
creepyPMs,not_removed,i couldnt figure out where he was from i just assumed greek because of the come to greece statement he might have been italian but i understand a bit of italian and could not make heads or tails of it even with google translate help
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes like the energizer bunny of creeps
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know and i dont want to try it either
creepyPMs,not_removed,damn this really puts this in perspective
creepyPMs,not_removed,what is the first italian phrase he is trying to say
creepyPMs,not_removed,for shits and giggles i guess easy entertainment when youre bored but hes fucking annoying
creepyPMs,not_removed,i didnt have to work and no car so i was stuck at home alone i used him for entertainment
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh look its omar bye omar drives past omar
creepyPMs,not_removed,the city im from barely even has internet access so i doubt hes even heard of it unless things have changed in the last six or so years the last time a family member from the states visited my dad emails with family a lot i should ask him
creepyPMs,not_removed,read the rules before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,you are an inspiration persevere for all of us
creepyPMs,not_removed,at first i thought he was using google translate but it wouldnt format the way he was typing as someone who speaks creep fluently this person clearly has some sort of issues
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol so true i doubt this dude even knows how to fuck his right hand correctly
creepyPMs,not_removed,well troia is italian for slut so im guessing italian or some where that is nearby that has a similar dialect
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my god im reading it again and laughing op is a saint a fucking saint this is so ridiculously terrible that its hard to believe hes real like the creeper is so so bad that imo its more nonsensical than offensive just mo omg what is a goldfish memory hhahaha i just cant ok let me focus scrolling through the drivel succhia la mincchia im sure we all know that hes trying to say suck my dick the correct version is succhiami la minchia he was pretty close ive never heard anyone ever ever ever say that though there are much more common and creative italian insults bc he got the grammar and the spelling wrong and its boring
creepyPMs,not_removed,as a metaphor for many creeps omar will try to grab your car and make you listen to his rantings
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha thank ya
creepyPMs,not_removed,see thats one of the words my grandmother never taught me so i dont know that lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,he probably just said that because he thought op was italian i mean i know those words in other languages as well
creepyPMs,not_removed,soif you were a jerk face italian guy while a woman who didnt want to talk to you what creative insult would you use
creepyPMs,not_removed,hmmm let me flip it around bc i wrote my thesis for my italian major on sexism in the italian language and recommendations to make the language less sexist httpwebfreepassitcazzionariovocabolariohtm so just like in english there arent any negative words for men who sleep around surprise so almost all of the insults are focused on being feminine or women having sex so what i do is flip it around take every female insult and turn it into a male one by putting an o at the end instead of an a if you ever meet an asshole who speaks italian trust me they will flip the fuck out theyll tell you that you spelled it wrong and that the word doesnt exist and you can tell them right back that you meant to spell it that way bc thats what they are baldracco battono bocchinaro cagato figlio di puttano son of a bastardmale whore puttano troio
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is beautiful if i ever encounter an italian jerk i will use these
creepyPMs,not_removed,please do and report back even cooler to use it with an italian who doesnt speak italian mwhwahahahahahahahahah
creepyPMs,not_removed,btw i just tired the link it just brings me to your post trickster
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry about that its a dictionary of bad words the link should work now cazzo means dick so its called a cazzonario like a dicktionary d
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh now thats funny it works now thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,sure sorry bout that
creepyPMs,not_removed,he didnt even try to hide his infantilizing you
creepyPMs,not_removed,its a petname commonly used in ddlg relationships not defending just offering info its really inappropriate to use with a stranger hes both using a pet name and pushing a kink on the op that she hasnt consented to
creepyPMs,not_removed,we noticed potentially inappropriate language
creepyPMs,not_removed,does this work on some people
creepyPMs,not_removed,just curious what does pick your mind mean
creepyPMs,not_removed,beautiful fox
creepyPMs,not_removed,match you guys are soulmates how could you resist responding
creepyPMs,not_removed,id love to pick your mind oh he has a body under his floor
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh these assholes give the kink community a bad rep i despise when people shove their dynamicskinks unto strangers is it that hard to grasp the concept of consent
creepyPMs,not_removed,so weird like i said in my profile that i dont like needy dudes i need my own space then starts baby talking me wut
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry what is dd lg just curious my profile is just pics and a few dot points so not sure what inspired him haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahahahahaaaaa seriously how online dating feels sometimes but i am loving it so many weirdos i finally have something to post to reddit other than pictures of my cat
creepyPMs,not_removed,i surely hope not
creepyPMs,not_removed,he looks like a serial killer so he probably means it in the literal sense
creepyPMs,not_removed,it means talk and get someone opinionperspectivethoughts on a topic ive usually heard it as something like hey if you have a minute id love to pick your brain about the recent upheaval around cheesemaking
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive usually heard it as pick your brain and it means to ask an opinion about something hey man i know you are into cars could i buy you a coffee and pick your brain for half an hour i have a couple of options for my new car
creepyPMs,not_removed,god that grosses the hell out of me too
creepyPMs,not_removed,wrong post
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha what
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahahaaa i think its so funny how okcupid does the percentage thing i dont really pay attention to it but maybe i should haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,dom daddylittlegirl
creepyPMs,not_removed,your cat is sooooo cute
creepyPMs,not_removed,i once upheaved after too much cheese
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you i think hes the most beautiful boy ever
creepyPMs,not_removed,like your face man that was so smooth i cant even grasp it tightly s
creepyPMs,not_removed,even if there were a few women who liked dick pics they would ask men for them specifically rather than insisting that every horny guy everywhere send out dozens of unsolicited pictures to women on the off chance that one might reach her eyes
creepyPMs,not_removed,good thing he realized he was being a weirdo instead of dragging it out like other creeps do
creepyPMs,not_removed,hi i am another creep man telling a woman what women should like die
creepyPMs,not_removed,wont happen again untill the next girl i message fixed that for the guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,your face is good im a soos
creepyPMs,not_removed,well i like looking at penises but i want to see an entire man with his dick out not a disembodied organ thats never appealing and nobody ever wants all that unsolicited
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive never known anyone that described themselves as mature for their age that was actually mature for their age
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not very mature for my age want to make a pillow fort in my living room well id go for that
creepyPMs,not_removed,not all women want mature men the fact that my so can embarass himself when he acts like a child in public is one of the things i love most about him he gave himself tennis elbow on my birthday this summer when he high fived everyone at universal studios shit like that warms my heart
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a little shit pun intended
creepyPMs,not_removed,red flag tbh
creepyPMs,not_removed,im immature for my age source am act a damn fool at zoo and childrens museum embarrass gf
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think the only time thats appropriate is for actual children
creepyPMs,not_removed,ill bring pillows o id rather build a pillow fort with a stranger then the tree these guys are always barking up
creepyPMs,not_removed,fuck yeah adults can enjoy a pillow fort in ways children never can
creepyPMs,not_removed,awww thats precious
creepyPMs,not_removed,im guessing since its a common enough name and theres no other information its probably a safe bet no one who didnt have a loopppt of time on their hands could find them
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah hes probably the only shawn in existence so a quick google search is sure to return only his info
creepyPMs,not_removed,up there with im a nice guy if you have to say it its probably not true
creepyPMs,not_removed,and have been caught playing out scenes from scifi movies and such with action figures in the toy aisles
creepyPMs,not_removed,who does not act like a damn fool at the zoo and childrens museum besides your embarrassed gf of course
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats true and even then id probably hesitate
creepyPMs,not_removed,pillow forts are serious business
creepyPMs,not_removed,im thirty and sometimes when im alone i turn my hand into a jet plane and zoom around my living room making sound effects from top gun checkmate
creepyPMs,not_removed,dangerzone i dont think that even singing old soap opera songs to my dogs quite competes
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would ignore and move on if they are so adamant to keep such mistery they are either trolling or catfishing keep the messages just in case you need to involve authorities which i highly doubt but its too soon to discard any possibility
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah id ignore but save the messages just in case anytime someone texts me and i dont recognize the digits i just play dumb thought you handled it well though
creepyPMs,not_removed,its really easy to make a fake number with any number of phone apps try calling the number there will be an automated message of some kind if its from a texting app no idea what the potential motivation of this person might be but the safest thing to do if its giving you weird vibes is to block the number and ignore any future contact
creepyPMs,not_removed,did you do a reverse phone search
creepyPMs,not_removed,you might also consider changing your number if he continues to hassle you
creepyPMs,not_removed,i recently got in a fist fight at a bar ive been assuming its the other guy looking for some kind of revenge but ive been known to overreact too at least i get to post to this sub ive been a lurker for months edit sorry i meant to say thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah but nothing came up
creepyPMs,not_removed,howd he get your number
creepyPMs,not_removed,try doing a reverse search through facebook i recently had to do this since a friend of mine got a new number that i didnt recognize i googled it and nothing came up but doing a search on fb actually worked
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have no clue i wonder who else has my number and wants to creep me out early in the morning
creepyPMs,not_removed,calling someone love and my love are two different things i call my friends love all the time but i dont say it to strangers also i reserve my love for my bf as i feel its more intimate this jerk doesnt get that people come from different places and view expressions differently op i wouldve been just as creeped out as you also your response was awesome
creepyPMs,not_removed,i enjoy how i find the dudes that whine about people being offended easily generally themselves are the ones oh so offended someone doesnt appreciate their wordsactions
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats what i mean haha i agree with you super weird
creepyPMs,not_removed,common expression used towards people you know and have a friendship with
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you it was weird for him to randomly send it to me since we had never spoken before lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,isnt that the truth
creepyPMs,not_removed,true but he was a random stranger id never spoke to before
creepyPMs,not_removed,but my love why dont you love me my love proceeds to barf projectile style
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know what i was thinking of course love lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i rejected him because he was way too old for me and i didnt like his attitude talk about inability to respect no
creepyPMs,not_removed,the thing about this one for me is that this happened at around like come on guy let me have my coffee first
creepyPMs,not_removed,ok
creepyPMs,not_removed,in a weird way i cant help but admire the guy for just slapping that one out in the open the ok more amusing than most
creepyPMs,not_removed,somehow i respect that well a little bit anyway
creepyPMs,not_removed,hope springs eternal
creepyPMs,not_removed,wait just asking like that doesnt work
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey youll never know if you dont ask rightright
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i cracked up at the ok i mean thanks for not putting up a fight but make it a little fun
creepyPMs,not_removed,he knew when to abort
creepyPMs,not_removed,ok
creepyPMs,not_removed,this desecration of the comma cannot be tolerated anymore
creepyPMs,not_removed,what was the convo before this this seems so random but i could totally believe it
creepyPMs,not_removed,years old
creepyPMs,not_removed,unreleated to the post but great username op
creepyPMs,not_removed,my guess is that op mentioned she was asian and this dude took that and ran with it
creepyPMs,not_removed,he asked me why i wasnt at work and i told him that i was at school he sent this right after
creepyPMs,not_removed,i bet the op said hi
creepyPMs,not_removed,actually
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you very much d
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes im asian his wife is hispanic he swears he would never cheat but then asks me if i can handle his dick i dont talk to him anymore
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh god
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know after that message i told him he needed to stop talking to me like that and he claimed that it was a joke bullshit i ignore him whenever he messages me now
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wonder how funny his wife would find that joke
creepyPMs,not_removed,ha i asked him if his wife would appreciate him talking to other women like this and he said no didnt stop him from continuing though
creepyPMs,not_removed,if he even has one
creepyPMs,not_removed,he showed me their wedding photos
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy was my superior like years ago we always had a great rapport and we havent spoken since but he always posted funny stuff on facebook so i kept him as a facebook friend about a month ago he posted a serious post about issues hes had in his life illness court precedings death in his family and so i reached out to him saying even though its been a while if theres anything i can do to let me know he said that he didnt even know if he was going to survive his illness but he would know for sure soon i asked him to let me know since i was worried and he said he would he never did a week or so later he invited me at and my boyfriend to a concert with backstage passes since he knew the singer i said sure sounds good but closer to the date i desisted because of other plans looking back i never really confirmed i had a boyfriend i think he was fishing i spoke to my boyfriend about it but i was never sure if he was subtly hitting on me or not so i just let it go a week after that he became facebook official with a girl so i figured that that would be the end of that just kidding it wasnt this morning he texted me this it seems lack of sleep is enough of a reason to be unfaithful in either case my boyfriend had a good laugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol conge baladi was cute though how unfortunate will use this joke in the future and pretend its mineno hard feelings
creepyPMs,not_removed,im so curious about the joke
creepyPMs,not_removed,what do belly dancers do when they have a cold they take a sick day sick in french is similar to baladi which is the type of dance belly dancers do
creepyPMs,not_removed,ha that is funny
creepyPMs,not_removed,man why did you have to be so annoying s
creepyPMs,not_removed,fucking love how you called him out cause your age range isnt even up to your own age gross old dudes are always hypocrites and his yr old girl rly old sex doll he bought off ebay
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wonder if he stopped for gas as he drove around the city a few times before getting to the point pretend year old is there to try and break down the age difference factor clearly if a year old can want a year old then surely you can too right right
creepyPMs,not_removed,at least she made him happy
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should of replied and you make me dry like a desert
creepyPMs,not_removed,i thought it sucked more to be him
creepyPMs,not_removed,you make me feel like im in a desert desperately thirsty
creepyPMs,not_removed,did did he forget that the end to that tired ass line is and youre the oasis or youre a bottle of water or something its like saying hey does your face hurt thats how beautiful you are without the because you must have just fallen from heaven
creepyPMs,not_removed,plus google it sounds like a first page google result or rather smells reeks like one
creepyPMs,not_removed,how am i supposed to find someone willing to go into that musty old claptrap
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah anyone that salty over a rejection must live a really shit life and be a really shit person
creepyPMs,not_removed,the cabin right
creepyPMs,not_removed,when i used to do the online dating i would sometimes get reactions that were pretty mundane well fuck you too stuff for trying to be nice and explain im gay and not interested at first i gave them the benefit of a doubt and thought they might have just had a string of bad luck before me and it was the straw that broke them now i realize some people are just assholes and looking for any excuse to get pissy pretty mundane well fuck you too oh my god i never thought id write that out
creepyPMs,not_removed,am sounds like insomnia was talking and no brain was involved
creepyPMs,not_removed,my faith in humanity really hopes the last two messages he sent were a joke but he probably was being serious
creepyPMs,not_removed,his little compliment was headacheinducing lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,op what does oft mean
creepyPMs,not_removed,ha to flip the coin i wish id replied with im not interested oh that was my vagina talking but then id still not be interested i need to think this over
creepyPMs,not_removed,unfortunately nothing says he didnt wake up at hes just a horses ass
creepyPMs,not_removed,means often just a slightly different usage
creepyPMs,not_removed,the sorry having troublw ttpiing is fucking repulsive this dude is being incredibly gross i feel like this person doesnt deserve the kindness of reddit privacy tbh
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a low life trash bag i hope he got exposed for the scum he is i liked how he ccouldnt spell because he was dying but all the sudden his grammar started to improve on the glimmer that he might see skin i wouldnt have entertained scum for so long even as a teen so kudos to that girl for ssticking to her guns while being unnecessarily patient with the turd its really disgusting that a piece of shit like that has a platform to reek on
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus fucking christ who is this
creepyPMs,not_removed,theres lots of discussion in this sub about why guys dont just google naked pics here we have a straight up admission that what he wants is to get them from someone who doesnt like doing it it is sick and rapey hes getting off on forcing her puke
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hope this sociopath gets whats coming to him he should be jailed for this and i hope to god no girls were coerced into sending anything to this sick criminal
creepyPMs,not_removed,yor better off without me well when youre right youre right
creepyPMs,not_removed,if im not mistaken youtube can contact local authorities if you report something and they believe someone is in danger idk what his limit is or if hes ever actually be willing to do something but just fyi
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is horrific wish i knew who this was would you be comfortable inboxing the name
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is by far the worst thing ive read in this sub ive been suicidal in the past but i would never use that as a way to manipulate someone into doing something talk about committing suicide as a cry for help sure but this is absolutely disgusting i got the impression that the girlwoman he was trying to manipulate kind of knew what he was doing to her
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have a daughter and reading this sub makes me want to kill some of these guys i hope she is as steadfast and strong as this young lady im proud of her for not compromising her morals for this chump
creepyPMs,not_removed,his pathetic attempt at the end to pretend like he was dying was awful i dont often wish for awful things to happen to people but this guy deserves awful things
creepyPMs,not_removed,my favorite part was help wont help
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats fucked what a piece if shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus fucking christ that is some of the most psycho shit ive ever seen holy fuck if you dont show me your tits ill kill myself and that will definitely be your fault dont you trust me she is amazing for continuing to say no in the face of hardcore coercion
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow this is disgusting stay safe op
creepyPMs,not_removed,manyoutubers continue to creep me tf up also im a bit uncomfortable with how much internalized misogyny the first victim had still was very brave to not give in to his empty threats out of fear
creepyPMs,not_removed,got only one dickhead giving a meger evidence suckahs greg
creepyPMs,not_removed,when he started to pretend he couldnt type properly anymore i lost it lmao
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like i know who this is
creepyPMs,not_removed,the fact its hard for you is why it will work is that intentional or is that an accidental pun
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit when he started fake typing badly all i could think of was dey tuk our jeerrrbs from south park fuckin oh no im almost dead need help soon only nuuuuuudes can save me
creepyPMs,not_removed,the manipulative shit this guy is doing is terrible but thats also really not the way to handle it the more you indulge him the more hes going to think its working even if you do end up turning him down hes going to think that he almost had it which just encourages him and makes him even more likely to try it again on someone else cause in his head he almost got what he wanted as soon as the conversation gets into blackmail screenshot it and contact authorities
creepyPMs,not_removed,see this would have been over it he said ok i respect that but its never that easy for boys like this emphasis on boy
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow fuck that guy i think this wins the sub for all time is winning the right word
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is fucking repulsive send me nudes or ill kill myself is the lowest emotional manipulation at its worst
creepyPMs,not_removed,this cant be real omg this is so pathetic that im laughing out loud
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like how those pills took literally minutes to start to take effect
creepyPMs,not_removed,woah wtf
creepyPMs,not_removed,how does it ever prove i cared about you would you ever do this if you didnt care about me flawless logic
creepyPMs,not_removed,whats funny is this guy isnt even famous he has a little over subs fucking creep
creepyPMs,not_removed,i listened to a podcast where these were read out loud i assumed this was a dumb teen not a grown ass man
creepyPMs,not_removed,the worst part was that the girl still genuinely wanted to help him even if she knew what he was trying to do jesus fucking christ
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you were comfortable with it it wouldnt be special fuck this guy right in the ear
creepyPMs,not_removed,too bad he didnt do it 😒
creepyPMs,not_removed,absolutely disgusting
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think there will be a double upload
creepyPMs,not_removed,that game probably has a disproportionately high number of perverts among its players no judgement just saying it panders to that crowd quite a bit
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my god thats so fucked upand how he pretends to keep getting more tired is just ridiculous how can you be so manipulating i wonder how he sleeps at night i really hope he wakes up someday and sees how much shit he has done to other people and then he really will want to die
creepyPMs,not_removed,your postcomment has been removed in accordance with httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is super fucked up and i cant forgive this person for doing this to others i was in a position with a girl i was seeing and she threatened to kill herself i didnt come out to england for a vacation with her its manipulative bullshit like that that just sets me off fuck this dude so much what a fucking creeper i also dont think op should keep this mans details private fuck him
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know that this is sick and he should never have done this but i also know wishing him dead or to kill himself is also sick wishing that he would get caught and got the punishment he deserved by the cops is the better place to be just wanted to put that out there im so sorry this girl had to go through that ive been there in a different type of situation talking someone out of suicide whether or not you know them to be sincere is truely heartbreaking and unexplainable
creepyPMs,not_removed,he kept asking even after he claimed he swallowed the pills i imagine hed suddenly make a miraculous recovery if he got what he was asking for pathetic
creepyPMs,not_removed,not only that but look at the times theres no way pills would affect him so quickly
creepyPMs,not_removed,and
creepyPMs,not_removed,i giggled at that point i went all the way from mildly disgusted to amused to vaguely sad its everything i look for in this sub
creepyPMs,not_removed,its horrible i hope if i have a daughter she never has to deal with anything like this
creepyPMs,not_removed,i liked howhe ccouldnt spell because he was dying but all the sudden his grammar started to improve on the glimmer that he might see skin its a bit amusing to imagine a man clutching his chest in agony pills all over the floor slipping from conciousness and then suddenly peeking one eye open when he hears the new message jingle what an absolute bastard though
creepyPMs,not_removed,cant say because of the subreddit rules though pretty sure what hes trying to do is illegal surely maybe mods will see and help
creepyPMs,not_removed,obviously cant specify who but the information needed is in the post the game name blade and soul is meantioned in the title of the imgur album the discord nickname is in a screenshot and reverse image search can be used on something
creepyPMs,not_removed,seems to be pretty easy to figure out google bns youtuber and you will find that avatar
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep its not about porn its about his ability to aquire them from someone who doesnt want to give them up he gets off on them giving in its absolutely sickening
creepyPMs,not_removed,sadly its likely hes done this many many times before
creepyPMs,not_removed,definitely
creepyPMs,not_removed,yor right
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes i have reported his youtube account with the imgur album his twitter deactivated after people started to call him out for his actions
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont want to get the post banned by saying who they are despite them not really deserving any protection
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was suicidal a lot in my teens and early twenties and had an attempt when i was never did i ever consider using my depression and suicidal thoughts to get things from people or extort nudes from someone this makes me so physically sick not only does this piece of shit want nudes from someone who repeatedly states that she doesnt want to and that it makes her uncomfortable not only does he use the pathetic dont you trust me bullshit but he treats suicide as a tool that can help him get what he wants he cares nothing for people who actually suffer through and endure the nightmare of attempted suicide or suicidal thoughts i really genuinely hope he learns a lesson and changes the kind of person he is i also hope he loses his job and faces serious consequences terribly disappointing to see people acting like this im sorry for anyone who has ever had to deal with this absolute garbage excuse for a human being
creepyPMs,not_removed,hosptll iss nlly mles awsay
creepyPMs,not_removed,same his avatar looks so familiar
creepyPMs,not_removed,there are no winners here really
creepyPMs,not_removed,sexual coercion isnt funny
creepyPMs,not_removed,i agree with your general sentiment but i wouldnt say its sick to wish death on a person who does this to people reading something like this will and should evoke strong emotions and theres no right way to react
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly even if hes caught hell probably only get probation or may not be charged at all
creepyPMs,not_removed,the downvotes here are absurd you got downvotes because people realized yeah me wishing he kills himself is pretty sick so they become angry that you made them feel shame hence the downvotes
creepyPMs,not_removed,right this pos has some fucking nerve cant believe hes still pulling that shit at too
creepyPMs,not_removed,the processcanstillbereversedyou must sendthe nudes
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly my first thought was i wish my meds kick in that fast sadly i bet there are a lot of youngyounger girls who have fallen for it
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe hed been popping pills for hours previouspretty sure nudes wouldnt have cured him from his imminent deadly coma tho
creepyPMs,not_removed,yet you ruin my entire life no you did that
creepyPMs,not_removed,wowthat poor dudei feel so bad for himcant believe hes gotta take responsibility for his bswowwhat a cruel girl op is
creepyPMs,not_removed,im sad he still has subscribers
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg
creepyPMs,not_removed,its that good reddit oc yo
creepyPMs,not_removed,she will but you handled it well so youre a good role model for this type of shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,paging unosefetish
creepyPMs,not_removed,look at the reply to this comment
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think its also about the ability to threaten and extort more pictures and stuff like that i really hope this guy gets put away for good
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe you can cross post this to other subs so more people know
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love your username
creepyPMs,not_removed,its not funny no but to me as an outsider seeing how low this guy is going just gets creepily hilarious
creepyPMs,not_removed,so they become angry that you made them feel shame yeah thator they just genuinely disagree with the comments sentiment
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,right im going to die right this minute if i dont see your naked bod sendnudescant kepp eyes oopmnndyyinngghaving troubkw ttipng i know its terrible but i laughed out loud at that because it is just so ridiculous and pathetic im glad she didnt fall for it although im sure it was unpleasant to experience
creepyPMs,not_removed,cant believe hes still pulling that shit at too not that this is acceptable at any age mind you but yeah you might expect this from a troubled year old not a grown ass man
creepyPMs,not_removed,its pretty damn sad at that age he hasnt figured out life enough to make a human connection and see real boobs then closest he can get is asking for nudes
creepyPMs,not_removed,to continue playing please insert nudes
creepyPMs,not_removed,i laughed harder than i should have at your comment ffs have an upvote
creepyPMs,not_removed,looks like he turned off comments im pissed the channel is still up
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wish i wasnt
creepyPMs,not_removed,i should do really but creepypms seemed like the most appropriate one given the content the album was first posted on rlivestreamfail after being banned from the gaming subreddit that the youtuber in question is popular on
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol mmmhm sure
creepyPMs,not_removed,pretty much makes him look extra predatory tbh
creepyPMs,not_removed,wait serious thats fucked up
creepyPMs,not_removed,if he cant finish his words tho u what makes him think he has the skills to finish another person
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am slowly learning to start with blunt but mabey he can help u relax s
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey i just met youand this is crazybut throw away my number never text me again mabey
creepyPMs,not_removed,fuckin awesome i wish i wouldve thought of that
creepyPMs,not_removed,this response is everything
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg thats amazing
creepyPMs,not_removed,i guess ill never know what the full potential of relaxation is i think ill survive
creepyPMs,not_removed,mabey haha that was great
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha im normally way too nice to people in those situations so that was my version of being blunt
creepyPMs,not_removed,if he keeps going feel free to take that line and use it for yourself
creepyPMs,not_removed,i unmatched him cause its been days with no response but ill definitely use that in the future
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really hope that blocked out pic isnt what i think it is and by the way this qualifies as workplace sexual harassment
creepyPMs,not_removed,umwhat the fuck
creepyPMs,not_removed,not ok tell your managers immediately
creepyPMs,not_removed,plaster this very same screencap in a massive message to everyone who wants to see it shame this motherfucker until he wants to die of embarrassment
creepyPMs,not_removed,id be a total bitch and bring it up in the company of others or like seriously emphasise that hes old enough to be your dad like he helps you with something aww thanks just like my work dad or something he wants a cup of coffee here ill make you a coffee i do it for my dad all the time emphasise thats hes old enough to be your dad and make sure everything is completrly platonic and then hell get creeped out by himself
creepyPMs,not_removed,its my profile picture for some reason he attached it i took it up with hr and they cant do much because it wasnt during work hours
creepyPMs,not_removed,do not do this this could make things worse if hes really perverted
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is terrible advice
creepyPMs,not_removed,they cant do much because it wasnt during work hours i would recommend that you take this over to rlegaladvice i think your hr is copping out
creepyPMs,not_removed,make sure they keep a record of it in case this perve does do something during business hours
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh gotcha at first the way the pic is blocked it looked like a wrinkly scrotum i thought dick pic but now that i look at it i realize its just hair falling down your shoulder😂
creepyPMs,not_removed,no way they really said that thats a complete lie
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats bs if this creep does something again go to hr and mention getting a lawyer thatll inspire action
creepyPMs,not_removed,okay good that would be one hairy dick otherwise
creepyPMs,not_removed,please take ukumachaaan s advice and follow up he is a coworker stating he is stalking you within work hours or not they have an obligation for your safety and this guy is a fucking creep i hope they do something keep us updated
creepyPMs,not_removed,this makes me sick its their responsibility to keep you safe and do something about this completely unacceptable
creepyPMs,not_removed,the golden phrase when you next speak to hr rep hostile work environment and ofc mention you dont want to get a lawyer but your friendpartner etc is pushing if work dont do something about it light a fire under their fucking asses like its of november source i work alongside hr dept
creepyPMs,not_removed,to this couldve been a twist if hes into wincest
creepyPMs,not_removed,hmm your username
creepyPMs,not_removed,if hes into it then she really knows to contact hr etc again though ive often found that pointing out a behaviour in a very clear extreme way to a creep works do you have childrendo your friends have children do you touch their asses like this what would your friends say did it make you hard when an old man touched you like this when you were a child or something or why are you doing this people dont like feeling shame or acknowledging that what they are doing is sinister i wouldnt do this oneonone though cause men can get really scary angry in public people will almost certainly ask whats going on and im the type to say he fucking grabbed my ass and now hes screaming at me if its relevant im a woman i live in southern sweden i have adhd so i realize that im more impulsive and gutsy than most in the heat of the moment
creepyPMs,not_removed,another case in point that hr isnt to protect the employee its to protect the company dont ever believe hr ever has your best interests in mind or cares about you
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i was like did he comb and straighten his pubes for the picture so glad it wasnt a dick pick that wouldve been creep factor x
creepyPMs,not_removed,trying to be edgy no relation
creepyPMs,not_removed,well lets say the answer lies in the median of extremes dont be afraid to call it out in front of people but know people in general can lack any form of judgement when put on the spot i just dont want you to face any physical relation over a direct approach this dude could just take the brunt of it and follow you home tread carefully please personally as a psuedonice guy in recovery please dont bash me for this i generally keep to myself to work on years and years to undo what they sell to men from birth a direct stern semiaggressive approach would and has stopped me in my tracks at the height of my issues this dude is arrogant pays no attention to all the equality talk doesnt realize that how he views the female demographic and their boundaries is fucked up and thats why hes single trying to smash on women half his age he probably thinks this is fine and it will either shatter him or make him more determined sorry youre dealing with this i hope a day comes when men arent slammed with subliminal messaging and taught a kind of culture that promotes this kind of behavior hopefully i dont get downvoted to hell 😧
creepyPMs,not_removed,the company isnt going to be protected if they turn a blind eye to this and she gets a lawyer its in the best interest of the company to deal with matters like this to avoid a lawsuit this is just a really dumb hr rep
creepyPMs,not_removed,luckily ive encountered little of this behaviour in sweden and ive only seldomly been sexually harassed so i wouldnt worry too much were far more egalitarian here than most societies which shows in how people treat or dont treat each other still thank you for your concerns and nice words
creepyPMs,not_removed,np thanks for the different perspective
creepyPMs,not_removed,im willing to bet this is the same type of guy who says im just being honest and gets offended when people call him out for being vile in real life too
creepyPMs,not_removed,is that guys avatar ted bundy or is that an image covering his avatar
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha he doesnt talk to women in really life silly
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think the best part of this is him calling you a whore when you blatantly turned him down wouldnt that be the opposite of a whore
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have never understood calling a woman a whore when she says no she rejected me so she must take payment for having sex i am an immature idiot and this is the best i can do this guy and anyone who has ever done or thought about doing this a woman is not a whore even if shed sleep with the entire universe but not you
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have no idea why but the moment i read the title i pictured gluskin from outlast i havent played outlast in over a year the frick
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is the guy id find on facebook so i could find his mom and send her screenshots
creepyPMs,not_removed,i bet hes lying probably couldnt even spit out hi irl d seriously why do men do this even years of this and still cant figure it out
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was unbelievably rude an obnoxious the nerve of some people
creepyPMs,not_removed,doesnt even deserve to have his username blocked out
creepyPMs,not_removed,uh bet he wouldnt though actually
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes probably one of those people whos very proud of the fact that he has no filter
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats pretty much every creep who would pm someone something like this
creepyPMs,not_removed,please answer this
creepyPMs,not_removed,lolol i had to cover up his profile pic and since he seems to be the type to do something rapey like ask random women at grocery stores if they like it in the butt why not use ted bundy lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i came for this
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my god youre right
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i was like wow wtf a serial killer as your default as you act like a year old with no brain should be locked up
creepyPMs,not_removed,the creepers do not subscribe to our earth logic
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think he was referring to the op as a whore in the traditional biblical sense i think he was using it in a derogatory manner to intentional insult op not to literally infer shes a payforsex whore
creepyPMs,not_removed,gluskin shudders
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think any of us will ever figure it out am guy and cant figure out the logic alot of these guys use
creepyPMs,not_removed,thems the rules
creepyPMs,not_removed,hi basically we dont want to encourage witch hunts images may have been faked someone could track down the creep and tell them that the submitter posted about them here or someone could use uncensored personal information to track down the submitter
creepyPMs,not_removed,im just brutally honest is all and some people cant handle it
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is pretty great lol op
creepyPMs,not_removed,not just a serial killer but a serial killer who only killed women
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh i get that i just think that people like that shouldnt be protected but i get how it might be faked or something apparently feeling that way gets you downvoted though lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh dont get me wrong i totally get why thered be those rules in place i just think when genuine people like that should be exposed but i get why its not that simple
creepyPMs,not_removed,was this like around you were such a fucking douche
creepyPMs,not_removed,well i mean you could say the same about a lot of the pms we get here but the rules are there to stop witch hunts and most people subscribed to the sub appreciate that so thats why youre being downvoted its not because people disagree with you they just respect the rules of the sub
creepyPMs,not_removed,i guess i didnt take my comment to be asking them to break rules i just saw this on the front page of reddit and thought wow people like that shouldnt be allowed to have their usernames blocked but i get it thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,at least you caught it early some people take a decade or two
creepyPMs,not_removed,i understand where youre coming from and often feel the same but i appreciate the rule
creepyPMs,not_removed,are you of high school age if so it reads a hell of a lot more creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,he really reminds me of a guy that added me a few years ago because of my friend she at the time knew him from a fan group of her favourite singer he would message me a lot and when i called him out on being creepy he said it was just some teasing he ended up commenting youre so sexy under my picture i was and had my friends report him i had to block him because i was creeped out are you over cause if youre not i would certainly block him
creepyPMs,not_removed,give a woman food she will give you a meal give a creeper your id hell show up at your front door ready to kidnap you
creepyPMs,not_removed,im just funnin ya never heard that before but its creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh just like when guys say that they should legalize yo girls cause theyre trying to be funny so disgusting
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh no call the police
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hate this guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,cuz im just funnin ya is that a thing people say
creepyPMs,not_removed,im in college and i get that im baby faced but this is a bit much i dont want anyone to be into me because they think i look younger than
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes pretty blockable to people of all ages
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am over still unmatched him though that made me more than a little uncomfortable
creepyPMs,not_removed,it was pretty common where im from for a long time actually
creepyPMs,not_removed,or when they spew bullshit about how any girl who has had her period is biologically ready for reproduction lol youre supposed to finish puberty before giving birth not get pregnant in the its first stages the age of consent is very necessary also the number of men who dont realize that states with a year age of consent only allow for sexual relations with year olds if youre in your early is shocking and gross
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes i agree i worded that wrong my apologies i sometimes leave creepy people in my friends just so i can keep screenshots and post them in a group chat for my friends to laugh however when i was younger i would have been too scared to keep a person this much older in my friends
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont blame you poopdy im sorry that he made you uncomfortable i hope that youre okay
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh i wasnt criticising you do you
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh im fine he doesnt have any way of getting any personal information on me thanks for the concern though 💜
creepyPMs,not_removed,punch in the throat that sounds painful without the fun
creepyPMs,not_removed,probably how he stops premature ejaculation
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like fun to me i wonder where he is ill give him all the punching he could ever want
creepyPMs,not_removed,i can make it painful even without the punching imagine sticking out the first joint of your middle finger like a thorn while forming a fist think of that hitting the adamsapple the thought alone is agonizing
creepyPMs,not_removed,he got laid last night tho promise is it really too much to ask to read someones bio before making an ass of yourself
creepyPMs,not_removed,whale fart
creepyPMs,not_removed,backstory after allegedly reading my profile which clearly states that i am not interested in meeting men this fuckboy decided to message me i attempt to explain my clearly stated preferences again but he decides to take it personal and get salty
creepyPMs,not_removed,i need to get a glass of water too salty for me
creepyPMs,not_removed,every time an idiot refuses to read a profile and then gets pissed when he gets rejected a puppy cries protect the puppies learn to read
creepyPMs,not_removed,these losers are so predictable they stew in their own ineptitude all day then go online hoping some woman will find their ridiculous flirting a turn on when it inevitably fails they turn on the woman as if she is somehow at fault because these man children have nothing to offer a romantic or sexual partner at all in fact they have nothing to offer anyone period they are a waste of space consuming resources that could go to far more deserving recipients
creepyPMs,not_removed,a trans is there a word for this where people call disadvantaged groups of people by an adjective that refers to them the blacks gays and all that
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe instead of saying interested in trans because i feel like that would be making trans people feel fetishized you could say im interested in meeting anyone except cis males just an idea
creepyPMs,not_removed,trump may put you on his cabinet as a finger size distraction theres hope yet
creepyPMs,not_removed,haaahaha fee fees
creepyPMs,not_removed,how do you get so many creepypms
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly and apparently he is going to post this on facebook so that all of his friends and family can see how fat sick and large fingered i am lmaoso funny all he is going to do is show them what a salty fat shaming transphobic piece of shit he is
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was stuck on that for a minute i gave up and just chalked it up to being old and out of touch with emoji lingo
creepyPMs,not_removed,my thought as well thats how the young insult each other these days s
creepyPMs,not_removed,by far my favorite comment of the night
creepyPMs,not_removed,guys like this get salty so quick
creepyPMs,not_removed,curious when you say arent interested in meeting men but state females and trans where does trans fall transmen or transwomen as an ftm i find dating sites to be frustrating as hell and if i saw a profile like that i may worry they would see me less than what i am
creepyPMs,not_removed,dehumanization
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,the funny thing is that this is the first time anyone has ever told me that about my handsusually people comment about how small they arei think he was just grasping for any little bit he could insult me on lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hear ya and if you could give me suggestions on how to be more transinclusive im down but yes definitely open to trans men and women
creepyPMs,not_removed,not for me i am attracted to people regardless of their gender identity but im not interested in meeting men from dating sites because welljust look at this subreddit lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,are they bigly baby hands same idea but as a direct comparison stand next to him and move your hands with his so hes always relatively large handed
creepyPMs,not_removed,i guess the best thing to do is say you arent interested in cismen i know that seems petty to add cis in front but it helps differentiate between cis and trans without excluding trans from their gender group its a tough area as i understand why people would want to date trans people and i understand why people would not want to date trans people but there are a lot who have a fetish for it though after a few conversations you can definitely tell who has the fetish and while i personally dont see anything wrong with that i know it wont work for what many trans people are looking for the novelty of wanting a trans partner just because they are trans wears off when they realize that its just like dating any other human being
creepyPMs,not_removed,first off that word is really offensive and you should probably not use it second i dont know how to make it any clearer to you and maybe someone else can explain it better but againi am attracted to all gender identities i dont care what someone has between their legs or what they identify as when i am physically attracted to someone i just no longer feel safe or comfortable meeting males on dating sites anymore so that is why i indicate that i am only interested in meeting females or transgender peeps its not about having a fetish or being a chaser its about my safety and comfort
creepyPMs,not_removed,unless youre trans yourself could you not use that word
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was seeing this guy pretty casually and i decided to break things off because i was discovering more and more unpleasant things about him like a history of dv hes had a hard time dealing with it but as of the last two photos on there i think hes gotten the hint lol edit one more cause its funny he kept saying he was going to delete me but didnt do it so i ended up deleting him and not even two minutes afterwards he texted me asking about it lmao
creepyPMs,not_removed,nice job not taking the bullshit as an aside though you might want to log in to imgur and paint over the names or the mods here might delete it
creepyPMs,not_removed,who the fuck spells cody with a k
creepyPMs,not_removed,my god that is beyond manipulative dude just stop already
creepyPMs,not_removed,but he loved you you hurt him you should feel bad s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love how forthright you were in breaking it off and not taking any of his guff good job getting out of it
creepyPMs,not_removed,can i ask what dv is
creepyPMs,not_removed,good for you to give it to him straight though maybe he will now at least learn from the relationship and what you said great honesty on your part
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read the posting rules and it said as long as they cant be identified then its good theres a shit load of kodys and i dont have him on any social media anymore so even if someone found my stuff he still wouldnt be connected so i think its all good thank you though
creepyPMs,not_removed,first names are alright by themselves same with last names usernames are no good as many people use the same username on multiple social network sites
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah that struck me as weird haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,well i knew someone who spelled it koti because his name was dakota so
creepyPMs,not_removed,that was my main red flag
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think i only know out of kodycodys who spell it with a k seems common where i live
creepyPMs,not_removed,right lol what really pissed me off was the whole youve changed bruh weve been talking three weeks i havent changed i just realized youre not the type of person i want to associate with
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes i should feel very bad obviously he didnt mean the shitty things he said he only said them because he was sad lmaoo
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha thanks i was pretty much done so when he started this shit i was like baiii
creepyPMs,not_removed,i assumed it meant domestic violence
creepyPMs,not_removed,domestic violence
creepyPMs,not_removed,me too thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah domestic violence
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah being honest was definitely important to me i dont want to lie about why i wanted nothing to do with him lol hopefully he learns from this if anything
creepyPMs,not_removed,your first name is in there also just in case
creepyPMs,not_removed,im gobsmacked that he even sent that many messages
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly
creepyPMs,not_removed,ahh okay thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,makes sense i just never saw it abbreviated dv before thank
creepyPMs,not_removed,he said multiple times that he was done messaging me but would send another right afterwards haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was trying to be nice but by the last one i was over it i havent had response since so i think he may have gotten the message now
creepyPMs,not_removed,all of your comments have been removed in accordance with httpiimgurcomvkforaspng httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,im gonna do it im gonna deprive you of my presence no iim serious i will leave you right now see im leaving right now this is me leaving i am gone do you feel bad yet no maybe you dont understand i said im leaving my god it sounds like me or my girlfriend when we jokingly storm out of a room except completely not funny
creepyPMs,not_removed,mgotw in a nutshell
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just read this to my boyfriend and were both cracking up hahahah that is the best
creepyPMs,not_removed,what was the point of those videos
creepyPMs,not_removed,can confirm am cracking up
creepyPMs,not_removed,glad i could help
creepyPMs,not_removed,damn that is pretty scary i hope your cousin notifies the police and that she stays safe
creepyPMs,not_removed,the tone deafness of this guy is just amazing and cringy jfc theres so much here the guy watches way too much porn if he really thinks this is an amazing offer and that of course a bunch of college girls would just all want to flock to him and sex him up at the same time if he thinks anything near his rear end would make others think hes gay i meanreally everything is just delusional hope your cousin stays safe op
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am not at all gay and will not engage in sex acts with other mens bodies their bodies im no lawyer but it seems like hes setting up some legalese loophole im dying to taste your ass if you want i will suck your pussy as well i mean if i must begrudgingly you probably will never get another opportunity to have a man as your own sex slave again this guy should be in marketing because even as a straight male he almost got me with that one the male sex slave market does seem pretty dry these days
creepyPMs,not_removed,the offer of a lifetime jackpot but for real she should call the cops
creepyPMs,not_removed,holly crap i would probably report that dudelike fast sounds like a stalkerrapistmurderer type person
creepyPMs,not_removed,i guess this would be considered a handwritten creepy pm
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah dude this is golden if the rules exclude whatever this is we will rewrite the rules
creepyPMs,not_removed,private messages that are written have appeared on here before
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes she really should notify the police especially if he may be on parole
creepyPMs,not_removed,she has to file a police report this is stalking there must be a record of it then if he does something else there will be an official record she should also file for a restraining order now
creepyPMs,not_removed,is it even a pm hmm
creepyPMs,not_removed,yuck hope she stays safe this guy sounds like seriously bad news
creepyPMs,not_removed,they probably wont do anything the first time in most cases but now it is on record and she can make a stronger case each time something happens if it does continues
creepyPMs,not_removed,i swear to god everytime they say cum over or cum anything i wanna flip my laptop i dont understand do they think itll be like a subliminal message and theyll wanna fuck them
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg why is it always inches that seems to be a trend with these creeps
creepyPMs,not_removed,nieve is a painfully bad misspelling
creepyPMs,not_removed,so immature
creepyPMs,not_removed,im pretty sure that would make any woman dryer than a desert
creepyPMs,not_removed,what amazes me is how many of these jagbags double down when theyre called on their creepiness dudes dont play it off as a joke dont call the poor woman youre harassing names just apologize say it was in poor taste ask for forgiveness and then leave her alone
creepyPMs,not_removed,it always infuriates me when these creeps do the whole wow youre missing out spiel if you reject their amazing offer as if there werent any other dicks to fuck in the world
creepyPMs,not_removed,inches eye roll
creepyPMs,not_removed,the best part is you still get similar shit from dudes if youre gay d why do so many dudes think their penis is magical
creepyPMs,not_removed,i always wonder how quickly these guys would back out of meeting up if you actually agreed i know a lot of people arent particularly great at eyeing up sizes but theres no way anyone is mistaking his more than likely for
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats very borderline rwtf what goes through some peoples minds
creepyPMs,not_removed,some girls are just toosnow
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know which is more upsetting him responding to his own idea saying it would be fun or him trying to make a pun with redic to show what a stud he is
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow op youre so immature
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just started using a dating site last week i was so nervous that i was going to come off creepy somehow then i see shit like this and i realize im not a piece of shit who assumes every woman wants to fuck me
creepyPMs,not_removed,redick omg make it stop
creepyPMs,not_removed,but op its raging
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus christ thats horrifying
creepyPMs,not_removed,i kind of want to start carrying a measuring tape with me brah i highly doubt your shit is
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh how romantic
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love how hes calling you immature
creepyPMs,not_removed,i genuinely do not understand how guys think starting a conversation off with sexual intentions and their penis size will make anyone want you
creepyPMs,not_removed,its always must be such a common size among creeps i suppose
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes am woman unit responding to activation phrase cum protocol activated seeking dick seeking dick seeking dick
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha that sounds so fun tho he kinda lost subliminal by the end there when he responded in excitement to his own idea
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like to give them the benefit of the doubt theyre just trying to gentley give you the heads up that the plans theyre attempting to make with you will include sex if you arent totally repulsed the next step is to entice you with the dick size so you know its gonna be fun
creepyPMs,not_removed,╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻
creepyPMs,not_removed,because inches is just outlandish
creepyPMs,not_removed,and what happens when his ploy works and she sees that its more like or hows he gonna explain that
creepyPMs,not_removed,not to mention thatd be really uncomfortable for most ladies
creepyPMs,not_removed,the appropriate response is i think you used the wrong ruler this was probably centimetres
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you speak spanish it still doesnt make sense
creepyPMs,not_removed,some people are just so nivea hand cream
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah its actually spelled niamh
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah usually she just gives me my slayer task
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think hes actually trying to say that he has hooked up with former milwaukee brewer melvin nieves
creepyPMs,not_removed,nigheev
creepyPMs,not_removed,right if you dont know how to spell a word look it up or dont use it dont guess edit and in principle i agree it shouldnt be this way but in life times out of ten youll be better off phrasing it a different way then spelling the word wrong and as long as youre not writing it by hand you can figure out the proper spelling though i am assuming that youre connected to the internet which you probably are if youre using a computer
creepyPMs,not_removed,the projection is strong in this one
creepyPMs,not_removed,anyone rational enough to do that is rational enough not to send a creepy message in the first place
creepyPMs,not_removed,at the minimum they should just not reply and move on once theyve been shot down i think actually manners would be a stretch for these guys
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i second this
creepyPMs,not_removed,you might think that penises arent magical but you havent seen my penis its and thick too youll cum just looking at it seriously my penis will change your life ur missing out bb s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think i got it these are loweffort pitches someone just sends these stupid messages to a people and of that group maybe or will respond positively of course the type of person who responds positively to a message like this are probably not the person id want to have sex with but id never send a message like this so
creepyPMs,not_removed,nothing sane apparently
creepyPMs,not_removed,what is redic
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg i know

creepyPMs,not_removed,see thats often the mindset creeps have when sending inappropriate vulgar messages to strange girls that this kind of attention is appealing to them so it must be equally appealing to women however most girls arent looking for casual hookups and if they are this talk isnt appealing neither is saying you have a big penis its just not a turn on for most people it also shows you are quite rude and disrespect of boundaries if they state this isnt what they want in their profiles plus its pretty objectifying this fantasy for example simply focuses on the creeps pleasure assuming the girl will just go along and want it just because he may or may not have a large penis and its usually sent to multiple girls at a time so its just annoying and has no thought put into it now having this in mind most girls get multiple messages like this every day making it even less appealing and even more annoying part of the appeal for men is that this rarely happens not so for women finally another thing to think about im assuming the girl in your mind asking you for a hookup is at least attractive in your eyes and your age well most of these guys are well not theyre usually way older or whatever which decreases the appeal even further im not saying attractiveness is why some are creepy and some arent not the case at all physically attractive people sending unsolicited creepy messages are still equally as unappealing im just saying to think about it from a womans point of view sorry this was so long
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats because that is something you would like to have happen where as typically girls get these messages by the dozen and thats not what theyre looking for they want more out of it than just a fuck boy
creepyPMs,not_removed,first of all no one cares second no you should not say shit like that then argue when youre called on it

creepyPMs,not_removed,the dick size is always the selling point do you think you can handle my giant monster dong baby
creepyPMs,not_removed,heres the thing what if the girl is like sure be over in mins whats he gonna do he most certainly doesnt have a giant dick hows he gonna explain that when she comes over and sees it
creepyPMs,not_removed,and saying is too average
creepyPMs,not_removed,she isnt hot enough for him to get that big obviously her fault
creepyPMs,not_removed,he hasnt gotten that far yet

creepyPMs,not_removed,creeping on somebody crossing boundaries aok but god forbid you make a mistake grammar is our lord and savior and you will hold it with the upmost importance if you use the wrong word even once in your life youre pretty much exposing how little of a human being you are we must destroy these enemies that dare spit on our holy grammar creeps arent the issue here there are people who are actually using your wrong the audacity
creepyPMs,not_removed,the creep used redick which sounds like ridic short for ridiculous gotta get the word dick in there somewhere i guess does this need an s
creepyPMs,not_removed,this auto script needs to be updated to be grammatically correct you are comment has been removed is painful to see over and over again
creepyPMs,not_removed,pokecumon go
creepyPMs,not_removed,itd becum true ftfy
creepyPMs,not_removed,oops i dropped my magnum condoms for my monster dong
creepyPMs,not_removed,god yes thats so fuckin hot
creepyPMs,not_removed,big dick dont play
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes got a inch dildo in his night stand he does them with from behind in the dark
creepyPMs,not_removed,in all fairness if he had a giant dick nobody would believe him anyway
creepyPMs,not_removed,on what planet is that average
creepyPMs,not_removed,good for you i like to say the vaginal canal can accommodate a baby passing through it your penis is nothing mate
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow thats terrible
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was using it to bother some people who were making the ops grammar a big deal and when leaving warnings i usually go to my user page and copy and paste the last one ive since made sure to correct it back to the original warning as you can see in my user profile it was only a few times too its done and over with now until the next time i make a mistake
creepyPMs,not_removed,noooooooooooo
creepyPMs,not_removed,how can i possibly have not thought of thatits very unbecuming of me
creepyPMs,not_removed,didnt think anyoned catch that one
creepyPMs,not_removed,the planet creepton
creepyPMs,not_removed,the spelling isnt the point of the post so lets move on kay
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know what it is about users but regardless of how wellmeant your comment was grammar is not the point of this sub comment removed
creepyPMs,not_removed,theres everything you said is now invalid
creepyPMs,not_removed,and people are going to get onto you for the wrong word rather than creeping im speaking as a humble english major but i feel this priority that some people have is a bit skewed i understand getting upset when someone has little regard for grammar but all i see is op making one mistake and people getting onto them for it but i think youre funny too upvote
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was making a point about how poor grammar can make it harder to take someone seriously which speaks exactly to his point about poor grammar not being reflective of the intelligence of the writer how is that not relevant
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wanted to make a comment that made him feel a little better i say you could be einstein and theyd still be judgmental and then i go on to say that i dont know why it is that people react this way essentially saying that i agree that its pretty illogical to pass judgement based on a small mistake in a message that still completely conveys the information it intended to with no ambiguity
creepyPMs,not_removed,by the way i didnt mean this in a mean way i meant more like your right its weird that people take grammar so seriously even when the intended message is still obvious and then i went off on some weird mental masturbation wondering what exactly governs how we judge someone for these small mistakes my bad youre right i need to work on my spellinggrammar too my main goal was just to say the einstein thing and what i meant by that was that youre right we do judge grammar in illogical ways because you could clearly be a genius and using bad grammar would still effect peoples perception of you i was just like rambling on about the anomaly of the way we judge people so much if they make a spelling mistake
creepyPMs,not_removed,a bit late but i think if its a blog or something more serious and you make simple spelling or grammar mistakes like these it speaks negatively of the author and about their intelligence i agree but specifically someone here had a problem with youreyour on a reddit reply i find this is the single most common example of a grammar mistake and your an idiot in particular is one ive seen many times over maybe they both sounding the same adds to the mistake but what it shows mostly i think is that people are typing fast when i stand in line at the grocery store and check reddit and do a quick reply i can easily just make the mistake myself and then later have to correct it generally in more serious situations i think you are right but in not so serious situations when just typing out fast people can make these simple mistakes easily and its not really telling of their intelligence more telling they were in a rush imo im on desktop now and with free time so i can type out with more thought and without rushing one last thing the reason why the focus on spellinggrammar irritates me more frequently than not is that the focus becomes on that instead of the actual content
creepyPMs,not_removed,im dumb i responded to the wrong comment duh
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats cool and your heart was in the right place but just be careful with those kinds of comments okay
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol no worries
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah should i delete it
creepyPMs,not_removed,im sure the people youre targeting with this post appreciate the sentiment and im glad you learned something however the dig at fat people isnt necessary and makes you sound like an asshole also your username is kind of ironic now
creepyPMs,not_removed,it never ceases to amaze me how many men dont believe women who explain what its like to be a woman then they set up an experiment that has been done hundreds of times before and are shocked when they discover what women have been saying all along also fatties gtfo
creepyPMs,not_removed,theres a difference between reading about an experiment and actually performing one i think the point was that the experiment shouldnt have been necessary as thousands of women have written about this sort of thing and talk about it over and over and over again you shouldnt need to see it directly for yourself to believe it but if that motivates you to correct any of your own behavior that you recognize as problematic then i guess thats a good thing and yes fatties and thats where you kill any motivation anyone would have to give you the benefit of the doubt about your supposed enlightenment welcome to the male perspective it comes with its own problems thats your perspective and its entirely in your control saying it that you give the impression that you havent actually learned much of anything dismissing it as just the way us men are
creepyPMs,not_removed,nobody gives a shit if the progression you make on one hand is invalidated by ignorance on the other hand if you came here seeking validation for your thoughts you could have taken a second to read through our rules then you would have realized were against body shaming and we identify as a feminist and women friendly community that includes the women you listed above because they still matter in the world regardless if you find them pleasing to your eye or not no one is going to applaud you if to fix race relations you need to throw a different one under the bus you would still look like a racist to a bunch of people you can make all the progress in the world in your mind and still be a shitty person people dont like take the browbeating as you call it as these fine people here caring about your progression within improving man women dynamics theyre trying to help you through the next stage because its something you have to constantly work at for it to mean anything there are women here telling you how they feel by your words and actions disregarding it tells them and me that youre not fully sincere in your motives or that youre bragging over the small accomplishment you made please read through our rules in full as this will be your only warning we welcome diversity here not ignorance youre free to be ignorant about peoples bodies in other subreddits not here
creepyPMs,not_removed,dude you blew it body shaming is shitty
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks for the browbeating sorry youre not getting the pats on the back you were expecting ill be sure to not share any proactive measures i take when it comes to improving malefemale dynamics anymore if this is your idea of proactively trying to improve malefemale dynamics then yes i agree its probably better if you just keep it yourself
creepyPMs,not_removed,i see it as a social tool to motivate members within a group to conform to societal norms that advance the interests of the group thats why were trying to tell you how shitty your mindset is to motivate you to change for the better see how its not working
creepyPMs,not_removed,the fuck what are you an antifat eugenics pusher fucking group of skinny people
creepyPMs,not_removed,what society forces people to be skinny and pray tell how the good fuck do they enforce it
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like a drunk message to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,drunk or desperate will we ever know
creepyPMs,not_removed,u were really enjoyable something about this manner of phrasing is very unnerving to me especially that i see it regularly in creepyppms its not i enjoyed talking to you its you were enjoyable its somehow both dehumanising and taking any agency away from op like shes a piece of cheesecake or something eww
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah probably i guess the message in itself isnt too creepy but i found it kind of unnerving that he remembered me from brief meeting where nothing significant happened months later
creepyPMs,not_removed,completely ive seen them so many times it fits the drunk profile
creepyPMs,not_removed,why not both then again im not proud of some of the texts ive sent
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep pretty much its totally objectifying now that you mentioned it though i never thought about it like that before
creepyPMs,not_removed,are you lost or do you just not get what this reddit is about read the rules please
creepyPMs,not_removed,its creepy its not dic pic out of nowhere creepy but its creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,nothing good happens after am
creepyPMs,not_removed,it is tweets with me i am good about not texting tweeting can be out there
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah it gives a distinct impression that what he enjoyed was not as much your company and input into the conversation as you as a pretty thing he was talking at a receiver of sorts its gross
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i get shirtless snapchats a lot haha but not dick pics
creepyPMs,not_removed,do you not know how to interact with another living person is a question for the ages on this sub op
creepyPMs,not_removed,did he just call you a weirdo thats some serious projection right there
creepyPMs,not_removed,guess that means youre gay now classic i love it
creepyPMs,not_removed,that ending though perfect i can just imagine his little face wait what no thats not hey come back okay youre a girl dont block me
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive asked people that so often they get so defensive when asked that
creepyPMs,not_removed,im also sure losa is slang for loser im not sure but i think he was the one that lost here
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks i figure that would get to them the most
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah but that would show he has some level of decency
creepyPMs,not_removed,deleted
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think anyone wants him
creepyPMs,not_removed,relax is there any reason to think theyd try to track you down did you post the pics you sent on any other site is your kik name the same as any other of your accounts
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have a kik and i should remember this but is kik one of those apps that sends a photo as soon as you take it what i usually do with apps like that is switch out to my camera and take the photo inspect it because im paranoid and then send it
creepyPMs,not_removed,this reminds me of when i used to play league of legends maybe or so years ago when i was underage and would talk to random men online i remember specifically i talked to this guy who lived a state over and was very abrasive and dominant in nature if you wanna put it that way he was very demanding and got frustrated if you didnt respond to him at a rate of his liking i remember one time i was being distant with him because i started getting more and more bad vibes from the way he talked to me i stopped responding to him for a couple hours and then he sent me a text with my address in it basically it was like xxxxx xxx xxxxxx xx xxxxx does this address look familiar to you i was freaking out cause i didnt understand how he knew my address turned out i had my location on my photos and he tracked it from there i learned my lesson from that ugh so scary this same guy told me he would hunt me down bring his dog with rub peanut butter on me and watch his dog lick it all off nope nope nope nope nope all of the nopes ever
creepyPMs,not_removed,if they have a full view of your face it may technically be possible if you post the same pictures you sent him anywhere publicly with any sort of social media attached they could theoretically use that as a base to track you however as long as you kept your name and location out of the conversation you realistically have not much to worry about chances are they will never see your face again just keep any social media privacy locked down like facebook and dont post ant pictures of your face with any accounts that may be attached to any personally identifiable information i wouldnt put much thought into it the chances of them knowing how to track you down with those pictures is very low
creepyPMs,not_removed,the only thing that got me worried is that they got a little aggressive when i said i had to go nothing too worrying and i easily could be interpreting their emotions wrong nope just kik and my kik name is independent from any other accounts i know im probably overreacting i just needed to hear someone else say it you know
creepyPMs,not_removed,this comes off as blaming op
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think youre fine most people wouldnt do something like that we just see a lot of threats on this sub you can always make your facebook instagram etc private for awhile if that will ease your mind
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wasnt trying to blame them i was trying to reassure them that nothing will come out of this what part comes off sounding like blaming
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats probably a solid idea posting on subs like that is kinda new for me so im still learning the ropes thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,silly didnt you know there are no women on the internet signed a woman who is actually children in a trenchcoat
creepyPMs,not_removed,you fucked it up op that was your chance to prove yourself to be a real woman tm to him dang you missed your chance s
creepyPMs,not_removed,and you would have gotten away with it too if it werent for those manchildren and their dog
creepyPMs,not_removed,idk why but for some reason people think calling a girl online a guy is like the biggest insult ever then theyre always like if youre a girl prove it
creepyPMs,not_removed,so did he demand nudes after this you know to prove youre a man
creepyPMs,not_removed,this has happened to me on several occasions some chucklefuck will start calling me sir in every reply like im just gonna get so flustered and upset ill send nudes to prove him wrong these arent the brightest crayons in the box were dealing with
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg op i had almost an httpiimgurcombutvdgjjpg with this same person i assume a month ago i wonder what their story is
creepyPMs,not_removed,i got this the other day in omegle are you a female yes no you arent you fucking liar disconnect lol some people are just sad
creepyPMs,not_removed,if im in a situation like this i usually just say yeah i am a guy and then they stop pestering me usually its not worth the arguments for me for the sake of confirming my gender
creepyPMs,not_removed,guess ill have to tell my daughter her birth was an illusion p s kiddo youre a guy in real life
creepyPMs,not_removed,i went to work did a business
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow im actually one child in three trenchcoats what are the odds
creepyPMs,not_removed,you gave birth to three children while in a trench coat or you gave birth to three children who were all wearing trench coat when they came out
creepyPMs,not_removed,shoulda slang it them titties out damn
creepyPMs,not_removed,they want photo proof
creepyPMs,not_removed,if youre a girl prove it wow flashbacks prove it ok attention whore ok
creepyPMs,not_removed,playing magic the gathering online the other night same username as here are you really a girl yup name d like im gonna fucking give that shit out to some no name nobody im randomly paired up to play a match against

creepyPMs,not_removed,ooooooh i read that entirely wrong i see now thats what i get for wake n redditing
creepyPMs,not_removed,idk why people feel so entitled to getting pics of random strangers online
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have a selfie posted and its not like if you dig hard you wouldnt be able to find something they want photo proof probably means theyre hoping theyll get nudes as proof plus these kinds of guys might easily be too lazy to do much digging
creepyPMs,not_removed,hell yes bats are adorable
creepyPMs,not_removed,amazon rain forest is that how far youve got to go these days to find a virgin ba dum tss
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly none of that surprises me

creepyPMs,not_removed,see you are kind
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh yas
creepyPMs,not_removed,the strangest part is how long after it happened
creepyPMs,not_removed,ok nows my chance i remember a comedy sketch about men getting into accidents with attractive women to get their number i thought it was just a joke
creepyPMs,not_removed,he plowed you car and is now trying to plow you solid plan s
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe there is a moratorium on hitting on ladies after they have rearended you
creepyPMs,not_removed,sigh not safe even while driving i wonder if it took him months to work up the courage to send you that or if he got drunk and thought the hell with it what could go wrong eyeroll
creepyPMs,not_removed,he had to make sure his car was okay before he hit you up for insurance purposes s
creepyPMs,not_removed,you hit him so now hes hitting on you
creepyPMs,not_removed,i agree it was a solid months after i read ended him i was surprised he even still had my info

creepyPMs,not_removed,this has to be a fake profile or troll i think i am sick regardless
creepyPMs,not_removed,ew
creepyPMs,not_removed,even if he didnt say that i bet it would quickly become quite apparent that he was not

creepyPMs,not_removed,oh god i want to puke
creepyPMs,not_removed,

creepyPMs,not_removed,even if he thought he had some remote chance of hooking up with someone who is almost half his age why the hell would you just go straight for id fuck you if you were my daughter like what made him think that would be the line that had the highest chance of getting him laid or nudes or whatever
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a weirdo tryin to make a change
creepyPMs,not_removed,best case scenario hes talking about being an overly protective dad ugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg wtf
creepyPMs,not_removed,makes me wonder how many people hes trying to fool with his age
creepyPMs,not_removed,if he keeps talking to women the way that he did here i dont think there is much to worry about
creepyPMs,not_removed,ps and all men as well sincerely a guy with stunning daughters who doesnt think about fucking them
creepyPMs,not_removed,well he did explicitly mention his willingness to take a chance
creepyPMs,not_removed,you either have a much stronger stomach than me or youve been here less than a week
creepyPMs,not_removed,no i think this is a sincere attempt at flattery
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have a pretty strong stomach i just usually grimace wonder about the state of the world and then move on
creepyPMs,not_removed,attempt
creepyPMs,not_removed,simply riddled with them l o fucking l
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive got fullblown aids
creepyPMs,not_removed,some dudes in a bar were trying to get their blind friend laid theres nothing wrong with being a wingman but they were straightup telling women were trying to get him laid i told them i had herpes shockingly and i kid you not they kept trying
creepyPMs,not_removed,riddle me this batman
creepyPMs,not_removed,now im picturing him agreeing to meet up but shows up with a dart gun each dart loaded with doses of penicillin and several other antibiotics
creepyPMs,not_removed,aaaaaaahahathis made my frickin morning
creepyPMs,not_removed,but medication can cure these
creepyPMs,not_removed,to shreds you say
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read that in josh thomass voice with the way he speaks in please like me i was entertained
creepyPMs,not_removed,this seems like a great idea until you get the guy who says oh sweet me too and starts sending pictures of his stds to his new stdpal
creepyPMs,not_removed,im riddled with it
creepyPMs,not_removed,im dripping with the hiv just completely slathered in aids
creepyPMs,not_removed,cn for std shaming which is not cool
creepyPMs,not_removed,gym movies pizza cuddling sex bbw hiking tennis
creepyPMs,not_removed,tom riddled with them even
creepyPMs,not_removed,its genius
creepyPMs,not_removed,best response ive seen in this sub ever take a bow op
creepyPMs,not_removed,the fuck
creepyPMs,not_removed,loooooooovvvvvvvveeeeee this
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow he expects about as much honesty from you as the btk killer expected from police huh
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,i literally laughed out loud at this have an upvote
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,like the skin of an apple
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have super aids
creepyPMs,not_removed,not hiv but full blown aids
creepyPMs,not_removed,dire aids its like regular aids but dire
creepyPMs,not_removed,ebolaids
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,everybody got aids and shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,howd you get that
creepyPMs,not_removed,as long as you dont got hiv tho and he cant get it i dont think itll be much of an issue
creepyPMs,not_removed,i guess they didnt like that friend very much
creepyPMs,not_removed,to be fair like of people have herpes the majority of people have herpes and just dont know it lol its really not bad like people make it out to be not even close next time just tell them you have aids
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeap basically what we learn in med school
creepyPMs,not_removed,some anyway
creepyPMs,not_removed,and his wife
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read it in liam neesons voice
creepyPMs,not_removed,whats that show like by the way i loved jt when he was first making a name for himself years ago but then i left australia and havent been following him as much
creepyPMs,not_removed,wtf is cn
creepyPMs,not_removed,given that most stds are treatable these days i think people should certainly be ashamed of spreading them not of having them though if theyre responsible
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was gonna point that out yeah this doesnt sit well with me even if its to push gross people away i dont appreciate the stigma this enforces onto people with stds
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank for info
creepyPMs,not_removed,aka im generic as fuck would you like some mediocre sex while i bore you with my boring hobbies
creepyPMs,not_removed,in what universe is it nott creepy to message a random stranger youve never met and tell them that you will do them the kindness of becoming their romantic partner but only if they dont have any stds
creepyPMs,not_removed,theyre like super everywhere all over me its crazy how much aids i have
creepyPMs,not_removed,just one teaspoon of super aids in your butt youll be dead in three years
creepyPMs,not_removed,aids that regular aids is afraid of
creepyPMs,not_removed,like a direwolf screaming and teething from my vagina
creepyPMs,not_removed,right thats what grossed me out the most if i had been telling the truth and i decided to go off with that guy that poor guy had very misguided friends
creepyPMs,not_removed,or the plague
creepyPMs,not_removed,to shreds you say
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really enjoyed the show i just finished bingeing it on netflix
creepyPMs,not_removed,corn necromancer obviously
creepyPMs,not_removed,content notice im seeing it more and more recently it seems to have overtaken trigger warnings
creepyPMs,not_removed,op we need answers now ง •̀•́ง
creepyPMs,not_removed,whoops yeah it means content notice and it means there could be something you find offensive inside that you dont want to read its something to use instead of trigger warning so you dont cheapen the word i guess
creepyPMs,not_removed,my knowledge of fashion forum terms says its cop or not but i dont think thats what it means in this case
creepyPMs,not_removed,i too would like to know urban dictionary has a few suggestions but none of them seem applicable
creepyPMs,not_removed,my guess would be content notice
creepyPMs,not_removed,uincendiarylemons you are our only hope
creepyPMs,not_removed,i assure you that its not my intention to shame or stigmatise anyone with an std its a boundary that he set not me and its not my job to educate every idiot that wants to message me maybe i shouldnt have responded the way i did but i doubt i was going to be changing hearts and minds with this guy any time soon
creepyPMs,not_removed,its a new initiative in the vaccination movement if people are too busy to come to the doctors or not enough time to hold clinics at their jobs then the shots come to them its flu season so well just drive by and dart you along with your neighbor for the flu then shoot little timmy next door with his mmr booster and hep b first dose just send us a post card in the mail with your address allergies and requested doses or go to our friendly mobile site to schedule your drive by
creepyPMs,not_removed,ok good to know im gonna try it out tonight
creepyPMs,not_removed,first time ive seen it thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,tell us op it might be important for our sexual health
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is excellent reddit has run that word into the ground and ruined it for genuine use
creepyPMs,not_removed,very close its actually contagious nookie
creepyPMs,not_removed,concentrated nitroglycerin
creepyPMs,not_removed,lets imagine ops profile says theyre interested in a longterm romantic relationship the creeps first response was about stds which makes if seem like theyre only interested in sex which conflicts with ops profile which is creepy also they have never talked before and offer to become a longterm significant other on day one which is creepy lets imagine ops profile says theyre interested only in casual sex the creeps first response was about becoming their boyfriend which conflicts with ops profile which is creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,it is not normal in your very first message to some stranger to simultaneously ask her to be your girlfriend and share her medical history with you each ask is creepy alone and put together they are mega creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,is it perfectly normal to approach someone youve never met or spoken to and tell them youd love to be their boyfriend if they dont have any stis
creepyPMs,not_removed,it was always being misused trigger warning was never meant to avoid things you disagree with it was to avoid triggers that induce anxiety attacks typically for people with ptsd from war or rape or anything else really
creepyPMs,not_removed,not in the very first freakin message though
creepyPMs,not_removed,that didnt answer my question it seems that your opinion opposes the majority opinion here anyway
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah its amazing how many piece of shit dudes will message you when you start posting on sjw subs srs is probably the biggest one for being brigaded by bigots and far right freeze peach reactionaries
creepyPMs,not_removed,jeez you need to buy some asshole repellent seriously you seem to have loads of absolute douches on your case is there a gang of them or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,i still say i doubt hes out of high school
creepyPMs,not_removed,i grew up in a time when one person with lots of sockpuppets was not unheard of so maybe
creepyPMs,not_removed,a lot of them arent hence being raging dickweed morons haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have no idea what that means im afraid
creepyPMs,not_removed,a sockpuppet is an alt account that the owner uses to back them up pretending like the sockpuppet and the original account are two different people
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah gotcha so maybe just one douche with multiple aliases a douche all the same
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats been the case for every sockpuppeteer ive met
creepyPMs,not_removed,it ended up being the guys year old nephew who had borrowed his uncles phone while he went out with his friends the uncle apologized and said that the kid was gonna get in trouble for it i would post pictures of the rest of the conversation but this happened over half a year ago and the phone i had is now broken and has since been replaced
creepyPMs,not_removed,ill floss your nutsack with barbed wire is the most intense threat ive ever heard
creepyPMs,not_removed,what the hell yeah let me threaten this person then theyll have to accept my offer
creepyPMs,not_removed,ill let you fuck my wife who has no say in the matter
creepyPMs,not_removed,im just trying to figure out the rationale here a mistake i know you turned down my initial offer so i will beat you up and do horrific things to you in order to force you to have sex with my wife in order for me to get your xbox this is an even exchange yup checks out
creepyPMs,not_removed,now that he whooped my ass i have a trading partner for life thanks craigslist
creepyPMs,not_removed,ill whoop dat ass and then youll think huh you know what they might not know to what i am referring right there at the endthey might infer i mean they will think about the ass whooping they just received or that they will just be thinking in a general sense about trading having it be its own sentence brings it back around nicely they are sure to get the full meaning now nailed it
creepyPMs,not_removed,fickung nr ass bitch he lapsed into german for a second there
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had a guy threaten to rape and kill me for asking for less on gamecube games
creepyPMs,not_removed,poor negotiation after the wife offer the counter is obvs and the
creepyPMs,not_removed,the correct response would have been i fuck your wife anyway
creepyPMs,not_removed,ps i would have bought that
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats a good fucking deal op
creepyPMs,not_removed,some marketing lessons to be learned
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus fucking christ
creepyPMs,not_removed,plot twist replaced with that ipad
creepyPMs,not_removed,why do i have a hard time believing it was actually the year old nephew
creepyPMs,not_removed,im sure it was just a wrong turn of phrase but you said couple of months in the title not a few to indicate more than six also how did you get these pictures and not the rest if the old phones broken can you not get the other messages the same way thats such a twelve year old thing to do my nephew bought games online with my credit card once i think its easier for them to break the rules in a digital world nephew hasnt done it since just by seeing the effect it had on me was very disappointed at the time but hes really grown from the experience worth the money in the end
creepyPMs,not_removed,and from a year old
creepyPMs,not_removed,barb wire she lives just down the street and shes a real kinky lady
creepyPMs,not_removed,and who married a year old
creepyPMs,not_removed,and he didnt even wait for op to respond
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like he just got confused and found himself in the wrong section of craigslist an honest mistake
creepyPMs,not_removed,perhaps he had descartes famous line cogito ergo sum i think therefore i am in mind his plan might have been to whoop dat ass which would cause op to think and therefore op would know he exists he was trying to save op a lifetime of existential angst by giving him a whooping the memory of which would always let op know he exists
creepyPMs,not_removed,uh
creepyPMs,not_removed,the negotiations were short
creepyPMs,not_removed,it was pretty obvious that he wasnt lying the uncle didnt spell like he was
creepyPMs,not_removed,if youve ever played an online game opposite a year old this language should not surprise you
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean as someone that once attended middle school i can attest that this sounds exactly like a year old
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol it sounds exactly like a year old xd no man would be willing to let someone fuck his wife for a game system then go to threats xd
creepyPMs,not_removed,im actually reposting my own post on runexpected from months ago as to why i said a few in the title i was trying to sell my xbox half a year ago just sounded too oddly specific in my mind
creepyPMs,not_removed,a year old
creepyPMs,not_removed,balls
creepyPMs,not_removed,makes sense kid wanted that xbox
creepyPMs,not_removed,school in scotland was different we didnt sound like that at all
creepyPMs,not_removed,well that makes perfect sense im not even really that bothered so i dont know why i asked i agree that would have been but that just cements my theory that it was just a mistake you wrote a couple i would have shit my pants if someone had sent that to me haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats thats exactly how i remembered kids talking in grade and kids now have the benefit of the internet to up their insults
creepyPMs,not_removed,it was a year old check my comment here
creepyPMs,not_removed,and was willing to trade his or his uncles ipad for it
creepyPMs,not_removed,kid probably forgot to delete the texts or just didnt think his uncle would notice them op could have also responded later after the uncle got his phone back
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep probably regional i grew up in a wealthy white conservative suburb in southern california with a bunch of punk skater friends i was twelve in and virtually every kid was a foulmouthed dick including me
creepyPMs,not_removed,us either we were too busy calling people posers lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,completely understood i would have thought the exact same thing if i were you
creepyPMs,not_removed,do you also remember them needlessly repeating words and ending statements with question marks
creepyPMs,not_removed,or wife
creepyPMs,not_removed,i assume and wife not or
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wont do anything if youre not cool with it im not cool with it come onnnn please just once
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am really horny and it would help me and that is ops problemhow again god i hate this way of trying to pass off jerking off as some kind of human need that we should all be charitable enough to aid them in
creepyPMs,not_removed,i want to know if can i ask you an odd question ever ends in a nonsexual question or a question thats not a setup for sexual innuendo can i ask you an odd question sure have you ever thrown an overripe fruit at a onearmed man who is your least favorite astronaut why do our thumbs only have one knuckle what happened to that other knuckle do you know tell me your knuckle deprivation secrets
creepyPMs,not_removed,just the tip cmon
creepyPMs,not_removed,can i ask you an odd question or a weird question or any variation thereof almost always means can i be wildly inappropriate
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you say no thats cool not gonna do anything except harass you again and again might be paraphrasing just a little
creepyPMs,not_removed,ewwwwwwww
creepyPMs,not_removed,one try and ill leave you alone
creepyPMs,not_removed,these guys have very permeable boundaries
creepyPMs,not_removed,but im jerking off to you which is really flattering surely so if you think about it im really doing you a favour here s
creepyPMs,not_removed,you ever think we all see different colors but we call them the same names
creepyPMs,not_removed,ever see a man say goodbye to a shoe
creepyPMs,not_removed,why do sloths come down on the ground to poo
creepyPMs,not_removed,buzz aldrin he knows why
creepyPMs,not_removed,may i ask you an odd question how many belligerent drunken honey badgers would it take to decapitate a walrus
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know that drives me insane
creepyPMs,not_removed,okay i guess ill cover the check then
creepyPMs,not_removed,boundaries are just a challenge to these guys
creepyPMs,not_removed,right i feel so validated
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes once
creepyPMs,not_removed,i say two working together mainly owing to neck thickness
creepyPMs,not_removed,good answer mistress
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is a pickle and grounds for your wife to file divorce proceedings have fun being unhappy with half your stuff
creepyPMs,not_removed,im starting to think this is all the same dude
creepyPMs,not_removed,his penis is probably the size of a pickle
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is a pickle and of course giving any response would only encourage him not dissuade him unfortunately
creepyPMs,not_removed,that reminds me of the episode of bobs burgers when the belchers pretend to be that one dudes family so he could sleep with the woman that was only in to married dudes i dont know why
creepyPMs,not_removed,i can see how you are totally reading his mind thats the correct answer to his illogical text p
creepyPMs,not_removed,🤔🤔🤔🤔 unless he has different accounts but who knows hes already a sociopath
creepyPMs,not_removed,a gherkin perchance
creepyPMs,not_removed,his dick is green better have that looked at
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont use link shorterners on reddit they are auto removed as spam also try rehosting images on reddit or on imgur as some sites are also flagged as spam thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wouldnt be surprised if he did the wording is really similar some people are freaking insane
creepyPMs,not_removed,true😕
creepyPMs,not_removed,my guess is hes rotating through throw aways spamming the fuck out of anything that looks hopeful and then moving on to the next name and group pretty rapidly
creepyPMs,not_removed,how are you in contact with this pig hope you blocked his ass i would contact his wife send her this messege then hes fucked
creepyPMs,not_removed,i doubt my responses have been hopeful at all
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know this asshole he just pmed me
creepyPMs,not_removed,i sadly fear that his idea of hope and ours are the same
creepyPMs,not_removed,fucken love it well ive apologised and that means you should just get the fuck over it you little weirdo with the great rack
creepyPMs,not_removed,this kind of negging is the worst not insulting a physical attribute or what you do to me at least its almost straight up dehumanizing calling you some weird little thing nope just a person
creepyPMs,not_removed,and here i was wondering if i was socially awkward when talking to girls in a respectfull way how did he ever think that calling a girl a wierd little thing is a pantydropper
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey sexual object youre a fucking weirdo i mean seriously a real weird bitch so when are we having dinner
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh god if you dont want to feel a part of your soul die do not read the imgur comments i dont know whats worse how much of a dehumanizing jerk this guy was and how he doesnt see how much of an asshole he was or the comments of the guys sounding like theyre defending him
creepyPMs,not_removed,i apologized now give me attention that guy not a dog creeper mccreepson you just cant piss on shoes and it be okay
creepyPMs,not_removed,why do men think negging works lmao
creepyPMs,not_removed,or l like this guy carefully place their head between the door an repeatedly slam it shut
creepyPMs,not_removed,when i was ish i dont know years ago i thought this was what youre supposed to do until i realized that its a mean and stupid and b you definitely end up destroying any interest you could have potentially generated bad memories
creepyPMs,not_removed,if your goal is to get some online action why would you even say this
creepyPMs,not_removed,tone deaf loser
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly like what if i dont accept your apology
creepyPMs,not_removed,right it just makes me feel gross like im some doll hes poking at
creepyPMs,not_removed,the person that said she plays twitch naked how the hell would they know what she wore he never described that she couldve have a turtleneck on for all he knew
creepyPMs,not_removed,i keep all my imgur posts private well just public for that reason i like it as an image hosting site but the community is pretty awful
creepyPMs,not_removed,sometimes i wish we could all hire eddie from bottom to
creepyPMs,not_removed,why did you think thats what youre supposed to do
creepyPMs,not_removed,then youre a little bitch with a big rack s
creepyPMs,not_removed,richard if he was real would be regularly featured in this subreddit i think to be fair theyre both really creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read a few books the game by neil strauss and watched that pickup artist show ok they said something along the lines of showing active disinterest in women is the only way for you to build attraction and raise your value since women usually have their protective shield up to get rid of everyday swarms of nice guys complimenting them i thought ok i have to go be mean since nice is automatically bad this led to a string of the types of ridiculous comments like this dude problem isyou can show this active disinterest without being weird or an asshole also you can just genuinely be interesting and confident and it will consistently be more successful
creepyPMs,not_removed,no sarcasm thats factually accurate
creepyPMs,not_removed,you forgot to call her pale girls love being called pale
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh no doubt he would its been over a decade and a half since ive watched a few eps of bottom and part of me is a bit hesitant to take off the nostalgia glasses and rewatch it like ive done with some older shows i used to like but now i just cringe at what they were
creepyPMs,not_removed,you might be interested in this neil strauss has forsaken the seduction community and wrote a book where he talks about his damaged views on women and relationships that were made worse during his time as part of the scene and writing the game sadly from reading some interviews hes done he still has some shitty views on women and has some chauvinistic ideas but i get the feeling he might be challenging himself and hopefully hell shed those ideas like he did the others he used to embrace
creepyPMs,not_removed,i recommend not to watch it some of the stuff they do and say is just so much creepier than i remembered its still a funny show but that other stuff kinda taints it
creepyPMs,not_removed,didnt he have that challenge book he released several years later or he got that one band girl and then she left him whats he doing now anyway i just learned that having a life and interesting hobbiesetc is way better and more rewarding than a formulaic approach to attracting women
creepyPMs,not_removed,he wrote a book where he hung out with survivalists and people who learned to live off the grid along with some articles about sar teams not sure about challengers ive read his book with manson and a bit of the one with jenna jameson but after learning he was part of the seduction community ive never touched anything else he wrote however with comments and interviews he did ive started to pay a bit more attention curious about his change what he did ill let the reviewers talk about him and the hot mess he made of myself before he got help one from httpnextsharkcomneilstraussinterviewthetruth a write up by httpgrantlandcomhollywoodprospectusgamemetmatchpickupartistgodheadneilstraussssubtlesurprisingnewbook a review from who was very cynical about neils new book the general consensus is that neil is a messed up person he does still have some crap ideas but there seems to be a real change to him and an attempt to grow up that he wasnt doing for so long im cynical and wary about him still but i do love a good redemption story
creepyPMs,not_removed,what in the absolute fuck this message should have stopped at or before i know youre straight does anyone realize that other peoples orientations do not magically bend just because youre horny or interested in them
creepyPMs,not_removed,if that doesnt make you wanna have sex with another dude i dont know what would s
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow you got a message from
creepyPMs,not_removed,im confused about the thing does it mean bi or a guy who sleeps with men but doesnt identify as gay ive seen this on craigslist and dont understand it
creepyPMs,not_removed,where the fuck did that come from what was the bestcasescenario answer what ps hey whats good op i kno you dont want to kill urself but would u let me shoot yuo throu the eye with a its just my thing lol dont judge xd
creepyPMs,not_removed,its the every straight guy is just confused and is fuckable mentality i see it a lot in the gay community its ridiculous really
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean he couldve at least offered to smoke me out first ha ha
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha thats a long word demeanor it sounds like weiner i dont like that shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,no i am a heterosexual male being creeped upon by a homosexual male
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not sure being hit on and telling someone you want to gag on their dick is the same thing you can hit on someone without being so explicit intoxicated or not i dont really care though i thought it was hilarious
creepyPMs,not_removed,people period need to learn some respect man
creepyPMs,not_removed,not just this guys telling lesbians on this sub i can turn you straight or i know you only like women but you should have sex with me anyway or you and your girlfriend who are both not attracted to men should have sex with me a man
creepyPMs,not_removed,oooohhh yeah man i have an acquaintance who cant see me without yelling that im a faggot slave boy or talking about come on my face or something not super charming tbh
creepyPMs,not_removed,im confused whom do you see offering because in this sub what i see is nonlesbians telling lesbians they can turn them straight and in this post i see a guy literally telling a straight guy i know youre straight but i a man want to have sex with you anyway
creepyPMs,not_removed,i apologize for the creepiness thanks for pointing out that youre male im still confused about and wondering if it has something to do with stigma but ill google that on my own and not waste any more of your time
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i see your point
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive seen a lot of lesbians do the same to straight girls as well and a lot of girls that do this to gay men its like every gender every orientation does this waaaay too often of course there are genders orientations that do it more frequently than others guys thinking they can turn lesbians for example why would people respect how others are born right
creepyPMs,not_removed,straight
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh tell me about it i havent seen that from lesbians to straight women yet seen any posts like that here
creepyPMs,not_removed,ok ive always seen it used in a context where a man is referring to sex with another man but maybe ive misunderstood
creepyPMs,not_removed,no not on here ill post in whenever i get one again im bisexual but dont tell that to everyone i meet why would they need to know right and i look straight apparently so ive experienced it multiple times in real life
creepyPMs,not_removed,from what i have seen it looks like it might refer to heterosexual men who might be curious or flexible i dont know regardless i am sorry that your preferences were disrespected op
creepyPMs,not_removed,i found it more humorous than anything it was very unexpected
creepyPMs,not_removed,photos took i think i just died
creepyPMs,not_removed,iirc angelface photography is the company alias that child predators use to coerce kids on the internet into skyping with them its a very real company but a lot of them say that they work for them
creepyPMs,not_removed,hostel much
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think using transportation instead of travel really kicks it up to a whole new level of creep
creepyPMs,not_removed,you fool of a took
creepyPMs,not_removed,huh i was actually wondering if it was a real company
creepyPMs,not_removed,this just became a whole bucket of disturbing
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg he can fuck off with that stroke excuse i had in my due to complications of a cyst in my brain dont use that shit as an excuse of ignoring no stop but something tells me it was just a ploy anyways
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre gf material and im a picky ass dater what makes people think this is a compliment like do they think so much of themselves that they assume its a great honour and it will make people instantly sleep with them before they lose the chance
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had a stroke is certainly a new one
creepyPMs,not_removed,how about lets play take a shot every time he says haha or aw who talks like any of this its terrifying to see
creepyPMs,not_removed,my vegan boyfriend and i are sending you the best of luck it sometimes sucks trying to date and find someone compatible or at least not a huge dick about it but perseverance also the times i dated guys who would use eating less animals as some sort of bargaining chip yuck just because you didnt eat an entire cow tonight doesnt mean were gonna fuck buddy
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh frustrating as an aside i havent been dating onlinenever give out my number because men are pigs and i cant handle it at all but i went vegetarian when i was in my last semi relationship and its one of the thing that makes me anxious about trying to date again cause its so hard to find a vegetarian guy let alone one youre compatible with in other ways
creepyPMs,not_removed,on a completely separate and positive note i am a vegetarian myself and this post its replies have convinced me to include that on my tinder profile i didnt initially because people can be pretty judgey with dietary choices but til now i didnt think about how important it can be for matching with compatible people though obviously not in ops case this time around anyway thank you for that
creepyPMs,not_removed,we are in canada so he should know full well that our old prime minister jean chretien had a stroke and was still somehow capable of running the country
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive never had a stroke but even i can tell thats extremely insulting to those who have suffered through one let alone two edit a word
creepyPMs,not_removed,not to toot my own horn but i was significantly out of this guys league in the first place it took quite a bit of selfragecontrol to not point this out when he said that
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah didnt realize having a stroke a few years ago forces you to be a creeper today science
creepyPMs,not_removed,man im vegan so literally all i can do is try to find a guy i like first and foremost and then try to encourage him to eat less meat and go from there because going into the dating scene thinking youre gonna find a veg guy of any kind is a pipe dream
creepyPMs,not_removed,no points do it for yourself i considered it for a while and have made a stronger effort since meeting a guy who is its a nice motivation and yes i guess some brownie points for a joint interestbut if i did it only because he does then that would be pretty shallow
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was the pm that punched the attackerrough protestors back around right
creepyPMs,not_removed,my mom has had two plus a tia i dont see her acting like this maybe shes doing it wrong s
creepyPMs,not_removed,it would have have killed the conversation im gf material well youre arsehole material and ive met my share of arseholes
creepyPMs,not_removed,is there some kind of local vegan scene or community you can get involved in you can meet vegan guys that way its not impossible
creepyPMs,not_removed,yea im actually just starting going vegan like a week now i guess i meant more finding some guy whose not going to go but bacon or make a big deal about it im generally a very socially anxious person and ive encountered a few family and friends and my roommates ex bf of all ppl who expressed extreme hostility towards me going vegetarian so it now gives me anxiety to even bring it up im also celiac so double whammy on the good restrictions
creepyPMs,not_removed,my girlfriend is vegetarian but we still make meals together and go out to eat quite a bit once you get used to finding places or making meals that accommodate both preferences its not a difficult thing to get around plus some vegan sausage is pretty tasty although we do live in a large liberal city so that helps
creepyPMs,not_removed,it can work my husband decided to go vegan last year i never thought it would happen
creepyPMs,not_removed,i honestly dont see why anyone would care but people are just weird and pushy i guess i dated a girl for years who couldnt physically have more than of protein a day which meant basically no meat or dairy and it was no big deal ill never understand why people get all upset when someone chooses to not eat meat i mean ffs a high percentage of americans choose to pretty much never go near vegetables and no one seems to give one shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,can i be the zach braff to your david cross
creepyPMs,not_removed,for vegans its a bit bigger of a deal though especially ethical vegans because its very difficult to love someone while watching them engage in behaviors that destroy the environment and contribute to animal abuse ive dated nothing but omnivores and the day to day figuring out what to eat stuff is hardly even an issue its moreso the morality of it
creepyPMs,not_removed,eating meat isnt a personal choice tho its not a personal choice if the choice affects other beings im not going to get into a big vegan debate on this sub but all i meant by that was in all of the relationships ive been in since going vegan my partner has cut out at least one animal product not because i asked him to but because being around me opened his eyes to a particular issue surrounding the product he cut out
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think a lot of ppl are really defensive about their food choices and weirdly take it personally when youre out to dinner and it comes up when youre talking to the waiter even though i personally and most other ppl i know dont bring it up as a judgement i think a lot of ppl deep down are uncomfortable with the current factory farming system but not enough to do anything about it but when someone else chooses personal action and they face that they feel singled out or criticized then you spend minutes talking about it while waiting for the food to come and you get attacked but also dont want to be a dick and bring up actual examples of treatment of animals that have caused you to make the decision i also worked in a steakhouse before going vegetarian and witnessed it quite a bit with customers a lot of other ppl are super chill though and just say thats cool ill have the chicken and the discussion is over
creepyPMs,not_removed,deleted
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh okay fair enough
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah wonder why they deleted it
creepyPMs,not_removed,so for eggs when bought from the store even though they might be labelled cage free or free range this means nothing companies are allowed to use that term so long as there are no actual cages however in of free range egg farms hens are still living in warehouses with no windows or ventilation cramped up against each other living in an inch of their own excrement additionally regardless of free range status or not the billions of male chicks that the egg industry produces are either tossed live into a shredder or just dumped into a garbage bag to suffocate as for cheese and dairy this industry is actually worse than the meat industry in the opinion of lots of vegans many people me included dont or didnt realize that cows have to be pregnant to produce milk so dairy cows are kept pregnant their entire lives nonstop in order to keep a steady flow of milk coming but of course pregnancy also means lots of baby calfs which are problematic because naturally they want to stick around their moms and drink all of the milk which is supposed to be for sale so the babies are ripped away from their mothers extremely soon after birth males are sold for veal and females are raised as more dairy cows when dairy cows eventually give out and collapse from exhaustion theyre just killed for beef so essentially the dairy industry is the meat industry and these processes are standard across the industry even on small farms just on a smaller scale the crux of the whole small farm thing is even if certain tiny familyowned farms did treat their animals in any halfdecent way those still arent the farms that supply to the vast majority of supermarkets anyways and it would be next to impossible to truly buy all of your animal products from one of these farms all of the time sorry for the longwinded response theres just a whole heck of a lot more to it than most people realize i find is a really good video to summarize the dairy industry and one for the egg industry we are also always open to questions over at rvegan if you want to stop by because i see you like potatoes and we have lots of potatoes
creepyPMs,not_removed,definitely look more into it im in canada and was surprised that all of it applies here too its just the way the industry is not much variation across the board
creepyPMs,not_removed,he asked to see it you showed it to him wish fulfilled
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey im surprised they said thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,nice tosee a guy get what he asked for insteadof being shot down op that is the best response picture may have just made my day my wife one day texted me while i was in another state want a picture naked in the shower of course i was like hell yeah she then sends a picture of a bottle of naked juice sitting in our shower this reminded me of that
creepyPMs,not_removed,your wife us my hero
creepyPMs,not_removed,she loves to do random stuff like that to me lol i love her to death and till the day i smother her with a pillow
creepyPMs,not_removed,smother would be the death part right lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean they said till death do you part but the police keep calling it murder
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds a little by the book what buzzkills
creepyPMs,not_removed,why do creeps always think that hitting on people in happy relationships will make them leave their partner immediately like oh hes the only exception to my sexuality and i love him 😙 what about me tho lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive always been pretty cool with being open to things sexually thanks having gay dads and met my boyfriend this summer never been into guys ever but thought he was ridiculously hot and awesome so weve been dating since i kinda consider myself straight with him as my exception but i dont get pissed if you call me gay or anything as long as youre not an asshole about it met this guy in class when we worked on something together kind of the typical dudebro but harmless enough we went out a few times trying to pick up girls but definitely werent really friends he was pretty confused when he saw me on a date with a guy last night but i wasnt expecting this
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel the same as you the more i think about it the more i realise that i dont believe in labels by todays standards i would say i was straight but ive found women sexually attractive before who knows what would happen if i was single and met the right woman
creepyPMs,not_removed,looks like this guy also wants to explore sexually
creepyPMs,not_removed,like i just dont understand why this is appropriate to text someone you barely know from a school project why do ppl care so much about other peoples sex lives
creepyPMs,not_removed,you dont need to explain yourself to anyone congratulations on meeting a nice partner its lovely to read
creepyPMs,not_removed,tbh i dont really understand labels like i understand if youre generally into one sex but you literally never know if one day youre suddenly gonna find someone of any sexgenderwhatever attractive so a lot of the time its just assumptions i hope that doesnt come across as rude in any way
creepyPMs,not_removed,one of my very favorite quotes is from chaz bono it is a highly evolved individual who falls in love with a person not a gender ive never understood why thats such a hard concept
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not in anyway trying to force you to label yourself as anything but a label some people in your situation choose to identify with is heteroflexible
creepyPMs,not_removed,that moment you can see this taking a turn toward the creep being super thirsty
creepyPMs,not_removed,why is there so much pressure to put a label on sexuality how is it any different than having a type say blondes for instance and finding yourself attracted to a brunette anyway op it did get a little weird at the end i wasnt really expecting what he was asking
creepyPMs,not_removed,so for the record i actually get ops idea here what i dont get is why the creep thought that leadingass bunch of questions was appropriate given where it was going
creepyPMs,not_removed,as a straight guy i just cannot fathom feeling like that totally unattracted to men but still able to find one that id swing the other way for super foreign to me but hey if youre happy more power to ya e too to
creepyPMs,not_removed,i completely relate to this i was on the lgb community for over five years when i was with my butch girlfriend i identified as bisexual but my gay friends argued i was gay because i hated touching a mans dick or having anything to do with ejaculate because i literally threw up i disagreed since i also disliked touching women and identified more as a pillow princess and proud some would say a stone femme meaning i get touched but do not touch which worked very well for my girlfriend who hated to be touched after i broke up with my gf i met a man who was nothing like any man i had met he was never angry never lost his temper or raised his voicesomething i had demonized about men in general he is the one sadly my gay friends turned their back on me when i entered a straight relationship i would get male friends asking similar questions all the time i even had one female friends male partner try to coerce me into a threesome since he knew i was bi but thought trying it on was the best way that male partner had already pissed me off asking why i had been with a butch woman when i could have a manthe pig there is no one like my man and honestly if we were no longer together i dont think i will be with another man because no one will come close i think i am considered straight now but will always be open to make or female just not when solicited or pushed on me
creepyPMs,not_removed,aannnnnnnnnnd now we get to the point of it
creepyPMs,not_removed,lmfao
creepyPMs,not_removed,man this is confusing so is this dude closeted was he wanting to experience the thinking he could come to you or is he one of those dudes so insecure that he sees you with one dude and thinks suddenly you will want to jump him in any event dude needs to chill the fuck out
creepyPMs,not_removed,a total of four women in my life were lesbians who were attracted to me two of which i dated and one of whom was a friend with benefits the fourth was a hell of a lot of fun but i was not attracted to her and it always mystifies me i am not feminine in any way but i was the only man that they were ever attracted to according to them they were still lesbians anomalous attraction outside of ones sexuality apparently can and does happen what i dont understand is why it happened to me four times two of them said i make them feel comfortable but what that has to do with attraction i do not understand
creepyPMs,not_removed,then wat
creepyPMs,not_removed,even if you dont consider yourself bi its like its an alien concept altogether with this guy youre gay suddenly i thought you liked women like it can be both again im not saying you are bi but most people would assume it based on the situation
creepyPMs,not_removed,im in a similar situation i consider myself lesbian but i am with my husband i fell in love with him if we werent together id go back to women
creepyPMs,not_removed,while its tempting to say he has some issues he might just not know boundaries and goes with a bizarre line of questioning or hes sexually confused that is well within the realm of possibility glad youre happy with someone though
creepyPMs,not_removed,im a woman and while never experiencing it feel much the same way as you do i consider myself straight but im open to the idea that the right lady could come around some day honestly i just see me as me sexuality and whatnot is not a part of my identity ill answer surveys but outside of thatmeh
creepyPMs,not_removed,sexuality is a weird thing i fully believe you can be straightgaywhatever completely but i do think most people need to realize you dont always fit into something one way or another it can be messy
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah its weird on the opposite side of the spectrum my girlfriend is totally gay but then ended up falling for me it worked out though when i ended up coming out as trans like a year later
creepyPMs,not_removed,if they arent used to demean someone they can be quite comforting since it shows that at least one other person out there has a name for what you might be dealing with people who get on this no labels thing are either afraid to confront their own issues by name or are simply far too boring to be worth a label
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know i wont because im straight am never aroused by other men never happened and never will happen
creepyPMs,not_removed,excellent quote my mom was with another woman for years my mom never really identified as lesbian or bi or anything in her life she had only been interested in guys and still after that relationship ended shes not looking for women per se she just fell in love with that person its wonderful when you realize that thats perfectly okay
creepyPMs,not_removed,while i understand the intent of your question please remember that this is a support sub not a discussion sub and the op should not have to defend or explain his choices or the way he sexually identifies thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment was removed in accordance with rule please reread the rules before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,its not for you to decide what the ops sexuality is this is a support sub unsupportive or antagonistic comments are not allowed please reread the rules before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,only if you buy me dinner first
creepyPMs,not_removed,banned
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh totally like i said i dont consider myself bi but i understand why people would and it doesnt bother me at all my dads always taught me that sexualities can be many many things and its not really important what other people think of you as only what you think of yourself as the complete lack of him thinking i could be bi was weird as shit but considering the few guys i know that are bi get told lol youre gay stop lying it doesnt really surprise me its like if you suck one dick youre suddenly unable to like boobs anymore no matter if youre a guy or a girl people are fucking weird and stupid when it comes to this
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am envisioning a guy that is so self absorbed that he thinks that he the creep is so awesome and attractive that the op should have gone gay for him
creepyPMs,not_removed,the world would be a much better place if everyone thought about sexuality the way you do i gotta admire how open you are about it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know its been said a million times now but i just wanna say again your attitude towards sexuality is extremely admirable hope things go great for you
creepyPMs,not_removed,you never really can tell what might happen in the future not that i dont believe you you know yourself and the odds of you feeling different are slim enough that theres no reason to doubt you but not knowing what the future holds is what makes life interesting why be so adamant youve nothing to prove to anyone
creepyPMs,not_removed,no problem i was just curious
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am thinking that s idea of a classy dinner is going to taco bell and you have to split a baja blast mt dew while sitting in the parking lot dont think ill be giving up my nudes for that but then again i am a really hairy guy and that be all my nudes are worth sorry about the trolls
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep sexualities are weird i find women far more attractive than men and would prefer to have sex with a woman than a man but at the same time ive only dated guys so far just because their personalities and attitudes have won me over and i just learn to love their appearances the personality is far more important than attractiveness its just that with women i dont need a relationship to have a physical attraction and with men i do
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes thank you so much a lot of people dont understand sexuality is a spectrum and people can change places on the spectrum throughout their lives
creepyPMs,not_removed,its like if you suck one dick youre suddenly unable to like boobs anymore for some reason theres a lot of guys out there who seem to think the penis has magical sexualitybending properties these are the same guys who think they can convert lesbians with their dicks
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow your dad is awesome
creepyPMs,not_removed,just consinder yourself pansexual and everything starts making sense
creepyPMs,not_removed,it violates rule number be supportive you were even aware of that by your knowledge that your comment would result in downvotes if youd like to discuss this further please message us in mod mail
creepyPMs,not_removed,i could have written this myself i consider myself bi because i am able to have an attraction to both but in general i say this while being in a loving long term relationship with an amazing man i find women a lot more physically attractive my partner is the most attractive person in the world to me though so thats all that matters
creepyPMs,not_removed,dads ive got two or well ive got a dad and a pop my dad is pretty awesome though when i told them i was seeing a guy he shrieked the mormons were right we managed to convert him pop was raised mormon and when they adopted me his parents friends went ballistic claiming they were doing it for recruitment purposes in the middle of public i thought it was hysterical but my sister wanted to punch him
creepyPMs,not_removed,you know how i said you dont have to prove anything to anyone you kinda are acting like you think you do i think thats probably why you are getting down voted cause no one cares how super not gay you are
creepyPMs,not_removed,we think very much the same way i think you put it better than me i have a boyfriend that i love very very much and he is more attractive than any girl ive seem because hes mine doesnt stop us talking about the cute girls we see while were out we have different tastes but we can appreciate everything and its just really awesome d
creepyPMs,not_removed,your dads sound amazing thats hilarious
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh man thats brilliant
creepyPMs,not_removed,lmao that is hilarious
creepyPMs,not_removed,definitely also being downvoted for comparing homosexuality with bestiality and pedophilia thats what earned my vote anyway
creepyPMs,not_removed,you literally repeated what i said to you in my second paragraph and then compared gay attraction to pedophilia and bestiality thats not really an argument i mean not a good one at least
creepyPMs,not_removed,🤔 why is this so important to you
creepyPMs,not_removed,also seriously the evidence and studies on the fluidity of sexuality are in their infancy we can so your heart rate and and brain patterns in the immediate moment thats part of a greater picture the same studies show bisexual men have a greater physiological reaction to sexual images of men than women but it would be irresponsible to draw conclusions about their overall sexual orientation if what they state also are you suggesting your attractions based on weight are as hard wired as that of gender i mean theres limited evidence of standard facial symmetry and hip to waist ratio being universal human attraction but standards on what is beautiful re body shape do change through history and cultures extremely skinny women were in vogue in the women you undoubtedly would describe as obese pulled heart strings like crazy in renaissance europe so might all of this have something to do with cultural attitudes and personal beliefs just maybe look dude im not saying that i think you are secretly gay or that the right man for you is just waiting in the wings thats not how it works it just seems pointless to me to be like no never ever you cant make me when literally nothing but death is destiny and they are working on that one
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not allowed to disagree with a generalized comment and defend myself when random people join in
creepyPMs,not_removed,ok see theres where youve gone a little wrong here theres nothing to defend
creepyPMs,not_removed,no faster way to get a girl to fall in love with you than to ask her to be your cum dumpster gah i feel gross just typing that
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey if youre really worried about your kik being posted somewhere googling it might help itll generally show up if it has edit i see your underage so ill link up to the resources that we provide for underage users again paging unosefetish
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe you could introduce the first guy to the last s that first guy has got to be a predator also your kik might not have been spread i found that this happened more to me when i was underage
creepyPMs,not_removed,really
creepyPMs,not_removed,off topic is that an old school gm screen i see in the bottom corner
creepyPMs,not_removed,sugger daddy not zucker but sugger
creepyPMs,not_removed,i will even pay u oh wow ten whole dollars how can i resist
creepyPMs,not_removed,take the and shut the monitor off lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just added someone with a typo and you came across instead at least the other creeps were more obvious honest about their intentions and needs than this guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i thought it was going to be your version of
creepyPMs,not_removed,and that kids is how i met your father ♡
creepyPMs,not_removed,i assume the adults who think hitting on underage girls online is a smart idea rarely are the most intelligent and smoothest talkers in the society
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know if much has changed since i was a young girl of but twenty years ago they tried to woo me with queries like do you watch porn i had never heard of it and was baffled in my prepubescent mind as to why anyone would want to look at pictures of naked people and have you ever stuck a cucumber in your and twisted it ewww no why would anyone do that there were a lot of weirdos in aol chat rooms im surprised i never got kidnapped because i gave my address and phone number out at one point in middle school to a fellow teen who ended up being a noshow in hindsight im like dang i couldve been had by one of those predators chris hansen caught who is all showing up with a teddy bear for the middle schooler he thinks hes about to bang i even remember my dad commenting on how one year old boy who called the house this was pre cell phones had a very deep voice i was so naive and gullible
creepyPMs,not_removed,sweet
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was also a super gullible girl ini think an msn chat room i look back on some of the conversations i had and thank god nothing awful happened
creepyPMs,not_removed,me love you long time
creepyPMs,not_removed,one two princes kneel before you
creepyPMs,not_removed,but he walked miles then more wont you let him fall down at your door
creepyPMs,not_removed,who came from of miles away to make love with u gee i dont know you sound like a total stranger to m good love ooooh good love see thats another story entirely come on over

creepyPMs,not_removed,suckysucky dollah
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh god now i have that song stuck in my head
creepyPMs,not_removed,and then leave him there maybe sweep him off with a broom
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was tryin out a new angle lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,meetme
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats what i said now
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was confused for a moment there i thought the creep was outing himself edit autocorrect
creepyPMs,not_removed,dem gurl
creepyPMs,not_removed,your fine af girl
creepyPMs,not_removed,isnt he
creepyPMs,not_removed,he is check post history
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah same whats the deal
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow thats really odd
creepyPMs,not_removed,check his post history
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like how he ends it with the possibility of you talking to him again hes a keeper
creepyPMs,not_removed,so heres my cynicalass take on it i noticed that it turned around exactly at the point where you said that hed like you in person and sent a winky face i understand your intention but i do also think that had a man said that he would not have responded as well he still ended on being extremely racist and as another commenter here pointed out talked about speaking again i really really hope that i am not reading the situation right and that you got through to him
creepyPMs,not_removed,what better way to insult someone i dunno personally the best way to insult me is to imply im stupidignorant there are plenty of better ways and what in the hell that asian accent part which asian accent
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow you actually seem to have gotten through to him doesnt mean he wont do it again but thats impressive
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is seriously impressive hes still kinda racist at the end but i hope you gave him a lot to think about
creepyPMs,not_removed,i suppose this is the closets well ever see to a happy ending on this subreddit
creepyPMs,not_removed,saw this work a lot in online gaming namely cod stupid no life nerd in basement go kill yourself nbsp hey you were playing pretty well wanna team up sometime nbsp sorry i was a dick yeah id like to team up
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow that is damn impressive nice work op
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe next time ill be much more civil i love that
creepyPMs,not_removed,statist reddit is a privatelyowned forum thems the rules motherfucker itll save the burden off of the taxpayer says the guy who likely lives in moms basement and feeds off of tendies
creepyPMs,not_removed,creeper keeper
creepyPMs,not_removed,that wasnt the full conversation i cut it short but basically he changed after i had stopped replying for a while i was just busy but i think he felt like a butthead i agree that this encounter wont change him i do hope it made him think
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh man i didnt even notice that
creepyPMs,not_removed,the stereotypical asian accent used by white actors playing asian people
creepyPMs,not_removed,seen that happen in lol as well
creepyPMs,not_removed,and he is he contacted me today and he dos happen to be more civil im glad about that
creepyPMs,not_removed,really thats awesome then even if he doesnt change making someone think about their actions is certainly a valuable thing im glad and thank you for doing what you did im still sad hes still a racist though
creepyPMs,not_removed,i figured that sigh
creepyPMs,not_removed,never switched from dota found it to be too dumbed down but ive heard the community can be very toxic
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow that is just hilarious
creepyPMs,not_removed,im still sad hes still a racist though i know but hey baby steps eh
creepyPMs,not_removed,tried to play dota just couldnt everything seemed so clunky to me i think dota players trying to play league said the same thing plus it just looked bad on my computer then again so does league the community in league is bad in many many cases but it can lead to some fun experiences like the one in the post
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i mean weve been playing dota with friends especially on lan parties for so long now of course we were playing other maps as well as some cs
creepyPMs,not_removed,hmmm havent tried having a lan party seems fun though we talk about it every now and again havent actually played league in a long while moved to brawlhalla about a year ago then promptly stopped playing that as well now i just kinda do nothing mostly
creepyPMs,not_removed,do u want some gold op i have some gold that i could give you im just askin if u want some
creepyPMs,not_removed,why doesnt he solicit a professional if hes looking to pay women for their attention
creepyPMs,not_removed,transfer the money first and then well talk he sends money you securely move it to a different account yea k bye
creepyPMs,not_removed,k isnt a lot
creepyPMs,not_removed,he thinks makes him a sugar daddy lmao edit im not making fun of his savings themselves or of people who have savings of or less that would be classist and gross im making fun of this particular dude because hes trying to pass himself off as a sugar daddy when he very clearly is not for reasons that go beyond his savings
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes been saving his fast food paychecks for years you should be in awe
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes not rich but thats a lot more saved up than the majority of the us population
creepyPMs,not_removed,depending how long you save and your age it could be
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like its not enough to be offering other people and trying to come off as a sugar daddy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i always loved the hornyhorny thing should tell him to rub his dick on a horned lizard
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should send him a picture of a turd and tell him that the turd is very cute as well
creepyPMs,not_removed,blackmails for nudes of yourself by sending you nudes of yourself ok
creepyPMs,not_removed,this dude isnt a mod here guarantee
creepyPMs,not_removed,nothing makes me laugh more than pathetic blackmail attempts check out this one posted on rchicago yesterday fucking hilarious
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like blackmail is a whole other level of creepy especially combined with a narcissisticego fueled personality they take things personally and i get the same feeling i got when i was young getting in trouble for something against the rules even when reading these sorts of things glad this guy isnt a mod here it would definitely be hypocritical if he were
creepyPMs,not_removed,what if i sent these text messages to your mom in
creepyPMs,not_removed,where are these guys getting the idea that this works like im even seeing similar phrasing in different exchanges is this a new pua tactic thats being taught if so its brilliant find a female who publicly posts nudes and threaten to publicly post her nudes until she sends you nudes thats some geniuslevel shit right there
creepyPMs,not_removed,how exceedingly pathetic
creepyPMs,not_removed,there are a lot of sad disgusting people out there with no shame
creepyPMs,not_removed,does this mean that everyone who posts to gonewild is going to get kicked off reddit thats going to be hell on the traffic stats
creepyPMs,not_removed,how uglydesperatepersonality deficient does one person have to be that theyll go online and try to blackmail people into giving them a nude pic i mean really i cant imagine how bankrupt of decent qualities this person has to be to have to use these tactics there are millions of pictures of naked women all over the internet he can find girls of all types to pull his lil pud to and yet he has to stoop to this shit guaranteed hes also the type to get pissed off that a girlfriend if his pathetic ass should ever get one would refuse to take nudes for him hes the type to put them on revenge porn sites and feel justified doing it
creepyPMs,not_removed,the only twist that seems plausible in this case is if you found out he became brain dead reading his own shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,most of here id like to think dont care what ops do in their spare time and none of our business honestly it proves that the dude is a entitled ass
creepyPMs,not_removed,again with the whole comic book evil genius bit beforeyou know it hes sitting there twirling his mustache and petting an overly fluffy cat chill out creeper you aint shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont get the logic of these clowns a woman has public nudes i shall threaten to make her nudes public
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow i looked at your post history you deal with a lot of shit im ashamed of my gender
creepyPMs,not_removed,when your dick pic uploads almost instantly at even your modem is mocking you
creepyPMs,not_removed,when did blackmail and revenge porn become a thing when did men get together and decide manipulation and coercion was a great way to communicate with women i had a guy try to blackmail me on skype that is why i do not go on there anymore he took my email ran it through a easy online program found every place i had used that email similar to google image reverse found my facebook took pics and peoples names he was saying the same stuff to me about exposing me to friends and family i was really upset and scared either men were always like every creepypm or the internet has corrupted themyou decide
creepyPMs,not_removed,my god it never ends for you
creepyPMs,not_removed,nudes even have copyright so if he does anything just sue till hes on food stamps
creepyPMs,not_removed,perfect logic how could it possibly fail
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes definitely i meant to point that out so no one got worried
creepyPMs,not_removed,i got the impression he meant he would post it elsewhere he just said he would put them on reddit not specifically rcreepypms
creepyPMs,not_removed,that was a wild ride i was not prepared for
creepyPMs,not_removed,the way that phone makes any two words connected with a period into a web link is also cringeworthy
creepyPMs,not_removed,this was here a few days ago or maybe some other cringe sub
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats the greatest thing ive ever seen did the coen brothers write that blackmailer
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah these blackmail posts are just next level evil losers because even thought they fail miserably theyre actively trying to intimidate and force women into doing sexual favors for them its absolutely disgusting and it horrifies me that so many guys seem to think that its acceptable behavior plus they all talk like theyre pretending to be campy bond villains its just ridiculous
creepyPMs,not_removed,op if you find out this guys mom then you should send these blackmail messages to her and tell her how her son treats women on the internet
creepyPMs,not_removed,pua
creepyPMs,not_removed,well shit there goes half the user base
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not sure its the pic itself that gets these creeps off but what it represents control over someone who knows though
creepyPMs,not_removed,its spread out over time i just post a bunch at a time when i get around to it
creepyPMs,not_removed,next time you can say him that people here know it think its fine and respect you
creepyPMs,not_removed,not to be rude but what is a cam whorethis might be a dumb question and are you one
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks samsung now my tech is cringeworthy
creepyPMs,not_removed,it was in rcringepics
creepyPMs,not_removed,i definitely would if i were able to
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes absolutely this
creepyPMs,not_removed,theyre generally referred to as cam girls or guys or webcam models for the official title they do sexually explicit acts on camera for a live audience usually for tips or donations i cant attest to whether or not op is or isnt one though
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not op but im assuming hes referring to someone who does cam shows online people pay to watch other people on their live camera doing various things im also going to assume that its not really our business if op does cam work or not
creepyPMs,not_removed,its so satisfying
creepyPMs,not_removed,i believe op has said she posts to gonewild but i dont remember any mention of cam modeling
creepyPMs,not_removed,so its basically twitch with more tits thanks though surprisingly enough never heard of that being a thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,honest to god i had no idea what it was before i asked but yeah youre right its none of my business
creepyPMs,not_removed,i used to do skype shows and sold kiks and snapchats things like that
creepyPMs,not_removed,i used to do skype shows and sold kiks and snapchats things like that
creepyPMs,not_removed,lets just say it predates twitch by a long shot
creepyPMs,not_removed,im really curious why anyone would blackmail a person with nudes for more nudes its baffling
creepyPMs,not_removed,my favorite conversations go something like this creep send me nudes me nah creep nude of myself me great so you dont need me to send you one then creep do it or ill post it online me didnt you get that online though
creepyPMs,not_removed,the logic is not strong with these people
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is hilarious
creepyPMs,not_removed,should have asked him if you could see his balls first
creepyPMs,not_removed,didnt even give you any time to back out well better get it over with fast i suppose
creepyPMs,not_removed,ummm nah sabrina
creepyPMs,not_removed,so many fucked up assholes out there
creepyPMs,not_removed,it really disturbs me how many people try to ask people that
creepyPMs,not_removed,gah not okay so not okay
creepyPMs,not_removed,sad that i already knew before i clicked on the post what it was going to be and i did it anyway sorry you got a driveby creeping by that gross bastard op
creepyPMs,not_removed,phrasing
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont understand this guys motives is it like a humiliation fetish or is he trying to send you to go harass some innocent woman or what
creepyPMs,not_removed,gulp fiction
creepyPMs,not_removed,is it just me or does anyone think the gulps sound like this is some kind of weird fetish
creepyPMs,not_removed,what is this universe where everyone and their mum are making these bullshit bets and how losing them always leads to some poor randomer having a thinly veiled fantasy forcefed to them
creepyPMs,not_removed,okay but i didnt read your name before i read the message so i spent approximately minutes trying to figure out why the hell he was calling you sauce boy
creepyPMs,not_removed,revenge porn or humiliation fetishists
creepyPMs,not_removed,gulp
creepyPMs,not_removed,👌
creepyPMs,not_removed,if i had to guess the first one
creepyPMs,not_removed,definitely a humiliation fetish
creepyPMs,not_removed,gulp
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would pay to see this
creepyPMs,not_removed,worst autosignature ever he should think about tryin to make a change
creepyPMs,not_removed,almost certainly
creepyPMs,not_removed,because they are bad at poker s
creepyPMs,not_removed,then turn it around get the pictures oh shes lovely are you two together no oh certainly youll ask her out oh come on now youre a good guy steal her no i wouldnt dream of stealing her away from a honorable guy like you in fact one moment im just going to send her a pm telling her what a fine upstanding person you are if hes got a humiliation fetish that should kill his buzz quickly
creepyPMs,not_removed,deleted
creepyPMs,not_removed,at some point all that air constantly swallowed will burst out both directions painfully
creepyPMs,not_removed,why do creeps always want to cuddle that always makes me cringe
creepyPMs,not_removed,ha brilliant shut down
creepyPMs,not_removed,i can relate was chatting with this dude on tinder and he seemed to lose interest but randomly sent me messages to come cuddle with him like nah dude
creepyPMs,not_removed,that denial though lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like its a half assed sort of insurance policy if the girl responds the way he wants her to they can talk about sex if she doesnt respond the way he wants her to and gets angry he can say hey i just said cuddling why are you freaking out youre crazy
creepyPMs,not_removed,nothing makes me crawl out of my skin faster than the word cuddle
creepyPMs,not_removed,its weird its okay if your with the person but for a stranger its pretty weird
creepyPMs,not_removed,its weird that he asked but whats wrong with cuddling
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think they think its what women want to be emotionally fulfilled instead of sex because we all know women dont want sex so if they lie about wanting cuddling the holy grail of romance for all women then they can get close enough perhaps even close enough to maybe sex
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks i was just like umm no way to make me lose interest

creepyPMs,not_removed,oh nothing its just they always think thats what girls wanna hear and its just off putting i cant really explain why
creepyPMs,not_removed,definitely any time someone just says what they think you want to hear its unnerving sometimes its cute if you know each other well but generally its just this aggressive creepy dishonesty

creepyPMs,not_removed,the second one is pretty bad but that first one thats gotta be one of the grossest things ive ever read considering the number of school shootings in the past couple of years
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel so gross just reading this it gets more icky the further you go
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think there is a filter for men to avoid gross messages works right
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think its a copypasta iirc ive seen this cli t pu y nonsense before in creepypms im not googling it to find out though
creepyPMs,not_removed,cant be both
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep he thought it was a groan in response to a groanertype joke which is what he thought he was telling
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds to me like hes just fucking around i doubt hes taking his pickup line too seeiously
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would guess it is to avoid a filter which someone mentioned above
creepyPMs,not_removed,you need a s or they will delete you here very strict
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment has been removed in accordance with httpiimgurcomvkforaspng httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,i doubt if there is one it would only be for men
creepyPMs,not_removed,of the first posts i saw on this subreddit were this message safe to say dudes a douche
creepyPMs,not_removed,the tongueincheek is fine it just needs a s to make clear it is tongueincheek youd have to see some of the trolls weve had to understand but the rule is listed in the rules and it is enforced have a good one edit incidentally if you havent read those rules you should take the time there are some that are unique to the sub and the mods are pretty serious about all of them
creepyPMs,not_removed,what im so confused this guy is gross
creepyPMs,not_removed,you would so hate my brothers that is totally something they would say to me and one likes to tag me in dildo pictures on fb i get my revenge
creepyPMs,not_removed,what is wrong with these savages
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,who the fuck could you text this stuff to and have it be okay if its some role play thing whatever but continuing to force it on someone after youve found out its the wrong person is fucked as is using incest as a pickup line for strangers so theres just no real scenario in which this makes any sense wow
creepyPMs,not_removed,gone very very right imo degree burns poor thing i think you had him confused from the beginning op and he was the one messaging the wrong number i hope this isnt a new creep technique
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey the phone number is still readable i dont think thats okay
creepyPMs,not_removed,im pretty confused too tbh for a minute there i thought one of my brothers was about to get in some huge trouble until i realized it was a wrong number lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,its basically the same as if a girl joked saying stop jerking off to her brother some siblings joke around like that
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre right and in future please feel free to report posts like this to bring them to our attention
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment has been removed in accordance with httpiimgurcomvkforaspng httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love his backpedaling shes not my real sister so still gross
creepyPMs,not_removed,probably meant to be some game opener ohhh sorry i thought you were my sister and thats why i brought up your pussy so signel
creepyPMs,not_removed,not good enough for you i wish it was socially acceptable to say nope youre too ugly
creepyPMs,not_removed,the correct response is i was just being polite looks like a mutilated pink sardine
creepyPMs,not_removed,wait since when do they allow underage kids on dating sites
creepyPMs,not_removed,pro tip if he was underage receiving his nudes could also get you in trouble stay safe op
creepyPMs,not_removed,ahhhh ok that makes more sense thanks for clarifying
creepyPMs,not_removed,jeeez guy have a drink
creepyPMs,not_removed,guys get so weird with this dont they once i told someone i couldnt send nudes cus i was at my friends house polite excuse and he said thats ok go in the bathroom and take a pic for me so selfish
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy kept messaging me later on trying to explain or maybe mansplain that his reasoning for being persistent was that since i post nudes on a gonewild sub i must be in the mood to do so all the time i promptly told him thats not how it works and to fuck off and i ended up blocking him i will never understand why guys get weird about this and simply will not takeno for an answer no matter how you put it
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive also gotten that reply when i used a similar excuse go fuck yourself
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think its fragile egos that wont let them accept that a woman doesnt feel like sending them sexy pics that or hes used to getting the woman to cave in and do it
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry if it wasnt clear from the start im not actually underage i knew where this guy was going with his questions so i told him i was underage in an attempt to get him to leave me alone and hopefully reconsider talking like this to strangers clearly it didnt work its great to see that there are policies in place to help people and give extra information to people in circumstances like these though everyone has been so nice shout out to the moderator and the bot
creepyPMs,not_removed,gross and weird i mean who likes teenagers
creepyPMs,not_removed,people freak me out responding so cute is justcringe worthy on the best of days side note upvoted for battlenet
creepyPMs,not_removed,hi we have a copypaste message of resources we put when underage people are creeped on paging unosefetish
creepyPMs,not_removed,go on
creepyPMs,not_removed,battlenet of all places and both fit the age range of most people who play video games as well if i had to guess the real ages are still around there from teens to mid still not exactly a place where id expect people to try to creep and flirt with one another i still like messing around with the occasional scammers i get on gaming communities especially those csgo raffle admin stuff
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats beyond creepy id probably have reported him at that point
creepyPMs,not_removed,yuck i get creepers on battle net all the time especially when i talk in overwatch and everyone hears my voice
creepyPMs,not_removed,see that i could sort of understand not that that makes it okay i mean they know youre female or they know at least you have a voice they like i never even confirmed that i was female he just assumed i cant imagine dealing with this kind of shit often ive been playing hearthstone since the beginning and this is the first time someone has ever done this
creepyPMs,not_removed,im glad you exist to dole out information like this fight the creeps
creepyPMs,not_removed,wait they messaged you after playing a game of hearthstone all you have in that game are some simple emotes thats a crazy level of thirst by the creeper
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep i normally get lots of random adds after games especially lately as ive begun hitting the higher ranks rank woo maybe out of every message me and thats normally just good game or broken deck so i dont mind that this is the first person who has actually gotten weird i dont understand it at all like you said its not like we were talking during the game or anything i was hardly giving off signs i wanted to chat oh well i reported him and mentioned asking for pics of someone he assumed to be underage so i hope something comes of it
creepyPMs,not_removed,rank congrats i usually get up to the meager teens p im imagining the creeper seeing a username hotsexylustywoman and being like oh boy what luck surely they are as the name describes maybe people message more at the higher ranks ive had like people message me ever and only one was akin to op deck i was thinking cmon man were like rank youre not missing out on your esports sponsorship with this
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks i normally hover around rank but im off uni for the next few weeks so thought id take a rush at legend secret hunter op when people say that i like to send them a link to whichever streamer i got my deck from and tell them to try it for themselves xd
creepyPMs,not_removed,that made me laugh more then it should that last line is the best
creepyPMs,not_removed,after being rated times that is the image of persistence
creepyPMs,not_removed,well played op very well played i hope your recovery went smoothly and wasnt too painful im sorry about your husbands back injury i hope he can find something that works for him
creepyPMs,not_removed,im so sorry dixie i tripped on the sidewalk earlier today and fell into a radioactive puddle im now a cowgirl
creepyPMs,not_removed,face meet palm
creepyPMs,not_removed,cowgirls carry a lasso
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks im doing fine now and were working on his back doc says stretching and massaging the area should ease up some of the pain maybe even fix it all together since its pretty much a muscle malfunction
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean i wouldnt be opposed to him being a radioactive cowgirl hed be like spiderman but with a lasso
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah ok thats great ive had back surgeries so if anything else works for him im jealous lol no just kidding its wonderful to fix the problem with a much less invasive technique b
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really hope that works for him back pain is no fun
creepyPMs,not_removed,three back surgeries here so i feel your pain
creepyPMs,not_removed,literally
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my god youre a survivor
creepyPMs,not_removed,yay for scoliosis
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh no my mom has mild scoliosis and other back problems i dont understand i looked over the report and there were so many new words i showed it to my friend whos a pt the important thing how are you feeling now
creepyPMs,not_removed,to be honest it depends on the day and what im doing i had all three surgeries when i was im now and ive always had at least the slightest bit of pain pretty much all the time but ive learned to ignore it overall its usually just a dull ache there are days when its worse though and it was especially difficult when i was working jobs where i was on my feet constantly i can sit most of the time at my job now and have the freedom to stand and walk around when i feel like it so that helps
creepyPMs,not_removed,damn in one year youre really a trooper can over the counter meds help at all btw dont you just love it when old people start to talk about their back pain and how one day well understand i love to see the looks on their faces when i say im doing ok now but ive already had surgeries lmao getting your surgeries at did people around you make assumptions about you and your health until they knew about your situation
creepyPMs,not_removed,over the counter meds dont really help all that much but i dont really have any interest in asking for a prescription i wouldnt say that i have an addictive personality but i dont want to rely on painkillers i take aleve when it gets really bad and it does take the edge off at least its always my favorite when people complain to me about back pain or when i mention that my back is hurting and they tell me that im too young to have back problems ha love their faces when i tell them or show them my scar i used to work as a cashier at a store where we had to scan and bag everything ourselves the woman that i was checking out wasnt removing her bags from the carousel i asked her if she would mind putting some stuff in her cart so that i could continue scanning and bagging her response was i dont do that i have back problems i replied excitedly and completely innocently with oh really what do you have i know how back problems are ive had three surgeries for scoliosis she started putting her shit in the cart after that i think my favorite story though was a conversation that i had with my grandma she was complaining about her back hurting looked at me and said never get anything in your back she paused looked at me for a second and then continued with never mind i guess im talking to the wrong person lmao
creepyPMs,not_removed,yuk i have scoliosis but luckily ive never needed surgery for it you have my sympathy
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks i was when i was diagnosed and it was already really bad tried bracing and a chiropractor for a while but my case was too severe
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had to do back muscle stretching exercises laying on my tummy with one of my folks watching to make sure i did them i was so it was humiliating definitely not as bad as surgery though x
creepyPMs,not_removed,interesting hair sexual deviant good to know
creepyPMs,not_removed,but you calgarians are usually so open minded he knows that because of the one calgarian hes met s i dont know if calgarian is the right word or not by the way it just sounded right
creepyPMs,not_removed,nice downtown no nice i lold
creepyPMs,not_removed,kingston my first ldr partner was from there
creepyPMs,not_removed,nice no nice
creepyPMs,not_removed,nice

creepyPMs,not_removed,haha im only there for university im blowing that popsicle stand once im done

creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you though i cant take all the creditthe bourbon helped too lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha thanks i found it very refreshing that he was amused by it and yep him actually giving me a hat tip made me laugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you i enjoyed myself i was literally moments away from disabling my account so i figured id have fun before i left okc
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not seeing his reaction
creepyPMs,not_removed,yay bourbon edit and good job to you too op
creepyPMs,not_removed,there should be three images loaded in the last one he said ive never been so overjoyed at a rejection before
creepyPMs,not_removed,weird i can only see the first image on my desktop can see the other via mobile
creepyPMs,not_removed,there are others i only see one both on mobile and desktop
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just posted a comment with separate links for each pic im not sure what the problem was before but this should work
creepyPMs,not_removed,say yes sir
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive got ten years on her so shell be so easy to manipulate and wait why is she not capitulating
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol wow nothing beat those pathetic «dom» bdsm is a relationship based on trust and respect not a way for a pathetic wanker to relieve is sexual tension fuck those guys
creepyPMs,not_removed,to this guy posted the whole exchange to whatever woman hater club hes part of
creepyPMs,not_removed,can someone tell me where op would be from ive never heard feck off mate before
creepyPMs,not_removed,good god people please stop forcing your kinks on non consenting members of the public youre giving the rest of us a bad name
creepyPMs,not_removed,ohhhh my gawwwwd like these people know that healthy relationships have both respect and excitement right like why this guy doesnt think that you can have both is beyond me lol feck off mate
creepyPMs,not_removed,what an alfalfa
creepyPMs,not_removed,so lets look at the bright side op posted the entire chat in one screenshot cheers to you i dont think the con needs to be stated
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats super gross but thanks for using stitch it thats my app glad you likey you will become my beta tester are you ready for your bug fixes and and cool new features
creepyPMs,not_removed,and we just witnessed a number of the ballet coming to theaters this christmas the life and times of a wannabe dom
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cannot deal with these pseudoms i really cant i take comfort in imagining how quickly they would buckle at the hands of a particular domme i met a few years ago though
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive been doing it wrong all this time im off to pick a random based on his picture and tell him hes now my bitch say yes maam massive sarcasm
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy is the type of person that put a bad name on ds relationships
creepyPMs,not_removed,tries to fake casual with later then comes right back to argue with her
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wonder how often that works for him
creepyPMs,not_removed,say yes sir
creepyPMs,not_removed,id be tempted to olay along with him and convince him to meet me at a bar downtown with some sort of ridiculous fetish gear plainly visible so i can tell its him then just not show up in other words i want to humiliate the perv who gets off on humiliating women he thinks are helpless
creepyPMs,not_removed,part of me wanted to see where this guy would be going but im glad you stood your ground op
creepyPMs,not_removed,dude wtf
creepyPMs,not_removed,not consenting to your fetish if i have the same interests and express them send me your spiel i have not dropping your load on random people is pointless is harassment and makes the whole scene look like predators
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh lame dom wannabe probably got kicked out of his local bdsm scene for not following rules of consentbeing a narcissististic asshole rather than a true dom probably does this to every girl hoping she thumbed through a borrowed copy of fifty shades of grey and only read the sex scenes
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read your side of the convo in an english accent just had to share you handled that like a champ though you go girl
creepyPMs,not_removed,savage
creepyPMs,not_removed,awkward cough this fucker serious
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy is so cringey oh my lord i saw like whole pages of shades once im a bdsm expert haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,theres no need to call me sir professor
creepyPMs,not_removed,that cracked me up a lot
creepyPMs,not_removed,how do i quotations
creepyPMs,not_removed,please clap
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh how long do you figure hes been doing this
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy has years on her men lie about their age to try to attract younger women
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wish people would put down their copies of shades of grey already
creepyPMs,not_removed,i see this sort of thing all the time on fetlife my eyes are tired from rolling constantly just because someone is submissive doesnt mean they are your submissive there is a real world with boundaries and limits
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read that as plastic doms whichis not far off
creepyPMs,not_removed,england
creepyPMs,not_removed,australia or england probably
creepyPMs,not_removed,feck is pretty common in ireland too
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds english yeah
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh thats awesome yeah its a super useful app especially for this sub
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats a cool app itd be down for beta testing i might not be very useful but i like having stuff before other people even if the stuff is terrible i am become consumerism
creepyPMs,not_removed,wait how did you know she used your app im looking for a watermark or something but dont see it
creepyPMs,not_removed,because he thinks its a shit test
creepyPMs,not_removed,because he is a domly dom and domly doms cant be domly any other way
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like to picture them trying to tie a rope
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment has been removed for violating rule threats of violencedeath wishes are not allowed please read the rules before commenting again and message modmail if youd like to discuss thanks

creepyPMs,not_removed,runexpectedhogwarts
creepyPMs,not_removed,ten years
creepyPMs,not_removed,or possibly close one of the twenty porn tabs they have open
creepyPMs,not_removed,at least there was a negotiation there
creepyPMs,not_removed,i literally have to say this on all my profiles im a pet im not your pet treat me with respect
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly this just because one is submissive doesnt mean they just obey anyone and it doesnt mean i wont just punch you in the face if you try to make me submit against my will
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly someone may be a submissive but acting like those guy without any understanding of boudaries limits and such is the best way to get someone real hurt or even worse fuck them
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks d
creepyPMs,not_removed,nah we aussies dont use feck unless were fans of father ted
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,interesting good to know thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,a strange and unexpected niche its found its nice that its a tool for the good guys though its kind of hard to use stitch it for nefarious purposes sunlight being the best disinfectant and all that
creepyPMs,not_removed,alright oppenheimer send me a pm with your email address and ill add you to the beta tester list in the meantime feel free to download it or httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomluckybunnyllcstitchit and feel free to leave us a nice rating if youd like to help others find us cheers

creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like he would accidentally tangle himself up fall over and then start crying
creepyPMs,not_removed,ha i think my submissive would like to see me try to knot a rope hes had wilderness training whereas id be a joke of a rigger lol i bet you this guy would claim he can do it better than anybody or some shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,soooowould his original targets have been then
creepyPMs,not_removed,there was no negotiation in shades there was an abusive dick threatening coercing and on occasion drugging the heroine into doing whatever he wanted and when that didnt work he straightup raped her
creepyPMs,not_removed,and youre from canada
creepyPMs,not_removed,so youre saying australians are feckless
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey i dont judge you do you mate
creepyPMs,not_removed,can i look through your comment history to find out if you say thanks after every reply haha i love it
creepyPMs,not_removed,just imagine him angrily mashing two frayed ends together
creepyPMs,not_removed,im in charge of tying my own shibari most of the time finally one of those girl scout badges paid off
creepyPMs,not_removed,would you really be surprised
creepyPMs,not_removed,how did you know
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wont stop you ha but i dont think i say it after every reply let me know thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,xd wile e coyote comes to mind
creepyPMs,not_removed,ohh you do it yourself thats cool as hell we havent tried rigging yet because i lack rope fu but i saw a demonstration of something i cannot recall the mame of that means something like one rope and it was really intense and cool
creepyPMs,not_removed,surprised no grossed out hell yes
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep ive got about feet of silk rope in my toy box only people that have done mine for me were friends that wanted practice and i was their modeldummy or boys who wanted something that would restrain my arms or hands
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol gotcha thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you have concerns about our modding message us in modmail do not abuse the automod bot
creepyPMs,not_removed,roger that
creepyPMs,not_removed,ddid he just define the word persistent to you
creepyPMs,not_removed,why is it that none of these types of guys seem to be able to spell the your and intrested were killing me
creepyPMs,not_removed,you were much nicer than i would have been tbh
creepyPMs,not_removed,just to clarify for the couple of people who have messaged me and clearly missed my point and claiming that im attacking him for only wanting to know me based on her looks and yet im doing the exact same thing but only to justify my i dont care if somebody only wants to get to know me initially because they think im attractive first impressions and attraction while not the only important thing do matter as does lack of attraction on app like this its how initial interest is formed what i dont like is the hypocrisy of me not being able to say that im not interested without guys like this continually whining that i dont know anything about them besides how they look and therefore its unreasonable for me to be uninterested and that they have a right to dismiss my feelings criticise me or insult me for basing my decision on attraction because they know nothing about me either besides how i look and yet they are interested based on attraction and thats totally fine why is it rightfully okay for them to decide who they message based on attraction but not okay for me to decide to message back based on attraction why are they rightfully allowed to care about looks but i am not why are they rightfully allowed to want a partner they find physically attractive but if i do im being shallow or should give them a chance let them surprise me or base my decision on something else attraction is important for everybody its usually part of the reason these dudes have messaged me in the first place i doubt theyre hitting on women they dont find remotely attractive so why am i expected to message back or give a chance to the men that i dont find remotely attractive why am i continuously being told by these same guys that while its okay for them to care about it and choose which women theyre interested in based off of it it isnt okay for me to choose who im interested in back off of it total double standard my point isnt that attraction isnt a valid reason to be interested in somebody i totally think it is my point is that if its reasonable for one person to be interested in the other purely based on first attraction then surely it is equally reasonable for the second person to be uninterested based on a lack of attraction i shouldnt have to argue to defend my own disinterest when both of our feelings his interest and my disinterest are based on exactly the same thing so why is his valid and yet mine isnt
creepyPMs,not_removed,as century women were up against thousands of years of men seeing our autonomy as a way to define their masculinity it has more to do with the metrics of identity even than attraction the idea that persistence in the face of a dehumanized challenge is heroic and commendable and it is in most situations if that challenge werent a person in her own right men see my walls as a thorny maze to test themselves with never seeing me as an individual on her own quest tackling her own challenges im stationary in their minds even as i move way a target i have to focus everyday not to go mad from knowing i am sentient but being treated as if i am not
creepyPMs,not_removed,where you find these creeps is this like a chat app
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive had this conversation so many times oh my god they just dont get it
creepyPMs,not_removed,man you answered well
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should have sent him the definition of no with his face as the picture beside it
creepyPMs,not_removed,rjustneckbeardthings
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont forget weather
creepyPMs,not_removed,i thought your response was a total mic drop good on you
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey there op if any users decide to harangue you in pms feel free to unedited screenshots so we can ban them
creepyPMs,not_removed,you responded to him eloquently and more intelligently than he could counter its an continual hypocrisy that men are allowed to pursue based on attraction but women are told they should get to know him before trusting the same instinct when you can see this plainly and the world around you has faith in a logical fallacy it makes me feel totally alone until i find other people whove trusted their own senses and reason i hold onto my selftrust and analytical brain like a life preserver otherwise id slowly decay and crumble inwards from the constant attack on my rational facilities i think youve got that selftrust down cold so dont worry about those people who didnt take the time to see the simple clear logic of your statement they dont have the lifepreserver that you do
creepyPMs,not_removed,well put
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes all of this
creepyPMs,not_removed,meetme its literally full of them i get between a day message me on there and a disturbingly large number turn out to be utter weirdos
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,removed for violating rule
creepyPMs,not_removed,read the rules before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,agreed i actually just saved ugoddamitletmesleeps comment as ammo for future discussions with other people its well said and breaks the hypocrisy down beautifully
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment has been removed for violating rule please read the rules before commenting again and message modmail if youd like to discuss thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you so much im just pleased theres people who agree sometimes dealing with those people drives you mad and makes you feel alone
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha i understand the frustration and i try to go the education route as well ive never had to explain this particular double standard you mentioned but ive definitely been annoyed by it im a frequent commenter on askmen im a woman but i use the gendered flair so its all good most of the guys there are great but a few get pissed if i freely admit i care about looks ive had to break down exactly how saying physical attraction matters only physical attraction matters
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah right because its so nice to ignore a persons preferences and boundaries super nice s
creepyPMs,not_removed,op i dont think you overreacted at all you had a clearly stated preference on your profile and he chose to ignore it assuming he read your profile before messaging you theres no need to talk to someone who doesnt respect your wishes from the beginning and i would never feel comfortable meeting someone who acted like this
creepyPMs,not_removed,in my profile all it states is please refrain from petnames and compliments if youre wishing to get to know me as they irk me a bit coming from strangers who barely know me i find that thats plenty of warning and i didnt jump down his throat right after just wished him a good search
creepyPMs,not_removed,hmm i guess i can come across as that online i have some social issues sometimes and while i feel im replying in the best way in this case letting the person know why i wasnt interested instead of just saying im not interested i can come across as blunt and rude my speech patterns are like this irl as well and im honestly lucky i have the friends i do that know me well enough that i dont mean harm

creepyPMs,not_removed,the fact he reiterated that hes a teenager several times seems kind of sketchy
creepyPMs,not_removed,op explains what teen did that was creepy teen just tell me what i did wrong every time
creepyPMs,not_removed,context dude liked my art and wanted to talk we chatted a bit and he got really clingy he had some kind of interaction with my so at some point i dont know anything about it really and he kept being emo about it
creepyPMs,not_removed,considering his age and glaring insecurities he probably thought he was actually going to win you over somehow the delusions man
creepyPMs,not_removed,that whole exchange was just really sad
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont you have any simpaty for me lmfao
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am hes so for me it just seemed like an annoying attempt to validate his reasoning
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah that had a weird ring to it
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly there is no winning
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think youre right i dont mind talking to my younger fans but the clinginess fuck no
creepyPMs,not_removed,yup
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah it was pretty obsessive i think how exotic meeting a dane here
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have no simpathy
creepyPMs,not_removed,as long as its normal i try not to discriminate my fans
creepyPMs,not_removed,very especially when he was trying to make your fiancé look bad yeah especially since i just finished my masters in the field of culture studies is having a son in a few months and loves to illustrate your illustrations are awesome btw
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know right like wtf was he expecting from that thats awesome congrats on your little one they kinda rock appreciate the compliment thank you xd
creepyPMs,not_removed,i already agreed we could talk so i didnt want to be a dick and bail right away i think it was pretty normal except for that wtf message he sent me which i chose to ignore my bad
creepyPMs,not_removed,alright i understand hope he doesnt bother you anymore though
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks havent heard from him since
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really have no idea about that part apparently he talked to my fiance before we talked and when i asked my fiance hed pretty much forgotten about him
creepyPMs,not_removed,women are so superficial no fatties
creepyPMs,not_removed,funny to see someone so pretentious who doesnt understand understand what the word former means
creepyPMs,not_removed,this has been a peeve since i was young guys chase us because were hot but were shallow if we arent attracted to them
creepyPMs,not_removed,you have a pretty face so i can tell youre the kind of girl who will give a greatguy™ like me a chance what youre not interested wow how dare you not fit into all those roles i made up in my head
creepyPMs,not_removed,there are years between us is that really a reason to dismiss someone well lets examine the available evidence i just told you that i am dismissing you for that reason therefore yes by definition that reason really is a reason to dismiss someone
creepyPMs,not_removed,did you just mock me he seemed so surprised someone would mock him
creepyPMs,not_removed,so guys are allowed to call girls pretty and judge them because of that but girls arent allowed to know that they are pretty and have standards and preferences that makes sense s
creepyPMs,not_removed,where you are mentally wtf does that even mean i mean this guy is clearly mental that he gets vibes from pictures and all
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a selfrighteous jerkface
creepyPMs,not_removed,shoulda called him out on it watched his head implode
creepyPMs,not_removed,seems to be a lot of us over who rage out like this dunno what my fellow oldies expect when they bother young women who have specifically stated a preference that doesnt line up with middle aged dudes
creepyPMs,not_removed,you are all the good things he can just tell from your pictures until you decide that for you he is not all the good things and then you are suddenly not the person he imagined you to be who would also fall in love with him of course but you are a just a disgusting individual because you denied him a chance even though his multiple repulsive responses clearly showed his personality
creepyPMs,not_removed,footy guy lol what the fuck is that im picturing a man with feet for hands
creepyPMs,not_removed,tragically superficial is such a strange choice of words he sounds like a drama queen either way
creepyPMs,not_removed,send me a reply ok definitely not passive aggressively giving you an order reads like he meant an exclamation mark
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wouldnt be surprised in the least if this was sent by my ex
creepyPMs,not_removed,lady killer up in this whoo
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love it when they send messages that expose their awful pesonalities and then claim youre rejecting them because youre shallow and obviously looking for a hotter guy it really never occurs to them that theyre just plain unlikeable does it
creepyPMs,not_removed,its not offensive adds comment about ops mental stage clearly intended to be offensive
creepyPMs,not_removed,i didnt even notice that makes it all the more hilarious
creepyPMs,not_removed,first thing i noticed made me chuckle
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was gonna say that
creepyPMs,not_removed,understand understand understand understand understand understand the concept of love oh
creepyPMs,not_removed,its because we have nothing to offer other than physical beauty and men are the total package so how dare we judge them on something so minute in relation to their allencompassing awesomeness is there a symbol for sarcasm laden with the saddest of truths
creepyPMs,not_removed,clearly he hasnt spent much time on the internet
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think its slang for football player in the uk or australia maybe
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read it as foofy at first which was really funny but yeah soccer player
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes not angry at her just disappointed that shed act so out of character the one he invented for her
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow weird you know it took me like minutes to understand understand understand why you posted this comment it was invisible to me for some reason and i was trying to figure out what this was funny
creepyPMs,not_removed,s thats a kind of sad sarcastic cyclops i hope its sufficient
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah im in australia so a guy who plays aussie rules football theyre pretty popular with women because they are muscular and attractive and wear short shorts while playing so the footy guy is a guy who has an incredible body but is supposedly uncultureddumbwhatever edit typo
creepyPMs,not_removed,my bad i am uncultured swine
creepyPMs,not_removed,its the first few lyrics of the song concept of love from the game jet set radio future
creepyPMs,not_removed,have an upvote for that awesome alliteration
creepyPMs,not_removed,right there with you
creepyPMs,not_removed,andyou thought lucidity wanted to know this because hello creeper
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just spanked one off to the means of production
creepyPMs,not_removed,bah anyone can do that can you jerk it to the lumpenproletariat
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am jay man what an ending
creepyPMs,not_removed,ops friend here lets just say im done with online dating for a while im not sure anyone can write something as beautiful as convulse in the aftershock of pleasure here is another one just in case you wanted more
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like to flay you alive and wear your skin like a poncho i am karen
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love how guys vomit out these sexual fantasies then sprinkle them with a hearty dose of i want to make you feel good and you have the best orgasm ever from my amazing sexual prowess in this scenario its so cute when they think well totally orgasm so easily and so intensely when they havent even asked what turns us on and havent even remotely covered it in their entire fantasy scenarioand by cute i mean pathetic
creepyPMs,not_removed,he is jay
creepyPMs,not_removed,long creepy fail sexy paragraph oh and my name is jay s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am jay and this is my story
creepyPMs,not_removed,i still dont understand why guys think this is a good way to start a conversation yeah okay i dont know how to start conversations with strangers which is why i pretty much dont message people on socialdating sites first but opening like this in what universe is that considered an acceptable opening i cant imagine this works in real life ever
creepyPMs,not_removed,you had me at blouse i know its a thing but it feels soold
creepyPMs,not_removed,that sounds uncomfortable for everyone involved
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like that it says ask him about a recent personal experience how does it feel to be a creepy older man writing to a woman years younger than him who writes out porn novels to strangers in the hopes that you will one day get laid
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey wait im jay garrick
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am jay
creepyPMs,not_removed,for some reason i ended up reading this like jay was on stage at openmic night spokenwordpoemed the whole message and it was a lot easier to read and that ending was something all right lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am weasel
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is jay jay has never had sex with a woman only with a sock he found from his mothers basement
creepyPMs,not_removed,well they did just finish having sex giving his victim his name is just polite
creepyPMs,not_removed,hmm got the erotica all copied and pasted i am good to gooh shit forgot my name better throw that in there
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont look at my gw posts
creepyPMs,not_removed,very strong fedora in that first message here
creepyPMs,not_removed,a how would you describe her beauty b so giggling a
creepyPMs,not_removed,did you ask them about a personal experience they recommend that at the bottom
creepyPMs,not_removed,yikes eastern wa this is about on par of what i would expect out of spokane
creepyPMs,not_removed,it must work once in a while if they keep trying thats the only reasonable excuse i can think of
creepyPMs,not_removed,im going to go out on a limb here and say thats why hes single at maybe some ladies eat that shit up all i know is i got the screenshot as i was leaving work assisted living got maybe or words in and instantly felt like a pervert
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean he could have just said hi and id been okay with that and a lot less creeped out i would have pretty much been okay with anything aside from this
creepyPMs,not_removed,what do the kids call them now a days
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg i need to ask him that but im afraid of the answer
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like hes feeling pretty good for a year old
creepyPMs,not_removed,i felt the second one was very i cant wait to know all the ways you wear my skin
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think it works i think these are just the type of guys who get off on knowing that someone has read their perverted fantasies if a woman replies at all to them its winning since its a confirmation it was read
creepyPMs,not_removed,ask him about a recent personal experience at your own risk
creepyPMs,not_removed,big fat hairy clit vomits
creepyPMs,not_removed,sigh
creepyPMs,not_removed,does the username you crossed out perhaps have some resemblance to your reddit username because that would make sense
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like hes probably never seen a clit before
creepyPMs,not_removed,is this not an appropriate way to say hello to someone
creepyPMs,not_removed,not sure google makes it easyprobably not in person
creepyPMs,not_removed,deleted
creepyPMs,not_removed,criticizing his dick is quite possibly the best thing to say to get him to stop
creepyPMs,not_removed,theyre always so proud of these pictures too like its an enormous favor theyre doing us by sending them some of these dick pics have toilets in the background so sexy
creepyPMs,not_removed,he never answered my questions btw
creepyPMs,not_removed,ha love your response
creepyPMs,not_removed,im with you about the non responsive things i have never heard of a woman going from non responsive to omg yes i shall sleep with you because you sent me an unsolicited dick pic im thinking it may be a douche bag ego thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,but why why is it so skinny
creepyPMs,not_removed,reason why im proud to have been on the internet for years and have never taken a picture of my penis ill never be that guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i look at it as an attempt to save the next woman who has the pleasure of encountering the guy if he thinks his penis is unsightly which without a doubt it is he might just give it a second thought before hitting send
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh man ive seen sitting on the toilet dick pics way too many times i cant fathom believing thats a good idea
creepyPMs,not_removed,wait toilets arent sexy my whole life is a lie s
creepyPMs,not_removed,cause it didnt work so he went on to another woman its not like they are chatting up one girl at a time
creepyPMs,not_removed,you dont send out a dick pic a day
creepyPMs,not_removed,ahem thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,why are you proud of this there is nothing wrong with consensual nude exchange
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive deemed it the net tactic if they throw it out enough and they go wide enough theyll catch something
creepyPMs,not_removed,you dont
creepyPMs,not_removed,the idea here i think was more theyre proud of never involving someone in nonconsensual nude exchange im more on the fence about wanting ro possibly make someone insecure about their body and the possibiity that that really is the only way to make them stop shoving it on other people without consent
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe an std
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh well everybody should be proud of that surely seeing as that would be grounds for sexual harassment
creepyPMs,not_removed,hopefully
creepyPMs,not_removed,well yeah i guess theyre just kindajokingserious
creepyPMs,not_removed,hed asked me if i was related at the same time as hitting on me in a facebook message i informed him i was his cousin and he said it was a shame hes married but has lied about his age on fb saying hes years younger than he really is this wouldnt be too creepy outright but the things hed said to me before make me cringe at this
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow creepy pedo and incesty just what every girl wants
creepyPMs,not_removed,your postcomment has been removed in accordance with httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,have you told your family about this because its really concerning
creepyPMs,not_removed,some would say its too mutch
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have mentioned to my parents i feel hes a bit odd and unhinged if he says anything else like this ill just block him
creepyPMs,not_removed,doesnt this guy know the internet is full of pictures of naked vegetables he doesnt have to go around asking vegans for them
creepyPMs,not_removed,had to laugh at the way creep went along with that though
creepyPMs,not_removed,i bet a vid of someone peeling potatoes drives him crazy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i loled so hard
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont wanna know what he wants to do to those carrots
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is the best post i have ever seen on this sub
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahahaha what the fuck
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really want to tell myself that he fucked up the two windows and meant to send it to someone else but messed up i know its not but the illusion is easier since he didnt call her a fat prostitute or something i am so confused
creepyPMs,not_removed,i said nude take the tops off send me another
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks lol what
creepyPMs,not_removed,what
creepyPMs,not_removed,i lold at this
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahahaha
creepyPMs,not_removed,atleast they were polite
creepyPMs,not_removed,he probably thinks she likes em raw
creepyPMs,not_removed,most of them are fake vegetable stars though all gmo and touched up with special effects i like my vegetables real amateurlike
creepyPMs,not_removed,or going to the nearest convenience store but that would imply he goes outside which we all know the answer
creepyPMs,not_removed,i get the feeling this one was a troll to begin with which is still bad asking someone for a nude just because youre trying to upset them is as bad maybe worse than asking for one because youre horny but i could be wrong the creep might have just realized theyd made a mistake and then decided to play along either way at least they didnt push the point
creepyPMs,not_removed,its probably the best backpedaling ive ever seen
creepyPMs,not_removed,those damn potatoes sluts
creepyPMs,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlafscfqesk
creepyPMs,not_removed,whats a potato
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,probably
creepyPMs,not_removed,shimmy shimmy ya shimmy yam shimmy yay
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe he was just trying to be funny to begin with
creepyPMs,not_removed,you dont know until you ask
creepyPMs,not_removed,insert sausage party potato death scene link
creepyPMs,not_removed,ejactulation commences
creepyPMs,not_removed,i got that reference
creepyPMs,not_removed,harder
creepyPMs,not_removed,rretiredgif
creepyPMs,not_removed,todays risky click
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like to be a troll youve gotta at least try and be funny otherwise youre just an asshole ha
creepyPMs,not_removed,that movie gave me the worst boner ive ever had
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh yeah thats the stuff unzips
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you have a nice day
creepyPMs,not_removed,he definitely needs to grow his fro back now more room for crabs
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont remember oh i have had the shittiest week and this made me bellylaugh so loud i scared the cat
creepyPMs,not_removed,you called
creepyPMs,not_removed,are you feeling it now mr krabs
creepyPMs,not_removed,this made me laugh pretty hard well played
creepyPMs,not_removed,shakes the tip jar
creepyPMs,not_removed,condoms dont protect against crabs in the first place makes me wonder how many stis this guy has a friend of mine on facebook went through a stretch where he had a new girl every days no shame in that but i asked if he was going to take a few days break while he got tested and if he was keeping a list of names and numbers should he need to call anyone to let them know results and he replied with i use a condom every time so im totally clean yeah no theres a good chance youre clean but given the girls in days theres also a chance youre not dragged him to a clinic myself he had thrush on his thighs which he had been sharing with the the girls and asymptomatic chlamydia i was a bit annoyed that he refused to get blood taken he only did urine and swab tests so theres still a bunch of stuff he has no idea if he has or not but im not having sex with him and hes been lectured by his doctor so i should get my nose out of his sex life i just hope hes not saying im totally clean to the girls hes sleeping with they deserve an honest answer of i use condoms every time but i havent had any blood tests
creepyPMs,not_removed,the sad part ishell probably grow his fro back and let you know hoping it will somehow get him laid hell even chance the crabs lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,why do you have crabs just what well you see junior
creepyPMs,not_removed,hmm i dont know why but i seem to be craving a burger
creepyPMs,not_removed,this was beautiful op gross out the creep im surprised the lovely thought you also have me at dinnertime didnt turn him on like it does with some of these
creepyPMs,not_removed,why do you have grabs
creepyPMs,not_removed,brilliant
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cant tell my coworkers why im laughing well played op thats brilliant
creepyPMs,not_removed,winner winner chicken dinner
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is perfect
creepyPMs,not_removed,very well done
creepyPMs,not_removed,fucking neutralized
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats thats not how crabs work though
creepyPMs,not_removed,grabs
creepyPMs,not_removed,redditor for months your time to shine has come
creepyPMs,not_removed,rbeetlejuicing
creepyPMs,not_removed,art thou feeling it now mr krabs
creepyPMs,not_removed,im feeling a warm spot
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive seen this like times today since i found this sub whats it mean
creepyPMs,not_removed,god thats gross how do people not do basic research
creepyPMs,not_removed,afro crabs
creepyPMs,not_removed,tips fedora
creepyPMs,not_removed,what about the part right before that where he cant comprehend why a woman would judge him just by his fro i mean how shallow is that s
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats how these crabs work
creepyPMs,not_removed,you
creepyPMs,not_removed,there was a pretty epic post in which this chick just calmly and effortlessly trolled a creepster to the point where he stopped responding and her last thing was shakes the tip jar it was flawlessly executed
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly sex education is so bad at least in the us that i think many people dont know what they dont know if that makes sense
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like a dizzy gillespie composition
creepyPMs,not_removed,and an unknown unknown is the worst
creepyPMs,not_removed,fyi his opening message was somehow cut off but it basically said hi honey call me asap and left me his number
creepyPMs,not_removed,ok so he may or may not actually be the nephew of someone famous enough that not everyone has heard of them so that entitles him to whoever he wants got it
creepyPMs,not_removed,who the hell is charlie wilson
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read that as i happen to be charlie wilsons bitch thanks to just waking up but with an attitude like that he probably is his bitch
creepyPMs,not_removed,wasnt that a tom hanks movie charlie wilsons nephew
creepyPMs,not_removed,charlie wilson is an rb singer charlie last name wilson is one of his more popular songs but i like you are
creepyPMs,not_removed,i asked myself the same question lolapparently he is a member of the gap band
creepyPMs,not_removed,my sister still sings that song at me sometimes
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was or is a singer
creepyPMs,not_removed,httpsyoutubemjtozlfebgy
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like regular flirting but from someone thats socially awkward do with it what you wish
creepyPMs,not_removed,looks to me like a classic case of flirting
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats flirting a bit creepy to me its creepy i dont what you are comfortable with and i dont know what your relationship with this person is just be safe starting a relationship with someone is exciting and great but if the person says somethingask does something you arent comfortable with tell them and if they dont respect that then ignore block them stay safe and if you want to start a relationship with the person have fun
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey there op sorry but this isnt the right place to look for this kind of advice ive removed your post
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh that is definitely flirting go for it if you like them
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive known him for a long time and we have been friends for a long time as well i always had a feeling he might like me but he is never direct enough
creepyPMs,not_removed,why dont you try being direct he seems to like you may as well as him out on a date
creepyPMs,not_removed,which part of his anatomy do you think is im guessing his nose
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love he says you look good then demonstrates how he knows nothing of how you actually look
creepyPMs,not_removed,its a shame jamal read that as no ive never dated a black guy and not no this is not how you hit on women
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats not how you spell ass jamal or black
creepyPMs,not_removed,facetime for over hours
creepyPMs,not_removed,either youre tall or you cant be both
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks for reducing us both to the sizes of various parts of our anatomies jamal
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love a a nice tall skinny thickmed small or big titty ass girl
creepyPMs,not_removed,well damn jamal gotta do better
creepyPMs,not_removed,seriously though a inch schlong is not an advantage creeps act like its a fucking cold war arms race when irl there is such a thing as a dick thats too big
creepyPMs,not_removed,httpimgurcomaxgwzk
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly me and my friends favorite part of the whole thing 😂
creepyPMs,not_removed,my best friend lives very far away we facetime like once a week and it gets pretty late
creepyPMs,not_removed,its his name
creepyPMs,not_removed,yup my vagina is not in fact a bottomless pit this is literally a limit to what fits in there
creepyPMs,not_removed,what inch is not the average i guess i will have to go with inch then and get me something to heave my imaginary penis on
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah its much more like roller coaster tycoon oh you can build the coasters so dangerously it needs a waiver to ride but if its too big dangerous etc nobody is getting on it ever
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive wanted to use that reference for years and i stumbled on yours i blew my one shot
creepyPMs,not_removed,how on earth did you type that out read it and come to the conclusion that its funny or appropriate is beyond me
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh shit im dumb
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just do not understand why creeps think telling you they have a ginormous dick will make you want them a vaginal canal is not that long it has a cervix at the end a cervix that does not want to be hurt if i find myself with a guy who happens to have a bigger than average dick then well work something out but its not something im actively looking for
creepyPMs,not_removed,my sentiment exactly
creepyPMs,not_removed,theyre not familiar with vaginas though just bad erotica and the culture of enormous dicks
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol a system of levers and pulleys manned by a team of galley workers
creepyPMs,not_removed,in bby p doesnt produce any exciting mental images in my mind its rather an ow ow ow ow ok ok stop sort of thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,mr stealyomeme
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey sorry op here what did this person say that got deleted im quite interested if you could pm me
creepyPMs,not_removed,yup at the risk of tmi i no longer have a cervix so i definitely have a finite accommodation length and that is going to hurt
creepyPMs,not_removed,somehow i am reminded of the city building games where the construction site has little men that literally fly around while working can your workers do that
creepyPMs,not_removed,well they can hoist a monster schlong so
creepyPMs,not_removed,ok so basically i go to a public school and i along with everyone else recently found out this girl green likes me the whole school has kind of been a dick about it and they have been non stop asking me if i like her back blue is her friend who im pretty sure also has a crush on me but whatever black is two people also her friends who have been annoying the shit out of both her and me blue for some reason just needs to know if i like green back this week was honestly such a shitshow i havent told anyone not even my closest friends if i like her back i dont so i guess she had to resort to death threats
creepyPMs,not_removed,what ages are we talking about here
creepyPMs,not_removed,they have had more practice
creepyPMs,not_removed,creeps dont age well like wine
creepyPMs,not_removed,entitlement
creepyPMs,not_removed,men start off life with a finite amount of giveashit kinda like tooth enamel it never grows back once its gone thats why there is a term dirty old man
creepyPMs,not_removed,if theyre hitting on someone half their age they already dont respect boundaries assuming that you saidimplied that your interest is men close to your age whats one more to them as an old guy i wouldnt pursue a young woman closer to my sons age than mine its the douchebags who even try that sets up a false sample issue
creepyPMs,not_removed,because they are more desperate
creepyPMs,not_removed,lonely and desperate
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,people think these creepy nasty abusive messages are only from younger generation but it is all ages i have had dirty disgusting messages from men and even years old i always think that they could be fathers grand fathers and are acting with such disrespect either the internet has corrupted all men in this modern era of social networking and online dating ormen were always this perverse nasty rude but didnt have the outlet i find the idea of a victorian gentlemen wanting to send letters describing what they would do to a woman wearing a corset and crinoline with an enclosed picture of his privates amusing
creepyPMs,not_removed,because older guys who arent creeps dont want young women but someone in their age group as they have more in common
creepyPMs,not_removed,deleted
creepyPMs,not_removed,they age like milk
creepyPMs,not_removed,i thought they were made from sour grapes at the start though
creepyPMs,not_removed,theyre like wine thats been forgotten in the car
creepyPMs,not_removed,ehh people get super defensive about age gaps but you really didnt say anything that warranted a bunch of not all older men its pretty uncommon that there isnt at least a little something off when a man is pursuing a significantly younger woman im not saying its impossible for a healthy relationship to exist in those parameters but in my experience the kind of people who make it work are very aware of commoninstitutionalized power imbalances and dedicated to avoiding them and maintaining an equilibrium they definitely arent the ones comparing commentary on this subject to flagrant racism
creepyPMs,not_removed,i didnt even imply that
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes i said nothing about older men who are creeps nothing
creepyPMs,not_removed,so whats the age gap
creepyPMs,not_removed,you bore me i expected you to carry the weight of the conversation and you arent doing it so have a patronizing wellwishing comment eyeroll
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus christ were expected to entertain them slavishly stay by the phone be witty and sexy without baggage cute independent young etc did i miss anything are they so bored in their lives that they expect flirty banter not only expect but deserve s
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow that is some of best dismantling of man child ive ever seen
creepyPMs,not_removed,between his response about costco and informing me that im boring was maybe minutes because not only am i obligated to be super fun but also to respond immediately god bless him
creepyPMs,not_removed,you missed thin and virginal
creepyPMs,not_removed,bless him with fire
creepyPMs,not_removed,damn it plus under right
creepyPMs,not_removed,under no old ladies jesus
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my god i need to be in a retirement home
creepyPMs,not_removed,guys who say things like we can be friends arent you allowed to have friends when you tell them youre not single are still going to ask you for nudes and initiate inappropriate conversations with you source this has happened to me too many times
creepyPMs,not_removed,i fink u freeky and i like you a lot
creepyPMs,not_removed,when i see good friends written as one word i cant help but read it like the narrator of the history of japan video because they are goodfriends
creepyPMs,not_removed,not just friends but good friends he finks
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep these guys arent looking for friends theyre looking for nudes dirty talk money andor green cards thank god for the filtered message box on facebook
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly what i thought when i read fink
creepyPMs,not_removed,yikes looks like you dodged a bullet by cutting them off
creepyPMs,not_removed,loool
creepyPMs,not_removed,you like os huh
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love the oh i see like hes just had some kind of fucking epiphany
creepyPMs,not_removed,whoops title typo ¯ツ¯
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should be at least bi likeno thats not how that works at all way to invalidate the sexuality of bi and lesbian women because its not getting your dick wet idiot
creepyPMs,not_removed,look a man has deigned to message you the very least you should do is change your sexuality for him its only fair
creepyPMs,not_removed,these dating sites need to come up with a bloody gender filter i like girls i dont want messages from those who indentify as male as male option doesnt stop catfishers but it at least stops this crap also if this something like meetme which i am told is a friend place as well i apologize i still dont have it all down
creepyPMs,not_removed,the fucking moron
creepyPMs,not_removed,im going to think that is what happened
creepyPMs,not_removed,in theory i would like one of his gaylesbian friends to sit him down and explain a few things but i guarantee he doesnt have any
creepyPMs,not_removed,right its like saying youre attractive to me so you should be sexually available to me i mean its not like your a person or anything i just hope that he learned something from this
creepyPMs,not_removed,im bi and not attracted to people like that people who think sexuality is the only thing that matters in attraction grr
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know it was so cruel and selfish of me to not let people use me as community property s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think okcupid does come with the option for lgbt people to not be seen by straight people if thats what they choose
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is from meetme all of the creeps ive gotten have been id fucking love a gender filter
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like a movie title
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats what im going with as well
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think he did and thats always nice
creepyPMs,not_removed,there is a lot that goes into attraction and its a shame that bi and pan people still have to deal with being seen as going after anything that moves
creepyPMs,not_removed,email them or twitter it if you have an account it wont stop the catfishers and some of the other jack asses but at least you dont have to deal with the ones who are lazy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean if sexuality has everything to do with it then why dont straights have sex with everything that moves and lesbians with all girls and gay men with all boys ect s
creepyPMs,not_removed,amen like i always saybeing bi or pan does not mean being
creepyPMs,not_removed,meetme doesnt give a shit i lost my last account because of a problem with a bugglitch and i tried emailing them and contacting them over twitter i got no response either way meetme isnt going to do anything to help with this either
creepyPMs,not_removed,cause thats different s people usually dont think about things til it effects them or til its brought up in a way they can understandrelate to
creepyPMs,not_removed,well shit thats sort of terrible this is one of those times when i wish i was a coder or had the resources to become one
creepyPMs,not_removed,so if bi people will have sex with anyone they have the capacity to be attracted to based off gender does that mean you have sex with of the population not just the ones you personally find attractive all of them s
creepyPMs,not_removed,its terrible and hilarious meetme reminds me of tumblr in a few ways
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats usually a good way to do it sometimes it doesnt click with them tho
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have never been to tumblr hell most of the internet is pretty foreign to me left facebook because it was fucking with my mental health hard never got into anything else and one day found myself on reddit
creepyPMs,not_removed,its obviously different for me because im im okay bi people have bi cooties go away s
creepyPMs,not_removed,tumblrs coding is basically two spaghetti noodles its so bad ive had my blog on tumblr for about years so im used to all of its weird problems but if facebook was bad for you then tumblr will be too
creepyPMs,not_removed,but isnt the most of the internet a lot of websites are probably poorly put together because of the amount of they need to run stay financially active the ads the third party site links ect i know very little coding i went as far as creating a hello world with a little wavy arm guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats true but if someone posts an audio file and then reblogs it then it breaks that audio file all together i dont know how to code but i dont think thats supposed to happen
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah that isnt supposed to happen lololololol that has to be frustrating
creepyPMs,not_removed,it is and thats just one thing tumblr is also overrun with pornbots that lead to the controversial decision to block the tag lesbian and tag anyone who posted anything tagged that to have their account flagged as nsfw theyve since reversed that but still
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wonder if they really care though given the fact they really only care about user data and selling it which is terrible tbh they really dont care about anything its sort of the problem with commercialization of the internet companies are literally paid not to care about shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,i strongly doubt that they actually care
creepyPMs,not_removed,freakoid thats such a weird insult to use i dont think ive heard that in a long time tbh i chuckled a bit when he said ive never slept with a man either but it was unnecessary
creepyPMs,not_removed,freakoid for what being lesbian i dont see it being more freaky then being straight anime fan they are a more preferabe then the sports fans they are peaceful koalas have you ever seen a koala riot have you op you are awesome dont sweat the small stuff like the silly words of someone that goes from princess to freakoid in iamlesbian seconds
creepyPMs,not_removed,blargh i hate the whole princess thing in a sexual context i mean its fine if thats a womans fetish in an existing relationship but you flat dont tell a woman she will become my princess its rapey and gross
creepyPMs,not_removed,i lost it when he said that hed never slept with a man
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a jackass
creepyPMs,not_removed,freakazoid mcspazatron s
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow what a lame insult is this all he could come up with and whats with dudes hitting on lesbians
creepyPMs,not_removed,aw i didnt expect a response like this thats so sweet thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,from what i understand the logic tends to be either lesbian just means i can have hot bisexual threeways with her or she just hasnt met the right man yet my penis will fix this ive met a lot of men both online and irl who think they can somehow talk me out of being a lesbian gags
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats still a weird insult to use
creepyPMs,not_removed,so shes a super teen extraordinaire
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont sweat it the whole community over here is full of awesome people i am just one of many subtly calls himself awesome
creepyPMs,not_removed,i refuse to link the article or give the dickhead who runs the site any links but over on this you can read about an article that was written on how guys are trying to give tips on seducing lesbians to have sex with men if you google it you can find a few places that give tips as well and parrot the article it seems like this has been a thing that started a few years ago with the creepy puas it seems like theyre confusing bisexuals who prefer women as being lesbians or else women who recently started to explore their sexuality and havent fully discovered their attractions yet the advice is creepy and typical pressuringplaying with our emotions crap you find on those sites let me give you a hint of the mindset behind this article its no secret that many lesbians arent lesbians because they like women but because they hate men ugh i remember thinking i was bi too for a few years and slowly realized my real attractions after i stopped being scared of admitting what i am after high school and going to college and no longer living at home or with my parents
creepyPMs,not_removed,you are awesome go you
creepyPMs,not_removed,god have mercy i cringed so hard at that
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh ive seen the site the articles from around quite a bit gross and manipulative seems to be their whole thing so im not surprised by this either puas are creepy fucks
creepyPMs,not_removed,same
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol its a bot
creepyPMs,not_removed,i get these all the time on sc and im not like popular or even active on it very much i dont know why they havent figured out a way to make these bots stop
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow a creepy pm from
creepyPMs,not_removed,your postcomment has been removed in accordance with httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,intense i never knew it was something even somewhat commonly dealt with on paper it sounds so devastating
creepyPMs,not_removed,they want you to click on the link whatevers on the other side might be a virus inappropriate or monetized
creepyPMs,not_removed,ohh that makes sense how odd that this approach works on people
creepyPMs,not_removed,what app is this ive never seen any fake creep buttons before though this probably would qualify as creep
creepyPMs,not_removed,this made me want to sign up for meetme just to get a good laugh at the creeps
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats meetme its nice that they have those buttons and im almost positive they see a lot of use
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think thats kik
creepyPMs,not_removed,ooh okay i heard its an app for just meeting people in general
creepyPMs,not_removed,deleted
creepyPMs,not_removed,the creep button is a little pacman ghost thats wonderful
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah okay thats why ive never used kik thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah its supposed to be for just meeting people and making friends but a lot of people try to use it for hookups i guess that happens on every social app though
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know right i like the little groucho marx glasses for the fake button too theyre nice touches
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre welcome ♥
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive used meetme before and i get a lot of messages asking for either sex or asking if i sell cannabis two types of people on there
creepyPMs,not_removed,hmmm interesting im guessing these people probably also use tinder and the like and do similar things on it
creepyPMs,not_removed,if thats his bedroom is my living room p
creepyPMs,not_removed,geez title scared me i thought you meant hed sent pictures of your bedroom
creepyPMs,not_removed,i also sub to rroomporn so when i saw that title and thumbnail i figured it was from there imagine my surprise i picture this guy sitting there in his real bedroom hitting the refresh button waiting for that one girl who might fall for this
creepyPMs,not_removed,mans hes persistent been going at it for months
creepyPMs,not_removed,dude i think donald trump wants to get with you s
creepyPMs,not_removed,now thats what i call a patient creep he managed to wait near months before trying to get you laid that aside it wouldnt surprise me if he actually has it a framed picture and just tells you you never asked if its the entire thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think scarface wants to have sex with you
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats the nicest parents basement ive ever saw
creepyPMs,not_removed,if my means google sure its his bedroom s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i refuse to believe this is his bedroom the floor isnt covered in jizz stained socks
creepyPMs,not_removed,that bedroom i can almost hear liberace playing in the background
creepyPMs,not_removed,fuck im poor
creepyPMs,not_removed,wanna go out
creepyPMs,not_removed,this hit me too its okay we can be poor together share a package of ramen or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have those fancy little maruchen ramen cups i got from aldi ill let you have a whole one in trade for a can of tuna
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have a pouch of that flavored tuna will that work
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre my new favorite person
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep
creepyPMs,not_removed,saw a whisper this morning where some girl was like finally paid off my car one guy immediately replies with sounds like you should celebrate with some i swear some people could turn a post about a parents death into a come on im hard for you like your parents casket
creepyPMs,not_removed,nice comppete shutdown whats on the tv
creepyPMs,not_removed,i saw a pm about the unexpected death of a girls toddler niece and her ex was like if you need a shoulder to cry on or a dick to sit on
creepyPMs,not_removed,world of warcraft
creepyPMs,not_removed,im really not a fan of creating bloody openings
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh hey that reminds me did you know that bed bugs mate by traumatic insemination basically the male just stabs the female any ol place with his daggerlike penis and ejaculates into the wound just yknow speaking of sexy bloody openings anyway whatre you doing later
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hate when they make huge assumptions and then berate people for trusting relationships like what are you trying to achieve here
creepyPMs,not_removed,let me just say as an indie game dev that guys advice is a bunch of common sense mixed with a bunch of nonsense gibberish make sure when you release your englishlanguage game to the internet you let people in america buy it too wtf yeah no shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow insinuating youre looking to cheat on your boyfriend that youre a liar that your partner is some sort of cuckolded abuse victim and being a stemlord gatekeeping fuckass who assumes that you cant do your job because vagina all in one message i have no idea why hes single s
creepyPMs,not_removed,meet new people a meaningful glance on the train a me too moment at a club an instant connection at skout were all about preserving the magic of unexpected meetings that lead to discovering new people from friendships to romance skout has been connecting people since the world has no limits so why should you from the front fucking page some people are so deadset on being right no matter how obviously wrong they are
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was really hoping youd say start off with hi i dont care thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,the code of life has many bugs ed boy ededdeddyjokes
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guys english makes me thing hes probably from india that and the hyperconservative stemlord attitude and attitude toward women
creepyPMs,not_removed,waahhhh youre not here for me to bone im single and youre not its not fair
creepyPMs,not_removed,i high key wanna punch him in the face
creepyPMs,not_removed,what app is this
creepyPMs,not_removed,he sounds like a nut to me and a huge asshole
creepyPMs,not_removed,til my own country is full of religious fanatics that i have never seen also who even needs to look up what social network means the name clearly doesnt mean dating site unless ive been doing facebook really wrong
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is the most pretentious pile of bullshit i have read yet
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive noticed most of these posts revolve around someone who speaks english as a second language im not sure what to make of that but its an interesting observation
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes pissed off that he cant hit on her because she has a bf
creepyPMs,not_removed,im just a junior artist its not even up to me where our games go lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont bring stem into this we dont want him or his fluffy greaseladen neck
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly
creepyPMs,not_removed,iunno he describes the uk as being mostly religious fanatics which would sound weird if he was from a more religious country like india maybe hes scandinavian
creepyPMs,not_removed,its skout
creepyPMs,not_removed,this like where are these fanatics i dont see anyone like that ever i love it when they say but this is for hookups well no it isnt and if thats why youre here then you happen to be a complete douche canoe
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was so knowledgeable he didnt even know what a game artist does lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,my bet would be that hes a racist with a stick up his arse about muslim immigrants to the uk
creepyPMs,not_removed,is it as creepy as meet me
creepyPMs,not_removed,but hes a marketing manager he knows everything ssssssss
creepyPMs,not_removed,umm it can be but its got a system where you can accept and reject new messages and most creeps just send winks as their first message so its much easier to ignore and filter out the weirdos i find
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is going to sound creepy but its not is the creeper version of im not a racist but preamble that racist people use before saying racist things
creepyPMs,not_removed,what kind of school is putting nude pictures up on their website op you should have called his bluff by telling him youd do it but first youd need to ring the school to clarify this was legit
creepyPMs,not_removed,better yet you take them and just send them to my phone please i could win
creepyPMs,not_removed,can i ask you something the red flag of datingfriend sites
creepyPMs,not_removed,the comments on imgur are as stupid as ever almost funnier than the post itself you probably shouldnt post them as public if you dislike getting such comments
creepyPMs,not_removed,you didnt know the internet is only for single people you must have missed the memo s
creepyPMs,not_removed,us women folk arent supposed to have a social life were supposed to serve our husband at his beck and call didnt they tell you that in the intro course s
creepyPMs,not_removed,do you need an imgur account to post images as private or without allowing comments the kids there are really sad and cringe worrthy
creepyPMs,not_removed,what app was it though if its something like meetme that app is not just for dating so being there looking for friends to play video games with makes total sense but if its like okcupid or plentyoffish then its kinda weird to be on a dating site not looking for a date ya know i dont recognize the app but if its one thats meant for making friends the expectation that youre only there for dating is stupid though i will say regardless of which app it is this dude was way out of line in the actual content of his messages its disrespectful rude and uncalled for when you were responding politely

creepyPMs,not_removed,rignorantimgur
creepyPMs,not_removed,huh havent even looked xd
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was shocked that the last imgur i made public wasnt downvoted to oblivion the posting community there is so toxic
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i tried it for an evening turns out no one on there read that part
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean i have an account but i only posted so i could post here im just ignoring the comments
creepyPMs,not_removed,years ago i was on okcupid with a profile that specified friends only the option was there met some good people through it but its been a lot of years i have no idea if they still have that option
creepyPMs,not_removed,it is meetme
creepyPMs,not_removed,some asswaffle on say hi messaged me seeking a submissive sex partner i put him through the ringer asking him why in the fuck he thought someone posting about wanting to chat about games would be even remotely interested he whined that i shouldnt be on such an app again this is say hi if i wanted gamer froends and told be i was kink shaming
creepyPMs,not_removed,please do not use the r word here even if youre not talking about the op or the creep

creepyPMs,not_removed,ive seen posts here where the linked image is in imgur and there is no way to vote or submit comments there also there is no user name attached so i guess they were posted privately
creepyPMs,not_removed,actually i wish they did i had an okcupid account for years to keep in touch with friends and because they use to have these awesome quizzes and stuff you could post on blogs but you had to sign up if you wanted to save your results
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh no did they say renaissance
creepyPMs,not_removed,huh well ill have to look into that then thank you for letting me know
creepyPMs,not_removed,worsericotta
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry i dont really follow pokemon
creepyPMs,not_removed,rofl oh no i said one too
creepyPMs,not_removed,the kitten really makes it work
creepyPMs,not_removed,well he wont have to pay you once youre cockmurdered hes just using the phallus you wouldnt accept as payment to add insult to injury
creepyPMs,not_removed,how do you kill someone with your dick
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cant get over the kitty pic gangster voice meow yeah see meowll kill ya with my dick meyeah
creepyPMs,not_removed,the kitten makes it a combination of creepy and hilarious
creepyPMs,not_removed,everyone who has ever come into contact with a dick has died or will die coincidence
creepyPMs,not_removed,guy walks into supermarket counter with food assistant thatll be please guy sorry ive only got three images of my penis will that do
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had no idea that a person could be killed from disappointment
creepyPMs,not_removed,be careful he got a muatra
creepyPMs,not_removed,ok kitten
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,its been so long since ive seen a zoomed in photo of a text that wasnt horribly photoshopped
creepyPMs,not_removed,dammit i can think of any good pussy jokes
creepyPMs,not_removed,translation i have hiv edit really downvotes for suggesting the guy who wants to kill someone with his dick has hiv because thats the only realistic way of killing someone with your genitalia
creepyPMs,not_removed,well you ever seen a cats snickerdoodle
creepyPMs,not_removed,more like adding injury to insult lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,well based off the pictures he sent me he couldnt even if he really tried lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,theres a bunch of ways to do it if youre creative enough most of them are probably liable to backfire horrendously
creepyPMs,not_removed,i almost died from encephalitis once dont know the actual cause but i was in a really dark place at the time and its possible i had syphilis or something that caused it so thats one way a dick can kill you
creepyPMs,not_removed,have you ever watched thats how
creepyPMs,not_removed,something something contains small parts choking hazard

creepyPMs,not_removed,theoretically one could choke on a penis although that method carries the extreme risk of having your knob bitten off
creepyPMs,not_removed,well yeah a lot of people object to the use of serious illness as a punchline i didnt downvote you i am a callous arsehole but its not exactly shocking surely
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh man i love snickerdoodles i love how they taste especially when the snickerdoodle is still a little soft but the edge is a little hard and chewy perfection
creepyPMs,not_removed,strong stench maybe
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha i dunno you might die from laughter
creepyPMs,not_removed,please tell me that was your response to him
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh god no that shit gives me the chills
creepyPMs,not_removed,what did it say
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats my thought exactly especially if a person is choking what do they have to lose by biting down
creepyPMs,not_removed,can you do that if youre choking though what if youre not getting enough oxygen to your jaw muscles
creepyPMs,not_removed,guess im a callous asshole too as long as youre not wishing it on people eh
creepyPMs,not_removed,we dont tell people what it said when something was removed because no one should have to see that sorry for being short
creepyPMs,not_removed,alright fair enough i was just curious haha edit on your edit i understand fully appreciate the apology either way
creepyPMs,not_removed,get out your daubers everyone todays free space is negging as it is prevalent throughout the course of this conversation starts talking about fapping in his message tells me not to be weirded out by him approaching me too late because he loves bbws as if someone approaching me and hitting on me is so out of the ordinary and a christmas miracle i wish vulgar comments about bbw anatomy claims hes just being up honest and showing love claims to be from a generation that is all about positive energy because apparently having preferences or morals and not wanting to be messaged with creepy things is not showing positive energy a menagerie of pet names generation x and previous generations were taught the wrong ways aka talking to people like human beings and not phone sex operators even after he excessively proclaims his love for bbws he begins to body shame me because i keep calling him out on his bullshit and creepy behavior update apparently in creep language that means unless you are open to granting vaginal access to all who wish to use it you are not confident
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean he made it over mins and to the message before he mentioned his dick or called you fat he probably considers that playing the long game and you disrupted his approach for shame smb reqs
creepyPMs,not_removed,his word salad just hurt my brain
creepyPMs,not_removed,heeyy you prude big queen with the wettest pussy let me spread some positive loveenergy with my dick nope nope nope nope nope
creepyPMs,not_removed,his calling you queen all the time was kind of weird too not my queen just queen kinda off there buddy boy
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive been approached like this so many times i mean i get that theyre trying to be positive but it really just comes off so creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,another whiny manbaby who thinks there is such a thing as creepshaming what a loser
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,what have you so sleepy op
creepyPMs,not_removed,just wanted to say i love your username and im sorry that guy was such a creep
creepyPMs,not_removed,if someone approaching me and hitting on me is so out of the ordinary and a christmas miracle i wish i have that and im willing to make a trade
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahaha damn me this is what lack of sleep does
creepyPMs,not_removed,right i feel like i couldnt even respond properly that combined with little sleep makes one big headache
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol guys like this are in no way trying to be positive they are trying to manipulate women by using subtle negging to make them question their preferences and self worth regardless it is indeed creepy af
creepyPMs,not_removed,hello queen i messaged you a complete stranger so that i could tell you about my plan to fap in the shower today but dont worry beautiful i love bbws so there is no need for you to feel creeped out or closed up about someone finally giving you attention and boy is it your lucky day queen because im from a generation that believes in exuding positive energy through creepy unsolicited information about my masturbatory habits and facts about the vaginas of bbws unlike those dusty ass gen xers and baby boomers that still believe in the wrong and antiquated ways of talking to women like human beings dont creep shame me beautiful im just being up
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is the ironic partmorning wood partners not mine lmao
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,tis ok hard to get your generational vibes correct before
creepyPMs,not_removed,nice
creepyPMs,not_removed,especially when my generation only knows wrong ways
creepyPMs,not_removed,geez get it together
creepyPMs,not_removed,someone please tell me this is just another way to force a reaction out of people and not actual pedophiles
creepyPMs,not_removed,what site was this you should definitely report them to the site maybe even higher authorities but im not sure if they would do anything

creepyPMs,not_removed,i seriously hope this isnt real and its just some asshole trying to get a rise out of people that is so disturbing
creepyPMs,not_removed,well this sub can probably be done now because i cant imagine a pm creepier than this
creepyPMs,not_removed,reminds me of the toybox killer or dutroux for that matter sadly unsurprised these people exist
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit that is some running scared level of fucked up
creepyPMs,not_removed,pedophilia is becoming normalized that is the scariest thing i have ever read there is nothing normal about it about the damage it causes a child about the sickos into it this shouldnt be the norm for anyone
creepyPMs,not_removed,he and his girlfriend ie him and a hammer drill in a dress
creepyPMs,not_removed,expose and destroy these people
creepyPMs,not_removed,dude back in the day i used to call this chatline not actual sex line i think it was something like livelinks or we there was this guy asking if there were any horny guys out there who were into pussies without hair and young that perhaps have not taken a cock to please message him i reported that shit immediately fucking disgusting
creepyPMs,not_removed,this reminds me of something linked in comments on another post here
creepyPMs,not_removed,disgusting this might be something worth showing the police who knows if theyll actually do anything though but i remember reading about instances where pedos have actually arranged to molest children by planning it out over the internet sometimes with the childs own parents its sick but unfortunately happens this couple might actually be very dangerous who knows what happens when they actually find another pedo i dont even want to think about it
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh fucking makes me sick
creepyPMs,not_removed,for my own mental well being i choose to believe this was a troll trying to get a rise out of you but i would still definitely report them
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know this probably isnt what you want to hear but i think this is a thing i remember reading an article a while back about a couple of teenagers maybe a bf gf cant remember on holiday who got beds on a small private boat run by a couple who revealed to them that they frequently involved their year old baby in their sex and asked if the teenagers would like to join them obviously the teenagers denied the request but the husband suffered a heart attack before they could go to the police edit year old baby not
creepyPMs,not_removed,there was actually several recent big arrests in my area with a couple for this kind of activity its pretty fucking vile
creepyPMs,not_removed,sadly this happens not infrequently pedophiles also form their own social bonds some to support each other in being less ill and others quite the opposite
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is the first time i hope the nsa is watching what happens and that these two are not only on a list but in a dimly lit room being interrogated
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes please report this to site admins as well as local police ideally as a father of a young children this sht makes me want to find these people and do things id rather not be on record saying adults that hurt children on this magnitude should seriously not be allowed to even be part of society anymore
creepyPMs,not_removed,this was on kik ive reported it to the admins but im not sure theres anything else to be done im also not sure if the report button even do anything but i really really really hope it does
creepyPMs,not_removed,mod modding done right
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah im going to choose to believe this too otherwise i think im going to be sick
creepyPMs,not_removed,i remember the dutroux case and how it was a rude awakening to me that was the first i heard of pedophilia goodbye innocence
creepyPMs,not_removed,except for dpr not being a paedo but yes and i hate everything after seeing some shit on reddit only yesterday about how some guy wants tips on how to stop a five year old from telling even though he swears he never hurt her but is totally into young children yeah the planet is broken
creepyPMs,not_removed,to be honest running scared is a whole different game of creepy that couple was one of the most fucked up things ive seen in a mainstream movie ive seen some fucked up shit but it was way worse because i did not expect it when i first watched the movie fuck i wanted to kill the couple in that movie myself and they were just acting
creepyPMs,not_removed,theres a whole thing thats happening now about whether it should be viewed more as a disease and allowing people who feel those urges to get treatment before they touch anyone thus hopefully protecting more kids than just throwing them in jail after they do something
creepyPMs,not_removed,saloncom has ran like articles trying to normalise it check im a pedophile not a monster disgusting scary stuff
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think i just vomited in my mouth a bit what the fuck is wrong with people
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think i just died a little inside after reading that shudder
creepyPMs,not_removed,on what planet pedophilia is not and never will be normal pretending to be a pedophile to get a rise out of people is just as sick the person in this interaction should be reported banned from whatever app is being used and investigated edit while the poster i responded to seriously needs to get their head checked along with the ops creeper i dont agree with the post being removed i dont think their words broke rules of this sub per se
creepyPMs,not_removed,it is not being normalized people are now understanding that it is an illness and something serious that needs medical help that does not by any means imply that it is becoming socially acceptable
creepyPMs,not_removed,a girl claiming to be babysitting a child and asking if she should touch him messaged me i was half sure it was fictional but i reported her to the child abuse and exploitation place included screen name and that i wasnt positive if it was true but better safe then sorry the account was deleted three days later
creepyPMs,not_removed,try going to the little contact us thing on kiks website im on mobile and went to httpskikinteractivezendeskcomhcenusrequestsnew but im not sure if it will work for you since its mobile usually i wouldnt go this far to report one person but they need to be dealt with im pretty sure the kik team will do something about it i doubt they want pedophiles trying to find other pedophiles on their app
creepyPMs,not_removed,same they want to do what with what what
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read about dpr and while he wasnt a pedo it specifically said he liked young girls because they were tight and if he couldnt find the type of girl he preferred hed grab anything available it makes me sad and distressed dont know how you could force yourself onto anyone much less some little kid
creepyPMs,not_removed,it may seem clichéd but ditto to everything you wrote even after watching a serbian film that scene in running scared will always be burned into me
creepyPMs,not_removed,the poster youre replying to is a rgendercritical poster theyre a terf at minimum and the gc people claim that all trans people and some add all gay men are pedophiles and allowing gays and trans people to be part of society is accepting pedophilia
creepyPMs,not_removed,good for you this shit is not a joke
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you so much for this creep reported
creepyPMs,not_removed,after that movie i was never allowed to call my wife mama bear ever again
creepyPMs,not_removed,lmao what an insane leap of logic seems like its just if youre not hetero youre into little kids
creepyPMs,not_removed,is this a legitimate thing people actually believe these things those are some serious leaps in logic there just for reference what does terf stand for
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think this actually might be worth sending to the police
creepyPMs,not_removed,its even worse because a lot of terfs are hardline lesbians but they see the gbt part of lgbt as being subhumans beneath them it requires some incredible mental gymnastics but shrug
creepyPMs,not_removed,transexclusionary radical feminist
creepyPMs,not_removed,yup theyre really horrible a lot of them dox closeted trans girls
creepyPMs,not_removed,what the flying fuck
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks for the clarification didnt even know that was a thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah it is really messed up its super contradictory
creepyPMs,not_removed,butbut telomeres thos in all seriousness i feel your pain i went through it when i was your age and i still go through it in my late with men in their mid these guys need to learn that it is ok for all of us to have preferences and noone is obligated to date screw be friends with etc anyone they do not want
creepyPMs,not_removed,younger people tend think the older crowd have money would be my guess
creepyPMs,not_removed,your postcomment has been removed in accordance with httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am a man seriously hes not even gonna commit to his fake identity what did he think was gonna happen here
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am a man if youre going to pretend to be somebody then at least do it right he doesnt try to commit to his fake identity or deny he is a creep
creepyPMs,not_removed,he likes to identify the beautiful he identifies beautiful people he identifies himself as beautiful
creepyPMs,not_removed,a while back i posted a personal where i indicated i was only interested girls or individuals who identify as girls i was talking to a trans woman a while back and we didnt really hit it off so i told her best of luck etc etc she bombards me with messages for a while then randomly says something along the lines of okay you dont like me as a woman so i will be a man for you and that really made me feel weird like she lied about being transgendered so i would talk to her
creepyPMs,not_removed,these are the worst kind of catfish
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really dont get this one are guys that do this expecting sex because once the clothes come off theres a few things shes bound to notice lesbian naive
creepyPMs,not_removed,was there something in his profile that made it obvious or was it the cleavage shot for his picture
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh a man you say your trickery has ensnared me take me now
creepyPMs,not_removed,just fishing for naked pictures probably
creepyPMs,not_removed,super obvious fake cleavage picture and the profile made no sense
creepyPMs,not_removed,like a penis fly trap
creepyPMs,not_removed,i clenched so hard reading this that i no longer need a sexchange operation thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,rretiredusername
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont get it
creepyPMs,not_removed,lesbians always grow louder when theyre about to feed on man flesh
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like plants btw lets fuk yeah nothing gets me hotter than plants talk botany to me baby
creepyPMs,not_removed,urge for man flesh again well then wasting no time at all not even a hello lol i am curious how did he find out you were lesbian edit went to the store to get some ham and now this thank you im new to reddit and this is now my top comment d
creepyPMs,not_removed,heres another encounter
creepyPMs,not_removed,that sounds less about sex and more about cannibalism i say go for it op im sure hes prime steak material
creepyPMs,not_removed,well im straight but im pretty sure that comment made me never want man flesh again
creepyPMs,not_removed,why does he think that peppering random comments about trying dick again into conversation about normal things will make lesbians want to sleep with him what a delusional fuckstick but butmuh magic penis
creepyPMs,not_removed,saruman riled up the uruk ki by saying they would taste man flash so obviously this guy is just an ally of sauron and is trying to get you in the mood to go kidnap some halflings if thats not your thing i can understand but some of us really dont like the way gondor is always telling us easterlings how we should be all good and not evil
creepyPMs,not_removed,httpsimgurcomgalleryastzc
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really do not understand why dudes persist in pursuing lesbians its like okay women who are actually into blokes dont like me maybe i should try with women where my sex is literally unappealing to them wholesale because logic their literally lowering their odds does not compute source am lesbian confused by desperate blokes thinking id be more likely to give them a shot than straight ladies
creepyPMs,not_removed,as a lesbian myself the amount of men that think you just havent had the right dick yet is astonishing
creepyPMs,not_removed,this should be enough random nonsense before offering my dong
creepyPMs,not_removed,urge for man flesh makes you sound like an urukhai do you bear the white hand of saruman
creepyPMs,not_removed,op what the hell is wrong with you this guy is nice enough to offer you some man meat and you act weird about it all you got to do is throw on some fava beans and a nice chianti and youll have yourself a lovely meal generosity like this doesnt come around often dont turn it down
creepyPMs,not_removed,ew it sounds like hes offering it to you brazilian bbq style with the waiter carving it out and everything ok i went too far
creepyPMs,not_removed,theres a certain type of guy who thinks that lesbians are that way because they just havent been fucked really well by the right man and of course hes the one guy with the magic dick thatll turn you straight and be his love slave
creepyPMs,not_removed,man flesh is possibly the least sexy way to say penis i have ever heard makes it sound like you are a cannibal
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats disgusting bonsai trees are stupid just get a little fruit tree
creepyPMs,not_removed,just tell him you are into vore so if you ever have the urge for man flesh again you will definitely let him know
creepyPMs,not_removed,manflesh does he think you are an orc edit waaaay late with that joke sorry op
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like guys think that women being lesbians is different than men being gay like someone lesbianism is something you chose because you needed a break from man flesh
creepyPMs,not_removed,i prefer my man flesh sauteed
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not a lesbian and hes turned me right off man flesh ffs
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was onto something with the bonsai tree though i think im getting one on monday
creepyPMs,not_removed,i see an urukhai is trying to hook up with you nice
creepyPMs,not_removed,where are you hiding neighbor kasleo the destroyer craves man flesh
creepyPMs,not_removed,man flesh it back on the menu boys
creepyPMs,not_removed,the blurred out picture of him looks kinda like danny devito fitting
creepyPMs,not_removed,its working youre already turning straight admit it
creepyPMs,not_removed,man flesh who the fuck thinks that phrase is in any way sexy
creepyPMs,not_removed,that got weird suddenly
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love how the majority of these follow the template of something mundane something mundane something mundane bam something horrific and off putting
creepyPMs,not_removed,so youre a cannibal right man flesh does sound rather appetising did you get a bonsai tree let me know if you ever have an animalistic desire to eat me
creepyPMs,not_removed,ya know with all the straight friends who wound up gay or bisexual with a severe lack of the other way round its statistically more likely hes the one wholl change his mind
creepyPMs,not_removed,to start a bonsai with bonsai penis ill get my hedgeclippers
creepyPMs,not_removed,that comment made me a lesbian
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is actually funny as hell
creepyPMs,not_removed,respond creepy pms just loves these
creepyPMs,not_removed,is he an orc
creepyPMs,not_removed,the sheer gall of this dude assuming youre an orc
creepyPMs,not_removed,i see that an urukhai learned how to type
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should mention that youve always wanted to try cannibalism
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive always found man flesh is good with beer
creepyPMs,not_removed,i smell man flesh orc
creepyPMs,not_removed,call him invite him over and
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have a feeling that man flesh isnt back on the menu boys
creepyPMs,not_removed,someone wants to play hide the sausage
creepyPMs,not_removed,woahhe ehh got a little weird there at the end
creepyPMs,not_removed,the invalidation is insane with this one
creepyPMs,not_removed,you mean the term man flesh didnt turn you straight how is that even possible lmao
creepyPMs,not_removed,httpsmyoutubecomwatchvbpcarrytpe
creepyPMs,not_removed,do you hear that highness those are the shrieking sapphos
creepyPMs,not_removed,im so thankful i took a very small sip of coffee before reading this comment jeeez xd
creepyPMs,not_removed,rafflesia lacks any observable leaves stems or even roots yet is still considered a vascular plant similar to fungi individuals grow as threadlike strands of tissue completely embedded within and in intimate contact with surrounding host cells from which nutrients and water are obtained this plant produces no leaves stems or roots and does not have chlorophyll it can only be seen outside the host plant when it is ready to reproduce perhaps the only part of rafflesia that is identifiable as distinctly plantlike are the flowers though even these are unusual since they attain massive proportions have a reddishbrown coloration and stink of rotting flesh this scent attracts insects such as flies which then pollinate the rare plant it is not to be confused with the titan arum amorphophallus titanum which is also commonly referred to as the corpse flower because of its repulsive odor
creepyPMs,not_removed,do you think he knows that almost all bonsai are outdoor trees i dont think he knows
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive known him for awhile this isnt the first time hes made these comments to me needless to say hes blocked now
creepyPMs,not_removed,if i were her the only urge id have for man flesh would be to stab it in the penis
creepyPMs,not_removed,when is the last time anyone but him touched his dick
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha have fun with your little gay thing ill be here when you change your mind ok what the fuck is wrong with people
creepyPMs,not_removed,its like he spends all day thinking about this shit and only messages you to setup the ask
creepyPMs,not_removed,he shoehorned his shakeweight handjob joke in there so smooth he shouldve put a wet floor sign down
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think i just went from kinsey to
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like a keeper permanently keep him in a jail cell
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow his magic dick must have sexpreference changing powers that or hes a sour lil bitch
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats thats not how you give a good handjob
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes but is his meat marbled enough
creepyPMs,not_removed,the moon has risen the night is young but our blood is old before dawn breaks we must feast on manflesh
creepyPMs,not_removed,come on bby you can practice on me
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe because when a lesbian rejects him its because shes gay not because she creeped out by me still complete bullshit though
creepyPMs,not_removed,looks like meats back on the menu boys
creepyPMs,not_removed,as a haradrim i understand perfectly your dislike for gondor those bastards almost brought our oliphants to extinction
creepyPMs,not_removed,looks like meat is back on the menu boys
creepyPMs,not_removed,i clicked on the comments just to find this
creepyPMs,not_removed,because how could any woman not want dick they obviously starve themselves into a peniscrazed frenzy every few years and he wants to be invited
creepyPMs,not_removed,along with them acting like men are the only source of dick in the world
creepyPMs,not_removed,or they ask your friends the secret to get with you went to a party once with my roommate who happens to be of the man flesh variety and he was asked by two different dudes the best way of getting in my pants as if hed plowed me on the basis of being roommates alone what goes through straight boys heads sometimes
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean richard nixon is not the right dick but theres plenty of wonderful dicks out there s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i blame the porn industry
creepyPMs,not_removed,theyre a bitch and a half to care for i hear
creepyPMs,not_removed,or an urukhai
creepyPMs,not_removed,hi image links from quickmeme are disallowed by reddit please link to that image from another domain such as imgur and well reapprove your comment thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,firstly shes a lesbian so no he can not potentially get a fuck from her and two hes just lost a friend because hes a creep definitely a loselose situation and if you think this is a good way to get a fuck you have some learning to do
creepyPMs,not_removed,totally right what woman could resist what should be an obviously unwanted comeon if a guy is as douchey as possible eventually he will come across a woman with low enough selfesteem who will sleep with him and convince herself its a compliment afterall everyone knows lesbian is just another way of playing hard to get and a woman saying no really means try harder right
creepyPMs,not_removed,with a thought process like that no wonder youre a mgtow
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like the shrieking sapphos would be a kickass allgirl punk band
creepyPMs,not_removed,sploosh
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe he just thinks youre a cannibal
creepyPMs,not_removed,looks like meats back on the menu boys
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you do not know pain if you do not know fear you shall taste manflesh unless youre into womanflesh instead or both thats okay too
creepyPMs,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbpcarrytpe
creepyPMs,not_removed,probably some pediatric checkup when he was a toddler
creepyPMs,not_removed,nobody touches my dick and his comments make me retch
creepyPMs,not_removed,how was your day exhausting my dog tore the garbage apart thats the worst hey speaking of tearing shit up
creepyPMs,not_removed,it what world did orcs order from menus
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,in this case apparently not
creepyPMs,not_removed,or that if they do decide they are bisexual and not strictly lesbians theyll pick the guy who offered at every available opportunity
creepyPMs,not_removed,whoa what i gotta get a different dick dealer
creepyPMs,not_removed,did he reply with be a woman
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you make the appropriate sacrifice of manflesh to gaia every full moon they arent really that bad
creepyPMs,not_removed,relevant username
creepyPMs,not_removed,but those dont look and smell like zombie dicks
creepyPMs,not_removed,manflesh is too gamy woman flesh or child meat is much more tender
creepyPMs,not_removed,as long as the flesh consents
creepyPMs,not_removed,peter jackson orcs did apparently
creepyPMs,not_removed,middleearth arda in that world
creepyPMs,not_removed,some women have dicks
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was all whiteknight about it and called them out immediately and they both left before the night really got going that answer would have been a little more humorous
creepyPMs,not_removed,child meat
creepyPMs,not_removed,always practice ssc with your man or womanflesh or alternate flesh as appropriate
creepyPMs,not_removed,why
creepyPMs,not_removed,wat
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know its from the films its just i dont see mordor have many good restaurants or orcs agonising over a menu choice i mean i really want the man flesh but my friend glort says the elf flesh is to die for
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes make sure the flesh is willing
creepyPMs,not_removed,i prefer a rack ofwith womanflesh
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry i meant it was a fabulous burn
creepyPMs,not_removed,id say youre just here for petty arguments and im gonna go ahead and avoid that

creepyPMs,not_removed,hi everyone my name is yasmine and im the cofounder of this company it was inspired by a solo sixmonth trip throughout south america where i met too many people who shared experiences of assault the goal is to make better versions of existing selfdefense tools and invest the proceeds into empathy training we hope to not need to exist one day if you have any questions about it please let me know
creepyPMs,not_removed,that last link isnt the correct link and will lead to a virus the correct one has org at the end just an fyi to anyone whos going to click it httpwwwjoinoneloveorg
creepyPMs,not_removed,i definitely want to look into this closer to release when they have more info on the feature remindme weeks
creepyPMs,not_removed,just so yall know samsung phones have an sos feature you go into settings and there should be a privacy and safety tab there you will find an sos feature what it does is sends a photo gps coordinates and a text to a contact of your choice i do not know if iphone has that probably does youll have to google instructions for that i dunno how it works
creepyPMs,not_removed,i saw a display for a product that works the same way but not quite as elegant looking at my local brookstone i searched their website and i think this is it its an amazing idea im going to try to get one this weekend
creepyPMs,not_removed,dude this could be incredibly useful for situations with kinky people where a safecall isnt an option too
creepyPMs,not_removed,remindme in weeks
creepyPMs,not_removed,well may be an option in some states as well
creepyPMs,not_removed,remindme weeks this could be useful for my sister who just moved to ny
creepyPMs,not_removed,o
creepyPMs,not_removed,remindme weeks
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey your account is shadowbanned that means most people dont see your comments and it could have happened years or months ago reddit has a rule on self promotion you can only post so much about your product or your website before they consider it spam i assume thats why your account is banned read more about it in the link below httpswwwredditcomwikiselfpromotion it would be best to message the admins using so they can unban your account or make a new one because any message comment or post you make from this one wont show up also i saw your sweet tweet about this post and the appreciation is mutual i approved your comment here and people can respond to you but they wont see any future responses just so youre aware thanks for the great product take care
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry about that thanks for catching it another mod removed the post after you brought it up so someone didnt get infected and i put it back up after fixing it
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre being down voted so im going to give you a chance here can you elaborate on what you meant by that if you mean safe wording out theres no reason to need this rather than a healthy nonverbal signal
creepyPMs,not_removed,is that a loaded statement
creepyPMs,not_removed,im going to give you a chance here what a strangely condescending way to do this
creepyPMs,not_removed,safecalls are silent calls you send to let a person quietly know youre safeneed help when youre meeting a person and things become uncomfortable or dangerous a nonverbal signal would not be seen by somebody who is not in the room or house where you are and neither would a verbal one be heard furthermore a verbal signal would defeat the point since the idea is that the person not know youre calling for help
creepyPMs,not_removed,is that a pun
creepyPMs,not_removed,they were at
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah i see what you mean now that makes more sense thats definitely be a subset of this products uses yeah anytime youre meeting someone you dont know or trust its a good idea
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah but why say it like youre doing them a huge favour
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeahh exactly
creepyPMs,not_removed,protip the password is oooorgyyyyyy
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly if someone was paying me to write invites to an orgy id probably spit out something like this
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cant help thinking that the guy whose name and email is listed isnt gay and has no idea his info is being put out there
creepyPMs,not_removed,context would be help if i got this from a stranger especially if i didnt fit the target demographic i would be creeped out if it was from a friend i trust i wouldnt be creeped out

creepyPMs,not_removed,what is with that random ass pic of some woman taking a mirror selfie is that a picture of yours hes sending you in case you forgot what you looked like or like just some picture of some woman somewhere sent for some reason is he trying to pass himself off as that woman to try to trick people into talking to him but then switches immediately to talking about his dick anyway

creepyPMs,not_removed,this is amazing makes me want to learn old english more then ever
creepyPMs,not_removed,is it weird that i was trying to read your billy goat story to see if i could understand any of it i got so distracting by that i didnt even read any of his messages ha ha
creepyPMs,not_removed,i speak some swedish and i was happy to realize i could read the tale of three goats and understand most of it so this was both fun and linguistically interesting to read
creepyPMs,not_removed,the umlaut over the u in just made me laugh really hard
creepyPMs,not_removed,fucking gold holy shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh sorry yes thats my profile picture and i have no idea why he kept sending it
creepyPMs,not_removed,its like what type of person would actually believe that was someone elses penis its like wtf dude the unsolicted dick pic made me pretty angry but the some what arrogant entitlement makes me enraged
creepyPMs,not_removed,this mean not the end of novel i think
creepyPMs,not_removed,well honestly he wants her to put a whore in her asshole duh
creepyPMs,not_removed,but it was so big and active
creepyPMs,not_removed,ahah yeah me too
creepyPMs,not_removed,jeg er mest imponert over at han faktisk tok seg tid til å oversette og lese eventyrene for å finne en måte å snu samtalen tilbake til sex
creepyPMs,not_removed,well denmark ruled over norway for a long time so that language was sort of the base for ours
creepyPMs,not_removed,httpoaksnvgorgnorwegianfolktaleshtml you go
creepyPMs,not_removed,can you approximate that expression in english
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am gotta give them a challenge you know
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats the one
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes httpoaksnvgorgnorwegianfolktaleshtml
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe you forgot who he was talking to
creepyPMs,not_removed,skjønner ikke at han gadd å ta det så langt ærlig talt the thirst is real
creepyPMs,not_removed,jag kan nästan förstå allt ni säger swede
creepyPMs,not_removed,right that makes sense id heard that danish swedish and norwegian are all very similar and i have studied a little swedish but there are quite a lot of differences but i was very surprised to see how close norwegian is very cool
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow thank you a bunch
creepyPMs,not_removed,directly translated it means no speed without a moustache it makes as little sense in norwegian as it does in english which is why i didnt translate it in the post
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry haha its used mostly in a sexual context like op says theres no speed without a stache it references the people from trondheims love of moustaches a stereotype im sure but still funny
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh absolutely well done d
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks ill have to check this out i like a good tale from time to time
creepyPMs,not_removed,that has to be it he was just trying to help that poor misunderstood creeper
creepyPMs,not_removed,man i wish i could speak norwegian it looks cool af
creepyPMs,not_removed,its close in its written form but not when spoken thats the main difference swedish is generally easier for us to understand when talking face to face
creepyPMs,not_removed,no problem
creepyPMs,not_removed,well i cant even figure it out with the context
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive heard a lot of people say it sounds like were singing when we talk i dont really get it though since its my native language
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats really interesting im making my first trip out there next month to sweden and denmark not norway yet unfortunately looking forward to learning a lot
creepyPMs,not_removed,det gjør synes jeg spesielt når sammenligne du med dansk jeg har også brukt norsk å bli kvitt av shithead menn en turk plager meg på instagram nå
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hope youll enjoy it both countries are really nice
creepyPMs,not_removed,so shithead is still the word for shithead in norwegian amazing how languages developed
creepyPMs,not_removed,im a native english speaker lol i find it easier to use english swears
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah fair enough
creepyPMs,not_removed,when i kiss more girls than you hello yes i just witnessed a murder
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love your replies they genuinely made me piss myself laughing
creepyPMs,not_removed,these guys are always the worst lovers too
creepyPMs,not_removed,isnt tinder a hook up app
creepyPMs,not_removed,this was actually a friend of mine but ill be sure to tell her
creepyPMs,not_removed,not exclusively but it can be
creepyPMs,not_removed,sometimes but theres definitely a line between hookup culture and being downright inappropriaterude specifically when he asked my friend if she wanted to bet that hed fuck her
creepyPMs,not_removed,i always thought it was exclusively a hook up app
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh no its absolutely inappropriate no matter the platform
creepyPMs,not_removed,dat game doh
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats disturbing
creepyPMs,not_removed,not rapey at all
creepyPMs,not_removed,this might be the single creepiest one liner ive seen on here at least most creepy pms have some sort of consensual element there one day we will fuck like rabbits or something stupid but this one man so rapey
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe he is a philosopher and he was referring to penetrating her in a metaphysical sense
creepyPMs,not_removed,ew much
creepyPMs,not_removed,one day i will penetrate u nbsp i have too many responses to this and i cant pick one
creepyPMs,not_removed,was the person who sent it a lumberjack by chance
creepyPMs,not_removed,twenty hours later ur heart penetrate ur heart sorry lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,things to look forward to obg s edit spacing
creepyPMs,not_removed,wait this does not make girls swoon
creepyPMs,not_removed,that line doe shit son he must get mad pussy or not
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats fucked up
creepyPMs,not_removed,his life goal is to pierce your ears you can get that job at the mall the training video is like half an hour its still on vhs
creepyPMs,not_removed,legitimately came here for this
creepyPMs,not_removed,how does sex even work in sl
creepyPMs,not_removed,damn second life thats a blast from the past
creepyPMs,not_removed,background i am a parttime read extremely infrequent escort on sl this infrequency is the main reason its not a part of my profile met this girl in a sex sim and we connected because she and i seemed to share similar bubbly personalities as well as having the same nickname it should be mentioned that the day i was there i was hanging out with a longterm partner and not looking for new people to screw around with my profile also says that i do not fool around randomly with people who arent my partners we had talked a few times since then and it was mostly just friendly banter about different avatars and clothes we had and about the sim we met at this was maybe our forth or fifth conversation
creepyPMs,not_removed,i rarely open sl anymore because of meeting so many psychos
creepyPMs,not_removed,i kinda wish id known about this subreddit back in my escortstripper days on imvu soooo many creeps willing to break club rules was thinking about switching to sl since imvus kinda dead lately but the last time i tried to use sl i got all confused trying to change clothes ended up with a transparent torso
creepyPMs,not_removed,girl
creepyPMs,not_removed,i must have been doing something wrong in sl never got creepers this is on some serious level lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,its a different experience to say the least theres an adult server that enables more sexual content but the animations have some weird interactions such as body parts passing through each other probably because these models can be heavily customized and therefore have different requirements for animations than the game allows for
creepyPMs,not_removed,in addition to what flametitan said a lot of people like roleplay in addition to or sometimes insteadof animations for their sex in sl in that case it takes a bit more thought and effort not everyone is good at the roleplay part
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing while reading this i had no idea second life was still active
creepyPMs,not_removed,returns to upvote once more
creepyPMs,not_removed,so how much is in second life worth any way
creepyPMs,not_removed,removed for violating rule
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know what you mean i have had some crazy experiences through the last years
creepyPMs,not_removed,removed for violating rule
creepyPMs,not_removed,i can definitely give you a hand figuring things out if youd like toss me a pm preferably not a creepy one
creepyPMs,not_removed,did your avatar have breasts males rarely get creeps
creepyPMs,not_removed,skys wasnt me it was in her busy message im not writing for you im certainly not going to change my style of casual writing to suit your tastes not sure how editing out someone elses typo and removing my emotes makes a conversation cleaner or easier to read
creepyPMs,not_removed,pretty sure youre part of the problem
creepyPMs,not_removed,still decently active actually
creepyPMs,not_removed,why thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,at current market value it fluctuates
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah thats whats strange lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,second life is a strange place
creepyPMs,not_removed,will do bye
creepyPMs,not_removed,bruh
creepyPMs,not_removed,please change it that you so kindly edited out of your original message
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dunno thinking others care at all to have your projected unsolicited opinion of them something this subreddit is literally full of
creepyPMs,not_removed,strange definitely but it allows people to do or be whatever they want and i think thats pretty neato
creepyPMs,not_removed,schematics and im bored done replying to you have a good night
creepyPMs,not_removed,all of your comments have been removed for violating rule read the rules before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,schematics semantics
creepyPMs,not_removed,you must be trolling surely you understand that nobody cares about what you think of emotes
creepyPMs,not_removed,you can post all you want man youre obviously missing the point of noone caring about the writing style of a conversation with a weirdo
creepyPMs,not_removed,im so beyond sick of the hey sexy u wan sum fuck no thanks ur fat and ugly anyway shit goddamn grow up
creepyPMs,not_removed,props for curb stomping this guys ego 😂 you dont wanna sleep with me so you are ugly yeah real original bro this is pretty much the definition of butt hurt
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol and acts like that what a fucking loser
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like how he immediately goes from wanting you to suck his dick to wanting you to help him suck his own dick help a brother out
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was shocked when i read
creepyPMs,not_removed,looks like someones mommy and daddy didnt teach him about life not being fair
creepyPMs,not_removed,a title 👌
creepyPMs,not_removed,did that even work when they were are they that butt hurt
creepyPMs,not_removed,is that michelle flaherty

creepyPMs,not_removed,creep d
creepyPMs,not_removed,he just lobs that hail mary at then end for good measure
creepyPMs,not_removed,a real gentleman asks you to view his profile at least once before asking for sex hes a keeper obviously
creepyPMs,not_removed,imagine if you had checked his profile how much faster hed have asked for sex wowee he sure shoots from the hip and inevitably missed by a long shot
creepyPMs,not_removed,that escalated quickly
creepyPMs,not_removed,please remove all identifying info before submitting posts thankyou if this is actually pictures of a celebrity or someone and i just am ignorant please let me know
creepyPMs,not_removed,match oooof
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had it stated in my profile i was a feminist mostly to deter the assholes like those i remember getting a message that said am i oppressing you right now after i ignored his first message i ignored his first message because he was a sexist ass on his profile
creepyPMs,not_removed,he sure knows how to pick up the ladies doesnt he
creepyPMs,not_removed,enemy on a scale of one to none how accurate id this
creepyPMs,not_removed,well done internet stranger that is exactly what i mean
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont get it
creepyPMs,not_removed,cant argue with that
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats a good idea lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,for negging though
creepyPMs,not_removed,i too would like to start a conversation about the chef in your name uhhh is it cooking related or did you misspell chief see what a normal conversation we are having now
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read the whole thing again in an effort to find ape shit crazy can confirm not in evidence unless polite explanation of different goals now constitutes it did i miss that memo
creepyPMs,not_removed,okay now you have to tell us what the chef in your name means or you know you dont have to but itd be cool
creepyPMs,not_removed,seems like the guy messaged her talking about how beautifulsuper sexygoddesslike op is she responded stating she prefers actual conversation not compliments on her looks from a stranger and recommended he open with something interesting to talk about next time instead of the shallow praise
creepyPMs,not_removed,it means im a chef weird right
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is exactly right
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a crazy idea
creepyPMs,not_removed,wait ucooknshit is a chef
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha for some reason it reminded me of credit rtexts
creepyPMs,not_removed,great comeback did he shut up and go away after that
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes he sure did
creepyPMs,not_removed,your bearded friend looks like hes staring at me
creepyPMs,not_removed,what app is this people keep posting screencaps from it and ive never seen it in my life
creepyPMs,not_removed,shakes tip jar nice work op
creepyPMs,not_removed,awesome
creepyPMs,not_removed,jeez he went from to in two texts
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was laughing because are bigger than most
creepyPMs,not_removed,fucking savage
creepyPMs,not_removed,wonderfully brutal
creepyPMs,not_removed,meetme it is pure creep fodder
creepyPMs,not_removed,beers and anal sounds like a gay couples netflix and chill
creepyPMs,not_removed,beersanal im surprised that didnt work
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love that this is the same type of thing that would upvoted in the tinder subreddit
creepyPMs,not_removed,im reading that and thinking of the smoke and a pancake scene from austin powers beer and anal wine and a blowjob vodka and tequila and bondage
creepyPMs,not_removed,at least he got it out nice and early
creepyPMs,not_removed,beers anal sounds like a sex shop that sells alcoholwe might need to write up a business plan op lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,so much tedious small talk avoided by going directly to beers and anal
creepyPMs,not_removed,he forgot to say please
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know why i was surprised that there is a tinder subreddit but there goes my morning
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly
creepyPMs,not_removed,the boogers line took it from wtf to pathetically hilarious what a joke
creepyPMs,not_removed,thatll make her so insecure im a genius oh she can look at her pictures and see its not true you have three boogers then
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah gotcha makes more sense now still childish as crap
creepyPMs,not_removed,please censor out all names and identifying information before submitting posts to the sub as per rule
creepyPMs,not_removed,why the hell is omegle filled with spam and bots lately ive been getting the same link to a girls paypal for months

creepyPMs,not_removed,probably to fool people like me who thought they were actual people at first
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh he totally put me back in my box he got weirder too
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol easiest ban today
creepyPMs,not_removed,what did i miss
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank god hes been eradicated from another sub
creepyPMs,not_removed,because thats not what he said and even if that were the case asking that is a violation of rule
creepyPMs,not_removed,pun op
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol with his last comment i can clearly see him backing away slowly with his hands raised
creepyPMs,not_removed,im so mad that he didnt appreciate your response he should gracefully conceded and instead he was like no really
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus that developing line was perfect
creepyPMs,not_removed,i agree it was a really good comeback and the guy basically acted clueless in response
creepyPMs,not_removed,update ah
creepyPMs,not_removed,did he follow it up by trying to hit on you i think its absolutely hilarious that your pictures made him feel so strange that he forgot to hit on you like he just forgot his reason for being on the site
creepyPMs,not_removed,background im a concept artart nude model and i use instagram as a portfolio of sorts ive got it linked to my okc as its a big part of my life and interests but i feel like an asshole putting model on my profile apparently the fact that nude doesnt always equal sexual is blowing this guys mind
creepyPMs,not_removed,shoutout to the casual misogyny in this post too bravo to whatever man was behind your pictures being this good
creepyPMs,not_removed,why this makes me to think why did you make him think why that poor man s
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy titty not for boner titty is people no touch weewee how
creepyPMs,not_removed,please confuse more idiots with this
creepyPMs,not_removed,i almost had sympathy for him before he seemed like a robot that had just learned to feel but no he was just a confused and horny idiot
creepyPMs,not_removed,there it is
creepyPMs,not_removed,ooof course he did
creepyPMs,not_removed,dang and he actually seemed less creepy before
creepyPMs,not_removed,knew that was coming these people you can just tell
creepyPMs,not_removed,really just a matter of time
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think thats great actually especially since he was intrigued enough to ask about it without being smarmy and crass
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like your artwork is having the intended effect
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah got to love the models are just ladies who sit there and look pretty and take no part in the creative process mentality
creepyPMs,not_removed,is he a golden retriever thats kind of how i imagine them thinking syntaxwise
creepyPMs,not_removed,changing lives one confused nonerection at a time
creepyPMs,not_removed,well hes certainly a dog
creepyPMs,not_removed,i remember the woman in russia who posed nude and didnt move i am not sure how i felt about it as a person but i applauded the concept of what she was trying to do that had to be an ordeal
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really dont see how him saying that your boobs probably wouldnt excite him is a good way to attract a woman into bed sounds like pua shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,me and my husband are closer to his age and when the kids are gone we can go at it way more than once so either this guy jas an endurance issue or he is just being ageist to try and manipulate you probably the latter since he talks about your breasts like he is the year old
creepyPMs,not_removed,im on holiday with some family in a very foreign country and i stuck on tinder just to see if i could meet a nice guy who could show me around the city have some drinks with maybe a little more if we got on well everything was going alright with this guy until he outright asked to hookup which i politely declined as i said in the album i wont begrudge a basic hookup request on tinder as long as its not ultra creepy but i will turn it down as its boring an unoriginal and not how i roll
creepyPMs,not_removed,this should be posted as an example for all those crying boys who claim a polite refusal would end creepiness you were exceptionally polite to the tosspot and he still felt the need to launch into an inane screed to protect his delicate fragile ego you gave him an easy out and he instead decided to throw his toys all over the place and piss his pants
creepyPMs,not_removed,just you typical white girl
creepyPMs,not_removed,sometimes people say no but they mean the opposite well fuck that guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,positing your tits are your tits a theorem ive never posited my butt but alas it is still there
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont you know that the best way to attract some ta is to proclaim your sexual ennui and immaturity geez op get with the times 😜
creepyPMs,not_removed,its such a weird thing to try and use to manipulate me though between ages and i had so much sex my dick doesnt work anymore
creepyPMs,not_removed,theres no winning tbh
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was the first thing i thought of when i read that 😂😂
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had so much sex my dick doesnt work anymore hes very much doing it wrong then
creepyPMs,not_removed,you laugh but i know at least one obnoxious asshole with a bee sting fetish who tries to harangue other people into indulging him through online roleplay
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry but in good old reddit tradition this has to be posted
creepyPMs,not_removed,are you a friend of
creepyPMs,not_removed,this made me laugh bc i have a family member who once told me she hums while she gives blow jobs
creepyPMs,not_removed,well then hello there lol i like bees too
creepyPMs,not_removed,this made me think of sera and her jar of beeees from dragon age inquisition sera has scribbled a jar of bees hitting someone in the face also a butt if only you could throw bees at these people through the internet httpdragonagewikiacomwikiredjennyinquisitionneedsbeeees
creepyPMs,not_removed,its always a buzz kill when your chat partner is not into bees
creepyPMs,not_removed,bees are pretty awesome ¯ツ¯
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh oh god what have i done
creepyPMs,not_removed,wat
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive actually heard that feels good or something i wonder if its true will have to ask my partner someday
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats pretty much half of why i clicked the pic haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,know what ruins a party bees i mean thats true
creepyPMs,not_removed,you have summoned the bee fetishists pray to monsanto
creepyPMs,not_removed,youve unleashed a beest no no im sorry that was bad ill leave
creepyPMs,not_removed,gobs not on board
creepyPMs,not_removed,take your pity upvote and go
creepyPMs,not_removed,beads
creepyPMs,not_removed,context
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes you may not be the only person in the universe but you are the one telling him no thats the key factor in this conversation its like this guy has no understanding of how these things work
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah even more psycho than i thought psycho bullet dodged
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah even more psycho than i thought psycho bullet dodged
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus christ
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats a formal nope right there
creepyPMs,not_removed,times he said the n word times she said cracker yeah no its totally comparable even when you dont factor in the other offhand racist remarks and cringey rape comments justified by a fantasy tv show
creepyPMs,not_removed,if thats d s rp on fb hes super crazy he writes terrible blogs about people hes stalked and harasses in sl
creepyPMs,not_removed,what an ass sorry you had to deal with that
creepyPMs,not_removed,gross
creepyPMs,not_removed,i actually got my second creeper a couple weeks ago while shopping at an inworld fundraiser he was a week old but already so good with the ladies s it started out alright and then he was like youre so beautiful i was like thanks and for roughly you too can have a maitreya lara body and then he asked for my number and wanted to have roleplay sex i told him hey i realize youre new to all of this but that is not at all how you approach other people youre being a creep right now and he was like no i love you so i was like yeah bye now and blocked him the creeper i had before him tried to get touchy feely on the dance floor at the faery crossing which is very much not the place for that kind of stuff and i am definitely not the place for that kind of stuff either so i told him i was uncomfortable with it and that this was a family sort of sim and then he wanted to know if we could go back to his place afterwards he said he had an adult bed i unfriended him promptly he hasnt messaged me since
creepyPMs,not_removed,can i completely boss you around tell you what to do and act like you have no rights to ever question me yeah is that cool
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah domsub stuff isnt always sexual op how dare you so glad i dodged that bullet with yous haha these guys
creepyPMs,not_removed,its possible for a domsub relationship to not include any sex but bdsm and sex are linked more often than not and its still not appropriate to push on someone
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like he has the issues not you
creepyPMs,not_removed,it annoys the shit out of me when someone is politely told off but decides that politeness is another word for complete asshole what happened to them in life to make them think that when someone says no thank you it means fuck off
creepyPMs,not_removed,it makes me so indescribably angry when people open with that ds shit like a girl or anyone is just gonna give up her autonomy like yeah sure i dont know you at all but lemme talk about this shit that takes years to develop with someone you trust just makes me thing the creeps are just into it for the control which is kinda horrifying
creepyPMs,not_removed,forcing fetishes onto people is always a bad idea yo
creepyPMs,not_removed,idk what website youre on but do you actually engage in casual conversation with people on it
creepyPMs,not_removed,its not all sexual okay just do what i say because it gets me off in a not sexual way jeeze
creepyPMs,not_removed,op no thanks reaction thats the spirit
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol exactly theres a very high chance that responding that question would lead to more sexual questions which im not interested in with strangers i guess he dodged a bullet though wouldnt want a sub that knows her own limits and boundaries right hah
creepyPMs,not_removed,indeed old ass dudes who seek to dominate young women do definitely not sound like mentally well balanced people to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,okcupid absolutely i have a ton of friends ive met on there as long as they talk to me like regular human beings and respect the boundaries ive written out clearly on my profile p
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think the safe word was bye
creepyPMs,not_removed,clearly stated boundaries are super rude youre right

creepyPMs,not_removed,to quote victa from the amazing book morningstar bye felicia
creepyPMs,not_removed,context guy on tinder wanted to hook up but personal circumstances meant i had to bail on plans not the most comforting thing to read the day of a family members funeral
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry for your loss on the bright side at least you dodged a bullet with mr creepy here offers cookies and condolences
creepyPMs,not_removed,personal losstragic daydeath in the familyblahblahblah lets talk about the important things in life namely my dick

creepyPMs,not_removed,just think of all the things you could be doing though with this wonderful man
creepyPMs,not_removed,my mom committed suicide a few weeks ago dude on fb said he would fuck me til i was no longer grievingare you kidding me was disgusted
creepyPMs,not_removed,so he totally had a chanceand he went and shot himself in the foot
creepyPMs,not_removed,im sure he just wanted to give me some good hard emotional support
creepyPMs,not_removed,when my mom passed had two male friends over for support one actually gave it to me by being the shoulder the other wanted to bang me and told me so after the reception spoilers we are no longer friends
creepyPMs,not_removed,im so sorry to hear about your mom thats absolutely terrible i hope youre hanging in there and have support from your family and friends
creepyPMs,not_removed,im so sorry about your mom big love hopefully one day guys will get the message that their dicks dont cure bereavement
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am so sorry i cant imagine going through something so terrible and then having some dumb fuck creep try and take advantage of the situation
creepyPMs,not_removed,what the fuck
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats the part i found so interesting reading this and the post telling the full context like guy you had a shot then you had to be an asshole then these same people complain that they dont get any well heres why guys heres why
creepyPMs,not_removed,whoosh
creepyPMs,not_removed,i noticed edit sorry op i thought you had made a joke with the hard despite that commenting on that was rude edit karma works wonders to make sure things that i shouldnt say especially in this sub

creepyPMs,not_removed,angry dick pics wow thats a new one for me
creepyPMs,not_removed,so this guy came to a few months ago talking about how i look like a nice cuddle buddy i told him my boyfriend thinks so too he then asks if my boyfriend is black and before i could answer he talks about how he hates interracial couples and when i told him thats racist and asked him to stop he then started calling me names and told me i was fat and ugly and blah blah blah now he sends me a picture of his crocked dick edit forgot to mention i blocked him and he made a new account so he could message me
creepyPMs,not_removed,as i man ive only just recently learned about women getting bombarded with unwanted penis pictures but isnt this like a sex crime could you report this person and get them arrested
creepyPMs,not_removed,but to answer your questions the shaft of the penis can bend like that and its completely normal
creepyPMs,not_removed,saitama
creepyPMs,not_removed,i appreciate the level of detail capturing the curve when censoring it rather than leaving it to the imagination
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol holy shit 😂
creepyPMs,not_removed,youd be surprised how much of a thing it is for angry dudes to try and hurt the people who reject them by exposing themselves via dick pic
creepyPMs,not_removed,same didnt really think that would ever happened to me lmao
creepyPMs,not_removed,its a look what youre missing thing i guess op i love your response
creepyPMs,not_removed,as someone in an interracial relationship fuck that guy or rather dont fuck him in fact nobody fuck that guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think this is a perfect response
creepyPMs,not_removed,law hasnt caught up
creepyPMs,not_removed,i remember reading something maybe it was here or maybe it was raskreddit but it was basically a guy that used to send unwanted dick picks he ended up sending one to the wrong person and she reported him he got in legal trouble but i dont remember exactly what kind of trouble
creepyPMs,not_removed,ya know i havent thought about it but if i go up to a woman and flash my dick i could get im trouble how is sending an unsolicited dick pic any different
creepyPMs,not_removed,too bad that completely normal bent penis is attached to an abnormal scumbag
creepyPMs,not_removed,one thrust man
creepyPMs,not_removed,i noticed that too
creepyPMs,not_removed,how would you feel if you constantly got dick pics though
creepyPMs,not_removed,removed for violating rule
creepyPMs,not_removed,i usually laugh at the unsolicited dick pics i receive this angry dick pic shit is just sorapey im so sorry this is a thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive never had an angry urge to send a photo of my genitals to a stranger who turned me down its unsettling the more i think about it consider filing a restraining order if he continues to make accounts to contact you
creepyPMs,not_removed,will be using that for the future thanks lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,my housemate just choked on his veggie samosa when i read this aloud to him
creepyPMs,not_removed,he must be one of those fellas from hammerfell they have curved swords curved swords
creepyPMs,not_removed,because it happens so often
creepyPMs,not_removed,well now im curious
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah im really curious too
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe hes actually a dog
creepyPMs,not_removed,if theres a weird lump id bet he fractured it and it healed wrong
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats probably an old wives tale
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha i dont think thats how it works unless he was going to town on that thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have an ex who had testicular torsion when he was a teen and said the bend in his penis was because of lessened blood supply on that side because of the surgery could be true i believed him
creepyPMs,not_removed,im pretty sure its because most guys push it to one side most of the time i push mine to the left
creepyPMs,not_removed,i heard it was the way a parent holds a baby
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats all he can manage
creepyPMs,not_removed,someone screencap this comment tree we have a rcringepics in the works
creepyPMs,not_removed,never made this connection before scary id love it if there are stats to this to see if its correlated i also dont want stats because that means people are being assaulted
creepyPMs,not_removed,freud is so upset he isnt alive today
creepyPMs,not_removed,draw little outfits and faces and send them back
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have never met this guy he has one mutual friend of mine plus he has a fake name and no pictures of his face
creepyPMs,not_removed,i get confused because i have a curved dick but at what point of curviness does it become crooked
creepyPMs,not_removed,put the emphasis on the teeny guys love it
creepyPMs,not_removed,veggie samosa you say
creepyPMs,not_removed,have you ever heard of curved monitorstvs theyre dank af
creepyPMs,not_removed,i knew this would eventually be relevant edit the entirety of the gamer poop series reminds me of shit ive seen on rcringepics and rcreepypms
creepyPMs,not_removed,am year old male and this is honestly kind of a real thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,i may or may not have been incredibly high when i wrote that carry on rcringepics
creepyPMs,not_removed,what would you do interview rapists and say have you ever sent an angry dickpic
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have read that flashers are considered to be on the scale of sexual violence just like peeping toms basically that people who are on that scale who escalate the severity of their crimes will escalate in that same category versus say indecent exposure to robbery or some other type of crime i would consider this type of revenge dick pic to be on that same scale
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow having your entire worth boiled down to your dick sounds really sad and hopeless like thats the only thing you have to offer to fix something rather than talk like a person
creepyPMs,not_removed,uhhhhh wat that is so bizarre im glad this guy is an ex
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah but only because the coke is so much better now
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe cuz his views were bs
creepyPMs,not_removed,i saw someone who would look up the family of the angry dick pic sender and then once they had their mothers fb or name or whatever they would respond to the unsolicited uncircumsized curmudgeon and threaten them that if they ever did that again they would send the pictures to his mother and sisters etc i thought that was a pretty good way to get a creeps attention
creepyPMs,not_removed,just be careful
creepyPMs,not_removed,i report fake names but thats because i know a lot of people getting harrassed by dudes on probation and its so easy to get them to shut up when theyre exposed like that
creepyPMs,not_removed,nothings wrong with it all his looked like a knot and it turned drastically i tried drawing it out but i didnt want everyone to see his peepee
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think it is only when you are creepy to people almost every guy has a curve some a bit more than others nothing wrong with that
creepyPMs,not_removed,nothing wrong with curved dicks brother but when you show your dick to people that dont want to see it you open yourself up to justifiable ridicule
creepyPMs,not_removed,at a point of any positive or negative curvature
creepyPMs,not_removed,as a starter before his pizza uhhuh
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should look into switch hitting
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes actually
creepyPMs,not_removed,isnt that part of a clinical psychologists job like if theyre involved with the court system they usually work and dig to find patterns in behavior
creepyPMs,not_removed,if he were alive today hed be all about the molly
creepyPMs,not_removed,every time i see peepee it reminds me of the south park and the stick of truth
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i gotcha i was just trying to differentiate haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know just curious about the difference between haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,veggie pizza
creepyPMs,not_removed,please tell him hes a hero to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,eh went rnofap and it selfcorrected
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey nothing wrong with a nice bit of concern for your fellow human its not always a white knight scenario also im almost sure that commenter is a lady
creepyPMs,not_removed,removed for violating rule
creepyPMs,not_removed,im a woman dipshit
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think it becomes crooked if theres a measurable angle to it instead of a slope
creepyPMs,not_removed,but of course
creepyPMs,not_removed,well i would but i have to live with him and he does not need that ego boost
creepyPMs,not_removed,how long for coughs a friend of mine
creepyPMs,not_removed,yikes overshare
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe about a year
creepyPMs,not_removed,no problemo i think we should be more supportive of each other and battle against angry wonky dicks together why not eh
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy fuck meh ill i mean my friend will start next year
creepyPMs,not_removed,personal choice is great but this isnt the sub for that
creepyPMs,not_removed,im going to hazard a guess and say that they must be a fairly old guy the names they pick make me think of commonsimple names from the and
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey its me ur boobs
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol who actually talks like that
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is bizarre
creepyPMs,not_removed,dude will never learn thankfully that women dont talk about their breasts like this and that being less creepy is the better path to take
creepyPMs,not_removed,now this is some real creepin
creepyPMs,not_removed,please report the accounts to the bbp mods if you havent yet theyll want to know i posted in the same thread as you but no creepy pms for me perhaps due to my comment history in this sub or maybe they particularly liked the age at which you began to develop if so eeew
creepyPMs,not_removed,you know i got a really weird pm a while ago in here it was a girl asking me for skincare advice and since im a regular in beauty subs i was like ok but my skin is oily and her skin was dry but i was like alright maybe she doesnt know where to start when i asked what was she using her answer was that she slept with mud masks weird any person who has ever put one on knows that you cannot keep that shit on for anymore than an hour let alone sleep with it then she sent me a picture of her weight loss since she posted in rweightloss just an after weird and tried to get me to post a picture of my body problem was when i checked her history she just had a comment in raskreddit and the account was days old it was really creepy and weird i have never posted a picture of me on reddit cause im not comfortable with it then she started asking me questions about myself and shit people can be so bizarre sometimes
creepyPMs,not_removed,lmfao this is hilarious
creepyPMs,not_removed,so martha and joan will be messaging her soon
creepyPMs,not_removed,older men pretending to be women with big boobs
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes i messaged the bbp mods about it they do a great job banning creeps i just hate how it keeps happening
creepyPMs,not_removed,update their account has been deleted hooray i was starting to dread looking at my notifications only to see that they commented on another of my posts unfortunately its probably just a matter of time before they try again
creepyPMs,not_removed,awesome and yeah agreed
creepyPMs,not_removed,tbh i feel like ethel should make a comeback i actually like that name
creepyPMs,not_removed,what does bbp stand for dont know the sub
creepyPMs,not_removed,i agree ethel is great its sad that womens names go in and out of fashion so quickly i believe its almost entirely attributable to our obsession with youth and beauty as womens most important features by default we are so disdainful of unattractiveolder women we have a treadmill of womens names as each generation rejects the names of old women you really dont see such a shift in names for men richard william george henry fine names with royal roots tom like in the bible and tom sawyer gertrude ick martha drab edna hilda glays bleh all perfectly good names that are cast aside just for being old the only womens names that dont go out of fashion are the names associated with royalty or the bible catherine elizabeth mary sarah theyre so common its hard to associate them with any particular generation
creepyPMs,not_removed,ewww no
creepyPMs,not_removed,rbigboobproblems affectionately known as boobit
creepyPMs,not_removed,the only womens names that dont go out of fashion are the names associated with royalty or the bible catherine elizabeth mary sarah theyre so common its hard to associate them with any particular generation richard william george henry fine names with royal roots tom like in the bible i agree with your point but your argumentation is horrible
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like those names
creepyPMs,not_removed,whats
creepyPMs,not_removed,im surprised they said inches
creepyPMs,not_removed,swear to god
creepyPMs,not_removed,who thought that thanks to creeps i would learn something useful
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know its not like creeps to add only inches usually they add at least
creepyPMs,not_removed,my overcritical mind always wonders how they get the measurement theres at least four different ways each of which will give a different result
creepyPMs,not_removed,well i was more thinking that that was more likely to actually be true than that it was probably still tinier
creepyPMs,not_removed,now see thats an interesting question
creepyPMs,not_removed,that icebreaker is easily on par with the titanic
creepyPMs,not_removed,absolutely also normally eat and devour can be used interchangeably but somehow the phrase devour pussy just doesnt make any sense at all
creepyPMs,not_removed,gotta reply op gotta get those points
creepyPMs,not_removed,whoosh
creepyPMs,not_removed,did you cover up a dick pic with a hot dog in a chocolate eclair thats actually kind of fitting
creepyPMs,not_removed,fucking wrecked and he is completely oblivious thats an impressive lackof self awareness
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just rolled my eyes so hard im afraid i sprained something
creepyPMs,not_removed,jump boy it might hit ya next time
creepyPMs,not_removed,at my work ice breakers are usually involving talking about books which influence your practise conveying emotion through body language and what we had fro breakfast this guy would not fit in our office
creepyPMs,not_removed,his lips have tongues
creepyPMs,not_removed,and boom goes the dynamite
creepyPMs,not_removed,this line has been noted down for future use
creepyPMs,not_removed,i also like the my cock is always rock hard like dude maybe see a doctor if thats the case
creepyPMs,not_removed,one time i was stoned with some dude and he told me he had the munchies for pussy quiver
creepyPMs,not_removed,what kind of app is there where you gets points for replying i didnt even know that was a thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,why yes i did i did a google search for gross wiener and that was one of the ones that came up i thought it would be fitting for oktoberfest lol also his username had something to do with being a crazy chef so i decided to use swedish chef for his profile pic bork bork bork
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy doesnt fit into society lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,well thats not super politically correct
creepyPMs,not_removed,adult friend finder a creep goldmine lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is the best comment ive seen on reddit in a long time thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was always the best muppet
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre right and in future please feel free to report comments like that to bring them to our attention
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry we dont allow cross posts like this
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry but im removing this i see that you got into it with the op on his original post and posting here will only cause more drama
creepyPMs,not_removed,removals are at the discretion of the moderators and cross posting from a sub and mentioning what sub it was could allow for witch hunts which is why we generally dont allow public reddit posts for context we dont want drama to follow into this sub
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry about the removal hope you have a pleasant day
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just explained it to you as per rule please message modmail about removals thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive already given you a warning do not comment further about this please message modmail and ill be sure to have him get back to you
creepyPMs,not_removed,tbh this is one of the most tame creepypm ive ever seen haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,good on ya as if saying im proud of you for not being interested in creeps like me
creepyPMs,not_removed,what app is this i love the little tabs at the top creepy haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,jeez that reminds me of a kid i used to talk to until he told me his plans to get his roommates with two of my friendshe planned on getting them drunk he was high one day and thought of a line similar to that girl you like an iphone simple
creepyPMs,not_removed,a nice change from the extremely terrifying ones i have read on here
creepyPMs,not_removed,the app is called meetme
creepyPMs,not_removed,more the fact that he started with those gross pet names that i say i dislike on my profile other than that i thought it was pretty funny
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah thats always cringey
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my god that picture had me in tears well played
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol what the fuck that picture its too bad she said that i could have used that line on my girlfriend now its creeptainted
creepyPMs,not_removed,aha so thats where the term dickhead comes from til
creepyPMs,not_removed,hah
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love how she just gave up trying to flirt and just went straight for fuck it show me your dick
creepyPMs,not_removed,shit why cant i meet openly horny women on tinder the only ones who post responses like that are bots
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i thought it was funny too just goes to show you that girls dont want dick pics even when they explicitly ask for one
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was so scared to click on that link based on this im more inclined to think she was just making light of an awkward opener i dont think she actually wanted to see your dick
creepyPMs,not_removed,i do not mean to be rude but what you are doing is sexist it is sexist by holding women to different standards than men and by having lower expectations of what a woman would or wouldnt want you then went on to make a universal statement which is certainly not true if a man made that joke it would be a creepy pm asking or actual support yet here you are saying it was funny and the other commenter says seems like she was joking trying to write it off she said what she said its a creepy pm no excuses
creepyPMs,not_removed,i didnt think so either which is why i didnt send one
creepyPMs,not_removed,him hey baby can i split you open like a carcass on boxing day you wtf him what i was just trying to be sweet i mean my friend was just trying to be sweet
creepyPMs,not_removed,im wondering where he got his definitions of sweet and humour from
creepyPMs,not_removed,roopsdidntmeanto
creepyPMs,not_removed,he is it was his friend that did it
creepyPMs,not_removed,it does seem as if his grammar has not improved ever since he took back over from his friend though maybe theyre identical twins
creepyPMs,not_removed,the shameless hahahahaha would probably be the creepiest of them all
creepyPMs,not_removed,im just tryna be sweet geez aw shit that didnt work how about hahaha it was a joke lighten up missed the mark again better try it was my friend hes such an idiot lolz dudes backtracking game is so weak it cant even hold up a feather this sucks coming from your friend op at least you know his true colours now
creepyPMs,not_removed,do you think its ever happened in the history of creepy messages that it was ever true that someones friend sent them without the owner of the smartphonetelegraphsemaphore equipment like even once
creepyPMs,not_removed,and here we see schrodingers douchebag in his natural habitat
creepyPMs,not_removed,ahh the old sorry that was my friend excuse
creepyPMs,not_removed,who are all these people who loan their phones to friends
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha omg the backpedaling makes it even worse what a tool
creepyPMs,not_removed,wasnt even me tho
creepyPMs,not_removed,how the hell is that funny
creepyPMs,not_removed,as if the creepy wasnt bad enough hes ableist too
creepyPMs,not_removed,im honestly thinking of texting him some pointers so this doesnt happen to the next fucking hot girl he neets
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was trying to be sweet wait thats not working lol it was my friend ha ha ha
creepyPMs,not_removed,reddit
creepyPMs,not_removed,the usual you know those chads
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cringed into a different dimension its super weird here
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was to through the and there really wasnt an equivalent there were masturbaters on the subway you might get a game of telephone goingsoandso likes you do you like them but if someone wanted to creep on you they had to do it in person
creepyPMs,not_removed,my friend was about to send some inappropriate texts to my girlfriend but i got the phone back from her in time i now lock my phone with a pin
creepyPMs,not_removed,i did this to a friend of mine and i still feel like crap about it he was crushing on this girl and texting with her and i was drunk and when my buddy left the room i grabbed his phone and texted her what are you wearing i thought it was hilarious another mutual friend who was in the room thought it was hilarious too and he encouraged me to send it i sent it spoiler alert neither my friend and especially not the girl found it hilarious at all it was so stupid and all it took was three seconds worth of a bad decision to ruin two peoples nights
creepyPMs,not_removed,no
creepyPMs,not_removed,some guys see friendships with girls as a stepping stone to something more intense unfortunately
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahahaha it was just a joke my friend posted this
creepyPMs,not_removed,what ableist mean
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cant believe youre getting downvoted for this
creepyPMs,not_removed,pretty much hes asked previously for me to come over to his which i turned down politely was hoping hed catch on that i dont want shit from him
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont they need to know how high on the creeper scale he is from the getgo
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you text him again hell take that as a sign that youre still interested in him
creepyPMs,not_removed,there were lulz
creepyPMs,not_removed,you can be attracted to opposite sex friends its just shitty when you ruin a platonic relationship that clearly was only meant to stay platonic especially in this weird creepy way that this guy did it in
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
creepyPMs,not_removed,discriminatory or targeting of disabled people
creepyPMs,not_removed,someone against the disabled he used the word retard as an insult instead of saying that what his friend did wasnt cool
creepyPMs,not_removed,its reddit after all
creepyPMs,not_removed,kid gloves dont always work in these situations and he would either benefit from you explaining that that isnt an acceptable way to treat women or hed get all pissy and never speak to you again its a win win to me but it isnt on you to fix him
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think it would make a difference even if he took pointers i bet hed still manage to make it creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah there isnt anything wrong with being attracted to your friends the problem is when guys think their feelings towards their friends leads to stuff like this
creepyPMs,not_removed,where in the conversation
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah but to be fair we call people idiots too i have more of a problem with him being weird than with trying to use the right terms
creepyPMs,not_removed,true brd
creepyPMs,not_removed,agreed
creepyPMs,not_removed,calling people the r word in the last message at the end of the image is considered ableist and we frown upon it in this subreddidt
creepyPMs,not_removed,im simply answering your question not getting onto you for anything
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know everyones relationship with their siblings is different but i cant imagine discussing a celebrity sex tape with my brothers yuck
creepyPMs,not_removed,wut i mean wut maybe okc is cheaper than a shrink
creepyPMs,not_removed,dutifully knock one out fuck you it is not your duty to infringe on womens privacy you disgusting jackass
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think its designed to throw you off balance and make you interested enough to reply vomits
creepyPMs,not_removed,god they arent even shy about wanting us to do mental and emotional labor for them anymore
creepyPMs,not_removed,dutifully
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry blank no longer has an account uh why would anyone be sorry about that
creepyPMs,not_removed,he would discuss this with his siblings why
creepyPMs,not_removed,i agree it doesnt seem like a typical sibling activity
creepyPMs,not_removed,somehow this just doesnt have the magic of the confessional booth at least in a catholic confessional you can actually hear the responses to your sins of course after a few times the priest will recognize your voice and then it gets weird when you run into each other before or after mass
creepyPMs,not_removed,it definitely is why crazy people continue being crazy bad choices plus no help to learn how to make the right choices
creepyPMs,not_removed,is that how that works geez i need to step up my game s why cant people just start with hi your profile says you like x thing i love x thing then again i guess if that was normal we all wouldnt be here
creepyPMs,not_removed,lmao yes out of curiosity if she said you really look like aubrey plaza to me would that have been an ok first comment or do you hear it all the time andor dont like it no need to answer if you dont want to btw just curious
creepyPMs,not_removed,i actually have a disclaimer on my profile saying i get it a lot and to please refrain from mentioning her
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg are you serious so this dude either didnt read your profile or he read it and sent it anyways so so rude i changed my name about years ago to a pretty unusual one and id have total strangers who didnt believe me and wanted to see my drivers license dude i dont owe you anything believe whatever the fuck you want sheesh
creepyPMs,not_removed,meanwhile im sitting here like who the hell is aubrey plaza
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats okay they dont read profiles anyway
creepyPMs,not_removed,the cute brunette from parks and rec who hates everything marries starlord
creepyPMs,not_removed,no clue what youre talking about lol i guess ill check google images so i get what everyones talking about
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol for some reason i suddenly thought everyone watched what i watch here ya go httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiaubreyplaza
creepyPMs,not_removed,aw you didnt have to do it for me thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like a scam
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel this is some kind of revenge against the girl they are impersonating not sure about the apps involved but maybe someone smarter that i could come up with an idea to let the girl in question know about it from the english depicted i assume it is a person of desi origin which totally contradicts the profile pic used i know this is not a caw post but the advice is not directly for ops benefit but a probable victim of harassment let me know if im stepping on boundaries
creepyPMs,not_removed,danger will robinson danger run far and fast
creepyPMs,not_removed,and this is how you wake up in a bathtub with a kidney missing
creepyPMs,not_removed,or a copypasta
creepyPMs,not_removed,or a bot
creepyPMs,not_removed,bribing with food ugh this guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like how it all ends with the abrupt ok were done no fucking around
creepyPMs,not_removed,that was a horrible joke
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive played the demo send me your number and ill send you a trailer this alone would have pissed me off she played the demo your thinly veiled attempt to get her number doesnt even make sense i guess he was expecting her to say she didnt know about the game
creepyPMs,not_removed,i usually enjoy bad jokes but these made me cringe pretty hard
creepyPMs,not_removed,forget putting a little he proper shit the bed
creepyPMs,not_removed,woah i feel like ive seen her face somewhere before is she some kind of youtube celeb or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think that guy is actually an year old or someone who has those fetishes of being a kid either way its scary
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe he chose the wrong one
creepyPMs,not_removed,it would be bad in real life written out like that its httpwwwmathcolumbiaeduwoitwordpress
creepyPMs,not_removed,same thing i was thinking when i got it
creepyPMs,not_removed,even if op had not the obvious answer to give me your number ill send you the trailer would be just aend the link in this why do you need the number
creepyPMs,not_removed,it strikes me as one a year old boy might find hilarious
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah that made me hella uncomfortable
creepyPMs,not_removed,what me lol i wish if youve just seen my picture here i post here quite a bit
creepyPMs,not_removed,i agree why arent people nicer to the jerks that are harassing them s
creepyPMs,not_removed,what about that one where he asked her phone number to send her a link pretty smooth s
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh cool and also im sorry to hear that
creepyPMs,not_removed,fifty percent of the time it worksevery time
creepyPMs,not_removed,funny enough i do actually do youtube videos lol but im no celeb
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had to google who that was xd how do i remind you of her
creepyPMs,not_removed,ha ha gotcha well she sounds pretty cool so thanks for the compliment
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would unfriend him block him and contact his work he shouldnt be using customers information that wayi bet you arent planning to order again any time soon
creepyPMs,not_removed,always trust your gut theres no reason for some dude whos delivered pizza twice should try to find you on facebook hes totally going to get weird unfriend and in the future dont feel compelled to accept someones friend request its ok to say no or do what i do ignore the request that has the added bonus that they cant keep sending friend requests because the first one is still active
creepyPMs,not_removed,first point is if you have your phone number connected to your facebook then thats how he found you automatic syncing between facebook and contacts can make people pop us as suggested friend so try to limit the access to that from facebook privacy tab go to settings privacy who can look me up tab second i think you should write a polite yet very firm message to him telling him that you do not wish to have any casual contact with him outside of delivering pizza and in fact that you prefer if he doesnt deliver your orders anymore and that you will unfriend and block him if that doesnt work call his boss and let him know and take screenshots of everything hope he backs away and leaves you in peace
creepyPMs,not_removed,it sucks this is happening to you and im sorry youre going through this hes totally testing the waters and being gross about it by sending you sad emojis when you dont give him what he wants if you want him to go away unfriend him block him and dont respond to messages at this point he may be looking for any sort of response or interaction so the less you give him the quicker hell go away prepare for a few more frowny faces and the like because usually the behavior gets worse until it gets better its usually better to cut them off now rather than later as the behavior just gets worse also you may need to find a new pizza joint for a while though if he sends you anything weird or harassing you have more evidence to approach the pizza place with and explain what happened though really you could totally call and explain what happened and that you feel uncomfortable and im sure they would understand my guess is that if hes done this with one lady customer hes done it with others so if you let the management know it may not be the first time they hear this tale
creepyPMs,not_removed,unfriend him block him tell his job what he did and then choose a new pizza place
creepyPMs,not_removed,unfriend unfriend block and delete dont order pizza from there any more its a serious red flag when someone you barely know in any way tries to push a sense of false intimacy at you and then gets upset when you dont enthusiastically start in giving them what they want trust your gut i had a friend whose daughter was stalked by a pizza delivery guy until he went to prison for it the daughter was plus beware of anyone who tries to guilt you for not instantly responding to them or in a way they like when again they barely know you
creepyPMs,not_removed,id love to contact his work but i cant prove that he used my information that way also i tried the benefit of the doubt and responded to his first two messages with i suppose i dont tend to play a wide variety of games i just get really into the few that i do play not exactly rude right he has kind of a poutydont be mean to me sounding reply lol sorry you just posted stuff about wow or whatever i was just curious thankfully that message leaves no room for continuing conversation so i havent said anything back again hes not being flirty with me just coming off as kind of needy is unfriending him still the way to go i feel like hes going to mess with my food or something in the future if i dont keep him as a friend plus im really bad at hurting peoples feelings edit i also checked to see if there was a phone number attached to my account based on a comment here and there is no phone number it makes me even more suspicious that he put my name from the pizza box into fb search and looked until he found me
creepyPMs,not_removed,i figured i would update everyone on the situation i got very lucky a male friend of mine saw who was giving me trouble and said for me to immediately stop talking to him when i asked whywho he iswhat happened my friend explained that the man messaging me was once his manager at a different pizza shop the creep was fired for multiple counts of sexual harassment of his workers and was notorious for hitting on every girl that worked there the sexual harassment was so extreme that the girls threatened to take it to corporate hr long story short i will not be ordering from there again he has been blocked its much easier to consider calling his job and telling them what hes doing too he cant harass his coworkers so hes moved on to harassing customers ill be letting them know asap
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes please let the restaurant know hes creeping on customers on facebook today it could escalate to stalking or worse tomorrow
creepyPMs,not_removed,he could have already messed with your food because he liked you there was a creepy pizza guy that actually put his dicksnot in the pizza of a gal i know when we had sleepovers my gal pals thought i over react when i dont eat food from places with guys that are creepy until the host gal read his confession on facebook it wasnt really a confession but a nice guy rant on how he got back the evil womenz who didnt give him a chance in my opinion unfriend him block him report him to his employer and find a new pizza place
creepyPMs,not_removed,unfriend block and find a new pizza place i understand youre worried about him messing with your food which sadly is a very valid concern however you owe him nothing do not worry about hurting the feelings of a pizza delivery dude youve met twice who then tracked you down on facebook he might not be being flirty but he is being clingy and needy which is typical nice guy behavior and quite often a precursor to escalating behavior dont even give him a chance to escalate trust your gut
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would still unfriend him he isnt someone you know after all so no need for him to be in your friendslist and i dont exactly know how the finding people on facebook works since i dont use it but isnt it impossible for him to find someone without the contact info so he had to get your info from the order you placed
creepyPMs,not_removed,you dont have to prove anything youre not in court and even if he didnt steal your information he would have had to do some intense snooping to get that information another way hes a creep and is likely going to victimize others if you do nothing you may be risking your own safety if you report him though so please do whats best for you this guy is young and he can get another delivery job but this time knowing that stalking people is not cool
creepyPMs,not_removed,ew oh my god that makes my stomach turn thats so gross im so sorry that happened to you guys
creepyPMs,not_removed,i honestly cant tell how old he is he looks roughly my age though and im hes certainly old enough to know hes being weird
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep sexist as it may be it is why i prfer to make my own food or use female run and employed places less chance of creepy shit happening in my opinion yeah it really sucked since he had an std and one gal was a virgin so she wasnt getting routinely tested he fucked up her fertility for life
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think you can gets stds that way
creepyPMs,not_removed,good god thats awful that poor girl thats so messed up
creepyPMs,not_removed,ingesting spermprecum is a way to get stds
creepyPMs,not_removed,fortunately she seems okay with adopting and she has a twin sister who offered to be a surrogate so it would be her own child dna wise
creepyPMs,not_removed,well it can be but im not aware of any stds that would mess with your fertility from an oral infection chlamydia or gonorrhea can cause infertility but only if its a vaginal infection that reaches the fallopian tubes which wouldnt happen from an oral infection
creepyPMs,not_removed,but are you aware that stdsstis can spread to other areas of the body are you also aware that research is still be doing on how stdsstis affect fertility but reportedly a quarter of infertile gals are due to a previous stdsri infection not just vaginally there are many contradictory claims about syphilis and fertility but yet it still stands many gals report infertility due to it
creepyPMs,not_removed,but are you aware that stdsstis can spread to other areas of the body infections can spread but the idea that oral chlamydia or something just magically spread to the fallopian tubes is a pretty wild coincidence the reason gonorrhea and chlamydia are so likely to cause infertility has more to do with the fact that the infections tend to be spread through sex rather than some intrinsic trait of the bacteria involved are you also aware that research is still be doing on how stdsstis affect fertility but reportedly a quarter of infertile gals are due to a previous stdsri infection not just vaginally obviously theres still research being done on all sorts of things but id certainly like to see some sort of source for the claim that nonvaginal stis are likely to cause fertility if that were really the case then it would likely mean that any kind of bacterial infection is likely to lead to infertility and theres nobody who hasnt had many bacterial infections throughout their lives for nonsexual reasons there are many contradictory claims about syphilis and fertility but yet it still stands many gals report infertility due to it no there arent actually syphilis simply does not cause infertility with the possible exception of tertiary syphilis and if your friend had reached that stage shed have a lot worse problems than infertility now if youre still infected with syphilis it can cause all kinds of complications if you get pregnant but thankfully syphilis is fully curable these days i dont know who these gals are who are reporting infertility due to syphilis but i have a strong feeling youve mixed up your information regarding them the only source i can find that even attempts to claim that syphilis might cause fertility is httpwwwconceiveeasycomgetpregnantdoessyphiliscauseinfertility and frankly its just fear mongering nonsense meant to sell their testing kits after the claim they even say this the fact is that if you have syphilis and it is untreated you risk the chance of permanently damaging many areas of your body for example there is a chance that your brain will be damaged or youre your nervous system as well which is clearly referring to tertiary syphilis that is a stage that occurs many years sometimes even decades after the initial infection and only if its untreated
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think you noticed that youre the only one bringing up chlamydia and gonorrhea i specifically stated stdsstis are capable of spreading and yet you stuck to the two only you brought up and it spreading to a specific region bit curious of your knowledge of the human body and areastis if you think vaginal infection is the only way to get infertile you do know that there are some systems that are i guess in a way synced with one another such as if there is an issue with the ear depending on the issue it may go to the nosethroatbrain the human body is in my opinion rarely solitary and confined when it comes to infections at least with the research bit on infections affecting fertility youre addressing something i actually brought up no just because research still isnt sure on how stisstds affect fertility doesnt necessarily mean any bacterial infection can cause infertility it may mean any sexually transmitted bacterial infection can cause infertility i mean the research is on sexually transmitted ones why would you go general yeah considering i know three of these gals and heard of two others i have a strong feeling youre the one mixed up on information i imagine you may feel i am mixed up on information of how one gal i know who got oral chlamydia almost went blind no there is contradictory claims about whether syphilis can cause infertility you just showed a hint of that yourself with syphilis cant cause infertility except when x y z exceptional conditions are met some claims dont even mention these conditions as they consider them an anomaly so their full claim is syphilis cant cause infertility im done here i know what happened my gals know what happened and the police know what happened though the dbag got off light in my opinion you can keep responding i wont be reading strangers things have happened with the human body than stisstds causing infertility which research still isnt sure on how but you go do you
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think you noticed that youre the only one bringing up chlamydia and gonorrhea well now im curious what stds can even live outside of the body for the amount of time it took for his ejaculate to go farmtotable so to speak hepatitis i guess but can hepatitis cause infertility
creepyPMs,not_removed,no youre clearly regulus
creepyPMs,not_removed,why yes my balloon inflating skills are legendary in my hometown but i try not to brag
creepyPMs,not_removed,no i blow well

creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe a hi how are you before asking how my blowjob skills were i specifically put in my profile not to do this plus he was actually in the minority most of the guys who messaged me were perfectly polite and friendly

creepyPMs,not_removed,what an interesting change of pace its not often you see a the magic of my dick will make you gay post its usually a the magic of my dick will make you no longer a lesbian post what i really want to know now is how can i unlock the magic within my own dick to somehow change the sexuality a person was born with

creepyPMs,not_removed,a rough guide to wearing pants oh wow now my coworkers wanna know what made me spit soda everywhere lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,nominal fee £
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha did you see it over at trollx too
creepyPMs,not_removed,most of the offenders have wolf print t shirts on so that line is only going to encourage them
creepyPMs,not_removed,i never knew how much i needed this until i saw it i saved this image to my laptop for future use the gods have smiled upon us today
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is amazing but i feel that point two would better read if it said how to hide the fact that you were raised by wolves i guess im feeling pretty passiveaggressive today
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel the need to make the penis reading booklet and see if i can pass it off as legitimate
creepyPMs,not_removed,just one
creepyPMs,not_removed,same
creepyPMs,not_removed,but they do always have their dicks out like a bunch of pantsless animals
creepyPMs,not_removed,i also appreciate
creepyPMs,not_removed,🙌🏻 that banana slicer is aces
creepyPMs,not_removed,after brexit that fee is dwindling

creepyPMs,not_removed,hah hah
creepyPMs,not_removed,an httpodditymallcomincludescontentcucumboacucumberspiralslicerthumbjpg
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg i think i love you you are not an uncultured lout you are a delightful lout and its also important not to be sizeist so
creepyPMs,not_removed,the easiest way to become a ho on the internet is to decline offers of sex
creepyPMs,not_removed,my faith in mankind dies a little more with every pm i see gonna need some alcohol soon who the fuck calls a stranger honey or bunny
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love monga how does someone even begin to spell manga like that the o is nowhere near any of the other letters in the word on the keyboard
creepyPMs,not_removed,im always curious how do you get fat that quickly like between one sentence and the next i mean i gained a lot of weight but it took me years and then years to lose it what is this poof now youre overweight magic s
creepyPMs,not_removed,this should be quoted on every profile out there
creepyPMs,not_removed,its because in proper pronunciation the japanese a is a lot rounder and sounds a bit like the ah sound in cot so he probably heard it said right once and assumed the spelling but trying to read monga from a japanese perspective is pretty hilarious
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont forget i like you is one of the creepiest ways to say goodbye to someone
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive seen this before including someone who was trying to add me because we went to the same school with other people i dont know you have nothing to do with you but be my friend no and then the there is no need for you to be mean and not add me why do random people think strangers owe them something you politely tell them no thanks and they keep pushing reminding you that its not nice to decline their invitation weird
creepyPMs,not_removed,ha ha very funny
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like how you can see his face on reddit but on imugr its scribbled over
creepyPMs,not_removed,if that was you being harsh op i cant imagine what youre like when youre in a good mood the positive energy and euphoria and charisma must absolutely radiate from every pore d
creepyPMs,not_removed,is that you have a friend request from jeky indutch my guess is limited
creepyPMs,not_removed,is this rindianpeoplefacebook material
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont you dare forgetting it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have learned that the best way of dealing with those kind of people is to simply ignore them
creepyPMs,not_removed,nope it said you have a missed call from jeky and the button says call back
creepyPMs,not_removed,im on mobile when i view the post on the front page i can still see the guys face
creepyPMs,not_removed,ohhh
creepyPMs,not_removed,can we just stop and think about the part where if were his friend it means he has racist friends and knows it which still would make him shitty
creepyPMs,not_removed,look at this chick he proclaims as his imaginary homies gather around to check out the messages displayed on his cellular telephone
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love the old my friend wrote that bit whenever someone is called out for rudeaggressivehorrible behavior seems that a lot of people have these so called terrible friends its an epidemic s
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh damn his friend mustve got ahold of his phone again you really would think hed get that password already his friend has a history of sabotaging his romantic efforts
creepyPMs,not_removed,i live in rural new england and this does not surprise me at all we got some real shit people out here sorry you had to deal with this chowderhead
creepyPMs,not_removed,some men are fucking impossible this day and age how is any of that shit supposed to work does it only work on people of similar intelligence insecurity
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit i always wonder why they keep going like after being ignored after multiple messages they just chug right along
creepyPMs,not_removed,terrible flirt game as if you were trying to flirt with him there
creepyPMs,not_removed,why is the excuse for offensive shit always oh that was my friend lol or some variant
creepyPMs,not_removed,multiple personalities
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think its more of a rural anywhere mentality
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly birds of a feather flock together
creepyPMs,not_removed,lmao thats basically what i was picturing too the way he says look at this chick like ehh youre talking to yourself here dude
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahahaha i gotcha lived here my whole life these are my friends chats but shes a lifetime new englander as well its okay i like the backwoods sometimes
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont disparage people with an actual misunderstood disorder by comparing them to this shit bag
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was mostly bothered by him using than instead of then
creepyPMs,not_removed,broken link
creepyPMs,not_removed,same although i was also a little sad that he didnt understand the how am i what joke but then again nobody ever does
creepyPMs,not_removed,meetme
creepyPMs,not_removed,link works for me but imgur has been up and down
creepyPMs,not_removed,you mean when they dont bother to use a question mark i try that on them too and they just ask another question without a question mark silly boys
creepyPMs,not_removed,what do you mean
creepyPMs,not_removed,well yeah i looked twice once because you forced it on me and the second time because im pretty sure the skin isnt supposed to be that colorpenis isnt supposed to be that bentrash isnt supposed to be there id make a doctors appointment bro
creepyPMs,not_removed,i see this trend of showing women dick pics even if they say no as no different to flashers on the street in the past the seedy guy in a coat suddenly flashing their dick to a disgusted passing woman it was not acceptable then and should not be now sadly most men have decided women really want to see their dicks because of some imagination that they get turned on by seeing it simply because they would be turned on by pics of girls tits ass or more
creepyPMs,not_removed,i never got the whole women want to see my genitals thing at least for me theyre only interesting when theyre attached to a man i care about and love penises by themselves are actually really unattractive
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know it doesnt fit the legal definition but this is sexual assault you said no and he forced his genitals on you anyway this is what is meant by rape culture sure no one was raped no one got hurt but this guy thinks its perfectly acceptable to force you to interact with his penis even after you said no
creepyPMs,not_removed,hed make a really solid sex predator
creepyPMs,not_removed,that censoring haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,penises look like sad sea creatures i dont get this need to show them off
creepyPMs,not_removed,guess what usually not a good sign
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wonder how the creeper would have acted if you had told him you were a dude just for the lolz
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive never gotten an unsolicited dick pick im attracting the wrong kinds of people
creepyPMs,not_removed,now that we know what he does on his smoke breaks jfc sorry you had to endure that sorry to all his coworkers that he didnt wash his hands before touching all the door handles after s
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive made the very same analogy i believe the motivation is the same new technology just allows them relative safety so more come out of the woodwork
creepyPMs,not_removed,unsolicited dick pics are a form of projection they know that if a woman sent them nudes theyd be stoked so they just assume it must go the other way which just aint so
creepyPMs,not_removed,unsolicited sea anemones should be a thing d
creepyPMs,not_removed,by the way this is my name yknow now that i am technically talking to you after rudely judging your body i might as well tell you my name i guess i think thats what bothers me the most about this it wasnt even his fucking intention to have a decent or even normal conversation
creepyPMs,not_removed,gat
creepyPMs,not_removed,those poor gingerbreads
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is super cringey and creepy af love the gingerbread censoring however i know nobody is going to point it out but super creative
creepyPMs,not_removed,online dating is a ridiculous hilarious nightmare
creepyPMs,not_removed,her breasts fire bullets
creepyPMs,not_removed,ahhh so now i understand why ice cube said nowadays a gat is mans best friend
creepyPMs,not_removed,gun boobs
creepyPMs,not_removed,recommended carry is in a shoulder holster obviously
creepyPMs,not_removed,vanessa youre a fembot
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol for hours on end is like the least sexy phrase i could possibly think of
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just got a yeast infection from reading that
creepyPMs,not_removed,that sounds super painful for both parties
creepyPMs,not_removed,why do they think jumping abruptly from a normal conversation to a sex one will end in their favor
creepyPMs,not_removed,why do they think that would work and also that sounds super boring
creepyPMs,not_removed,that sounds painful hey have you ever had salvia and a hot tongue causing friction and erosion to the skin of your cooch
creepyPMs,not_removed,forhours no why would anyone want that hes not really advertising his skills very well if it takes him that long to get someone off
creepyPMs,not_removed,have you ever been kicked in the teeth for hours on end
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know right i was baffled just trying to imagine what is going through his head why would you think that would ever work
creepyPMs,not_removed,bitch i aint got time for that seriously
creepyPMs,not_removed,apparently the best sex takes up a good bit of the day to them how can you say it was good if you didnt even need a lunch break and an intermission s
creepyPMs,not_removed,too funny
creepyPMs,not_removed,and boring that shit should not take hours
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think most people put salvia in their vaginae
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was grossly thinking of when one of my dogs were in heat and a male dog just constantly licked her crotch and i had to separate them because he lick her so much it was burned like a heat rash my mum didnt want to nurture them because she wanted them to breed but eventually she caved and did since all the male did was hump her head and lick her crotch
creepyPMs,not_removed,erghhh
creepyPMs,not_removed,load more images jesus dude there should have been messages after the first polite rejection
creepyPMs,not_removed,so this guy has been harassing me for about two and a half weeks now when he first messaged me i politely told him that i wasnt interested and wished him luck on the app since then ive been inundated with literally hundreds of messages from him at all hours of the day and night at first i tried telling him politely i wasnt interested i then tried ignoring his messages ignoring his messages seemed to spur him on more making them even more frequent i want to be able to receive push notifications from other people on the app so this meant my phone was near constantly making noises from him messaging me finally after a few days i blocked his account and within an hour he had a new one and was doing the same if not worse at this point ive blocked his accounts so many times and each time i do he creates another to harass me with ive been reporting him to no avail he is absolutely delusional
creepyPMs,not_removed,im speechless and yet he continues speaking for about more images im not doing anything to make you uncomfortable bruh she has verbatim said that you arehave this guy is a piece of work hope things work out and he gets gone op
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not a needy person at all if you still not interested theres nothing i can do he says on image im not saying and doing anything which makes you uncomfortable really im a pretty dense person myself but considering you actually told him that he was making you uncomfortable actually youre just judging me with my words and hes judging you on even less than that if we werent destined for each other we wouldnt have been spending our time and thoughts for each other im a delusional idiot myself and even i have a hard time believing that someone can be this delusional i hope he gives up soon because honestly its gonna be really shitty if you have to delete the app just because of one idiot is it possible for you to make a new account even if its inconvenient it might be better than listening to this guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly what is wrong with people who do this shit is it just entitlement do they not understand social cues what is the science behind this
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is beyond stalker have you thought of talking to law enforcement maybe they have an idea of how to deal with him as you said he makes you very uncomfortable and deleting the app may motivate him to find you through other appsmedia
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre still angry with me why are we fighting anyway omfg i dont understand how they can be so dense as to not understand why youre angry like you literally told him why
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy fuck i would not want to go anywhere alone while someone was acting like that
creepyPMs,not_removed,damn you said all the right things he is a bunhead
creepyPMs,not_removed,scrolls down load more images and the legend continues😂
creepyPMs,not_removed,for anyone whos curious httpsyoutubepdxojtddiu
creepyPMs,not_removed,please update us im sending you good thoughts
creepyPMs,not_removed,his profile says his messages and monologues scream was a surreal read
creepyPMs,not_removed,did they stop him and his reign of terror
creepyPMs,not_removed,did my best impression of yao ming face when i saw load more images lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,you never mentioned contacting the people running the app is that right i have no idea what app this is but most dating sites seem to have staff in place specifically to deal with cases like this that would have been my first move to be honest hes clearly breaking site rules by creating multiple accounts to harass you and they may be able to ban him entirely good luck what a creeper
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think i might have to delete it unfortunately the app shows you everybody within a certain distance to you no monitoring via swipe like tinder so hed just find me again pretty quick because of him ive hidden my last seen location feature though because hes honestly freaking me out a bit with the intensity
creepyPMs,not_removed,its entitlement and fucking romcoms
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not sure how serious theyd take me but if it continues if he finds another way to contact me i think i may have to hes actually freaking me out a bit because the town im living in currently is a really small place
creepyPMs,not_removed,cops would probably laugh if she tried unfortunately they dont have an obligation to protect anyway
creepyPMs,not_removed,the fact he lives in the same really small town as i do right now is super unnerving
creepyPMs,not_removed,this breaks my heart i love the song and hes spoiling it
creepyPMs,not_removed,and i thought he couldnt possibly get any more creepy i cant belive anyone would think if this is acceptable
creepyPMs,not_removed,any updates
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you hes still messaging me loads but i sent an email to the website a couple of days ago so im just waiting to see if they can do anything about it hes clearly insane
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment has been removed for violating rule racism is not acceptable here please read the rules before commenting again and message modmail if youd like to discuss do not comment with any more rule breaks thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats a really good idea so far ive only blocked and reported him but im going to find an email to message them directly
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats good advice but i tried that for about seven days and if anything he was messaging me more at that point im genuinely at a loss at what to do i think im going to have to delete the app because my phone is near constantly making a noise from him messaging me and every time i block him he makes a new account
creepyPMs,not_removed,man that really sucks do you have pictures up that hes seen hopefully he wouldnt recognize you if you saw you on the streets but tbh based on how whiny and idealistic he sounds he probably doesnt go out much
creepyPMs,not_removed,and a huge dose of desperate loneliness
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah im actually a little freaked out for you he seems like a stalker just the mentality herehes obsessive he creates new accounts to continue the harassment he is desperate for contact with you very scary does he know your full name
creepyPMs,not_removed,good thing is if you ever do bump into him irl you can get a restraining order if you document all his harassing
creepyPMs,not_removed,seriously if he lives that close to you you need a restraining order
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes still as creepy and persistent as ever but i sent an email to the company a couple of days ago so im just waiting to see if they can do anything about it
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey op if youre open to advice on this ill go ahead and give your post caw constructive advice wanted flair so people who give advice arent breaking the rules
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would this amount of frustration and annoyance isnt worth it if you enjoy talking to some people on there just get a brand new account and tell them the new name
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah theres a bunch of photos on my profile but ive changed the profile picture on my other social media so he cant reverse image search them and find out any more about me i hoping youre right it certainly seems like he just spends his days watching romcoms where if youre persistent enough you can force anybody to love you
creepyPMs,not_removed,add in a dash of only my feelings matter and what do you mean women have free will its like a really creepy recipe
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not too sure it was on my account when i first created it it syncs with facebook but i deleted it once i noticed im hoping he didnt see or if he did he doesnt remember youre right that he definitely seems to have that mentality if he did figure out where exactly i live it wouldnt surprise me if he tried some kind of contact outside of the internet
creepyPMs,not_removed,that would be great thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,i can only imagine him going through his romcom library shaking his fist at the screen and wondering why you havent fallen madly in love with him yet
creepyPMs,not_removed,that just shows how desperate he really is his feeling of loneliness is so strong that he cant even fathom that you have feelings on this source i used to be this kind of guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,awesome done
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes currently watching say anything while sobbing uncontrollably and shaking his fist at the television john cusack why did you lie to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,to be fair you probably already love him and just dont realize it yet
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre right if he just sends me more messages today ill suddenly want to fall into his arms
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh gods its all over again ´･ω･
creepyPMs,not_removed,it seems like u dont give a shit about my love life uh yes random internet weirdo that is very true
creepyPMs,not_removed,this sub is always full of greatness i look at a post and see a little bit of creepiness in the pic then i remember i can click the pic for the full weirdness this guys thought process or lack thereof is bizarre was he planning this from the start did you beat his ass so badly at virtual scrabble that he felt he had to have you was he spelling out love words the whole time
creepyPMs,not_removed,what can i say they make a compelling case s
creepyPMs,not_removed,what if you had said yes did he think any of it through
creepyPMs,not_removed,but i dont care apparently
creepyPMs,not_removed,you dont know what an incredible guy i am when these dudes use the word incredible i always think of it as meaning lacking credibility instead of its colloquial definition
creepyPMs,not_removed,lets see if this guys game plan works please please could you give me reddit gold
creepyPMs,not_removed,what app is this happn
creepyPMs,not_removed,so no rematch then
creepyPMs,not_removed,if these creeps are willing to put that much emotional responsibility onto complete strangers id hate to think about how much they put on their actual partners good grief
creepyPMs,not_removed,correct excellent assessment
creepyPMs,not_removed,no he sent this all at the beginning of the game before i had a chance to impress him with my awesome scrabble skills then he resigned as soon as i sent my last message then immediately tried to start a new game all very bizarre
creepyPMs,not_removed,plz
creepyPMs,not_removed,words with friends
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre really pretty can i have your snapchat no youre not even that pretty piss off but srs snapchat
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a creep we all know what he wanted to snap you
creepyPMs,not_removed,op i have to ask are you enjoying your ugly shitty life i assume your ugly shitty life is a tv show i dont know about
creepyPMs,not_removed,mewbacca i love it
creepyPMs,not_removed,the old call her ugly because she rejected me seconds after telling her how hot she is guys should know how common this is and how dumb they look for doing it obviously they dont realize i just wish they would
creepyPMs,not_removed,classic rniceguys strange how you were so beautiful until you didnt do exactly what he wanted
creepyPMs,not_removed,what exactly was supposed to be implied by is it because ive seen all your tumblr posts
creepyPMs,not_removed,its one of my favorite shirts gotta love puns
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was thinking this same thing its astounding how many guys follow this very pattern hey youre hot omg lol send nudes no i didnt want them anyway you ugly cunt i mean the evidence is out there an abundance of it yet still here we are they must have a poorly written playbook entitled sure fire ways to get the girl or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,the instant you dont give them what they want you magically turn into an ugly cunt apparently ¯ツ¯
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have a porn blog on tumblr where i occasionally post tiddyunderwear pics and i had the link in my bio
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know my worth im almost years old do you really think hes the first to compliment me i thank people for genuine compliments he just wanted to get my snapchat and show me his dick and when i refused i magically transformed from cute to ugly ¯ツ¯
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was trying to be nice and shit my dude but i realized where he was going and any potential niceness or respect i had for him went out the window
creepyPMs,not_removed,i started being a cunt because he started being one of those typical internet strangers that want nothing from me other than my kiksnapchat to send me dick pics
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah maybe i was rude but i can sense a fuckboy a mile away my dude and i have tolerance for that shit after he asked for my snapchat and said is it because ive seen your tumblr posts i realized the path he was taking and i decided i was done with it before i got too deep
creepyPMs,not_removed,no she didnt he asked to snap she said no and he continued to question why instead of just saying no problem she didnt leave room for negotiation it was a solid no she doesnt owe a stranger any sort of explanation
creepyPMs,not_removed,right
creepyPMs,not_removed,how dare you have your own opinions and make your own decisions
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had a bad feeling it was something like that
creepyPMs,not_removed,ahh okay thats fair enough then
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah you did and yup
creepyPMs,not_removed,its fine op no idea why these people are attacking you they should read the rules he came off as the creepy entitled niceguy nerd right from the start
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont show my face in them and honestly ive posted most of the same pics on my finsta too so him saying that was more stupid to me than anything
creepyPMs,not_removed,what things she didnt word well she told him no and even explained why he didnt take it well and still persisted then insulted her are you one of those gals that think if you turn down a guy you have to be selfdeprecating and ever so sweet that you just cant say no but no thanks youre a really great guy but x y z
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think her replies were totally legit and called for personally im way more of an asshole when i get messages from blatant fuckboys it gets old when of the messages you receive on social media are hey sexy u single the second that shit lands in my inbox cue the verbal evisceration 👌🏻
creepyPMs,not_removed,fuck off with your racist bullshit
creepyPMs,not_removed,do you really have nothing to do in life besides troll people on the internet if i really said that hateful stuff to you feel free to share the screenshots and prove it
creepyPMs,not_removed,the response what had me laughing
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is my new favorite dickpiccensorship method
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a creepy motherfucker who just cold sends dick pics hate to break it to him but no one wants to see his gross tiny penis
creepyPMs,not_removed,eggplant
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love our bot
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was hoping you would run with the melting really enjoyed this did he send anymore messages after your last
creepyPMs,not_removed,dial it back needs to heed his own advice
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha this actually made me laugh look how he tried to salvage it did it continue op or was this the last
creepyPMs,not_removed,this was funny well done op
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is one of my favourites youre a star op a liquefied bloody puddle of a star
creepyPMs,not_removed,so phoebes brother is single again
creepyPMs,not_removed,mmm jokes on you im into girls being a liquefied puddle of melted flesh and bone
creepyPMs,not_removed,whats that cat app
creepyPMs,not_removed,not yet this is probably the first time im hoping a creeper replies good god
creepyPMs,not_removed,my goodness thank you i would blush at such a kind comment but unfortunately i am totally drained of blood at this point
creepyPMs,not_removed,its called meowchat seriously dont bother its a total fiasco of an app
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was faced by so many dick picks profiles ugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,because that always works right we women love to just watch men jerk off no need to talk of course s
creepyPMs,not_removed,context a while back i was in a group project with two guys and two other girls we used skype to organize our ideas and communicate one guy suggested to trade instagramwhich i dont have and snapchat with everyone in the group after weve worked together the first thing after i accepted his request i got this i messaged the other two girls to see if they got any odd texts none of them said they did ಠಠ
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would print off this exchange and hand it out to everyone in the group and the instructor
creepyPMs,not_removed,well that would make class super awkward
creepyPMs,not_removed,what the fuck kind of asshole tries to guilt an acquaintance into watching them jerk off what the fuck is wrong with these people are they stupid arghhhhhhhhhh the guilt trip is what gets me its so gross and predatory
creepyPMs,not_removed,id post this screencap in the group just for lulz
creepyPMs,not_removed,a guy pressured me into doing that once afterwords i had no interest in it anymore and he harassed me for the next months because i didnt wanna see his magic penis again all in all a poor experience would not recommend
creepyPMs,not_removed,imagine her taking notes of him jerking off and then just signing off after completion
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is so weird so you still see or talk to this guy isnt this awkward i will never understand why people think this ever works i think its gross no need to explain
creepyPMs,not_removed,damn
creepyPMs,not_removed,im asking as an honest question but would this technicaly count as sexual assault
creepyPMs,not_removed,not a day goes by i dont think the world needs a deep cleanse like noahs ark but with bleach
creepyPMs,not_removed,😔
creepyPMs,not_removed,since no pics or videos were sent id say no technically as long as both people are adults you can ask someone to do stuff with you if he had persisted any longer op could get into sexual harassment territory but not assault
creepyPMs,not_removed,are you asking if his message is assault or if showing the exchange to other people is
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would think that using her contact info to say explicit things when she only gave it to him is pretty much required to for the school project would be of interest to the staff at the school i mean her professor might talk to him or do something and if the professor didnt then she could probably take it to someone else if she wanted like her counselor or someone higher up its really up to the person receiving the messages how they feel and what they would want to do whether it qualifies as sexual harassment or not idk but it seems like it would
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was hoping the backstory would at least give some level of justification for his actions but nope
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey adult wanna fuk
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not interested sorry
creepyPMs,not_removed,girl of bitch
creepyPMs,not_removed,ignores harassment i only kept harassing you because i didnt get a clear no says no repeatedly maybe if you didnt want to be harassed you should learn to stop acknowledging people
creepyPMs,not_removed,if youre not straight you should have told me straight up didnt he refer to your sexual orientation multiple times
creepyPMs,not_removed,no thanks what does that mean lol playing hard to get talk about not being rocket science to understand
creepyPMs,not_removed,lets all just appreciate that he opened with dont be gay which suggests he came into the conversation knowing you were gay and then he ended with you should have told me straight up
creepyPMs,not_removed,sad wait a second what color is this guys skin and how big are his hands
creepyPMs,not_removed,my favorite part is when you gave him that list of reasons why you arent interested and he just responds why am i narcissistic
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont be gay hahaha yes mate ill just change my sexual orientation for you
creepyPMs,not_removed,sweet tits these are the kinds of guys that need a good punch to the face
creepyPMs,not_removed,sad does melania know youre flirting with random women online
creepyPMs,not_removed,well that was fucking obnoxious what a douche
creepyPMs,not_removed,women right so mysterious i mean sure she said that she was gay not interested and to leave her alone and respect her wishes but manwhat did those words mean creeper
creepyPMs,not_removed,i see you claim to be gay stop that leave me alone youre playing hard to get leave me alone no but srsly stop playing hard to get leave me alone you should have told me to leave you alone if you wanted me to leave you alone leave me alone you should have told me you were gay leave me alone omg i hate people who play games bitch wat
creepyPMs,not_removed,it irritates the shit out of me when i repeatedly say im not interested and they say im playing hard to get no dude saying that i am playing hard to get is how you delude yourself into thinking you still have a chance with me because you cant handle rejection
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is beyond disturbing the arrogance is off the charts this isnt a tv show or movie its not cutesy to persist like this its just not fucking respectful or appropriate
creepyPMs,not_removed,yikes what a douche why do men think lesbians care at all about how attractive or unattractive they find us
creepyPMs,not_removed,why does everybody lean on the you should have blocked me like bitch learn how to control your damn self
creepyPMs,not_removed,creepiness aside its annoying as shit when people type like this af tbh tbqh
creepyPMs,not_removed,no is not a hint
creepyPMs,not_removed,tried pua shit when it didnt work turned into a whiny bitch
creepyPMs,not_removed,yikes i really want to unsubscribe to this sub because it makes me sick but i feel that if i do im somehow being irresponsible by ignoring an entire aspect of what women go through on a daily basis edit ive seen it happen to men too but it is obviously more prevalent in the daily experience of women i hate to say this but im so grateful that im a guy im enough of a mess as it is so this shit would make me paranoid psycho and neurotic af
creepyPMs,not_removed,we get a strong minority of guys who seem to think the rules are girl who does not respond is not interested send insult contradicting initial compliments girl who responds with no is interested no matter what she says every response means maybe bandy snide remarks then insults when that doesnt work then blame the girl for saying no instead of not responding wtf is going on here are there a bunch of girls out there saying no and then banging dudes because that does not reflect the other women i know
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy is at the top of my would love to punch list
creepyPMs,not_removed,god i imagine this person has the most punchable face irl
creepyPMs,not_removed,this makes my brain hurt
creepyPMs,not_removed,just because youre gay youre not interested in that man thats pretty gay s
creepyPMs,not_removed,oprah once said no is a complete sentence and she was right but i dont think everyone got the message
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh what a cunt
creepyPMs,not_removed,has this ever worked for anyone asking for a friend from austin texas
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit i felt like punching the guy after reading that from the tbh tbqh af and all the other text speak to how narcissistic he is and that whole exchange that guy has some issues
creepyPMs,not_removed,i want to repeatedly smash his head into pavement while saying learn to take no for an answer
creepyPMs,not_removed,seriously tho ueveavai you are cute af dont be gay
creepyPMs,not_removed,i didnt know mr collins was on dating apps
creepyPMs,not_removed,that last line is golden though amazing zinger
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,he messaged me a couple of times before this and seemed pretty normal so i didnt see any reason to mention itbut it was very clearly on my profile as id made it clear i wasnt looking for a relationship then a couple of weeks later out of the blue he hits me with the message in the title so i have no idea what was going through his head lmao
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think he meant gay as an insult like youre cute respond to me dont be stupid so he lost points immediately
creepyPMs,not_removed,trust me theyre yuge
creepyPMs,not_removed,i can assure you theres no problem
creepyPMs,not_removed,answering his own question there eh
creepyPMs,not_removed,to these types of guys lesbians are just bisexual women playing hard to get
creepyPMs,not_removed,but they think they will be the one to fix you bunch of arseholes
creepyPMs,not_removed,some dudes think their penises are so magical theyll literally change who you are
creepyPMs,not_removed,one of our old office managers was trapped in the and would repeatedly call female staff sugar tits as a term of endearment he even said it to the hr staff who were all women he saw absolutely nothing wrong with it at all different mindset completely
creepyPMs,not_removed,it is really depressing how often i see this women can literally say please dont ever message me again i am not interested in you and i dont want to talk to you any more and dudes are like yeah but you dont really mean that yall just playing hard to get
creepyPMs,not_removed,and then some knobhead comes out and goes hrrrngidunn understand why you cant be polite and just tell them no this is why rcreepypms should be obligatory reading for everyone meeting people on the internet
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy parties on rainey every weekend but then once a month goes to dirty sixth and gets kicked out of at least two bars he stalks bachelorette parties and usually tries to go for the bridetobe he has stepped in horse shit three times and puked in waller creek twice he regularly gets in fights with folks sleeping on the street and touches police horses without asking first he is the douchiest douche in austin edit his favorite bar in austin is the container bar he lives in a new condo somewhere close to downtown but complains about the loud music he constantly has people over and bothers his neighbors he moved here months ago and constantly complains about traffic he drives everywhere especially when hes drunk he blames uber leaving he couldnt make it in tech out in sf and couldnt make in finance in nyc he calls anyone that has ever been east of a hipster despite loving the tequila bar above whislers and weather up for those classier evenings he speeds while passing bicyclists with inches to spare he passes people using turn lanes
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah maybe but there are also a lot of nonpushy nondouchey ones too actually i think of austin as a rather tolerant not my favorite word since it implies that something is negative and needs to be tolerated and accepting we have had different experiences i guess shrug op i often find humor in the ridiculous posts here but this tool made me mad
creepyPMs,not_removed,imho its annoying af when ppl type like this tbqh ftfy
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should have to say tbh everything you say should be honest
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah if you cant be bothered typing actual words i cant be bothered googling all your abbreviations
creepyPMs,not_removed,dude thanks for admitting this a lot of men do not even come close to acknowledging the shit women put up with every day
creepyPMs,not_removed,srsly
creepyPMs,not_removed,please respond
creepyPMs,not_removed,more like you are cute af plz be gay amiright
creepyPMs,not_removed,i fucking hate when people say this seriously what is the basis of that assumption did you never see a straight person behave awfully or what why is it ze evil closeted gay whenever someone is a cocksplat to gay people
creepyPMs,not_removed,you know how some guys immediately call you fat and ugly if you reject them thats why lesbians are meh theyre the embodiment of male rejectionfemale independenceetc and thus are ugly by default also there is a higher percentage of them who are non gender conforming which does not pander to the male gaze feminists are perceived similarly so they are subject to the same fat ugly stereotype
creepyPMs,not_removed,theres no such thing as a gay personality
creepyPMs,not_removed,ordinarily id refer you to the rules and remind you that this is a support sub but your demeaning and insulting comments indicate you really dont have regard for the feelings of others banned
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol are you the guy op was talking to if so that narcissism label was spot on
creepyPMs,not_removed,nice victim blaming youve got going on here but maybe just dont
creepyPMs,not_removed,rule please have a reread of it before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,most likely since he said texting is gay later on also he doesnt refer to her as gay once after she says that she is but uses lesbian instead
creepyPMs,not_removed,and bisexual women are just straight women who think that claiming to be bisexual makes them more interesting
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wonder if he would feel fine being called lolly cock or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,why do i feel like ive read this one before oo
creepyPMs,not_removed,if its self defense from a rapey fucker like that then yes
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha this also sounded like the setup for that vw httpsmyoutubecomwatchvfliqzypoygu commercial
creepyPMs,not_removed,i get it man but five hundred bucks is five hundred bucks
creepyPMs,not_removed,if thats what youre into sure
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you for spitting the truth
creepyPMs,not_removed,dam it what did he say i always scroll to the bottom when they mention the sub to see if they come flying in to defend themselves and it looks like this one did we should have that a collection of people who came to defend themselves only proving further their points
creepyPMs,not_removed,knowing him it would have probably only served to legitimise him using sugar tits
creepyPMs,not_removed,lolly cock is hilarious im keeping it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i honestly dont think its possible to make the kind of guy who would call a woman sugartits feel uncomfortable by calling him any objectifying term based on the penis he already thinks his penis is the eighth wonder of the world wheres the offense
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean for getting the bj i dont think id even complain s
creepyPMs,not_removed,how on earth does that make him gay do you seriously think only gay people would be afraid of being called gay how ridiculous is that and vilifying gay people for no good reason
creepyPMs,not_removed,whatever makes you feel all right with believing in a stereotype that homogenises people from very different walks of life and with very different life experienceand yes they do have varied life experience but i gather that its just that queer people who are not flamboyant enough are invisible to you edit and fyi women have longer hair on average purely because of societal expectations im not saying its a strong expectation these days but it exists and has jack shit to do with that bizarre gay personality thing youve conjured up
creepyPMs,not_removed,youd know that queer people tend to have certain shared traits such as
creepyPMs,not_removed,that doesnt give you the right to blame op for being creeped on and implying her continuously saying stop leave me alone is in any encouragement of his behaviour is just rubbish
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol enjoy
creepyPMs,not_removed,good point sadly
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not in the mood for creep apologists
creepyPMs,not_removed,im guessing they mean a limp wrist and saying faaabulous a lot for men or preference for short hair and plaid shirts for women wtf even
creepyPMs,not_removed,please dont repost verbatim the comments that get deleted it kind of defeats the purpose
creepyPMs,not_removed,can you address the fact that you think its fine to attack someone im not an apologist for creeps i just dont think people should get punched in the face calling someone a name online isnt worth attacking anyone
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah okay thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,glad we could agree
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am pointing out that you saying hes a gay guy trying to compensate apparently because gay closeted people ha ha such hilarity is adding to the stupid myth that when someone behaves in a homophobic way theyre a self hating closeted gay person lashing out and this is a support subreddit just fyi
creepyPMs,not_removed,fucking hell read the rules ffs im done with you
creepyPMs,not_removed,a handful of famous people doesnt stand for a lot of examples sorry i understand that haggard was surprising to people but jumping from that to homophobes are gay is just stupid and unfair to gay people
creepyPMs,not_removed,you might not think of yourself as homophobic but your comments are maybe you should consider their implications and the implications of that common trope then and for the love of god stop telling people to relax its either one of two things either you actually mean it and if so you should know this only ever has the reverse effect or youre just being a dickhead just dont
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should care more about not being an arsehole instead of deflecting by trying very hard to create an impression that my patient explanations are some sort of a hysterical reaction but then i guess that would require effort and forethought so its easier to insult
creepyPMs,not_removed,dollars is a way to specific amount almost believe some calculations has been done to get to that number
creepyPMs,not_removed,why does he have to make it weird by requesting a nonwormed animal he likes to take risks perhaps a nice quality to some
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cant be the only one thinking of its always sunny in philadelphia when frank gave himself the worm to lose weight
creepyPMs,not_removed,httpmimgurcomynlqwrmr
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is exactly the kind of fucked up internet bullshit i needed to help distract me from my workday
creepyPMs,not_removed,so uh does he provide the sample or do you have to track it down yourself because the latter sounds like a lot of work
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,that fetish is puts on sunglasses weird as shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,possibly the worst message what is the contender
creepyPMs,not_removed,were just about to take our kitty for his last deworming meds should i hold off we split the pot
creepyPMs,not_removed,easy money
creepyPMs,not_removed,well op are you gonna do it
creepyPMs,not_removed,that message is awesome
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol i dont believe i ever got a normal message on that site
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont ever change collarspace dont ever change
creepyPMs,not_removed,what kind of dog surprise him with the droppings of a st bernard
creepyPMs,not_removed,ii have no words
creepyPMs,not_removed,this sounds like a terrible japanese fetish video i saw a few years backstill scarred
creepyPMs,not_removed,how does the brain even reach that formula of dogcat crap not been wormed and his bottom with that amount of cash cos that seems rather specific that amount like he worked out each bit of weirdness cost so much it genuinely left me open mouthed to read this
creepyPMs,not_removed,what
creepyPMs,not_removed,the amount and specifics make it sound like a joke granted not funny tasteless and imprudent
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is a very worrying kink
creepyPMs,not_removed,this one made me clench my butthole in discomfort and idek why
creepyPMs,not_removed,possibly
creepyPMs,not_removed,with a minute time limit yes they need to provide the feces
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats just foul
creepyPMs,not_removed,im interested in doing some kinkshaming who do i contact
creepyPMs,not_removed,act now you only have weeks
creepyPMs,not_removed,i can never unread this
creepyPMs,not_removed,im gonna give them an offer they cant refuse
creepyPMs,not_removed,i always say id do some pretty fuckedup stuff for amounts lower than a person might expect i mean and pretty much the skys the limit there is virtually no sexual act i wouldnt perform on any person for that amount of money there is almost nothing i wouldnt ingest as long as it does me no lasting harm i figure its for a few minutes of extreme discomfort for this he could knock off a grand and id still be down
creepyPMs,not_removed,i told him to make it an even and id think about it
creepyPMs,not_removed,he probably knows that the other person will negotiate it up to and that is the real max that he is willing to pay
creepyPMs,not_removed,probably all the money he had left
creepyPMs,not_removed,so perhaps he rates the person hes asking on a scale of of how hot they are and scales the price based on that so op is a out of so x if shehe was a out of it would be
creepyPMs,not_removed,people who usually have no intention of paying any amounts sometimes are specific so that it seems realistic sort of like the lie that has oddly too much detail i was gonna come by but the baby got sick and we had to take her to the er and the wait was sooo long
creepyPMs,not_removed,seriously so specific should try to bargain with him just to see how he justifies it
creepyPMs,not_removed,right woulda been no big deal but the nonwormed part is def where it gets weird
creepyPMs,not_removed,its the risk that turns him on
creepyPMs,not_removed,he doesnt wanna catch anything
creepyPMs,not_removed,stupid jerry
creepyPMs,not_removed,the normal shove wormy shit up my ass messages know what never mind
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats why hes paying top dollar
creepyPMs,not_removed,hol up
creepyPMs,not_removed,some weird ass shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeaaaaaaaahhhhh
creepyPMs,not_removed,ok so i lied i have words now actually questions soooooo many questions where did he get such a specific sum of money from did he ask several sex workers for a quote and this was the average he came up with does this guy have a fetish for shoving contaminated pet feces into his downtown brown or is he simply trying to get out of doing something going somewhere etc by getting himself sick or both if he is just trying to make himself sick surely theres an easier method a bottle of castor oil or a raw chicken breast thats been left out for a few hours and of course the httpsmediagiphycommediaxupgcwkyxdwlyoyazygiphygif on everyones mind
creepyPMs,not_removed,you drive a hard bargain
creepyPMs,not_removed,should have gone for
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wouldve asked at least to start and end with
creepyPMs,not_removed,rude
creepyPMs,not_removed,illuminati confirmed
creepyPMs,not_removed,no actually its the opposite
creepyPMs,not_removed,nonwormed means not been checked for worms
creepyPMs,not_removed,somehow that seemed like too much
creepyPMs,not_removed,id give you a perfect op
creepyPMs,not_removed,ouch if give maybe
creepyPMs,not_removed,til
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah the market rate for shoving wormedshit up someones ass is like you made the right counter
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean where do you draw the line the dude wanted you to shove animal feces in his ass
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is a whole field of economics i wasnt prepared for
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean you gotta meet demand but seeing as op currently has a monopoly they can set the price on their services
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hope you find your knight in shining armour i love to say i was looking for prince charming but he was with his boyfriend
creepyPMs,not_removed,shinning armour is worn around the knees
creepyPMs,not_removed,well i dunno about night but ive always wishes to spend a day in shining armor conventions and ren faires are the best
creepyPMs,not_removed,the day doesnt wear shining armor because its already bright
creepyPMs,not_removed,no not shining shinning like in that treehouse of horror episode of the simpsons
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy seriously pissed me off with his opener otherwise i would not have even accepted his chat invite the whole girl thing gets under my skin even from guys my own age i found it fun just using the same words he used with me changed just slightly
creepyPMs,not_removed,shhh do you wanna get sued
creepyPMs,not_removed,i also cant stand it when people refer to obviously grown adult women as girls its infantilizing
creepyPMs,not_removed,shit maybe she didnt hear me call her a bitch better do it four times
creepyPMs,not_removed,the stone cold steve austin method what
creepyPMs,not_removed,what app is this
creepyPMs,not_removed,the op cannot stand poor grammar
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah the reverse winnfield
creepyPMs,not_removed,no but i just googled that and i am now adding it to my repertoire thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly what i was gonna say
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive done that before mannnn do they get mad
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,your postcomment has been removed in accordance with httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,damn the delusion this guy lives in another reality a reality limited to his own little head it is so out of this world it goes beyond sad some people could study how his brain works and make an either awesome or horrible documentary
creepyPMs,not_removed,my money is on humiliation fetish also i think the pic was a trap
creepyPMs,not_removed,humiliation fetish for alex
creepyPMs,not_removed,does he know he can just post his pic to rroastme unless its actually a dick pic
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy messaged me as well i see quite a bit of copypasta here edit i just made a post with his messages to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,people still say preppy
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats why i didnt respond
creepyPMs,not_removed,right i wish i wouldve responded with that message ugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont understand these guys logic trying to convince random women to send them pictures as if there isnt a shitton of free porn out there hell google feet if youre so desperate to jack off to someones soles
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats what i was thinking like what does that mean
creepyPMs,not_removed,as far as i know polo shirts and boaters shoes
creepyPMs,not_removed,at least they addressed the truth in the subject advice you didnt ask for
creepyPMs,not_removed,ill have him know that my minutes of exercise and minutes of netflix and pizza is very beneficial and i am seeing great results
creepyPMs,not_removed,its pretty funny how often internet weirdos send insults that are far more applicable to themselves
creepyPMs,not_removed,minutes a day isnt a workout i guess they havent heard of high intensity interval training
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really feel like we should start sending that line to creeps
creepyPMs,not_removed,not much irritates me more than assholes trying to shame people into going along with their bullshit by claiming the top from bottom ugh im sorry you have to deal with such a dumb ass
creepyPMs,not_removed,and i hope he finds a big white screen or lots of white wall space because he sure seems to enjoy projecting
creepyPMs,not_removed,wtf
creepyPMs,not_removed,uh yeah no minutes is plenty fucking beneficial compared to zero minutes by default maybe the arsehole could find a proper human being to explain it to him with pictures just to be sure he gets it
creepyPMs,not_removed,hmmmm sweetheart is he ops grandpa
creepyPMs,not_removed,as someone with osteoperosisostepenia minutes weight bearing exercise a day is exactly what my dr told me to do so actually yes its super beneficial
creepyPMs,not_removed,jeez this guys a piece of work what sort of post was it he was even basing all this on theres no scenario where any of his bullshit is anything other than hostile nonsense im just curious about the context
creepyPMs,not_removed,he knew it was advice you didnt ask for yet he sent it anyway i can just picture the smug satisfaction on his face after he hit send he is the true definition of an asshole
creepyPMs,not_removed,people who use sweetie to be condescending should all be drowned in one big vat of molasses
creepyPMs,not_removed,the irony is strong with this one
creepyPMs,not_removed,humans beans
creepyPMs,not_removed,seriously would have been nice if he had just stopped there and hit send
creepyPMs,not_removed,didnt you know the way i workout is specifically the best and most ideal way to work out if you do it any other way you are a pleb s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i made a post looking for an accountability buddy because im in pretty poor health and want to start working out which is where the minutes came from decided i should start small so i dont get too burnt out seemed like a fairly innocent post to me but this is not the only piece of hate i got from it i guess a woman finally decided to take care of herself isnt something guys like to hear haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont listen to the assholes good job on starting to take care of yourself its hard enough to keep it up so its great to start small i wish you a lot of motivation
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah that guy doesnt know shit if youre coming from nothing any exercise is an improvement and will help im about a quarter of the way to my goal myself and the only advice i would really give is try to keep it regular and dont push so hard you injure yourself i got a leg injury a few years ago while trying to get in better shape and it knocked me way off course youd think that if you think youre fat youd know not to do jumping jacks lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i started working out since the start of and have lost pounds through sheer hard work in the gym and a good clean diet dont listen to the asses build positive habits work hard and believe in yourself the is no race to post a progress pic
creepyPMs,not_removed,awesome to hear youre a quarter way to your goal and yeah regularity is something im striving for which is why im going for something that i know is achievable for me in my current state im going from sitting in bed literally all day every day to sitting at my desk and doing a little exercise so a big improvement for me that i will eventually expand to be harder
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you and awesome job losing the pounds seriously thats amazing
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks it was a unique journey still not satisfied till i go even lower but i am more interested in a lower body fat so only trying to lose a pound a week now anyways if you have questions you can let me know or browse reddit fitness or rloseit all good sources good luck on your journey
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks i really appreciate it ive looked over rfitness and other similar subreddits for a while which is actually what inspired me to start getting healthy
creepyPMs,not_removed,this wasnt out of character he just finally revealed it
creepyPMs,not_removed,im offended by that post and will likely stay that way for some time flair please
creepyPMs,not_removed,uh oh he is offended and will likely stay that way for some time i bet you regret your reblog now op
creepyPMs,not_removed,the thing that jumps out at me here is that he doesnt argue that these issues dont exist his only problem seems to be op pointing them out
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont wanna discuss this with you but i still want to send you a long rant about it in order to shove my opinion in your face
creepyPMs,not_removed,nothing irritates me more than someone messaging or addressing you with a grievance and then saying they dont want to discuss it further thats too fucking bad you messaged me and now i have the grievance
creepyPMs,not_removed,youll notice i didnt blast you in public i have more respect for you than that or because he didnt want to get called out for it you know one or the other
creepyPMs,not_removed,i always chuckle when i see someone who will never be pregnant opine about the realities of pregnancy im pregnant right now with a longplanned and very wanted child and that little fucker is absolutely a parasite gets first dibs on my food so i have to snack constantly like having a tapeworm burping and farting all the time like having giardia having to pee constantly like having a uti random bouts of nausea mean i have to break my commute up with vomit breaks like having the flu and thats only the first three months i know some women get thru pregnancies with few if any symptoms but most women do not pregnancy is a goddamn medical condition not some happy magic rainbows time when everything is sparkling and smells like roses in fact everything smells like a grosser version of itself the magical glowing pregnancy myth needs to die die die die die
creepyPMs,not_removed,his response is beyond bullshit we as a species take the higher ground screaming about being offended what the hell does he even want
creepyPMs,not_removed,when a woman is offended you get people lining up to explain how offense is taken not given and its your own responsibility if youre offended and to grow thicker skin when a dude is offended by some dumb shit though well boy howdy thats just righteous indignation you better capitulate
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should just reply it was definitely worth it and unfriend him
creepyPMs,not_removed,methinks the gentleman doth protest too much
creepyPMs,not_removed,man i i was reading through those messages thinking damn he seems to be really sincerely hurt i wonder what she posted it must have been quite vile and then i got to the actual post what the hell theres nothing wrong with it it doesnt vilify anyone ever its concise and well written and it most certainly never even implies that all or even most men are like that its true that most women are treated like that by most people in most scenarios it doesnt have to be every single man for that to be incredibly fucked up im really trying to understand where hes coming from there
creepyPMs,not_removed,a not all men in the first paragraphs bingo what do i win
creepyPMs,not_removed,okay thats it he called it not all men so we need to shut down the feminism
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love the take the higher ground response to situations like this take the higher ground why cant you just put on a stiff upper lip and shut up instead of speaking out as if verbally pointing out injustices is putting you on some negative level
creepyPMs,not_removed,notallmen
creepyPMs,not_removed,time to unfriend this kind of posts really help weed out the idiots in my friend list
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am furious that you made me look at a situation in a light that forces me to confront my privilege and how a minority is affected by that privilege but were not going to talk about it because i need space even though im going to rant ad nauseum about how you let me down and tone police the fuck out of you while mansplaining your life and condescendingly presenting myself as a man who doesnt do any of those things but dont respond because i need space and i am upset that you made a post that i didnt agree with i say post that shit on the post in question and roast him i am mean like that fuck that dude with fire
creepyPMs,not_removed,there is one response to this guys tirade tldr
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh man the irony of the secondtolast sentence because i cant post something like this without being harassed
creepyPMs,not_removed,that was the longest not all men ever
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh no not another man talking about abortion just kill me already edit a commentor made a really good point below me this is my response to himher of course you can to clarify i meant men who resist roe vs wade or try to obstruct or overturn it it just isnt as meaningful to me personally as an opinion of a woman who is much more affected by restrictions on the rights of her body than a man is affected by restrictions on the rights of a female body of course if its your child that changes everything or if someones claiming its your child or if someone got pregnant to keep you there are tons of ways you can be personally involved maybe youre prochoice thats great but before roe vs wade a close family member of mine who was in an abusive marriage had to fly to cuba to get an abortion ill never understand why some people who feel so passionately prolife dont seem to care much about the mothers or taking care of the children after theyre brought to term oh and then there are the stats more danger when abortions are made illegal or difficult to obtain i think the horrifying stories of a retired obgyn who practiced before roe vs wade
creepyPMs,not_removed,fuck that the person who carries the parasite gets to determine if it gets an eviction notice pay rent or quit fucker
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hope it was worth it no longer being friends with a red piller who feels that he can go on a tirade about his opinion but you arent allowed to respond because it isnt up for discussion yeah sounds pretty fuckin worth it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would have sent him the good ol
creepyPMs,not_removed,all those statements are true but it offends my delicate sensibilities s
creepyPMs,not_removed,all men are pigs except for me i guess
creepyPMs,not_removed,yikes
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like i would be in a better position to judge his reply if i knew the original post any chance of sharing it
creepyPMs,not_removed,please post the screenshots of his message in the comments of the original post pretty please
creepyPMs,not_removed,i personally would find great satisfaction in never giving this person another thought
creepyPMs,not_removed,just tell him to stop being so triggered and watch his head explode
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont knows what else to say just know that i am not interested in discussing this with you it really pissed me off and i need some space but hes the one that messaged you in the first place about a post you didnt directly share to him dude has some chutzpah
creepyPMs,not_removed,my birth control is not expensive my ass
creepyPMs,not_removed,love the post you shared
creepyPMs,not_removed,because i cant post anything like this without being harassed — op not all men are like this making broad sweeping comments like this is disrespectful — some random man
creepyPMs,not_removed,its times like this i wish i could scream suck a bad of dicks and then fuck yourself with them through a screen
creepyPMs,not_removed,stop being so sensitive boy
creepyPMs,not_removed,probably one of the most frustrating things ive read in this sub ugh im so grumpy now what an idiot
creepyPMs,not_removed,i use the babies are parasites argument because its biologically true its actually biologically not true as part of the definition of a parasite is that its a different species from its host doesnt stop me from making the same argument though
creepyPMs,not_removed,if feminist posts bother a person that person is part of the problem
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol tldr you being offended by something that is a problem you deal with offended me and my feelings obviously matter so much more than yours so i am gonna add this to your problems
creepyPMs,not_removed,is the bottom your reply or what you posted either way it is gold and one of the best things ive read about what women go through
creepyPMs,not_removed,step ditch ridiculous excuse for ex friend step keep writing that original post is excellent and made me do praise hands
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah i also reblogged this and made sure to put that if any guy cared to comment with how not all men are like that they can eat shit because it wasnt directed at them personally its directed at society and theyre a dick if they want to act like its a personal attack on them while they have no clue what its like to be a woman and never will know what its like to be a woman
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like the type of guy who would joke about how feminists are triggered and offended too easily and yet something like this offends them a ton and the fact that he said that hes ashamed to be called your friend is incredibly fucking rude to say over a small disagreement in opinion also i love how he says prolife is a higher ground for our species like yeah we are so morally superior if we force women to have something they dont want damage her body and add to an already overpopulated world just to give an unneeded human a bad life growing up most likely in poverty or foster homes sarcasm there in case you cant tell
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey there is one line that confuses me can someone clarify it and shes supposed to be just like his mother unless he hates his mother what does it mean is it like she is doing everything for him like his mom because i understand the problem if so or is it if they the mom and the so have close personalitys because someone would have to tell to me why that is wrong thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,what was the original post that pissed him off
creepyPMs,not_removed,my mouth dropped open he doesnt want to discuss it with you more like he just wants to shame and guilt you for having an opinion different from his without giving you an opening to challenge his belief yiiiiiikes
creepyPMs,not_removed,birth control isnt expensive the health clinic gives that stuff away for free by the bag it also isnt effective thats why i have a little sister
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love how at first he refers to it as a conversation then vomits all over the place for paragraphs then says he doesnt want to discuss it further fun little world he must be living in
creepyPMs,not_removed,right so he thinks hes looking for solutions when hes essentially telling the people who actually are to be quiet his solution literally consists of shut up and stop complaining because not all men
creepyPMs,not_removed,link or copy the referenced rant
creepyPMs,not_removed,just know that im not ok discussing this with you uhhhhhhh ok
creepyPMs,not_removed,a friend of mine has been sending me the weird messages she gets about once a week or so from dudes she hasnt heard from in ages apparently this election is bringing out mens thoughtless and unwanted opinions all over the place
creepyPMs,not_removed,i once read a funny limerick on the instagram page datingafeminist i highly recommend following about men who feel the need to reply not all men whenever were talking about the issues we face as women while women are being abused i feel that im rather confused if we can agree that its not about me then why is my ego so bruised
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hope it was worth it it really bloody was fella
creepyPMs,not_removed,im really sorry the original facebook post is gone but from what i gather from the comments here i would definitely share a post like that ill never know what its like to be a woman but i know enough to fucking listen to yall and ive heard and seen enough to know youre telling the truth this friend is a complete fucking asshole hes the reason i like to say i hate straight white cisgendered ablebodied men people like him would completely miss the satire i am one plus nobody with any power would ever say that and be offended sorry you had to get that though what a douche
creepyPMs,not_removed,bye felipe
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats it ladies pack up your bags birth control is free everywhere no excuses
creepyPMs,not_removed,we should be looking at alternatives to abortion look birth control isnt hard to get not expensive etc well theres your best alternative to abortion knocked out right there i guess were back to forcing women to be mothers and hope they feel happy about it as the only acceptable alternative
creepyPMs,not_removed,it really pissed me off and i need some space he was the one to reach out to you first what ugh this guy is a total tool and im glad he outed himself as such
creepyPMs,not_removed,but but but not all men whining
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes a fuckboy but that post was everything i seriously wish i could give you a standing ovation and shake your hand right now you sound awesome and that post is just a straight up mic
creepyPMs,not_removed,im holding judgement till i see the original post
creepyPMs,not_removed,notallmening intensifies also i find it helps how obnoxious this argument is if you just think if it as no tall men
creepyPMs,not_removed,things all men say but not all men
creepyPMs,not_removed,dude needs a safespace
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hope it was worth it edit quoting the creep with a mocking tone not sure if this applies as sarcasm for the s tag
creepyPMs,not_removed,how dare she put it into his view its not like he could have continued to ignore all of this like has has his entire life until that moment its a reblog for fucks sake
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont want to discuss this i want to lecture you im going to be condescending and youre going to listen because as i said this isnt up for discussion nothing sends me over the edge of anger quicker than that shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,how dare you have opinions about your own healthcare you slattern
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have too much respect for you than to pick a fight in public where people can see im a piece of shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,i couldnt read past this line dudes head is up his ass
creepyPMs,not_removed,the human placenta takes over your entire physiology in an almost unique way weve basically lost an evolutionary arms race with our own offspring
creepyPMs,not_removed,seriously almost weeks and wondering why there are women who act like its the best thing to ever happen to them im lucky enough to have inherited my moms second trimester morning sickness im really excited for the baby to get here but man questioning if ill be able to do it a second time
creepyPMs,not_removed,once when i was pregnant with a wanted fetus i got this kidney stone and at the same time hypermesis gravidarum i was throwing up every minutes and in so much pain i was at the point of literally hallucinating from lack of sleep and dehydration i began to worry a lot that the baby was going to be hurt i remember a nurse saying dont worryhell get your bodys nutrients before you do on one hand i was extremely comforted on the other thats kinda creepy they may not be technically parasites because theyre the same species as us but lbh theyre basically parasites
creepyPMs,not_removed,i called my kid a parasite throughout my entire pregnancy and you know what she may not directly feed off of me now as she did in the womb but she will rely on me for all her needs for quite a long time so she is still a parasite in my eyes and occasionally a turd nugget but i chose to have her and shes all mine
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont forget how they soak up your calcium and other nutrients potentially causing you to have brittle bones and bad teeth
creepyPMs,not_removed,then theres the other medical conditions that can sprout up with it like ive also known more than one woman with httpwwwwebmdcombabytcgestationaldiabetestopicoverview we could do this all day really pregnancy is no picnic
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love your post and you deserve gold as a dude i try to stay out of all pregnancy related things not our position to get involved at all outside of directly supporting the choices of our loved ones accident of our loved ones as for work women should get a whole year off hell probably taking care of a baby isnt easy and i have been around toddlers enough to know i hate them i rather deal with teenagers than toddlers
creepyPMs,not_removed,called mine a parasite this evening pregnancy is not glamorous and id never in a million years force this on anyone who wasnt committed it sucks i get a baby at the end so thats awesome but to hell with the in between
creepyPMs,not_removed,and youre not the same after your body is changed your personality is changed and it dont matter how you give birth
creepyPMs,not_removed,my partner loved being pregnant but she was fully aware of how awful it is too constant heartburn not being able to sleep because of how uncomfortable she was and to top it all off she had pelvic girdle issues at around weeks in she could barely walk for most of the pregnancy anyway the little one is now months old and she would do it all again but boy does pregnancy suck in so many ways im glad as hell i wont ever have to do it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i thought parasites were interspecies
creepyPMs,not_removed,by we as a species need to take the higher ground he means marginalized groups need to shut up and accept their lot because them getting mad makes me feel bad
creepyPMs,not_removed,he wants op duh
creepyPMs,not_removed,not all men are like that but i am
creepyPMs,not_removed,that would make a perfect tldr for his rant
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats the weird part men are mentioned but its mainly a rant against social norms its not men are like this its were told to be x way because men are believed to be y
creepyPMs,not_removed,whats the actual post all i see is this guys message with no context maybe an image was removed from the album for all i know op might have been advocating for anything
creepyPMs,not_removed,a woman as president
creepyPMs,not_removed,no tall men
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was really hoping the reply would just be new phone who dis and then thats the end of the friendship forever
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont respond i know im a fucking idiot but i prefer to live in righteous denial of it
creepyPMs,not_removed,making abortion wont stop abortion it will only kill women if roe v wade were to be overturned i could never have sex again
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel this can be used as a prochoice campaign slogan and i am okay with thats its
creepyPMs,not_removed,the original post he is refering too are the last five images in my post
creepyPMs,not_removed,please and update
creepyPMs,not_removed,this was the only commentary he sent to me he didnt comment on the actual post
creepyPMs,not_removed,its not technically true but its closer to true in humans than any other mammal we have an unusually aggressive placenta
creepyPMs,not_removed,even if biologically speaking its inaccurate to label it as a parasite thats all it is at the end of the day a label not technically being a parasite doesnt change the fact that pregnancy is a huge burden on the person carrying it that has the potential to do permanent damage or even kill them and that they should be allowed to terminate it if they so choose
creepyPMs,not_removed,while your comment was fine we dont allow deleted comments to be reposted
creepyPMs,not_removed,the bottom half of the images are the post i shared
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read it as does everythingcares for him like his mother personally
creepyPMs,not_removed,it was a list of challenges faced by women it pretty much touched on just about everything abortion rights cost of child care societal expectations sexuality etc last line was pretty much and you wonder why feminists are angry the true irritation is that ive never been shy about my feminist leanings and i dont know where he got the idea that i wasnt
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not sure if this is the kind of subreddit youre looking for please read rule and comment with that rule in mind in the future but youre welcome to not participate in any circle jerking if it upsets you
creepyPMs,not_removed,i didnt reply at all to be honest it felt like that would be a waste of my time because im not going to change his mind ive been thinking a lot about his interactions with myself and other people in the time i have known him and im starting to realize that i really shouldnt have been surprised that he reacted like this edited for clarity
creepyPMs,not_removed,that doesnt work it just makes people way more mad and whats the point of that
creepyPMs,not_removed,i didnt write it merely shared it from another friend who shared it from the original op
creepyPMs,not_removed,from the sidebar we are feminist and womenfriendly you dont have to identify as such but you must be respectful of the environment please remember questions comments or rebuttals must be directed to the thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not sure you know which sub youre in
creepyPMs,not_removed,if women cant even talk about their own experiences without being accused of attacking men or being too negative then how the fuck else are we supposed to talk about it just shut up and pretend everything is fine so that youre not burdened with thinking about someone elses experiences and feeling bad for them the post isnt immature and whiny its fucking true if reality is too negative for you well then how about changing it instead of blaming the women who are frustrated with it
creepyPMs,not_removed,but what about that just happened
creepyPMs,not_removed,most abortions happen to an embryo not to a fetus and it depends completely on the person carrying it so parasite isnt that far off
creepyPMs,not_removed,have to disagree with you it feeds off your nutrients and stuff so it kinda is one in a way
creepyPMs,not_removed,removed for violating rule
creepyPMs,not_removed,okay bye
creepyPMs,not_removed,dude the message was creepy and infuriating
creepyPMs,not_removed,nm technically right but thats not the point the point is humans shouldnt have to carry a thing that makes them sick in them if they dont want to just because society is sentimental to the idea
creepyPMs,not_removed,i got unfriended by someone like this after a long personal rant that was supposed to make me feel bad made them look like more of a pillock to me instead
creepyPMs,not_removed,especially when it ends with a request for space not even allowing a response
creepyPMs,not_removed,listen sweetie i just dont think you understand sexism
creepyPMs,not_removed,seriously the selfrighteousness in the statement is just infuriating
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats known as mansplaining
creepyPMs,not_removed,it happened to me at work the other day someone said somethig i didnt agree with tried to change her original point after i proved her wrong then started speaking to me like i was a child to try and diminish anything i could follow up i eventually just said wed agree to disagree and she wouldnt accept it just finished her new unrelated point and said there would be no further discussion apparently she does it to everyone
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my god all the stuff i have read about how aggressive the human placenta is is just so bizarre and terrifying i want to be a marsupial
creepyPMs,not_removed,reasons im never reproducing pregnancy is not worth it
creepyPMs,not_removed,man im sad that article is almost a decade old im and have had arthritis for six years so i got really pumped when they mentioned their findings being used as a potential treatment maybe someday
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah ive got one and i was miserable for most of the pregnancy i love him to death but im still not sure i ever want to go through it again
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont get why the average women get so excited about pregnancy that its beautiful and fulfilling i mean are they missing the part they will upchuck regularly cannot eat certain foods drink smoke have to walk on eggshells with medication cant do many activities get fat stretchmarks and then the best part pushing a live creature the size of a small football out of a very small orifice in a process that can take hours incredibly painful and might result in extreme measures like csections how is that something that anyone would want it sounds like a nightmare
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is my turd nugget there are other turd nuggets like her in the world but she is mine and i love her
creepyPMs,not_removed,i did too now hes more of a leech that clings to me all the time and sucks out my energy but i love him to death
creepyPMs,not_removed,i knew a woman who lost her teeth and hair and had brittle nails and bones during and after her pregnancy i was present when she said her husband was getting a vasectomy and he was all surprised butwhy you love our son dont you why do you not want to have more babies i was just surprised he didnt burst into flames from the lasers shooting from her eyes
creepyPMs,not_removed,yup women with hg often have to be hospitalized and given an iv to prevent dehydration theres also mandatory monthslong bedrest preeclampsia gestational hypertension etc etc everyday some new irritating symptom eventuates most recent ones are intermittent joint pain due to relaxin beginning to kick in plus lower back pain due to uterus pressing on my nerves and i think to myself yeah its bad but at least its not hglevel bad
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont forget this fun condition
creepyPMs,not_removed,id change that and say parents should get time off work after a pregnancy maybe the husband in a straight marriage should get less time but he should get time stating that only the mother should get time off is sexist at best what about lgbtq people who adopt they may even need more time as babies imprint differently after adoption
creepyPMs,not_removed,mothers are masochists sometimes i cant believe mine wanted to have me so bad
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep hit the nail on the head
creepyPMs,not_removed,but he only wants her if she behaves like a perfect lady that he envisions her to be and not likei dont knowa person
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh yes absolutely there is much more to this than him being offended by her words
creepyPMs,not_removed,right like notallmen and arguments of that ilk are not even relevant let alone a counterargument i would and do have a huge problem against anyone who ever says all are because thats absurd and never the case no matter which group is being spoken of and what the descriptor is but all of the times in which i see people making that argument its never the point of the argument its usually this happens enough that its dangerous or disincentivized strongly enough to discourage or prevent me from this thing which is almost always true regardless if there is complicity from every given member of a group it doesnt fucking matter if all men are doing it to her enough are
creepyPMs,not_removed,my apologies there was a screenshot originally but its against rules of this subreddit
creepyPMs,not_removed,fuck alright ill see you guys later then
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like a mediumheight man personally
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,idk what im doing wrong but im only seeing images in the whole post finishes with the apples am i missing images would really like to read the original post
creepyPMs,not_removed,ahh sorry hadnt seen those well then to coin a phrase fuck that guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,this person is saying you should take a screenshot of what he messaged to you and post it publicly to the comments of your original post
creepyPMs,not_removed,nothing was said about abortions just that its incorrect to say fetuses are biologically speaking parasites
creepyPMs,not_removed,gotcha will edit
creepyPMs,not_removed,a parasite and a host are defined by most biologists as different species like most mammals human females have a placenta that exchanges materials between the female and the fetus the placenta suggests that for mammals the relationship between a mother and her fetus is symbiotic not parasitic
creepyPMs,not_removed,a parasite and a host are defined by most biologists as different species like most mammals human females have a placenta that exchanges materials between the female and the fetus the placenta suggests that for mammals the relationship between a mother and her fetus is symbiotic not parasitic
creepyPMs,not_removed,babies dont only make us sick but can actually kill us in multiple ways at multiple points in the pregnancy or even during or after birth
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly so if op responds or defends herself that makes her the one that crossed a line or whatever
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol are you mansplaining mansplaining to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,that term itself is sexist though
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would love to be a marsupial or even oviparous i could have a little eggcarrier and roost it at work when i was tired of roosting i could trade off with my husband and i could trade off worrying about eating the wrong thing and damaging the fetus with worrying about the egg breaking which is kind of a wash plus i could enjoy a vice occasionally
creepyPMs,not_removed,biological imperatives are motherfuckers
creepyPMs,not_removed,i witnessed a cat giving birth and it was the most terrifying experience of my life birth and pregnancy arent a miracle sure growth and development are but the other stuff nnnnnnnnooooooooooo also my mom had to get a csection when my heart stopped and my dad thought we were both going to die and the people in the next room lost their child i admit i cant do that whole thing with the kids and the stress and the birth and the lifelong responsibility
creepyPMs,not_removed,my wifes hair got long and strong and her nails got super strong her teeth didnt do too badly her main misery source was aching bones sore muscles and morning sickness lasting all day
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats fair i am currently so far away from kids right now that i havent put a great deal of thought into it outside of personal experiences and the economics behind a child i have never put the thought of mind to establish every possible scenario or to look at every relationship i do apologize about that i should have made the consideration before posting
creepyPMs,not_removed,chivalric love man you like girls when you dont know them and theyre far away enough to be a reflection of your own desires then they go and ruin it by being people and letting you find out
creepyPMs,not_removed,is that how stereotypes start im genuinely curious because it seems that if most people in any certain group are doing the act then it is fair to say that the group does that of course there are outliers but if the norm of the group is a certain way then it is a fair statement i am a guy and i wouldnt consider myself a feminist i just believe people should be able to do whatever they want as long as it doesnt interfere with any other persons right to do the same im sure there are plenty of holes in that mind set too but to me it seems the most fair thing across all genders races cultures etc
creepyPMs,not_removed,its against the rules now im even more curious to read the original post
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had to remove them due to subreddit rules
creepyPMs,not_removed,you wrote in several places that the person you replied to dont actually think about this issue or really any issue at all frases like i bet its easier to get by without thinking in referense to the above comment is not so different then saying stupid people are happier i was i was stupid like you then you gave no argument as too why the above comment was wrong only implying that it lacked nuance many people would agree that if a promotion equal right make you angry then youre probably more of a hinderance than helpful it came of as condesending that you didnt even bother stating an opinion as to why it was wrong as if it should be obvious so people are perhaps downvoting you because you came across as insulting and condesending and also didnt actually add any argument or new viewpoints to the discussion the official reasons for which we are supposed to use the downvote button that you talk negativly about your own ability to think through an issue dont really change this impression
creepyPMs,not_removed,it applies to a good chunk if not most women nowhere did it even say all but it absolutely is the reality we live in that these things happen to a lot of women and youre delusional if you think its not theres nothing hateful about outlining common experiences women face if you think its hateful just to talk about our experiences then clearly it struck a deeper nerve with you than you realize thats your own problem not hers
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know one guy who doesnt think women should have rights
creepyPMs,not_removed,im aware of that especially since several people have said it now which is why i said in a way not literally i dont think anyone here meant the parasite term literally and i still disagree that the only way a person might use that is if something were wrong with that persons head
creepyPMs,not_removed,best response here is just to type k it would send him into orbit
creepyPMs,not_removed,she will then be labelled as an extreme radical man hating hysterical feminist because she refused to just let a man have the last word pffft
creepyPMs,not_removed,tag no touchbacks
creepyPMs,not_removed,usually people on reddit are too afraid to use that word so i did im sorry if you thought i was being condescending i didnt mean to come off that way
creepyPMs,not_removed,not really
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont personally have a problem with it but enough people do that i wouldnt mind a less harsh alternative when talking to people who would bristle at it but i have to admit that i cant think of a better way to describe the particular kind of condescension primarily cis men preemptively adopt when explaining things primarily unprompted to women
creepyPMs,not_removed,i take it back you are clearly in the right here lets be monotremes
creepyPMs,not_removed,laying that egg would suck though the baby still has to grow to full babysize within that egg so its still gotta be pretty big itd also be such a painintheass vag shape to pop out id think
creepyPMs,not_removed,still no walk in the park
creepyPMs,not_removed,no no we agree i was just trying to be as inclusive as possible
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think the problem with that is that it means you start to assume that anyone you come across who is a member of said group is going to fulfill the expectations youve come to have about members of that group i guess that is how stereotypes start you notice a pattern you start to assume its the rule you expect each member of the group to follow that rule the trickiest thing in the world to me is that because so many people in each group do fulfill or seem to fulfill that expectation it becomes harder and harder and harder not to assume every one who is a member of the group how many times have i said that word will be like the others and then the moment occurs when it turns out this one person isnt like that andit just gets complicated its both unfair and i almost think naive to say not all x are like thatand unfair to say all x are like that too people are hard
creepyPMs,not_removed,naw its because the original post was a public post norhing that bad in it
creepyPMs,not_removed,does posting it in the comments count
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,because how dare feeemales have opinions and demand to be treated like people s
creepyPMs,not_removed,something tells me the only response he is hoping for is i am so sorry allow me to make a new post refuting everything i have said and telling the world about equality already exists so whatever
creepyPMs,not_removed,im picking up what youre putting down i wasnt upset i just thought it was funnyironic
creepyPMs,not_removed,how edit im always willing to learn more about my role as a woman in society i would genuinely like it explained to me why this term is not sexist im not trying to be facetious
creepyPMs,not_removed,i find it to be i dont have a better term for it though powersplaining
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes please to the monotremes
creepyPMs,not_removed,babies are pretty big and they also have a tendency to pop out of there anyway recovery from birthing an egg would be a lot easier if all you had to do was pop it in an egg incubator rather than feed a delicate baby every two hours change its diaper and make sure it doesnt die
creepyPMs,not_removed,i should have been from the beginning i tend to not see a whole picture wholenpicture which devalues other people who live with the same struggles i am also not considering adoption into it either how does a child at is years old that suddenly gets thrust into a family dynamic why shouldnt parents get some time to deal with that imagine how hard it is to convince this kid that theyre in the right place or that they should trust you
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah okay makes sense
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think so if a mod would care to chime in
creepyPMs,not_removed,bathing in tears dont sound to pleasurable though honestly its fine to disagree you had something thats been bothering and you let it all out at once which we all do sometimes when were frustrated but it never really go over well but if you approach it in a different way and perhaps in a situation that is more about discussion than support then you will probably get a different reaction its frustrating to feel dismissed and not heard it reminds me on how i felt on rtwoxchromosomes after it went default and most of the comments were dismissing or arguing against the issues concerns and personal stories being posted you get tired of the arguing and just frustrated im not active there much any more i would hope you found a space or group online or irl that you felt were more comfortable debatting with you so you dont quit discussing womens issue like ive stoped doing online at least
creepyPMs,not_removed,just letting you know that you mightve been missing the point of what kko was saying
creepyPMs,not_removed,its like we think were people or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think youre right he also probably expects a random oh please let me suck your dick thrown in there too
creepyPMs,not_removed,it describes an inherently gendered phenomenon being condescendingpatronizing to someone is something people of all genders do but mansplaining specifically describes a form of sexismits something men do to women because they are men and because the women are women a situation where a man is condescending to a woman is not necessarily mansplaining but a situation where a man is condescending to a woman because he automatically assumes she knows less because of her gender is mansplaining sexism in our society is often shown in how we communicate with each other theres a plethora of studies that demonstrate how men consciously or not consistently undervalue womens qualifications expertise knowledge and opinions eg the one where men in a group reported women dominating the conversation when they only spoke as little as something like of the time or the multiple ones where both men and women rate a resume with a male name as more qualifieddeserving of a higher starting salary than an identical resume with a female name the term itself kinda evolved from the essay men explain things to me by rebecca solnit httpwwwguernicamagcomdailyrebeccasolnitmenexplainthingstome i dont really use the term myself that often bc imo its overused and like other people have said here pretty harsh but i still think it describes a valid common experiece of everyday sexism
creepyPMs,not_removed,i view it as gendered term but not sexist
creepyPMs,not_removed,mansplaining is an inherently gendered phenomenon where a man is condescending and patronizing to a woman because he assumes she isnt as smart as he is more often than not he is actually less knowledgeable on the subject he is trying to mansplain or is no more knowledgeable than the woman he is mansplaining to a few examples are • a man telling a woman vaginal birthyeast infectionsperiod crampscatcallingany negative consequence of having a vagina isnt as bad as she thinks because his never complained about it • a marketing team of mostly men asking the one woman on their team what tricks or gimmicks appeal to women then shooting down her suggestions because they dont align with what men perceive as appealing to women • an exreality tv star and owner of several failed businesses thinking hes more fit to run the country than a woman who has a degree in law and has been in politics since she was in her mid twenties despite constantly proving he knows nothing about how the countrys government systems actually function • this last one happened to me in one of my design classes we had to list the behaviors of an animal and machine we were using for reference on a project i mentioned how an apache helicopter has multiple highimpact weapons and two pilots which i said ill be incorporating into my design once class was over a guy who researched a different machine told me i dont know of you know this but the apache helicopter has two pilots one that fires the gun and one that steers the helicopter maybe you could incorporate that yeah dude i said that two hours ago and have a new design on my desk right in front of you ive also heard the catcalling isnt making you uncomfortable thing and your period isnt really bothering you from another guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,it describes a very specific phenomena in western society where men condescend accidentally or intentionally to women on a topic you seem like a sea lion tho so maybe look up the essay men explain things to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would like to hear this as well the term appears to be inherently sexist maybe someone could explain
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just want to be completely barren so i could be more disconnected from the horrors of the placenta than i already am
creepyPMs,not_removed,true true i dont want to birth either though
creepyPMs,not_removed,its a gendered but not sexist term as it describes a phenomenon where guys think theyre more knowledge about a given subject than a woman hes with when thats not really the case for example a man telling a woman that any negative consequences physical or social of having a vagina arent a big deal because they never hear theyre girlfriends complain about it thats an extreme example but if you have a man explaining a subject to a woman in a condescending and often inaccurate manner but dont treat another man the same way you have mansplaining the act of mansplaining is sexist the term mansplaining is not
creepyPMs,not_removed,its cute how you think its a small minority when most women have had a sexual assault or some sexist act committed against them in their lifetime i get it dude you feel uncomfortable facing the reality of the situation and your privilege is going no not us its not true butgoogle is your fucking friend buddy
creepyPMs,not_removed,definitely not a small minority there are plenty of people out there who think that women shouldnt have rights sure you might not know them personally but they do exist why make the point that you dont know any of these people in the first place if you werent intending to make it sound like sexism is not something that needs to be addressed
creepyPMs,not_removed,because this is the reality the reality is as bad as we are saying youre arguing against reality its like youre arguing that water isnt wet or the sky isnt blue to a bunch of people who grew up swimming and looking up we know youre wrong from experience
creepyPMs,not_removed,huh i didnt downvote you and i dont hate it when people have different opinions i thought we were having a discussion not hating on each other sorry if i made it seem like i was against you personally
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy had asked me to a danko jones concert and was super sweet for a bit but when i had said brb work needs me he left a few hundred messages freaking out that he was being ignored thought i blocked him etc so i declined his date and promptly blocked him on meetme but then he found my pof and this is the beginning he still occasionally sends me messages on pof through numerous accounts and immediately blocks me so i cant respond to them bonus found a few more httpimgurcomaqnfwz from the same guy and one when he messaged my best friend
creepyPMs,not_removed,the problem isnt me the problem is no one else has bothered to fix me what a douche
creepyPMs,not_removed,is he trying to use women as a way of counselling and expecting them to solve all his issues in life for him wow
creepyPMs,not_removed,if everywhere you go smells like shit its time to check under your own shoes
creepyPMs,not_removed,its not me its you people not helping me with my issues ok
creepyPMs,not_removed,did you send loved that
creepyPMs,not_removed,that guy is terrifying good thing you dodged that bullet
creepyPMs,not_removed,did you report him maybe theres a way for the appwebsite to block alts by checking ip address or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,a smart woman would let me make up for it no a smart woman would run a mile and theyll keep running until you learn to behave in the first place lmao also what sort of lack of self awareness does this man have to not realise how fucked up it is to be angry at women for not fixing his issues lmao
creepyPMs,not_removed,you killed me with that line did you send it to him
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit is this elliot rodgers reincarnated
creepyPMs,not_removed,not very woman like fix me
creepyPMs,not_removed,wellhe sure as shit made up for his behavior wtf op why didnt you jump on that raging tornado of entitlement and bullshit s
creepyPMs,not_removed,in some ways i wish there was a filter like this that people had to go through and show you before you dated them like as a warning like thats the nice thing about online dating i guess i just feel so bad for the poor soul that will get duped into a relationship with him like his ex
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really dig your responses and people say women are crazy ha
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow selfish much jeez
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit he seems psychotic good on you and your friend though
creepyPMs,not_removed,you made a good choice to pass that up not very woman like jaysus
creepyPMs,not_removed,i apologized i am trying to make up for my behavior and youre not letting me which isnt very fair of you and isnt very woman like jeeezus the mommy issues on this one i acted like a petulant child but i said i was sorry so now its your job to hold me and tell me im a good boy and the it isnt very woman like basically means my mom is the only woman i know and youre not acting like her so youre not a woman
creepyPMs,not_removed,op your friend is awesome
creepyPMs,not_removed,this person really might be off his fucking rocker and as such needs to seek help before a girlfriend also speaking as someone whose close cousin was just shot in the face last nighti hope he was fucking joking
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is a difficult part to explain i know for me it was and still is very frustrating looking for help and none of the advice makes logical sense i would read article after article listen to podcast after podcast and just sink deeper into depression cause not understanding meant i was tragically flawed it also doesnt help when you reach out for help you get sucked into a circle jerk of niceguys™ and everybody else rolls their eyes i pick up most things in life super quick but confidence and social interactions are just plum foreign and impossible that coupled with the inability to afford counciling tends to overflow and hurt innocent bystanders i felt pretty shitty when i discovered i was a niceguy™ but the road to a better person doesnt seem worth it most of the time
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have reported him as did my friend i shared screenshots with both meetme and the pof safety team theres been no further messages on meetme but pof theyre still coming in
creepyPMs,not_removed,im just so very unlady like and unclassys
creepyPMs,not_removed,yea really the poor soul who doesnt see this side of him good luck
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds pretty solid to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,she definitely is
creepyPMs,not_removed,well god damn get you some culture girl this one is gonna slip away after three or four more days of harassment and bullshit we hope
creepyPMs,not_removed,please dont buy or sell animals on craigslist
creepyPMs,not_removed,seconding that i know of a man who made money by taking animals posted free to good home or with a nominal feeand selling them to labs for testingexperimenting
creepyPMs,not_removed,its like hes a dodrio and the heads are all trying to message you
creepyPMs,not_removed,i felt like i was having a stroke
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe english isnt their first language and someone told them a bunch of wrong phrases to use either way what in the fuck

creepyPMs,not_removed,what
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive seen a lot of creeps trying to extortblackmail people online but this is one of the freakiest attempts that i think ive ever seen even though hes obviously lying the fact that hes claiming to have literally stalked and followed you home plus filmed your family in addition to you ugh this is multiple levels of gross and fucked up
creepyPMs,not_removed,someone tried to blackmail me online in a very similar way once i was really distraught and upset at the thought they said they had naked pics and were naming random people off my facebook how they contacted me with how would name of friend react to these pics how about family name what would they think of you it seems some men today are using blackmail for one of a few reasons to extort sex sexual one to one to demand money for silence webcam sex mostly to get the actual blackmail material that they never had in the first place i was told to send money or else the images they said they had would be sent to all my facebook they threatened not to block because they would find other ways to contact sure enough i blocked them and reported to facebook with screenshots they did send me an email demanding more money and being more scary you shouldnt have blocked me that is going to cost you threats i used a tracing services on google to find their ip address to find them in the world the email came from africa and was obviously now a scam blackmail standard to try and get money i was told by the police that i could report to interpol but not to expect much they said that blackmail is only possible if you agree consent basically if you refuse to do what they demand or refuse to pay they cannot release the blackmail material because then they would have nothing to blackmail with losing all their power over you if they did have blackmail material via whatever means realising you would not give in to threats may still release the blackmail material to loved ones but the police pointed out that if you explained what had happened being blackmailed your friends and family should understand if friends and family do not then you know more about your loved ones and those you can rely on it was a great comfort realising i had the power so i did what the police said no replying or responding delete and block further emails nothing came of it in the end despite the threats getting worse and money demands higher until obviously realizing i was not reacting they gave up blackmail is horrible to experience and horrible more that it is becoming a manipulation tool in modern society by sad desperate little men and blackmailing scam artists it seems that it is so much easier to be blackmailed when you read the creepy pm messages where guys ask for sexy pics or webcam and some people naively send blackmail material straight to people they have just met and do not trust you need only google skype blackmail to see the stories of thousands and the fear it creates my advice is to report do not respond and block any contact
creepyPMs,not_removed,woah good on you for thinking logically and not freaking the hell out like i would have
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow what a fucking creep
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy crap what a horrible person i wonder if theres anything you could do legally since hes threatening you technically im guessing not since he didnt ask for anything yet but maybe someone else can chime in if this guys behavior is illegal in addition to being disgusting i hope instagram bans him and that he leaves you alone forever i think you handled this really well
creepyPMs,not_removed,because he kept asking if it was okay to post he said be couldnt because then id have proof that hes recorded me so he wants to post it publicly but doesnt want to show it to you because that proves he actually has these images like somehow posting those images publicly wouldnt also prove he has them my brain i dont even
creepyPMs,not_removed,how could he have video of you naked if he followed you walking home which im assuming you wouldnt be naked for unless hes saying hes able to record in your home not trying to freak you out im just trying to follow the logic
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh man yeah i didnt even think of that i really hope hes not sending the same messages to a bunch of other women the sort of funny not funny thing is that i literally just joined instagram this morning i always forget that there are creeps everywhere in the world both on the internet and real life
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks for the advice i dont have my full name on there and none of my pics will be ones that i have on other social media accounts so im hoping to avoid stalkery people but i know its impossible to avoid all creeps
creepyPMs,not_removed,no its not weird its weird that you said something
creepyPMs,not_removed,op hes probably thinking that you are one in the users who enjoys that type of thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know if its weird maybe you should ask your wife
creepyPMs,not_removed,lord this sounds like that guy who did the im in bed with my sleeping wife with her sleeping friend on the couch and my boner is so hard for you its some weird fetish shit hes got going on
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wonder how many guys who send some variation of this are actually married theres really no ratio that isnt creepy andor depressing in that situation tho
creepyPMs,not_removed,this kind of shit makes me not want to get married
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel so special that you are attracted to me wow even though you have a wife you want to beat it to me thank you for making me feel like a sexy snowflake s
creepyPMs,not_removed,and also pathetic
creepyPMs,not_removed,not at all 😂
creepyPMs,not_removed,when you put it that way its almost sweet s
creepyPMs,not_removed,if ur starting ur pickup line with is it weird its time to throw that shit in reverse
creepyPMs,not_removed,wait that approach doesnt work shit i had better rethink my approach s super s
creepyPMs,not_removed,weird it is
creepyPMs,not_removed,theres no logic just plain stupidity
creepyPMs,not_removed,i meant its time to back off lmao
creepyPMs,not_removed,the fucks front behind
creepyPMs,not_removed,you know you want me instead of him right someone should inform him that jedi mind tricks arent real
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wonder if the grand council would like to see a screenshot of this
creepyPMs,not_removed,has there ever been a tke that wasnt a gross pushy douche
creepyPMs,not_removed,whats tke
creepyPMs,not_removed,your first mistake was talking to a tke better than sae though
creepyPMs,not_removed,weird
creepyPMs,not_removed,is there a tke chapter that doesnt suck ass
creepyPMs,not_removed,classic tke
creepyPMs,not_removed,why did you accept his request
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you cant go greek go tke
creepyPMs,not_removed,you dont want to know
creepyPMs,not_removed,urethra
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats a good question they were generally seen that way at the university i went to lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,they were douchey back when i went to college in the early nothing has changed apparently
creepyPMs,not_removed,all the tkes i know are nerdy dweebs youre thinking sig chi
creepyPMs,not_removed,tke at my university got their section shut down for massadministering date rape drugs at parties
creepyPMs,not_removed,my ex boyfriends brother was tke and they used to have contests to see who could fuck the fattest girl his brother won that among a bunch of drinking contests im pretty glad to not be associated with that family anymore lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikitaukappaepsilon
creepyPMs,not_removed,i didnt see the last two messages until after i had accepted it i thought it was just the one message
creepyPMs,not_removed,not at my university anyway i didnt really know any sig chi guys although they did have decent parties
creepyPMs,not_removed,well now thats a new spin on the old will you bone me without a condom
creepyPMs,not_removed,send him a link to a fertility clinic
creepyPMs,not_removed,this seems like a successful strategy
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh man what app is this
creepyPMs,not_removed,why would you take that chance he should have said hey baby my surgery for infertility was successful
creepyPMs,not_removed,well dude youve made me never want sex again so yeah i believe it was successful
creepyPMs,not_removed,well yes actually yes i do since my uterus is clearly just more like a slots machine s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i honestly feel like weve reached a new low
creepyPMs,not_removed,meetme
creepyPMs,not_removed,more like stayawayfromme
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry your clever attempt to use racism in order to subvert the fact that you are a pathetic guy pretending to be a fashion designer to pick up chicks has failed trump
creepyPMs,not_removed,he should use some of that successful business man money to buy a new suit jacket that button is holding on for dear life one deep breath and that things gonna embed itself into the drywall
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes because obviously a person selling probably knock off versace shirts on facebook is the picture of success
creepyPMs,not_removed,well that was incredibly bizarre
creepyPMs,not_removed,well he certainly behaves like trump thickskinned egotistical insults and bragging
creepyPMs,not_removed,but the necktie looks fabulous
creepyPMs,not_removed,im super weirded out by the you did well creepy personally i would tell him you want no more to do with this love triangle he thinks is happening and i would tell z and t what c told you so they are aware hes being weirdly controlling and obsessive i would appreciate an update if there ever is one
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would really recommend telling z about this guys intentions he is obviously inept at reading social cues and its a worrying thought what could happen if he was to be left alone with her she needs to avoid that situation at all costs
creepyPMs,not_removed,i see a growing unhealthy infatuation with z happening not necessarily because its her specifically but because shes a female period if he has little female interaction hes going to stay homed in on her
creepyPMs,not_removed,tell her immediately she should know she needs to distance herself from that lunatic for her own safety
creepyPMs,not_removed,definitely tell z
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes coming across creepy because hes immature i used to get my friends to feel out a crush for me when i was in grade this guy wants to bag her so bad but doesnt know how to use his words so he is desperate for a wingman in you i think its good you cut it at the quick and let him know your idea of helping is not directly cockblocking t its cs fault for reading into it too much hes infatuated with this girl and is acting like hes got blinders on one track mind thinking with his dick please keep us updated
creepyPMs,not_removed,im sorry he put you in such an uncomfortable situation it always sucks being stuck in the middle of something i would love to hear updates in the future if you get a chance
creepyPMs,not_removed,lets not refer to them by their names from here on out so much cringe
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know everyone else has already said it but i have to say it too please please please tell z look out for her this is a terrifying situation to be in
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow this guy is weird considering this is a summer program and summer has just started i would definitely make it clear to him now and i mean crystal clear that you want no part of it and i think you should tell him by text so that he cant use the excuse that he was hammered and doesnt remember as he seems to be inclined to do in addition if hes a manipulator and tries to ruin your friendship with z and t youll have the text to back you up im really sorry youre going through this i hope it doesnt ruin your experience this summer
creepyPMs,not_removed,that poem sounds like it should never see the light of day let us know if you want any kind of advice theres a tag for dat but yeah bleh i wouldnt want to get in the middle of that either sounds bad
creepyPMs,not_removed,that dude pissed me off so much constantly saying sorry when you were at the grocery store he is a weirdo very insecure and lonely it seems
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah it makes me uncomfortable that he thought me sitting next to z was my way of helping him
creepyPMs,not_removed,this this guy is sending up so many red flags he buys them in bulk from costco avoid at all costs
creepyPMs,not_removed,and unfortunately when she doesnt reciprocate since shes in a relationship he seems like the type to take it as a personal slight because hes built the fantasy of her up so much in his head cue bitter resentment of how women just want asshole where any guy not him is an ass and cant see a nice guy if hes standing in front of her
creepyPMs,not_removed,charlie here the eagle has left the nest
creepyPMs,not_removed,bingo right on the nail head
creepyPMs,not_removed,not wanting to engage or enable a creep is not a bad thing its a common sense thing op is looking out for the girl
creepyPMs,not_removed,context im a cosplayer and model and get these messages all the time this is one of many after i bought and posted photos of myself in the infamous virgin killer sweater might post more text grab responses from my posts later my ig is a goldmine
creepyPMs,not_removed,im sorry i dont give a shit about boundaries or your feelings but i like you so give me pics because my man desires trump your autonomy feeemale
creepyPMs,not_removed,you turned down johnny depp how could you s
creepyPMs,not_removed,im sorry that you like me too
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think emojis should be banned in message boxes unless you enable it always makes things worse
creepyPMs,not_removed,he put i love you in quotes admitting straight up that it was a fake feeling
creepyPMs,not_removed,im a cosplayer too and in some of the cosplaybased groups im in on facebook i tend see posts with stuff like this even the cosplay community isnt safe from creeps
creepyPMs,not_removed,is that his real picture
creepyPMs,not_removed,i actually had a conversation recently about how dumb that sweater is and that it would definitely not fit a real human i was apparently wrongis out at least a comfortable item
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know i suck
creepyPMs,not_removed,missedopportunitiestobesassy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i agree especially for the ones who love to overuse emojis
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know maybe if he had been genuine he wouldve gotten videos
creepyPMs,not_removed,seeing as how the picture is of johnny depp im guessing not
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean theyre obv meant as a fetish clothing item and mine is super warm and soft at least in the front and i have a stupid long torso so it actually compliments how im shaped
creepyPMs,not_removed,seeing as i didnt recognize it as johnny depp i didnt know
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats fair it would never flatter me so much as i am a short lumpy lady lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,seeing as how i didnt recognize it either its okay
creepyPMs,not_removed,girl youd probably flaunt it but i totally understand if its not something youre down for
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not alone
creepyPMs,not_removed,noooope no thank you what the heck are people thinking when they send stuff like this gross
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats a lot of criteria to meet
creepyPMs,not_removed,you cant swallow when youre expecting everyone knows thats how babies get pregnant s
creepyPMs,not_removed,ew ew ew ew eeeewwwwwwwww cant unsee that wtf
creepyPMs,not_removed,pregnancy fetishists were the worst for me when i was pregnant nothing against the fetish itself but the way they always seemed to push it on me and sexualize the baby in my uterus was just sooooo uncomfortable sorry you had to deal with this op
creepyPMs,not_removed,a rating out of chats i wonder why s
creepyPMs,not_removed,well thats not fundamentally disturbing in the slightest s
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is a very special kind of ew
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus christ what im sorry i justwow
creepyPMs,not_removed,what app is this
creepyPMs,not_removed,for some reason i was reading this in my head in the voice of troy mcclure up until about the halfway point
creepyPMs,not_removed,people like this usually come from dark holes that have warped their mind past healing and deal with problems like porn addiction
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean hey im looking to stop feeling so lazy but uhnot looking to become some random strangers sex toy
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah its one of those that really make me feel uncomfortable its like the minute a woman becomes pregnant she stops being considered as an individual person with boundaries by so many people in so many different ways
creepyPMs,not_removed,since when did lesbian feminist whore
creepyPMs,not_removed,i say this as a straight man straight men are fucking strange sometimes
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg stubble in clit shudders also kek seriously the cringe sigh
creepyPMs,not_removed,isnt that totally illegal what hes doing
creepyPMs,not_removed,as a fellow lesbian i know how frustrating some straight guys can be to deal with thank god ive never had to deal with this amount of fuckupery but im sorry you did c
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg i have seen that first message before or posts below so this guy is going around messaging the same thing to everyone
creepyPMs,not_removed,he wants to rub his stubble in your clit duder thats so not a comfortable sounding thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,loooordd you know has some serious shit to answer for
creepyPMs,not_removed,whats that lil car thing on the top left
creepyPMs,not_removed,what even im so confused
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus christ people are fucking stupid
creepyPMs,not_removed,because lesbians like women and anyone who likes women is a filthy feminist s
creepyPMs,not_removed,women cant love women because theyre lovely and attractive they can only be gay because they hate guys andor cant get a guy s
creepyPMs,not_removed,what does kek mean im old
creepyPMs,not_removed,is this stubble in clit shit a meme somewhere why are there so many guys saying theyre going to do that who the fuck thinks its a good idea
creepyPMs,not_removed,he he wants to bite it
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah you like that baby chops lips
creepyPMs,not_removed,seems like it someone should hand him a dictionary though he doesnt seem to know what roast means
creepyPMs,not_removed,i thought this was the same person who sends that to more than one person without realizing this is not how you interact with people
creepyPMs,not_removed,i thought so too i remembered seeing it awhile back when i saw the post earlier and was thinking repost but apparently hes just a serial creep
creepyPMs,not_removed,youve found a great way to paraphrase how insecure assholes feel about lesbians also filthy feminist is a wonderful band name for an all girl punk band
creepyPMs,not_removed,spit
creepyPMs,not_removed,its literally lol yup
creepyPMs,not_removed,ouch why
creepyPMs,not_removed,well some of them legitimately think they have magic dicks or words that can change your sexuality because changing someones sexuality is completely possible s seriously though what fucking idiots
creepyPMs,not_removed,simple their world revolves entirely around their dick they dont grasp that you and every other woman on earth does not share this point of view
creepyPMs,not_removed,cripes
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know maybe hes never seen one up close and wants to see if it tastes like bubblegum d
creepyPMs,not_removed,that mental image isnt pretty poor vaginas they may be genitals but they dont deserve that
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh christ sakes first of all its scummy of them to flirt when they know your in a relationship already but to be a transphobic prick pisses me off im a trans girl and i am miles away from being a guy in fact im literally the opposite i guess those morons need to realize that trans women are in fact women and that your not a piece of shit cheater
creepyPMs,not_removed,if i pretend another woman wanted to spend time with me the uninterested onebwill suddenly be interested right genius
creepyPMs,not_removed,bucks its with his mom
creepyPMs,not_removed,never go out with a man who doesnt know the difference between your and youre
creepyPMs,not_removed,im presumably someone who only wants things if i think someone else lost out on them in favor of me so here let me tell you some other girl is going to lose out on a date with me because youre hotter that has to work right
creepyPMs,not_removed,im totally going to treat some other woman like shit and ghost her for you dont worry about the other woman youre way hotter and more worth it doesnt that impress you and make you feel special and sexy such a respectful gentleman not shallow or judgemental at all s
creepyPMs,not_removed,im no detective but something tells me he doesnt actually have a reservation
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahahahahah
creepyPMs,not_removed,or totoo first message
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had an albanian guy asking me to marry him so he could get into norway to get a job too and he just pulled the whole youre racist for not wanting to marry me card and i was like what the heck
creepyPMs,not_removed,is it even creepy at that point or desperate why does this guy want to get into norway so much
creepyPMs,not_removed,im loving can you married me i wish i could imagine some situation in which i could use it if it ever does i so will i
creepyPMs,not_removed,pretty shitty im all for accepting refugees and such but this is just pathetic this is what actual lykkejegere is not the syrian children p
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would get norwegian kroner for marrying a bosnian woman so she could live in norway i did not do that
creepyPMs,not_removed,theres a common misconception that norway is like the best country to live in and that you would get so rich from working here the latter would be true if you only spent your salary back in the country you came from theres a lot of eastern european people working here and sending their money back to their families nothing wrong with that people just go about it the wrong way sometimes
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know right i feel sorry for the children they did nothing wrong
creepyPMs,not_removed,that lyk thingy oddly sounds like some food or a pokemon lyk lyky use lick
creepyPMs,not_removed,what if they added two zeros would you do it
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks for explaining that for me haha we are one of the richest countries with a lot of welfare and pretty much free healthcare rated as the best country to live in several years in a row soo yeahh
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep and many young women from eastern european countries come here during the summer to work as prostitutes and finance their entire university tuition back home many many construction people come up here spend a year or two living in shared accommodation often onsite in those containerhouses and go home with enough money to get a house and set themselves up for a better life they come work hard spend as little as possible and go back home i believe many filipino people do the same in the us
creepyPMs,not_removed,its just norwegian for fortune seekers
creepyPMs,not_removed,as a canadian i kinda know what you mean by that canada gets rated high as well and americans like to talk about moving to canada for the dumbest reasons
creepyPMs,not_removed,a nurse who visits the person i work for has her family in latvia theyre filthy rich over there with her norwegian salary combined with her husbands salary so i understand why people do it i struggle with making it from paycheck to paycheck living here so i kind of envy them at times that they have the opportunity to do something like that
creepyPMs,not_removed,most of these work black though as we call it meaning they dont pay taxes and arent registrered which is illegal though
creepyPMs,not_removed,not everyone but definitely the prostitutes of course for foreigners in norway its legal to sell sex but not to buy and even if the construction people work legally theyre not always treated right by the company that hired them weve had a few exposés in the papers about that in the last few years
creepyPMs,not_removed,it honestly never ceases to amaze me just how utterly conceited and selfobsessed people like this are its almost as if every bit of information they get blasts through a power circuit that feeds directly into their grotesque ego complexes theyre like robots you say youre not interested but you dont know what youre missing out on you actually want to have sex with me youre continuing the conversation in some way so clearly all signs are saying that you actually want to have sex with me you clearly state you have no interest in random super creeps on the internet who spontaneously try to solicit sex but you just havent met me yet trust me you actually want to have sex with me all universal and fundamental forces demand that you actually want to have sex with me alternative route does not compute in brain bzzzt kaboom
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like how he repeats that sad line accidentally you just know hes going from girl to girl saying drinks dancing cunnilingus thinking that someone is bound to buy it eventually
creepyPMs,not_removed,to infinahty and beyond
creepyPMs,not_removed,firm nah on that one im choking trying not to laugh out loud at work
creepyPMs,not_removed,image is broken cant seem to view it
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont message me i will nah be changing my mind
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was fine with the phrase oral pleasure until this creep used it now i never ever want to hear it again ever
creepyPMs,not_removed,and its never a personally redeeming quality its always you should bang me because youre hot like how the fuck does that make sense
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wish i could see it too
creepyPMs,not_removed,damn it that would have been so good
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha xd i wanna know though maybe you should try giving someone a bj then
creepyPMs,not_removed,from the blowjob question i got the impression he was being disrespectful im glad he cleared that up
creepyPMs,not_removed,xd
creepyPMs,not_removed,finally somebody who agrees with me fuck that emoticon
creepyPMs,not_removed,mines
creepyPMs,not_removed,aww i love the xd face its perfect for not quite lol but still amused some people totally misuse it though
creepyPMs,not_removed,op is using o is that better
creepyPMs,not_removed,i honestly prefer emoticons made using characters over the emoticons and emojis programs use
creepyPMs,not_removed,my behaviour is respect women and play chess excellent edit my behaviour is respect women and helping old people
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think he is just confused but honestly as an indian that was terribly embarrassing to read 😵
creepyPMs,not_removed,im here to respect women and play chess and im all out of moves
creepyPMs,not_removed,so a leopard can change its spots
creepyPMs,not_removed,meetme is actually a good way to meet new friends as thats what the site was originally intended for
creepyPMs,not_removed,and women
creepyPMs,not_removed,only very slightly
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah okay thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,what the fuccckkk
creepyPMs,not_removed,he is gonna message your dad for nudes how much is he paying edit i see youre a member of a nsfw sub that sexualizes fathers and daughters maybe thats why you got this pm
creepyPMs,not_removed,please censor out all identifying information before submitting usernames must be blocked out
creepyPMs,not_removed,true but i dont post nudies
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh youre a fellow human being feeling down on yourself let me tell you how i can make this about my penis being more important ugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow that left quite the sour taste in my mouth sorry that it happened to you what a douche this dude is
creepyPMs,not_removed,uuuuggghhhh what is his damage thats just horrible im sorry you had to go through that
creepyPMs,not_removed,backstory oops i meant to crop the repeated part out of the second image okay so last night i had what to me was my first real whisper moment as in i actually had something i really needed to say aloud to someone but didnt have anyone to say it to so i posted it to whisper among other messages i gotthis guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,dysphoria sucks blah hes a dickhead too
creepyPMs,not_removed,im sorry i have a good friend with severe dysphoria and it hurts me to see what they go through i hope the other responses were more helpful or at least less infuriating
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is just nasty and fucking stupid im glad you schooled his ass
creepyPMs,not_removed,it just blows my miiiiind
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really dont know how i thought it wouldnt happen i guess because my body is disgusting seemed like if anything something that would draw creeps away from you how is my constantly thinking about how disgusting i find myself at all a sexual or appealing thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,it does suck
creepyPMs,not_removed,i try i try
creepyPMs,not_removed,saying something bad about your body seems to be code for these creeps they seem to think its i secretly want you to see my body so you can judge it no one ever said chasers were smart
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive seen arsewipes claim outright oddly enough when rejected that girls who consider themselves unattractive or who they consider unattractive are easy because they seek validation never seen it work though
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not sure but i think that the dude that messaged you is just yet another delusional moron on the internet they come in all shapes and sizes i guess
creepyPMs,not_removed,any sign of low self esteem brings out the creeps
creepyPMs,not_removed,what kind of annoyed me too was i knew someone would say then do something about it and someone else did yeah thanks buddy because i totally didnt think of thatits that easy i wasnt even only talking about my weight and for all they knew i could be skinny as a rail or talking about somethingtotally unrelated to my weight so the assumption that i must be fat and complaining kind of annoyed me too but i chose not to respond to that person rant
creepyPMs,not_removed,well considering im not a girl that mentality which i suspect was precisely the one he held is even more stupid that was another thing i was thinking that i bet he assumed i was a girl
creepyPMs,not_removed,indeed they do it really pissed me off that posting about that apparently struck this guy as an invitation to creep
creepyPMs,not_removed,whoops sorry for assuming youre probably spot on though
creepyPMs,not_removed,pisses me off too the guy is a huge cunt
creepyPMs,not_removed,wha was there context like any what the actual fuck
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,what the heck was there any context
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know know furry when i see one and diaper furs are so fucking common am i wrong
creepyPMs,not_removed,weeell that happened
creepyPMs,not_removed,its like he was trying to describe his many various fetishizes but it all got garbled into nonsense when he was struck by a massive stroke
creepyPMs,not_removed,goo ga
creepyPMs,not_removed,alright some contex i knew this person from imvu for a little bit i never really got to know her but she was friends of a friend so i just kinda stood up with most of the weird shit she tries doing she has tried to sexually rp with me a lot all with nos and even tried to roleplay as my cat i cant make this up so when the imvu crew made a skype group i added everyone including her and this is what she sent me out of the blue me and the group dont talk to them anymore
creepyPMs,not_removed,httplivestreamcomtinykittensstarling
creepyPMs,not_removed,sleepy kitties
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you kind person these cats will help me grieve
creepyPMs,not_removed,no that was my first guess as well once youve encountered one you never quite forget
creepyPMs,not_removed,that fucking flair gets me every time i see you on here
creepyPMs,not_removed,waking up and seeing this in my inbox completely forgetting the context was almost as confusing as op
creepyPMs,not_removed,probably furry
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is grade a crazy thanks for the extra info
creepyPMs,not_removed,theyre so fluffy i want to die 😍😍😍
creepyPMs,not_removed,um rnocontext
creepyPMs,not_removed,physco
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like his gf didnt take the truth too well
creepyPMs,not_removed,this
creepyPMs,not_removed,may be you could help me you decide dont leave us redditers with the responsibility of making such big decisions for you op
creepyPMs,not_removed,so was this a spam bot what is their strategy what is going on im new to this so it was a man pretending to be a woman
creepyPMs,not_removed,tune in next week for the exciting conclusion of dirty bot or not
creepyPMs,not_removed,my brother used to be mra till his girlfriend started abusing him and when he tried to get help and shit all his mra friends mocked him and made fun of him hes not an mra anymore
creepyPMs,not_removed,you can pretty much bet anyone who mocks safe spaces is gonna be an asshole
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry about that creep i know you hope to get positive feedback when you post about your depression and it only serves to encourage it getting a response like that trust me i know or else i wouldnt be depression iguana
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry about your depression if it helps your conversation gave me some holy shit what is wrong with these people type entertainment when i was going through my roughest moments in life i found making others smile laugh and be happy ultimately led to happiness for me as well hang in there not everyone is a piece of shit best of luck to you
creepyPMs,not_removed,what happened to your brother is why i absolutely despise mras they pretend they actually care about men but they only care about men being considered superior again they dont want to build shelters or at least have adequent consoling for abused men they want to continue abusing women and shut down domestic violence shelters
creepyPMs,not_removed,depression iguana thanks depression iguana
creepyPMs,not_removed,found the creep
creepyPMs,not_removed,i profoundly disagreeweve clearly had some different life experiences or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,you are either being willfully ignorant or trolling either way the fuck outta here with you
creepyPMs,not_removed,i do find it creepy that he posted that immediately after i posted mine and it was the first post
creepyPMs,not_removed,just my opinion i dont identify as either btw
creepyPMs,not_removed,nope midwest doesnt mean we still havent had different experiences i guess
creepyPMs,not_removed,every mra except the absolute leaders of the mrm deny being mras they know their worldview is toxic
creepyPMs,not_removed,can you give an example of what a good mra would believe indo
creepyPMs,not_removed,the only thing i can think of is fighting for equal opportunity to gain custodial rights of children and not being forced to pay child support for children that arent yours but thinking that doesnt make you an mra it just makes you a decent human being imo
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not even jewish and im slightly offended
creepyPMs,not_removed,your post has been removed because there is a profile pic visible please block it out and resubmit thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,love how he figured sex was inevitable
creepyPMs,not_removed,once sex is out the way says some shit like this then has the audacity to ask you to help him workout your a more forgiving person than me would of stopped playing overwatch with him
creepyPMs,not_removed,aah the wonders of the gaming community of the dudes i met on ow tried hitting me up just because im a chick so i gave up changed to a genderless name and dont mention im a girl unless i have to use vc which i almost never do without friends anymore also how about that new dva skin
creepyPMs,not_removed,the disappointing thing is when they ghost after youve made it clear that you want to be platonic it makes me question how interesting i am
creepyPMs,not_removed,nice guy good friend but ive thought he had a crush on me for a while now honestly who wouldnt lol and this just confirms it sigh trouble is im not interested in him
creepyPMs,not_removed,things like that really irk me i had a guy i would play pokémon with and thought was a friend get insanely jealous one day over some guy i was seeing he said something along the lines of all those slutty men get to see your body and treat you badly while im still just a virgin noped real fast out of talking to him after that cant we just play video games with guys and not be sources of sex
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol id just drop him instantaneously
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahah im totally just kidding what a funny joke i made my friend unless youre interested
creepyPMs,not_removed,damn i should play overwatch again its been awhile
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe it was this fellow from rcringe the other day
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont be gross tammy
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah being a girl gamer has its quirks
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love his optimism s
creepyPMs,not_removed,the game i play with most of the people in overwatch voice chat is are you a girl or are you not gonna lie there are times ive said i was because apparently a ten year old boy deserves more respect than a grown woman s also a mercy main here her new skin looks fantastic with the gold weapon
creepyPMs,not_removed,lolllllllll
creepyPMs,not_removed,and after the sex was the best time to get in shape
creepyPMs,not_removed,a guy playing overwatch feels an entitled sense of ownership of womens bodies nothing in the past could have possibly prepared me for this
creepyPMs,not_removed,see they get so excited because omg theres a girl playing where if theyd stop being such annoyances all the girls silently playing would come out of the woodworks or come back if theyd been turned away by their actions
creepyPMs,not_removed,ikr all the skins are amazing but yeah most guys make a big deal about me being female luckily ive found a few that dont care as long as i heal them lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i can relate with my gender nonspecific nickname ash also being in my battle tag i get asked if im a girl like ten times a day on ow luckily being a guy i shut them down pretty quickly but i can only imagine how they must be slavering over every piece of female flesh that dares interact with a keyboard
creepyPMs,not_removed,but with a female name youre pretty much asking to be fucked s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really want that mei skin i also really want to stop sucking at mei xd
creepyPMs,not_removed,i play on so the only form of communication is pretty much voice chat i get so nervous worrying about the possibility of some guy being creepy or sexist that a lot of the time i forego using it but it holds me back in ranked also i just got the new years dva skin im so happy i spent hours grinding for the christmas tracer skin but never got it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i get this when ever i make friends on games too first its oh youre a girl and suddenly next theyre constantly flirting or making creepy remarks one guy i met on wow was always siiiigh if only you werent a lesbian we could date uh dude even if i wasnt gay it doesnt mean id automatically be interested in you also that bold assumption that youd just have sex with him upon meeting is super creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was gonna say i make jokes like this to my online friends but its different if youre pretty sure hes crushing
creepyPMs,not_removed,wat if im not then what
creepyPMs,not_removed,the new event has launched and its incredible definitely check it out
creepyPMs,not_removed,when that genji complains why you havent healed him yet youll think again
creepyPMs,not_removed,hell yeah
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh noooo oh noooooooo
creepyPMs,not_removed,ikr i got the gold weapon about a week before the skin and its just perfect
creepyPMs,not_removed,well you ideally want to start with some cardio to get your blood pumping
creepyPMs,not_removed,you dropped this s
creepyPMs,not_removed,hi few things to start off with yes i added you because youre a female gamer tis an awesome thing to see im brian dont be intimidated but im not a stereotypical guy if anything ill be the one in the kitchen d
creepyPMs,not_removed,i play with a female friend of mine all the time and usually when we play competitive we go into team voice chat it makes me cringe so hard the way people talk to her some people are just outright mean or perverted i wouldnt be able to put up with it as she is shes determined to not let it stop her from using team chat but i usually avoid it i guess what im trying to say is that sorry i know it sucks and if i was a woman playing online i probably would never use team chat
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre gonna find it pretty hard for people not to love you when you be playing support
creepyPMs,not_removed,supporttanks all the way honestly i just assume every helping character is a girl unless proven otherwise what would those guys do without our heals haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love the paint job on anas gun looks especially good in gold but my god the mask is terrifying loving all the journey to the west skins but honestly my favourite from this set is the tracer rose skin the plain matte black with shiny floral detailing is just lovely shame i dont play her much
creepyPMs,not_removed,hello fellow mercy main d
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have the same problem i go by a shorter form of my usual user name on overwatch due to character limits strawberry instead of strawberrycocoa and apparently my user name isnt very masculine because between that and playing a lot of mercy i get hit on sometimes i find it kind of funny when they visibly recoil upon learning im a guy though
creepyPMs,not_removed,my username isnt feminine at all actually
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha i got both meis and i never play her really want that dva
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love dva but i m never lucky with her skins still crying over the fact that there was no zarya skin
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah weve never even talked about dating or romantic feelings or anything which i assume he has for me but i dont for him and he suddenly goes straight for sex hes usually pretty chill tho and the conversation continued normally after that luckily
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i dont joke about sex with him because i know hes crushing and i dont want him to take it the wrong way
creepyPMs,not_removed,no i told him a while ago weve been friends for months at this point
creepyPMs,not_removed,capture the flag is so much fun
creepyPMs,not_removed,i switched from the witch skin for this its that sweet actually i hate how the witch skin looks with the gold weapon tbh
creepyPMs,not_removed,and after the sex he can assure her that when he is in shape she wont be as disappointed with his performance
creepyPMs,not_removed,okay im just gonna ask s means sarcasm right
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is terribly familiar was this posted here once
creepyPMs,not_removed,isnt that pretty much what youd expect from a bunch of ultradesperate virgin dudes
creepyPMs,not_removed,i always use voice chat its essential to winning and usually people arent too horrible plus as a support main i really need to coordinate with my team
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats why i dont play comp anymore it sucks to miss out on that thanks though its nice to know there are more cool people out there
creepyPMs,not_removed,its funny most people love that im a support main but i get a couple every once in a while who just hate the fact that i only play mercy and say i dont know anything when i try to correct their positioning bitch i see the entire field i know youre out of position reaper is not a ranged character
creepyPMs,not_removed,i call people by their characters gender unless told otherwise
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly i think its her best skin im loving the new mercy one also and meis of course
creepyPMs,not_removed,we are the lifeblood of the team
creepyPMs,not_removed,that makes it worse eurgh
creepyPMs,not_removed,may the drops be ever in your favor
creepyPMs,not_removed,same im maining zarya this season and i use her original skin because i just really dont like any of the others the summer skins were pretty decent but of course i didnt get those in time
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats the best thing to do
creepyPMs,not_removed,its meh
creepyPMs,not_removed,ikr its amazing
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah the gold broom isnt great
creepyPMs,not_removed,nope s
creepyPMs,not_removed,it basically means end of sarcasm s
creepyPMs,not_removed,its pasta so probably at one point or another
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean yeah but overwatch has players i think the ultradesperate virgins are a minority
creepyPMs,not_removed,i started tank maining third season and the difference in voice chat is staggering nobody wants to stand behind my shield unless i yell at them
creepyPMs,not_removed,agreed my favourite by far though i am wondering when tracers getting a scary and baby skin though given the theme for her epics agreed on mercy and meis i am stuck with mercy on whether i prefer golden or amber both are quite lovely i think golden might have it though i think they have been knocking the skins out of the park in general the one person whose skins i am kinda disappointed in are actually lucios hes such a great character and im just not in love with any of his skins
creepyPMs,not_removed,rule please message us in mod mail if youd like to discuss this further
creepyPMs,not_removed,what youre doing it hurts me
creepyPMs,not_removed,is your comment sarcastic
creepyPMs,not_removed,but there are still more than enough of them than neccessary
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like his frog ones but yeah he doesnt have any spectacular skins which is disappointing i hope they give him some really good ones soon
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes s
creepyPMs,not_removed,samer heres hoping cheers for the chat have fun in ow
creepyPMs,not_removed,somebody please just tell me whats going on
creepyPMs,not_removed,i still have to print off directions from mapquest and hand write any deviations i plan to take so poorly
creepyPMs,not_removed,terribly i do not follow directions i give them and my directions will not be disobeyed or ignored under any circumstances now leave me alone never contact me again understood is what i would have said hope he didnt reply
creepyPMs,not_removed,wtf thats not at all what michesonmorley concluded
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow and racist too what a guy s
creepyPMs,not_removed,for those too lazy to search
creepyPMs,not_removed,are you asian please tell me youre asian
creepyPMs,not_removed,please censor our identifying information such as display pictures
creepyPMs,not_removed,you didnt block out his picture
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol all that rattling in and it seems like he didnt even read the thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,it sorta does but only with general relativity in mind the earth is stationary from its own perspective as in standing on earth you cant prove that its earth thats moving relative to other things or them moving relative to earth the earth is the center of the universe just like every other point in space
creepyPMs,not_removed,the talk page for the article is fantastic its full of conspiracy nutjobs calling the article biased for pointing out that the experiment gave a negative result and that there is no magical lightpropagating aether wind
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is why im so reluctant to use online dating services dealing with this stuff seems soexhausting
creepyPMs,not_removed,why is it so hard for people to grip the fact that asexual doesnt mean you dont feel love or any other emotion towards your partner bebop boop i dont want sex therefore i must be a hard unfeeling robot sigh
creepyPMs,not_removed,touchee
creepyPMs,not_removed,so ive been asexual this whole time and i didnt know it o guess i just learned something about myself haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,til being married isnt a deterrent to people who want sex from you you gave perfect responses op
creepyPMs,not_removed,people gotta learn that being asexual is just another kind of sexuality although you shouldnt say that sex isnt important to daily life to some it is just the same way it isnt to you the other end of the scale deserves just as much consideration
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep being asexual takes you off the market waaaaaay more than saying you arent interested because youre married s what the hell i dont understand what he was trying to say
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey op im a ace girl too and i totally feel your pain here ug
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think its because people mistake lust for love way too much
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think its because its not talked aboutdiscussed alot im not giving the creepypushy dude any slack im just saying i got genuinly interested myself in learning more about it not saying its unaturalweirdstrange or we but its strange for me in the same sense running a marathon might seem strange for someone who doesn like runningtraining
creepyPMs,not_removed,you got that right ive had at least different guys still try to get into my metaphorical pants despite telling them im married basically nothing can deter a stupid desperate horny guy also thank you ♥
creepyPMs,not_removed,creep to english translation youre suuuurrre youre not even a little interested in my dick not even a little butbut its magic really youre serious oh well then you have just lost all value as a human being of course i do not feel this way im just attempting to translate
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats a good point honestly
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is some next lvl crazy pants white knighting i cant believe he kissed you you should never speak to this creep again he was trying to use your rape as a way into your heart that is one of the craziest things ive ever read you are completely right to be angry and to never speak to him again im sorry he is related to a good friend wow
creepyPMs,not_removed,okay first of all you are way too nice you need to try to stop worrying about how everyone else feels about your life and prioritize your own mental health for once what god did was beyond psychotic no stable or ethical person would even think of doing that in a thousand years the fact that he kissed you against your will just puts the nail in the psychostalker coffin nupeper is completely right he was trying to use your rape as a way of manipulating you into loving him hes gaslighting you hardcore none of this is your fault you cant blame yourself i know im just an internet random but ive seen this shit in my own experience multiple times before and im actually worried for you please please cut of all contact with him and if at all possible never talk to him again abusers will try anything they can to worm their way back into your life and gain power over you the best possible thing is to cut them off completely
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey tried to use stolen knowledge of a seriously traumatic event and discuss it with you anonymously in order to steal your heart please tell me this guy is a teenager who doesnt know how society works yet dont let it be an adult
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow what an asshole trying to corner you into talking about an attack so he can be a white knight and sweep you off your feet thats incredibly low best keep away from him
creepyPMs,not_removed,i get your situation a lot honestly i was raped by a guy i temporarily half assed dated and never told anyone not even my best friend which is the person that introduced me to him im keeping it buried because of how much of a shit storm it would cause and for me its been over years now and i am actually over it dont need the guy to be in jail or anything especially because i know how his life is going and all i can say is karma is a bitch and real with that said i get what youre going through about not wanting him to tell his sister which is your friend since she does know now i say cut him off tell him this is over and done he pulled some serious creepy shit and also kissing you without your permission is creepy and rapey in its self tell him your friendship with his sister will continue but anything between the two of you is done its one thing to be a caring friend but to hit that stalker territory and be crazy enough to pull this stunt on you is something you would never accept from a stranger so why should you accept this from him why should you put up with this shit at all i assume from whats been said you hold no feelings for him the way he does for you so tell him to either get over his obsession and maybe try to hold a mutual acquaintance relationship with him or just be completely cut off and reported for any future stalkerish behavior what he did was completely wrong apparently you would have been fine with him just talking to you about it normally like any normal human being would have done but no he already said he thought this over and for some crazy reason thought this would have been appropriate in his head which should give you a lot of insight into how his brain is working his brain is obviously not working right and you should not allow any of this to continue
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is mindfucking im sorry what happened to you and i really would love to know how this plays out respectfully your best friends brother sounds like a closet psychopath in a way and in light way he just sounds too caring and overwhelming ninja edit please please please take care of yourself good luck on everything youre taking care of and whether he had good intentions or not he clearly fucked up
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am so sorry that you went through this im all honesty and maybe he didnt do this consciously it seems as though he was certainly trying to manipulate you hes loved you for years and finally when he saw a weak point he went for it thats not the kind of person who actually cares for you i know youre empathising with him because he seems to say that his ultimate intention was to make sure youre okay but thats not true his intentions were to prey on you and thats not okay i really hope youre able to keep having a supporting friendship with your friend but never ever let your guard down with this guy he will and has taken any chance that he could find to get closer to you no matter how much that could hurt you best of luck with everything thats going to happen in the future
creepyPMs,not_removed,seems like hes kinda gas lighting you really trying to fuck with your head youre probably best off just cutting things off with him for the most part
creepyPMs,not_removed,reading that actually made my heart race i felt anxiety and the desperation to not seem out of control when faced with a frightening situation the mind fucking and stalker behaviour was distressing to read let alone experience you really held your head together despite the sickening psychological battle of wits and emotional turmoil being forced upon you the disgusting way he tried to panic you with personal information location activities was so difficult to read i felt utterly sick for you on the reveal that this was a good friends brother who was obsessed over you and used a traumatic experience to manipulate you it is encouraging and a relief to hear that your friend despite discovering these messages were from her own brother still offered her support and outrage that is a very good friend indeed and shows just how much she cares for you you should not feel guilty for any of this when he brought it on himself to act this way i can only imagine he thought you were enjoying the back and forth with the intelligent back and forth this is obviously a delusional thought brought on by his obsession perhaps maybe he thought upon revealing himself ypu would laugh it off though who here is qualified to really break apart his aims for acting so creepy and unhinged perhaps he has watch too many movies like shades of grey that show a man stalking a woman and still getting the girl despite questionable actions lets be clear that he saw an opportunity of vulnerability listening in and took advantage of you by manipulating your feelings in a very predatory manner you should not feel guilty or any negative thoughts because he is at fault for this very big mistake even if it is out of character to you i can see this is indeed a very complicated situation to deal with your friend is rightly so shocked and disgusted in his behaviour and will no doubt express that you have had to face him and he somehow decided to attempt to kiss you in a misguided attempt to seduce it was incredibly desperate for him to try and kiss you knowing your no doubt betrayed and hurt angry feelings towards him again i blame movies for men kissing women when in a rage of anger to dissolve the heated argument only for the woman to slap him half hearted and finally succumb and submit to the kiss you could argue he is a foolish hopeless romantic at heart or a predator who tried to non consensually force a kiss and assault a woman dealing already with distraught emotions from a horrendous rape in the past somehow amidst all this turmoil and distress you are dealing with conflicting emotions and still managing to look at it objectively i assume you do not wish to alienate your friend by cutting out her brother thus creating an awkward situation every time you see him i suggest arranging to sit down with your friend and her brother to discuss rationally and controlled what happened openly saying you do not want to feel you cannot come over to her house because her brother is there discuss in detail exactly how it made you feel being emotionally played and state clearly that it was not alright ask your friend to support you at this meeting by saying you want to understand why he did it and want to get past the ordeal i imagine she is embarrassed and would not want the awkward situation to continue and will be open to dealing with it like adults give him chance to explain his actions and discuss together with his sister why it was inappropriate and set clear boundaries bring up the kiss and state how it made you feel and what you want your relationship to be with him ie platonic this will hopefully help him your friend and you all move on from this experience in a healthy way print out the interaction and make notes to refer to so you can keep your thoughts organized when communicating with him together you can all come to a conclusion and get past this difficult phase you could suggest he seek therapy for the obsessive stalking behaviour if you feel he needs it if this solution does not work you can go to his parents with your sister from a concerned stand point to discuss what occurred and ask for their help in dealing with it as a last resort a final note i am so sorry you have had to deal with being raped let alone knowing he is in town this is i appreciate extremely upsetting and i imagine distracting when you have to focussed on work i know in the uk you can report rape even years later as i did i understand that you may not wish to go down that path which is your perogative it is important for you to feel safe however even by carrying a rape alarm or pepper spray to feel more in control no one should have to go through what you have
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read this and after the first two pages i would have said fuck off and blocked them if i am talking to a person in person or digital if i do not feel comfortable after calling a boundary and giving them a chance they get period ive saved myself a lot of selfdrama doubt worry plus if its someone i have no idea whos contacting me ill read over it maybe ask them to identify depends if its pointing towards work or home or more likely delete i try to be fair but if its hitting my eew creepy wtf squick zone its gone man thats really creepy and youre not changing your tune im blocking you bye trying to spare other peoples feelings doesnt always work its because you have to spend a lot of time thinking how can i not have them see this they will get upset uses a lot of brain space and power many times thats something they already know about andor have to deal with no matter what dont actively hide it and dont lie about it do not hesitate about blocking someone and you may want to report it to his school thats very unethical and him being in med school i might skip this but if this continues bring it up
creepyPMs,not_removed,sociopaths are always charming and i would take any empathy you think he feels or felt at this point with a grain of salt i do believe he thinks he is in love with you but i also believe that his actions prove he lives in a very unstable reality and that can create a false sense of outcome this makes him potentially dangerous in ways you may not expect please be very careful with people like this as soon as they make you feel guilty for them or flip and action on you youre on their line without even knowing it im sorry this happened to you this world is filled with many ugly people
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit reading this and trying to put myself on ops shoes was disgusting i can only hope to imagine the emotional distress youre going through however op just know you have absolutely blame in all of this so dont fall for anyone trying to guilt trip you into thinking as much
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy hell it keeps going sees load more images edit holy shit i got through with it and he strung you along for a while claims to be your friend but thats a creepy way of trying to be there for you
creepyPMs,not_removed,why are all your friends going to a party with black anyway
creepyPMs,not_removed,not catch kill the wish he was fishing for from the start was i wish black was dead id stay away from the guy if i were you i suspect hes a bit unbalanced edit im very sorry that happened to you btw and that youre being reminded of it and everything that sucks and you dont deserve any of it
creepyPMs,not_removed,woooow wtf it just kept getting worse the longer i read that is seriously fucked up
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow i feel invasive reading this like ive seen something about personal about you that i cant take back its weird like i wanted it to turn out okay but i knew it couldnt since it was here i cant believe god would do this it honestly sounded like a perfect fictional situation like a fucking romance novel which i know its not then he ruined it for you by bringing up that guy its horrible i dont know its disturbing you should be careful hugs op if you want them life is strange
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit this is by far one of the craziest conversations ive ever read i dont really have any great advice to give or anything i just wanted to say that i hope everything turns out okay everything that god was saying seemed like the ramblings of an insane asylum escapee to me so to put up with all of that after what black did honestly takes a lot of strength whether you realize it or not i hope all of this makes you a stronger person best of luck dealing with the aftermath
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit man
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive never experienced anything like this and have no place giving you advice just know that im sorry you and your best friend have to deal with all of it because you two shouldnt have to your best friends brother has put you in a place where there is no good solution he has also placed his sister in an impossible position of being in the middle of her best friend and her brother i would not be surprised if your best friend forgave him shes somewhat genetically obligated to but that doesnt mean you have to and i hope you dont
creepyPMs,not_removed,its really too bad he didnt approach you like a person if he really wanted to be helpful that would have been a legitimate way of going about it i too can be overly trusting and empathizing so naturally when i finished reading this i felt somewhat bad for him contextual edit im not trying to downplay ops victimization here just that his desperation is sad and although i would have never approached this situation the way he did i have longed for the love of another before nothing changes the fact that at best he did this in very poor taste and maybe he really is a horrible person that doesnt deserve any empathy in the end its only for you to decide im sorry this happened to you and i hope things work out for the best edit im aware that what i originally said is probably unpopular to most of you ive reread a good bit of the conversation and realize how weird and disturbed it actually is i dont know the guy so i was giving him the benefit of the doubt but clearly his behavior has underlying implications that i didnt pick up on the first time through ive never been a victim of abuse or baiting or anything else this sub stands against so i guess i was a bit naive about it lastly after reading through everyone elses advice and comments it became clear how manipulative he was being its a sad world we live in why are people so fucked
creepyPMs,not_removed,well that was a trip
creepyPMs,not_removed,so this thread ended a week ago op how are you doing now it appears that dark green was infatuated with you heard about your personal hardship and was enraged wanted you to invite him back into your life and instead of being an adult concocted some juvenile scheme that spiraled into the absurd that about right i found this entire story fascinating but not nearly as interesting as your responses so just hoping for an update hope that things are getting better op
creepyPMs,not_removed,why are you both typing like this is some meta horror movie is this promotional material for scream
creepyPMs,not_removed,it seems to me a complete outsider so grains of salt are warranted i guess like youre a really caring person that makes up excuses for peoples shitty behaviour in a weird and twisted way you get what he was doing though in no way does that make it alright the end does not justify the means i get that obviously these people arent just random strangers in your life and things are a lot more complicated than that and surely trying to rationalize things like i seem to be accusing you of is not something to blame you for but as an outsider its really easy to say hang on no fuck that guy what the fuck
creepyPMs,not_removed,so what your saying is he tried to help you with a traumatic experience he was in no way equipped or qualified to handle in some sort of crazy attempt to be a white knight while playing with your emotions then sexually assaulted you himself kissing without a persons consent is considered sexual assault where im from i know im an outsider but this guy deserves so much worse than what he is getting that he pulled this whole stunt and clearly thought it was going to go differently and that it would actually help you shows that hes delusional and doesnt know you as well as he thinks he does you have every right to be furious with him please dont feel guilty hes the one that royally fucked up and has to pay the consequences for his actions i hope it all works out for you and that you stay close friends with green it sounds to me like shes got your back again i know im an outsider but you dont have to do anything you dont want to you dont owe anyone an explanation no matter who they are if you ever want to report your rapist without anyone knowing you can do so anonymously if you live in the us i dont know about other countries
creepyPMs,not_removed,i couldnt quite place what i was feeling while i read the texts until your comment came and it clicked panic i felt so much fucking anxiety throughout the whole thing holy shit i am legitimately shaken right now
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol genetically obligated to my ass just cause theyre family doesnt mean they have to always love and forgive each other what god did was an asshole thing and if they werent family i doubt youd be telling op that green might forgive him
creepyPMs,not_removed,no just ditch him and tell him to fuck off hes being a shitter and has no right to you easy
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly i think he really does care but went about it in a really stupid waythats my impression from reading all this everyone makes mistakes i mean you made fun of teens who self harm and made fun of middle eastern minorities who are upset at losing one of their few bits of representation everyone makes mistakes no one is perfect it seems like he was trying and he seemed to be getting encouragement from you and then he messed up and it really doesnt seem like he intended to hurt you though i dont think you should be friends with him anymorenot because hes an evil manipulator but because if hes in love with you and you really cant ever feel the same way the friendship would only be harmful for both of you in the long run at this point it can never again be a healthy friendship so i would say to split amicably
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh crap i cant even find the right gif for my feelings about this bit of information right now seriously dark green god how can you be this level of dumbrudejerky and what a selfish redacted salty language seriously i cant think of the worst things to call him he is supposedly that close to you and did this omg i want to smack him with some justicekarmasmelly fish i am so very sorry you went through this with everything really you seem like such a cool person you truly didnt need all this you know whats strange op i was thoroughly enjoying the chat log yeah it was creepy and i totally thought he would crack in a stereotypical way and i was laughing and intrigued right alongside youtill thereveal sigh
creepyPMs,not_removed,im really glad that youve found support here
creepyPMs,not_removed,it hasnt as ive said ive moved on but here is something for you to think about you cant control her brother you have no apart of how he became the way he currently is obviously your friend who is his sister sounds like she has her mind together her brother does not and that isnt your fault or anyone elses he is unfortunately that way and has fixated his self onto you that is not your fault that isnt ever going to be your fault think about it this way now that his sister knows she can try to help him or get him some help because he mentally is not okay he wouldnt have did what he did and he wouldnt be stalking you getting into your business and causing you mental anguish none of that again is your fault he has to own up to his problems and try to get them fixed hopefully now that his sister knows she can try to get the problem solved you arent making her choose between you and him if anything youre forcing him to make a choice to get help for his issues or to cause such a problem that he will have to get cut off i highly doubt his sister would be okay at all with any of this if she is as much as a best friend to you that you have been saying she wouldnt cut you off because her brother has issues again you need to see that he is that way not because of you but because he has problems he needs to get fixed if he wasnt doing this to you currently in this time he would have been doing it to some other poor girl
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive read some of the comments as well as your update and i really think youve done nothing wrong and reacted very reasonably props to you for having an incredibly level head
creepyPMs,not_removed,im glad youre strong and you can and will get through all of this
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah that should have been immediately obvious in retrospect apologies
creepyPMs,not_removed,think about it as a wish grant its not in his power to get the guy arrested he doesnt have a time machine what do you think he was offering im not saying he really would have done it but in his fantasy of finally dramatically revealing himself as your stalker what makes him all heroic and shiny having been an adolescent guy thank god i grew up not everyone does its a pretty typical damsel rescue fantasy kill the bad man and shes so grateful she cant resist jumping into bed with you juvenile but pretty common its just a guess but i think its a good one edit just outta curiosity you know if hes a game of thrones fan did you see the few episodes where arya stark made friends with the assassin and kept feeding him names thats the stuff of teenage male fantasy right there
creepyPMs,not_removed,not op but he wanted you to bring it up and talk about it with him so he couldve tried to essentially prey upon those traumatic emotions to sweep you off your feet
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is why i said somewhat genetically obligated and that i would not be surprised if it happened of course green does not have to many wouldnt but i know in my case i would not be able to stay mad at my siblings i would be angry and hurt over this but eventually i would forgive i was the youngest so they kind of help raise and guide me through my most formative years so while we argued and fought at times overall it was a strong relationship im predisposed to see the best in them even if thats not always accurate i dont believe im unusual in this a large percentage are just like me thats why i was just giving op some heads up i did not say green should forgive him just that she could and that if that was to happen op shouldnt let it affect her opinion of this guy some people just read what they want to read and then jump on it
creepyPMs,not_removed,awesome glad to hear i agree with so many people that are telling you to protect yourself physically emotionally and socially but it takes a special person to see the good in people benefit of a doubt its a fine line and basic decency is something worth believing in and expecting of people hope things go your way op
creepyPMs,not_removed,he is the one who ruined relationships if you had to withhold the information that he was harassing you in order to preserve relationships how would that be on you he wanted to reveal everything because he knew you would eventually and he wanted to come out looking better by admitting he fucked up even though his concern came from his affection towards you it is incredibly obvious at no point did he actually think what can i do that would best support and respect her instead he was acting in a way that satiated how he felt about this knowledge when you find out something terrible happened to an old best friend your dont take this as an opportunity to try and woo themsneak in your feelings about them to give him that benefit of the doubt when he over heard you guys it brought up those feelings and an urge to be involved with you to care for you but not on your terms to just support you but on his to fuel his love fantasy he was trying to be your savior and didnt care how you felt about this he was too wrapped up in his own complexes right now you should take actions that best serve your interests especially your level of comfort and safety there is no being a coward in this situation take care of yourself because you deserve it dont put that effort into undeserving assholes also i really dont want to chide you since you are obviously the victim here but i just want to advise you to exercise more caution in the future because often stalkers can start out charming and will intentionally withhold information to keep your interest if it starts to dwell that is often when they become upset and feel entitled to your attention additionally this is not your fault but a sad fact of todays society and law enforcement but they would likely not take it very seriously if you reported it and they saw you calling the person charming repeatedly and seemingly enjoying the attention this is in a theoretical situation where it escalated to this point this isnt fair and shouldnt be your burden to always be defensive in these situations but its hard to get help if you arent i just want to reiterate i dont think you did anything to deserve this and i am not engaging in any victim blaming just commentating on how society at large views these things as unfortunate as it is im sorry this happened to you he is a jerk and doesnt deserve your time or thoughts and im really happy your best friend is defending you shes a good one keep her around
creepyPMs,not_removed,have you talked about this specifically to green at all she sounds like a really understanding and supportive friend and i think she would be able to dispel at least some of the worries youre having about the what ifs worst case scenario is that she has nothing to add and even then you still get to talk to her about not having to feel guilty this is straying into more specific advice which i generally try avoid giving mostly because like i said im a complete outsider and i dont know any of you there are about a billion things that could make specific advice useless had i known about those things and i dont want to frustrate you by suggesting useless advice getting the ugh you dont understand feeling is terrible and having to explain relationships between people that have spanned a decade is literally impossible which is quite frustrating my disclaimers are getting longer than my original post ill stop typing now v
creepyPMs,not_removed,if youre just going to be a troll you can leave now
creepyPMs,not_removed,then you need to make the decision right now to talk to her honestly being so closely affiliated to someone so close to you is probably part of why he chose to live with her and dont accept excuses from her either i know that hurts to hear but if she cares about an abuser more than you after you show her all of this then you deserve so much better edit also you shouldnt have to go through all this but if you stay strong itll damage him to lose control i really hope for the best for you
creepyPMs,not_removed,every time i read a new comment this gets crazier he has a girlfriend so theres yet another person wronged in this whole mess if you happened to accept his declaration of love his girlfriend gets crushed now that you didnt he either stays with her while really loving you which is a slap in her face or he breaks up with her which is the right thing to do but again a slap in the face this person may mean well but has no regard for other peoples feelings and does things so reckless he just harms everyone he should be caring about
creepyPMs,not_removed,just be careful of the guy somebody who thinks in simplistic and juvenile terms like that maybe wouldnt have done anything but when his fantasies go sour hes very likely to lash out like a little kid who needs a nap only doing grownupsized damage and hell feel like the morally outraged victim while he does it or so my armchair wag runs and might all be completely off base as i dont even know the guy just going by a small writing sample and some second hand info anyone who picks god as a pseudonym though has some kind of issues that are likely to be unpleasant for those around them
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know about dealing with but he wanted to get you to bring it up probably to create some sort of trustintimacy between you two but going about in the worst possible way the tone of the conversation goes from banter to serious when he finally brings black up after trying to get his name out of you with leading questions it read to me like at that point he just got frustrated with your not bringing him up and revealed his hand i think his ultimate plan was to essentially play white knight but either way he was definitely preying upon your vulnerability im not an expert but the last part of that sentence is what im sure of
creepyPMs,not_removed,have you ever talked to a professional not a police officer but a therapist he was right that i wanted a thrill with the backtalkingastalker thing obviously i dont know you or your situation considering what i do know youve been through though this looks like a potential red flag that could endanger you in the future have you seen true detective by any chance
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wish you the best
creepyPMs,not_removed,seriously the mods here are top notch top gd notch
creepyPMs,not_removed,aw thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,awesome thanks for making my job easier have a good one
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think you should consider a therapist maybe a school counselor if you dont have access to one this could be a way out of the situation as well perhaps you could suggest to god that he see a therapist as well to address the conversation even if he doesnt believe he needs one which i think most people in this thread would agree he does he seemed eager to move passed the issue so you can tell him you need him to do it for your own peace of mind if he really does want to fix things hell do it if he doesnt its another sign for both you and his sister than you need to be far away from him

creepyPMs,not_removed,drugs or not he is still an asshole
creepyPMs,not_removed,something similar happened to me random guy messages me calling me babe and whatnot politely asked him to stop immediately he resorts to calling me a meth addicted whore who makes all women look bad incredible
creepyPMs,not_removed,its called being kind mate try it at a job interview then dummy im sure thatd go over well
creepyPMs,not_removed,he just didnt know where to go when you didnt ask him why he was sad that was his in and when you just pushed it aside he got lost bet you do drugs yeah im sure that is the only reasonable conclusion as to why i dont want you calling me babes
creepyPMs,not_removed,calm down mate s
creepyPMs,not_removed,mm thats when you call him something weird likeself fellationer and claim surprise when he doesnt appreciate the acrobatic compliment
creepyPMs,not_removed,theyre literally so fragile that simply telling them to stop after they call you beautifulsexybabeetc sends them into insulting you lol these guys are so pathetic

creepyPMs,not_removed,lol translation is wrong its a famous turkish folk song means roughly id die for your rivers turkey no harms intended
creepyPMs,not_removed,someone translate and tell me what it means
creepyPMs,not_removed,im just gonna go with some sort of scam
creepyPMs,not_removed,probly so she could take a screenshot of op saying that and threaten to post it online
creepyPMs,not_removed,either that or some kind of messed up prank
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats a possibility too
creepyPMs,not_removed,tell them to hmu if they like this cock send me a link to where u post it ho lee wew weeeee sorry i needed a bit i was dazzled for a second there because i swore this guy just wrote hes insecure about his penis that he just cant stop flashing around on snap chat then had a freakout it was going to be posted on a forum before asking if anyone liked it to hit him up no one could possibly be this much of a ding dong how silly of me to oh
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think we need a new subreddit with unsolicited dick pics lol i dont want anyone to see my cock tough shit im posting it to runsoliciteddickpics oh my gods it already exists
creepyPMs,not_removed,flawless logic what to do when someone doesnt reply send a dick pic
creepyPMs,not_removed,talking about his dick being small asking you to elaborate on how you will shame him sounds like he is pushing his humiliation fetish on you op
creepyPMs,not_removed,what advice was he hoping for are you a dermatologist specializing in wangs some sort of reproductive expert a doctor of the penis a dicktor
creepyPMs,not_removed,your response is hilarious thanks for not linking the video
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive seen this sort of conversation here several times the guy gets off on being humiliated and having the picture shown around and begging you not to do it its manipulative and gross but it amused me how he was clearly losing the thread of his personal enjoyment when you said itd be blurred
creepyPMs,not_removed,tell them to hit me up i mean seriously wtf
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cant stop laughing tell them to hmu if they like this cock if you gotta go down go down hard i guess
creepyPMs,not_removed,literally the most dense person ever holy shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,atleast we got a fun read thanks for sharing
creepyPMs,not_removed,is my dick too small for ur standards
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah fuck literally every time what is wrong with them
creepyPMs,not_removed,wtf this is hilarious
creepyPMs,not_removed,when people say no dick pics ill send a picture of dick van dyke or dick cheney
creepyPMs,not_removed,so if you dont respond they send dick pics now
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should have told him tough shit when he said not to post the pick of his dick online if you dont want your dick posted online dont send dick picks
creepyPMs,not_removed,he has a fetish his protests were of the reverse psychology persuasion he desperately wanted op to post his dick
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i should not have been surprised at that part
creepyPMs,not_removed,it does but its private you have to be invited
creepyPMs,not_removed,this excites me i am so freaking going to subscribe
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had an ex who used to harass me and send me dicknaked pictures when i wouldnt respond to his texts he said he did it because its the only thing that would provoke a response from me even if it was a negative one i still dont get it
creepyPMs,not_removed,he didnt want advice he wanted op to respond in any way possible i honestly think he enjoyed the angered response
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you and youre welcome i didnt add the pictures either lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats what he wanted

creepyPMs,not_removed,we dont support witch hunts here for a variety of reasons
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats harassment not cool to do
creepyPMs,not_removed,im glad i didnt post his actual dick then
creepyPMs,not_removed,daaaamn it
creepyPMs,not_removed,ironically the only way to get an invite is to send mods a dick pic
creepyPMs,not_removed,how ironic
creepyPMs,not_removed,at least cats do it out of the goodness of their heart since they are either trying to teach you how to hunt or they want to show you their loyalty this guys intentions are less pure
creepyPMs,not_removed,low selfesteem a heavily paraphrased quote from stoker you my not be responsible for who you became but that doesnt mean i have to accept you as you are
creepyPMs,not_removed,unsolicited dick pics are such a slap in the face i need a shower after that exchange
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats my favorite part that you didnt upload the dick pics i noticed that happily as i proceeded through the screenshots of the conversation
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah well i was completely wrong yikes
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats fair im not advocating to dox the dude i just dont think they deserve to be shielded they are the criminal but youre right that shit can get nasty
creepyPMs,not_removed,funnily enough they do it because they pity our lack of hunting skills
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit i am stealing that quote i have a friend who has a brother who has some sort of mentalemotionalbehavioral deficiency aspergers maybe or autism light and hes always trying to touch everyones legs even after theyve said not to and explained why it isnt appropriate in the first place and is just plain wrong after someones said not to touch them ive got another acquaintance that is bipolar or borderline personality i dont recall which who ive cut out of my life because shes consistently unpleasant to be around my wife and i got some flack from a few folks who felt like we were assholes for not putting up with these people we resorted to the argument that having a mental disorder isnt mutually exclusive from being an asshole and my rights start at the exact same place at all times regardless of who im dealing with or how difficult a time they have ascertaining where my rights begin i think this is another great way of thinking about it none of us are solely responsible for how we turn out but that doesnt mean anyone else is wrong for not wanting to deal with it
creepyPMs,not_removed,pun intended
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre very welcome
creepyPMs,not_removed,alleged key word
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah theres a lot of them out there with a humiliation fetish to boot which to be honest it felt like this guy was trying to fulfill with his oh no please dont post my pictures for some reason it just felt off to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,true true i want in if anyone is in
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah its like the whole oh he only did that cos of x or hes been through y while i completely empathise and appreciate how hard life is for him that doesnt make his behaviour acceptable mainly works for people who are dicks but were raised that way no theyre not responsible for how they were raised but if they are high functioning they should have the cognitive awareness to realise they behave differently to others and should assess whether people appreciate their behaviour or not people always say stuff like i am who i am i dont change for anyone if you dont like you can x fine goodbye then you parasite refusal to grow will be met with refusal to socialise end of story
creepyPMs,not_removed,didnt even think of that sounds fair
creepyPMs,not_removed,best part he referred to himself in a different message as a nice guy and a dom im making gobacktokinkschool a thing now
creepyPMs,not_removed,good lorx
creepyPMs,not_removed,most guys message you something dumb once or twice but im going to message you something dumb times
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly posting screenshots from dating sites is starting to feel like lowhanging fruit i dont even know what to say to this guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,good lorx this guys is persistent
creepyPMs,not_removed,halt in the name of the lorx
creepyPMs,not_removed,make america great again lorx
creepyPMs,not_removed,persistence is totally sexy and totally doesnt make people uncomfortable totally
creepyPMs,not_removed,persistence is a virtue when looking for a job to an extent not when looking for a partner that guy needs a thesaurus almost as much as he needs a thorough talking to about taking no for an answer
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive read desperation tak is not a good thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,clearly trying to type lorax you need great persistence when speaking with trees
creepyPMs,not_removed,you dont have to say anything hell persist anyways
creepyPMs,not_removed,he just needs to persist more because persistence persists his persistence
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly the less op says the more he knows shes the one for him and hell get her in the end bc patience is always rewarded meanwhile id like to smack him on the head with a x
creepyPMs,not_removed,nobody wants to get to know you or be your friend if that was the case you wouldnt need to be on here um dude you know youre on that site as well right
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont understand why people get so angry and mean over a no
creepyPMs,not_removed,update looks like his paid account has been deactivated i may or may not have reported him
creepyPMs,not_removed,i do love how he tries to preempt the whole if im as hideous and youre suddenly insisting why message me in the first place logic yeah dude still not very convincing
creepyPMs,not_removed,good lawd the butthurt is strong with that one
creepyPMs,not_removed,jurassic woman the hero we need
creepyPMs,not_removed,so hes calling himself a dumb idiot right with the whole first idiot dumb enough to get involved with you line and the whole no luck on a normal dating site so you come here starved for attention also seems veeeery specific to apply to you and not him
creepyPMs,not_removed,well for what its worth i liked what the lady had to say it was pretty good honest and straightforward
creepyPMs,not_removed,the first idiot dumb enough to get involved with you you mean like you you dumb idiot
creepyPMs,not_removed,we have a winner folks
creepyPMs,not_removed,but hes here just for the fuckings he obviously has a normal dating life where you approach people randomly on the street wait what he might even be in a relationship right now his motivation to be on the same site is clearly not desperation as he claims the ops is despite op laying out a fantastic list of foundations to build any relationship on even just fuck buddies lets get that straight just here for extracurricular nondesperate fuckings move along
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats my favorite when theyre all you must be a loserfatuglyetc if youre on this siteap im just on it as a joke or something i totally bang models all the time i just dont feel like it right now okay
creepyPMs,not_removed,because not enough parents say no to their kids
creepyPMs,not_removed,because if its the fault of the person who says no to them if not what else would be it their fault should they look at themselves but thats scaaaaarrryyy
creepyPMs,not_removed,luke the butt hurt is with you strawman wars
creepyPMs,not_removed,right tldr butthurt
creepyPMs,not_removed,why thank you big fat jurassic cow kisses to you
creepyPMs,not_removed,right i dont know how i resisted his charms s
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah silly me
creepyPMs,not_removed,these guys tend to care more about selfgratification than selfreflection lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,definitely let the one get away
creepyPMs,not_removed,far out i just found myself falling into satirically role playing this stereotype to respond to you i think it can be good commentary but then i feel like its so hard to convey the intent and context is so huge i wont deny theres a bitter jadedness but i also find it humourous at the apparent lack of awareness the fact that this is something ive been party to for over fifteen years and can so easily emulate disturbs yet doesnt surprise me it makes me think i could really do the catfish thing impersonate a lot of men i know
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think i got most of what the first guy wanted to do probably too much time on reddit optional question whats dp of dvp
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think there was a typo or replacing of makes more sense want some double penetration or double vaginal penetration
creepyPMs,not_removed,huh seems like a logistical nightmare
creepyPMs,not_removed,too much time on the internet has made me extremely jaded and now this seems like a polite interaction to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,reminds me of this dude at the bar youre gonna be a great mom isnt the smooth pickup line you think it is he backtracked so hard when i told him i dont want kids also i was like
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am surprised he didnt try to change your mind or tell you how horrible and selfish you are for not wanting children s
creepyPMs,not_removed,cool how fast that shut them up btw childfree life is awesome congrats on your sterilization
creepyPMs,not_removed,i agree children are walking petri dishes
creepyPMs,not_removed,i laughed out loud at your cause children are the worst
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes fuck children
creepyPMs,not_removed,i blocked him after
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you tag this as s does that mean you werent actually surprised
creepyPMs,not_removed,or maybe dont
creepyPMs,not_removed,plz dont
creepyPMs,not_removed,to preface i get a bit of attention from guys on this app but im a straight guy i put in my bio if youre a dude dont bother messaging me while this might seem a bit harsh youd be surprised how many guys have messaged me with something along the lines of are u interested in trying something different which is very creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should exhume his ugly ass
creepyPMs,not_removed,look at that overreaction this is like the text version of you throwing a paper ball at him and then him shooting you in the face
creepyPMs,not_removed,english is hard
creepyPMs,not_removed,the fact he knows the word exhume even exists is quite baffling to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,does this person even english
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wonder if he truly thinks the word is exhume lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,so hes going to exhume a bone from your ass or something isnt that just a fancy way of saying pull out
creepyPMs,not_removed,no rebury him whatever thats calledreinter
creepyPMs,not_removed,deleted
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is a thing in the us
creepyPMs,not_removed,no creeping in the comments please
creepyPMs,not_removed,in the discworld series the assassins guild refer to fulfilling a contract as inhuming
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes good word
creepyPMs,not_removed,it can be if youd like it to eyebrow waggle
creepyPMs,not_removed,use an s to indicate sarcasm in the future please there are too many people on reddit who unironically say this stuff that it makes it easier for us to discern thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,ill say it again i am intensely fed up with all these fake pushy creeper doms go back to dom school edit and furthermore did this person seriously imply only people on television are harmed by strangers does he ever read the news
creepyPMs,not_removed,being a domsub is all about control and trust when will these creepers learn that you will never find a healthy or interesting relationship by repeatedly trying to break what little trust exists between strangers they need to think for a moment how a dom person would act they would not latch on to a single person and try to force them into having sex with them doms treat their subs right
creepyPMs,not_removed,damned right i wish we had a sub specifically called domschool where we posted stuff like this for people who come here or it could be kinkschool we could post information as correct as we can find and our own stories demonstrating the aspects of kink that do have a right way because much of practicing kink is about doing things ones own way but there are still certain things no one should do like ignore boundaries or force consentor do the things people on cpms do hm
creepyPMs,not_removed,there are deader subs than that ill form it after work
creepyPMs,not_removed,i could make it now and add you as a mod since i am not at work
creepyPMs,not_removed,also im a guy bbl rinsing sour cunt fathers dead so i guess thats taken care of
creepyPMs,not_removed,its like a random insult generator struck out on its own
creepyPMs,not_removed,why would someone reply to a comment via pm anyway unless the person says pm me stick to the thread
creepyPMs,not_removed,you said something to me first so i was forced to reply dumb dumb now im replying to you but dont you dare reply back i get the last word damnit
creepyPMs,not_removed,that doesnt even make sense
creepyPMs,not_removed,peopledo this wtf is wrong with that person
creepyPMs,not_removed,someone doesnt like not getting in the last word
creepyPMs,not_removed,dumb dumb jesus
creepyPMs,not_removed,well his insult just caved
creepyPMs,not_removed,they want to say something insanely stupid but dont want downvotes and public backlash
creepyPMs,not_removed,probably all he has
creepyPMs,not_removed,most likely just this

creepyPMs,not_removed,in case anyone is curious today my father and i witnessed a girl who couldnt have been more than years old being beaten by her pimp it was really awful to witness but i cant imagine what she was feeling the guy was so frightening that i was scared he would have attacked me and my father if he saw me pull out my cell phone to call the cops i quickly wheeled my dad to my car got him in and called the cops as we were driving away the guy who sent me this message is someone i dated years ago
creepyPMs,not_removed,your ex really sad story on the news tonight someone got shot reminds me of penetration amirite i have to ask was this dude off when you dated him too as far as you could tell
creepyPMs,not_removed,oo thank god youre not dating that guy anymore if women getting beaten by a pimp equates to kinky sex in his mind
creepyPMs,not_removed,the emoji that people slap on the end of their sentences really blow me away that one is saying hes thinking really hard about how terrible it is but cant hey over the fact that the thought of a woman being physically abused is a real turn on and he just had to share it with you someone whos already said how terrible it is whats the end game that you coyly smilein emoji of course tell him you think the exact same thing and then its on just so gross ive been on this subreddit for a few weeks now and i just dont get it
creepyPMs,not_removed,woooww i am a submissive and if any man dom or not told me that the thought of seeing a woman being beaten by someone who obviously wont let her leave the sex industry reminds him of fuckingi would freak the hell out on them thats rapey as hell
creepyPMs,not_removed,top game
creepyPMs,not_removed,peak game
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not super familiar with the bdsm community but im pretty sure there is a huge difference between kinky sex and being a sex worker whos beaten by their pimp consent its a thing poor woman though i hope she is okay and im glad this guy is your ex
creepyPMs,not_removed,sex trafficking is a terrible problem and with prostitution illegal theres no way out im sorry you witnessed it its a nightmare
creepyPMs,not_removed,as far as i could tell when we were dating he was totally normal we had a few small quirks because i am a black atheist and he is mormon his religion became an issue which is ultimately why i decided to stop talking to him but even with that i didnt see a huge issue which is why we remained friends i am usually very good at picking up on certain issues mentally especially because that is what my degree is in and that is mostly what i do in my career he and i have been friends for a long while and have had brief and cordial conversations this really caught me off guard
creepyPMs,not_removed,id given evens on him claiming that prostitutes are subhuman and thus it wasnt like a real person was being beaten
creepyPMs,not_removed,new to this subreddit as well not understanding any of these people
creepyPMs,not_removed,nailed it doesnt matter how fuckin nasty you are theres gotta be at least underlying consent even if its role play rape you have to have agreement that it is in fact consensual
creepyPMs,not_removed,eeyup even with real bdsm there is consent and alot of times there are limts and safewords if something is wrong how you can have anything other then angersadness over seeingtalking about a poor girl being beaten and forced as a sex worker is beyond me hell im angry thispimp was beating the girl and was nowhere near this situation
creepyPMs,not_removed,there is a huge difference indeed
creepyPMs,not_removed,we had a few small quirks because i am a black atheist and he is mormon that does sound like it could be a hiccup but jfc who messages someone that its such a huge leap
creepyPMs,not_removed,idk if this is a patternand i hate to stereotype but my friend has this colleague who grew up mormon and he has a huge problem with being sexual harassing and generally inappropriate at work turning every sentence in work meetings with overall females to have horrifying sexual innuendo i knew someone who grew up mormon with the same tendencies i have to make the relation that growing up kind of sheltered leads to overstimulation and sexual craving as an adult im making assumptions obviously but ive seen this so frequently to greater extremes
creepyPMs,not_removed,awww i miss trivia crack lol but that was funny
creepyPMs,not_removed,you might want to censor out the slur in the post there on another note so even after you pointed out you were a guy he wanted sex huh
creepyPMs,not_removed,just do a couple of photos next time just makes it a bit easier to read is all
creepyPMs,not_removed,missed his name in one line
creepyPMs,not_removed,its just a prank bro
creepyPMs,not_removed,no
creepyPMs,not_removed,ok
creepyPMs,not_removed,the backpedal is strong with that one and the usage of lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i admire your grace i would have called him out on his bullshit so hard that all his future boners would be accompanied by the sensation of shame and defeat
creepyPMs,not_removed,while laughing during an uncomfortable conversation is a normal speech pattern it never translates into chat well and just comes of gross
creepyPMs,not_removed,manipulation check gaslighting you thought i wanted you to cheat haha how silly check utter and total bullshit sympathy check yep it appears we have a fucking creep on our hands
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol and haha are the diffusers of the internet people use them to buffer any possible negative reaction people might have to something their saying because theyre not serious after all they were laughing so its supposed to be lighthearted s in my experience if youre chatting with someone who says haha and lol excessively in their communications youre probably in for some insecure questions and indecent proposals
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,he says hes a good guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,op you just turned down a nice guy who wants you to cheat instead of those assholes who want you to oh
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly when they get all frowny and sad that is emotional manipulation and abuse right there
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was pretty entertained when he said that my not wanting to cheat was just an opinion lol i guess i was too harsh on him because he just wanted to know my opinion lol maybe i should agree to start over with him lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i try my best to give most guys the benefit of the doubt because im just nice like that i guess but man this guy has no class at all i wish i could be a fierce lady like you xd
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah my laughing was me feeling awkward and i guess he took it as yeah shes totally into this and his laughing was just too much hahaha lol haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love it when people try to gaslight you when the text is literally one screen up lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i absolutely hate the youre gay lemme show you this dick despite stereotypes not all gaybi people are sluts
creepyPMs,not_removed,im bi just because i want to see both types of genitals doesnt mean i want to see all genitals
creepyPMs,not_removed,its more of a im a guy and im attracted to you let me show you this dick seems irrelevant to sexuality
creepyPMs,not_removed,im in the same boat like yes im bi im also interested in dicks in general but not your dick in particular
creepyPMs,not_removed,thaaank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly im actually quite fussy about dicks
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah you cant just give me any old dick im a connoisseur of cock only the finest of penises will suffice
creepyPMs,not_removed,sometimes i want to see some kind of violent roleplay response to that but they might get off on it
creepyPMs,not_removed,wanna sit on my face with a pillow and smother you till you asphyxiate yes
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is one of the kinder ones on this board how sad
creepyPMs,not_removed,and then she suddenly climbed atop the ladder down below he called out wwhy wont you sit on my face in a tone of despair but she smiled and said who said i wont and jumped down on the bed where he was lying her rear forward batsch and thus her pelvis broke and he got a new face
creepyPMs,not_removed,can confirm this is a fetish for some
creepyPMs,not_removed,removed for violating rule
creepyPMs,not_removed,i did i just didnt see the notification for his message until like days later and planned to respond im pretty swamped with school this past week and was busy all weekend and i didnt see the notification so i had to manually go into the app to see
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,and so the creepypms god desses saw fit to grant my humble request i should have known some kindnsoul would oblige im now trying not to laugh because i have a cousin asleep nearby and its
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah diversity xd
creepyPMs,not_removed,makes sense tinder notifications never popped up for me either
creepyPMs,not_removed,last time i checked i turned out to be male edit yup still male
creepyPMs,not_removed,regardless i dont think i have to explain myself to you and thats kind of distracting from the point that some man i had never said a word to asked me to sit on his face
creepyPMs,not_removed,then youre covered presumably by the god half though i identify as ftm and as far as checking ones anatomy goes mine disagrees with the male part so i try not to make assumptions about others
creepyPMs,not_removed,edit biologically i seem to be male or something can i pass as neutral
creepyPMs,not_removed,dunno do you identify as neutral edit im not taking the piss im serious
creepyPMs,not_removed,i always wanted to be a battleship does that qualify as neutral alright lets stop before i miss the line between amusing and offending sorry if i did so
creepyPMs,not_removed,only if youre something like the uss kiddand good idea
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry im out isnt that what youre supposed to say you were way nicer and more reasonable than he deserved i would have blocked him edit i feel bad for his girlfriend
creepyPMs,not_removed,i didnt expect you to be comfortable with this really soooo you knew you were being a crude and insensitive jerk and you went along with it anyways real winner here
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus christ i literally never need to know that anyone anywhere is jacking off to a picture of me
creepyPMs,not_removed,his girlfriend deserves to know about this id want to know if i was her
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is similar to a litmus test for racist jokes if you preface a joke with im not racist but then its racist if you have to preface anything with i may sound like a creep but then shut the fuck up come on guys do better
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont expect you to be then why the fuck did you send all that stuff you disgusting creep oh yeah because you get off on the idea of having forced her to at least read your drivel vile and pathetic
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy fucking shit were you polite i honestly dont know if i would have had the capacity to even id have probably exploded all up in his face and told his girlfriend put that motherfucker on blast its a shame that women are raised and trained to be polite even when men are being totally disgusting and rude im trying to unlearn that behavior by being just as aggressive back to them aka a raging bitch lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,another one whos seen too much porn women do exist who like taking one to the face but they are a small minority the suggestion that youre fantasizing about that is not going to be considered a compliment in of cases
creepyPMs,not_removed,hmm i seem to be failing in thus sexual advance what is something every girl likes that can get me back on the right side of things cum in the face
creepyPMs,not_removed,can somebody explain to me why he even said it at all seeing that this guy knows this isnt an appropriate thing to say if he truly thought he was an awful person he would just keep this quiet
creepyPMs,not_removed,well atleast they know they are an awful person
creepyPMs,not_removed,whatever happened to a straight forward i cant stop thinking about you
creepyPMs,not_removed,as trite as it sounds oprah once said something that truly resonated with me she said to always listen when someone tells you what they are he was right hes an awful person my ex boyfriend was right hes a terrible asshole too they say that because in the right situation it draws a person in to help them show how they arent terrible or awful but nope they invariably really are
creepyPMs,not_removed,god damn that penultimate message i guess the dude figured there was no point leaving any money on the table but seriously wtf person literally just got done telling you in a much nicer way than you deserved they arent down with any of that way to take a very inappropriate but forgivable situation and crank it right up to irredeemable douchenozzle
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly he could have salvaged it just up until those two last texts ugh kid you coulda saved yourself but then you just dug yourself deeper into a pit good for you girl for being such a generous person
creepyPMs,not_removed,sometimes i wonder if some of these creepers are suffering from undiagnosed brain tumors that can actually explain a radical change in behavior and i dunno maybe that explanation helps me have a little more faith in humanity
creepyPMs,not_removed,well i mean you have to respect the self awareness for creepy selfawareness for being disloyal and fucking weird
creepyPMs,not_removed,the lack of selfcontrol is utterly baffling that parting line about coming on your face why i cannot understand it on any level
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow you gave him such a polite meaningful response and what does he do he continues to say abhorrent things ive read lots of posts on here but this one really bothers me because its so freaking disrespectful
creepyPMs,not_removed,damn you were really cool about it too he had to hit you with that one last line at that point id say messaging this to the gf is a good thing to do but also understandable not wanting to be involved in that type of drama
creepyPMs,not_removed,heh
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes you are a horrible person you piece of shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,sadly the fact you tried to be nice seemed to encourage him which reflects on him not you hes clearly an asshole
creepyPMs,not_removed,creepers remorse apparently it wont keep you off the rcreepy pm
creepyPMs,not_removed,he really was a horrible person sometimes the creep is right
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a manipulative shitstain
creepyPMs,not_removed,you were incredibly understanding he overstayed his welcome
creepyPMs,not_removed,you must be a hell of a singer lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was probably doing it as he was talking to you
creepyPMs,not_removed,well he gave up on it op
creepyPMs,not_removed,i get the distinct feeling that this guy gets off on being insulted and humiliated i could almost taste his disappointment when you didnt take his bait and tell him he was an awful person
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just want to know why guys think its hot to cum on a girls face
creepyPMs,not_removed,right i shoulda blocked right off the bat
creepyPMs,not_removed,mic drop
creepyPMs,not_removed,i agree after his last comment he blocked me instantly and since i didnt know his girlfriend i couldnt find her to tell her
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah hindsight is i was raised old order mennonite and was taught to stay in my place its definitely a work in progress for me to get out of that damn box
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think they think it will get them women i think these types of dudes get off on spewing vulgarity and then running away its like a power thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,he gets off on the fact that hes being inappropriate and violating her boundaries its gross
creepyPMs,not_removed,cos hes an asshole
creepyPMs,not_removed,he probably has low self asteem andor is self loathing but is so apathetic to her feelings that he sends her this not caring at all how she feels
creepyPMs,not_removed,except he gets off on it he likes saying gross things that make op uncomfortable and overstepping obvious boundaries
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really believed at the time that if i was nice he would just apologize and go away he had been a pretty decent friend until that point obviously i was way wrong and his last two lines prove i had the wrong idea about him from the getgo
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah it seems like he was saying bad things about himself to get you to tell him he wasnt im bad please tell me im not
creepyPMs,not_removed,you act however you like he was guilttripping you to keep talking to him if he really knew he shouldnt say that stuff he wouldnt it was super emotionally manipulative in my opinion fuck that guy you keep doing you op
creepyPMs,not_removed,your post was removed for violating rule dont creep in comments
creepyPMs,not_removed,i doubt thats a coincidence
creepyPMs,not_removed,you could always log out of facebookuse someone elses to go to his profile and find her
creepyPMs,not_removed,you poor dear dont worry youll get there men give us plenty of opportunities to fight back lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah he straight told her he knew what he was doing was wrong and unwelcome and then kept doing it anyway
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats my take on it maybe at the very beginning he thought he had a chance but the minute someone says no it turns from hope to powerdomination
creepyPMs,not_removed,good idea i didnt think about that im going to try this thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you do let us know the results
creepyPMs,not_removed,good luck if i was dating this guy id definitely want to know before i wasted more time with him
creepyPMs,not_removed,le feminism amirite guys
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think the down votes is largely due to it sounding like you thought this was typical behavior of the feminist movement instead of calling out the individual it sounded like you were calling out an entire movement
creepyPMs,not_removed,why do people get so angry at other folks choices that have literally no effect on them
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont spend time with these kind of people except the part where creep seeks them out to speak to them on purpose
creepyPMs,not_removed,wtf as someone who isnt a fan of kids either and isnt sure if she ever wants to have kids this attitude seriously pisses me the fuck off that and gee at you reeeeeeally need to find yourself a nice man and settle down before its too late not everyone likes kids just like not everyone loves animals would this idiot seriously rather see couples pushing out baby after baby just because
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow what a judgmental jerk im right with you on being child free op we get this kind of thing pretty often as well this guy was one of the worst ive seen
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think people who gets this worked up at child free couples are mad because they have kids and think they shattered their dreams and hates the fact that you have limitless options in comparison in reality this is a very over populated world resources are getting very limited and having one or no kids is a very responsible decision the fact that nowadays two parents need to work to support a family of three or more is enough indication that was unthinkable for our grandparents when only grandpa brought bread to a family of five or eight
creepyPMs,not_removed,i get the feeling this is a man from another country where women are there to have children they are married young and main reason is to have children to honour the family the passing of the family name and have as many children as possible the way he spoke seemed like someone who english is not their first language the shock of your lifestyle being so different culturally to his was what he found difficult to comprehend i have experienced men from the middle east freaking out because i am female with no children before i was married they would get irrate over me not being married yet it is often the diversity in cultural backgrounds and life experience contrast that seems so hard for these people to understand do not take it personally instead consider even he was from the usa or uk he may not have been born in the country and his values and beliefs may be drastically different
creepyPMs,not_removed,some guy on there preached to me about how children were so great and i told him i literally couldnt have any kids which i cant due to medical reasons and he just went on like im sure god wants you to have a child so you will get one i dont think thats how it works
creepyPMs,not_removed,so basically he feels a womans soul purpose in life is to birth what a tool i wonder if he would still feel that way if he had the organs to carry a child not that im saying thats the only reason to not have a child just wonder if his mind would change on that fact alone
creepyPMs,not_removed,high five for choosing to be child free
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cant believe its even still a thing that people judge you like that for not wanting kids ive never wanted them im now and i actually know more couples and single people my age and older who dont have and dont want kids i dont understand this child free isnt real life as he put it personally my life would be ruined if i had a kid i like my life i dont want to spend it looking after someone else aside from furbabies of course
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont like children either and im pretty sure im not gonna have any i didnt know you had to keep an eye out for rude judgemental people in the process this decision literally doesnt affect anyone other that the people deciding it fuck talking about going out of your way to tell people how to live and then get salty when they dont want to listen to your dumbass rambling live life however the fuck you want
creepyPMs,not_removed,everyone agrees the earth is overpopulated with people so why are so many people judgmental of a decision not to have kids im and never want kids either
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh man assholes like this sure as shit make me even less inclined to have kids already cf anyway
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am raging at this why do people treat you like a social pariah if youre a woman who doesnt like kids im single no kids and like it that way but most people genuinely do not believe me how hard is it to believe that i dont need other people or to procreate to be happy unlike you im undecided as to whether i ever want kids but am really happy as i am right now so thanks for voicing what is the opinion of many other happy adults
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am constantly surprised people can summon up the energy to have such emotions from the actions of people they do not know will never meet whose actions will never effect them at all likeyou dont have to have an opinion on others peoples lives i honestly could not care less if a person decides they do not want to have kids this is information which even if it was a close friend oir relation is not going to effect me but for this guy its his crusade or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think the part that pissed me off the most was his assumption with the relationship with my folks more than anything oh and suggesting there was something medically wrong with me its an insult to me and an insult to people who want children but cant have their own biologically
creepyPMs,not_removed,literally yes youre not normal if you dont have kids i only know that because im and people feel its their business to let me know how bizarre my life choices are
creepyPMs,not_removed,i can relate im almost and i dont want to have kids either everyone is always like oh youre gonna change your mind anyways that is so annoying
creepyPMs,not_removed,i honestly dont mind children at all especially the children of people i love and care about hell i write for childrens television i just dont want them lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,this so much
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think people who gets this worked up at child free couples are mad because they have kids and think they shattered their dreams and hates the fact that you have limitless options in comparison which isnt even true for many people having kids are part of their dreams you can take your kids with you and include them in almost anything we travel camp hike kayak rock climb and everything else with our kids you dont have to sit at home all day just because you have a kid and any company that doesnt value families probably doesnt value their employees either i wouldnt want to work for a place like that in reality this is a very over populated world resources are getting very limited and having one or no kids is a very responsible decision i absolutely agree with this it was part of the discussion i had when we started talking about kids the fact that nowadays two parents need to work to support a family of three or more is enough indication the only issue weve run in to here wife stays at home with the kids is the cost of health insurance it goes up every year along with deductibles while benefits go down if the us would adopt universal healthcare like the rest of the modern world it would help millions of families that work for small businesses or own their own business the only expense larger than our health insurance is our mortgage
creepyPMs,not_removed,probably i notice people of certain esl backgrounds that live where im at tend to have a cultural barrier
creepyPMs,not_removed,sole purpose because this guy lacks a soul
creepyPMs,not_removed,i didnt know you had to keep an eye out for rude judgemental people in the process oh you have no idea you get judged if you choose to have no kids you get judged if you choose have one and no more because youre somehow punishing your one child by not giving himher a sibling you get questioned if you have two kids of the same gender because youre totally going to try for the other gender right but if you have one of each gender people will be slightly confused if you even hint that you might want a third you start to get alarming looks if you have three because people are worried that you might have another just to even out the numbers and four is kind of lot and if you have four kids people seem pretty adamant that you should stop no more you better not get knocked up with a fifth because thats just irresponsible and dont you know what causes that
creepyPMs,not_removed,im happy that youre happy
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment has been removed in accordance with httpiimgurcomvkforaspng httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,let me try to follow creeps logic if you love your parents you will love having children if you hate your parents you will hate children so no one who had a bad childhood has children and that is a reason in creeps mind that some people are cf but then everyone wants at least one kid so no one is cf yeah i give up
creepyPMs,not_removed,normal but not as common as wanting kids id say
creepyPMs,not_removed,it really is i dont know exactly what i want yet but people seem to think they have a better idea than i do and just assume ill want kids eventually id rather have animals than kids lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think uxplosm is talking about you people who honestly wanted to have children and are in fact living a healthy and balanced life because of it youre not going around telling child free people they also should be having children because everyone wants children theyre talking about those who probably couldnt bother to wrap it up has a prolife stance caved into pressure and honestly just never wanted children to begin with because they didnt want kids they have no clue how to be functioning adults and their own people without the identity of being a parent so when they see a childfree person they get mad because theyre miserable and assume that we arent some of us are still miserable just it has nothing to do with our lack of crotch spawn
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my fuck i didnt know it was that bad damn people are fucking crazy just live your life as you want to god damn
creepyPMs,not_removed,my poor cousin was one of these people i feel like in a three years time she spent of it pregnant she really wasnt aware how fertile you are after giving birth i suppose it wasnt that people were bugging her to stop having children she was damn tired of being pregnant after the forth one she had her iud inserted but once she was was pregnant with her third people were really giving her looks
creepyPMs,not_removed,billion people on earth i think that goes without saying
creepyPMs,not_removed,does this person have zero concept of private informationpersonal
creepyPMs,not_removed,few things piss me off more than someone trying to shame or grief someone else or insist theyre more mature because they havent had sex im sorry you had to deal with this twatwaffle op your decisions are your own and they should be respected
creepyPMs,not_removed,the most amazing part is no matter how disrespectful he got you continued to be very respectful polite and responsive i applaud you you are definitely a better person than me
creepyPMs,not_removed,probably jerking off that entire conversation
creepyPMs,not_removed,only the utmost in immature people insist theyre mature if youre mature you dont need to tell people
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah that shit brought back my own creepy memory from when i was like or and on aol im old some guy imd me asl then started creeping on me he asked if i ever masturbated basically gave me instructions and told me to try it i was just sorta creeped out logged off and went to bed next day i sign into aol and immediately this creep imd me and asked if i masturbated last night my fucking older stepbrother was standing right behind me and started questioning me about it i was embarrassed as hell
creepyPMs,not_removed,its just easier to never answer the are you a virgin question nothing good comes from it its only acceptable from doctors and thats it
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks sad to say that im kinda used to this now
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks i didnt want to play his game and i hoped hed change topic but at the end i just had to ignore him
creepyPMs,not_removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
creepyPMs,not_removed,i knew it was going to be a stupid question when he started with his age i expected can i see ur boobs
creepyPMs,not_removed,awweee soon he will be asking you to wire him money swoon
creepyPMs,not_removed,he tried so hard to keep that train on the rail good work
creepyPMs,not_removed,i guess you could say it was this guys destiny to get shot down ill just let myself out
creepyPMs,not_removed,several centuries old most guardians are did some new lore come out year to confirm this i remember there being speculation about it but the game never really confirmed it i always just assumed that even if guardians have the ability to live for centuries they probably dont because of how dangerous their lifestyle is
creepyPMs,not_removed,guy completely disregarding your comments i hate that
creepyPMs,not_removed,i loved how you made him crota op by far the most annoying boss in the game i would totally date eris btw
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like a thorn in your side he mida had a chance in another timeline but you got the last word
creepyPMs,not_removed,that was glorious
creepyPMs,not_removed,speak for yourself on the courting me and the speaker are dating id tell you how but i dont have time to explain why i dont have time to explain
creepyPMs,not_removed,tell him to send black spindel pics make him earn it
creepyPMs,not_removed,off topic hows the playerbase in destiny right now i played this at launch but stopped before the first paid patch
creepyPMs,not_removed,ayyyyy im a female who plays destiny too theyre thirsty as fuuuuckkk on that game not everyone but the ones who are are so awkward
creepyPMs,not_removed,im so late to this but figured id share i play runescape pretty regularly and get my fair share of creepypms on there most recently i had a guy ask what are you doing and i said woodcutting hbu then he said no irl no reply from me he said tell me what you look like i replied describing my avatar in great lengthy detail spanning over messages he replied no irl and then proceeded to tell me i wasnt a real girl unless i could prove it on snapchat hang in there op 💕
creepyPMs,not_removed,old raid name for crota is scrota dont know if its a community thing or just a small group suits this nut sack well
creepyPMs,not_removed,that guy had some big cabals
creepyPMs,not_removed,i used to love destiny before kings fall anyways i feel like that expansion messed up everything i liked about the game it was disappointing
creepyPMs,not_removed,crota isnt that creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is so good
creepyPMs,not_removed,very clever what app is that
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should crosspost to rgirlgamers
creepyPMs,not_removed,loving the crota mask and also nathan fillion as theres no competition
creepyPMs,not_removed,ditto like if someone keeps replying over and over becoming visibly upset or frustrated and asks what they can do about such harassment i can understand something like uhjust block them but i wasnt upset by this guy lol just trying to get him to grasp the point oh well
creepyPMs,not_removed,we do know that the human lifespan tripled after the traveler arrived we also know that many of the npcs the vanguards saladin etc are centuries old i agree about guardians leading risky lives but theyre only in real danger if they lose their ghosts
creepyPMs,not_removed,eris is badass her cayde and variks are my top
creepyPMs,not_removed,puns are bad icebreakers bruh
creepyPMs,not_removed,so the ultimate question is the speaker human exo vex
creepyPMs,not_removed,going pretty strong sites like destinylfg and rfireteams make it easy to find groups
creepyPMs,not_removed,im super lucky i play with randoms several times a week and its very rare that anyone gives me grief for being a chick not everyone has the same experience as me of course but destinys community strikes me teehee as being very nontoxic
creepyPMs,not_removed,so fucking dense xd holy shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,take my upmote and leave
creepyPMs,not_removed,really i always loved destiny but i loved it even more after ttk the raid was my favorite and i like how eris was so integral to the story shes one of my favorite characters
creepyPMs,not_removed,say hi its pretty awful tbh
creepyPMs,not_removed,i might to that when i get home from visiting my extended family
creepyPMs,not_removed,the guy puts so much personality into every character he plays its like magic
creepyPMs,not_removed,i kinda envy you because when you go on a fantasy gaming site you can slay actual trolls lol p
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just kinda took for granted that the tripled lifespan thing ended with the traveler going dormant but i guess i had no real reason to believe that not like that medical science would just disappear i didnt know about the ancient vanguards didnt cayde take over as hunter vanguard just a few years before the events of the game i really liked the destiny lore but their refusal to put dates on anything was so frustrating edit it looks like youre right at least about saladin though it says hes one of the original iron lords and they predate the city
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i was thinking the same thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,i ketch your drift on that
creepyPMs,not_removed,vex obviously or an exo double agent
creepyPMs,not_removed,cool im still thinking if i should wait for destiny before coming back though ill probably try to finish for now happy new year
creepyPMs,not_removed,i never even got to that raid even though i solod and sherpad crota for ages before ttk i didnt like all the changes to the game dynamics it made it made me feel like the hundreds of hours i had already poured in were totally pointless i still have the game it just broke my little hunter heart to see all that work go up in flames
creepyPMs,not_removed,i agree im really hoping bungie expand on the whole thing i had a total mancrush on him throughout the taken king i was just waiting for someone to draw him on the destiny subreddit so i could have it commissioned for the man cave
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah even in one of the new cutscenes he talks about how they thought they were immortal didnt even know guardians could die etc etc
creepyPMs,not_removed,im with you i want some dates so i can know for sure how old some characters are its hard to know anything for sure most game lore is speculation it seems
creepyPMs,not_removed,gjallarhorn did i do that right
creepyPMs,not_removed,aw fair enough
creepyPMs,not_removed,its aimed more at chatting than dating but its a terrible app i dont recommend it at all
creepyPMs,not_removed,id check out sketchmob ive commissioned two pieces so far one of me and one of my warlock main you can find great art for any budget i cant recommend it more
creepyPMs,not_removed,it took some patience and time but yes thatll do
creepyPMs,not_removed,cool will give it a whirl thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,id give you the names of the artists that did work for me but im mobileonly for the next few days and dont have their info on me i believe one of them went by realea or something similar regardless im sure youll find someone you like that site is the only one i ever ordered a commission through and ive been very happy
creepyPMs,not_removed,when you get less mobile would you mind firing down the artist you used ive had a browse but would take suggestions
creepyPMs,not_removed,absolutely i head home tomorrow ill be happy to send you links when im able
creepyPMs,not_removed,and httpssketchmobcomuserprofileraelea best of luck
creepyPMs,not_removed,just to give some background he got drunk at a party stormed out angry when he saw me with a guy ive never shown any romantic interest in him after the parties asked to take picture of me asked me out and then sent me all this crap after i didnt respond
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats just beyond weird and out there
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes toooootally not interested in you relationship wise hes just obviously and inappropriately jealous when you hang out with other guys like any other normal manchild s
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes old enough to drink because those messages sound like a wrote them
creepyPMs,not_removed,woooooowwww some people just cant figure out how to be cool is he just a nice guy or is he a neckbeard
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep shocking i know hes
creepyPMs,not_removed,all that sodium cant be good for his heart
creepyPMs,not_removed,so much salt he could stop ny from having any snow on the ground
creepyPMs,not_removed,that instant turnaround on his part how dare she reject me ill call her fat thatll show her
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cant believe you said that fucking brutal

creepyPMs,not_removed,hes hitting on you because all the women his own age wont give him the time of day pretty sad
creepyPMs,not_removed,seen haha best part
creepyPMs,not_removed,not for a man his age
creepyPMs,not_removed,so much salt i could use his face to flavour my fries
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont remind me
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive been a member of this sub for years and i fucking love seeing how savage ops are getting these days as compared to no thanksblock not that theres anything wrong with that or with doing nothing not responding
creepyPMs,not_removed,meetme its relatively trashy and full of old creeps and younger girls with kids daddy issues source i have the app
creepyPMs,not_removed,his priorities are askew buying treadmills for other people when he needs the cardio himself
creepyPMs,not_removed,for a year
creepyPMs,not_removed,he hit back with another youre fat after that and i hit back twice as hard but he blocked me before i could screenshot
creepyPMs,not_removed,ye i think its great too didnt mean it to be bad just to clarify not that you thought so
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe thats how it is where you live but where i live its relatively trashy and full of old creeps and younger girls with kids daddy issues
creepyPMs,not_removed,so which catagory do you fall under
creepyPMs,not_removed,all of the fries
creepyPMs,not_removed,

creepyPMs,not_removed,dads with girly issues
creepyPMs,not_removed,how the fuck does someone take naughty pics of their braces is this some sort of bizarre fetish
creepyPMs,not_removed,mary its likely a man
creepyPMs,not_removed,huh theres a braces fetish iguess theres a fetish for everything
creepyPMs,not_removed,teeth or leg or what can we clarify the braces here op because i cannot grasp naughty teeth ones 😕
creepyPMs,not_removed,now im imaging naughty braces pictures as them not properly cleaning and caring for them mmm baby i got some arugula stuck in there from last nights dinner mmmm
creepyPMs,not_removed,and another opening with my fetish message
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have that its where i do a strip tease and finally end it off taking off my braces both of them my retainer and back brace i have a dislocated jaw and scoliosis its sexy as fuck right
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think its likea surrogate teenager fetish though adults get braces many times its younger generation people that get them before they get too old its probably similar to pigtails or school girl outfits or blowing bubbles with gum that sort of thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,there is yes even that one youre thinking of right now yeah that too
creepyPMs,not_removed,she sent me a picture of her sucking her partners dick without me saying i wanted to see it
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh god ive got so many one lingers popping up in my head oh baby smile and let me see that spinach by your left cuspid thats it baby no ones looking you can just pretend you used the water pick after eating
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol exactly my thought d braces with a whole banquet stuck in them
creepyPMs,not_removed,it was a photo of them sucking some guys dick
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had a professor with braces she had to be about married with kids its not a fetish but she definitely looked cute has nothing to do with anything but she looked cute
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am so glad we dont have those altered reality things from existenz in real life right now
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my god im so sorry op you had to deal with this
creepyPMs,not_removed,was there braces
creepyPMs,not_removed,what the hells wrong with people on what planet would that be ok to ask some random person
creepyPMs,not_removed,somehow earth has become that planet
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was thinking that too like i have a big ass i could probably suffocate him and save other women from having to deal with his shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,oops
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly
creepyPMs,not_removed,well between my legs ive got a laughing gargoyle head i was cursed by a witch i hope that isnt a problem
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wonder if he thinks thats all thats there just a wide gaping hole with nothing around it yikes lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh its a hole alright a black hole thats how my legs stay together
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know its the least of fucknuckles problems but what i am most struck by is that i a cisgender dude in fact have two holes between my legs people usually do not have a cloaca edit ive corrected it in the text of my reply but distended for cisgender is a seriously unfortunate autocorrect in a discussion on orifices ew
creepyPMs,not_removed,photographer quote unquote
creepyPMs,not_removed,am i alone in not caring about the genitalia of the person im interested in dating like if i find them attractive and we get along well and things eventually get intimate im sure between the two of us we can figure something out
creepyPMs,not_removed,wtf
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean technically there are several holes there hell be so happy to hear that
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe shouldve just tagged this misogyny for reducing vaginas to holes you can fuck
creepyPMs,not_removed,flair distended cloaca
creepyPMs,not_removed,guy with camera
creepyPMs,not_removed,you know theres a word for that right pansexual and theres a huge community of them like bruh
creepyPMs,not_removed,that wouldnt really be determined by my gender though like he does care about gender because he only wants to date women which is fine but hes an issue because hes asking what genitals i have which is nothing to do with gender
creepyPMs,not_removed,psst then was right in this context i mean youre right on everything else and fucknuckle needs a proofreader i was mostly just impressed that he actually used then correctly rather than than
creepyPMs,not_removed,not being attracted to one or the other is fine but opening with it in a message and literally asking a complete stranger about their genitals unacceptable i dont care how strong your preference is you dont get to throw basic manners out the window
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh god
creepyPMs,not_removed,im gonna level with you i dont know a great many things
creepyPMs,not_removed,what word should i use instead
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really respect how willing you are to learn and adjust your language when youve found out more thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,that should be a quote on a motivational poster i love it
creepyPMs,not_removed,sex the biological sex but i supposed this person could also be more focused on preop or postop which is a fucked up thing to take into account considering not all trans folk have plans to get operations so theyre not preanything
creepyPMs,not_removed,genitals like am i the only one not bothered by the genitals of the person im interested in dating
creepyPMs,not_removed,deleted
creepyPMs,not_removed,eh in my experience most guys who open like this will segue smoothly into transphobia the moment you make it clear youre not interested and arent going to tell them about your genitals you wont cater to my invasive questions and please my peen well youre a freak of nature etc seen it in here so many times

creepyPMs,not_removed,it goes to
creepyPMs,not_removed,it goes in the garbage
creepyPMs,not_removed,so my family have been fundamentalist christians for about years whereas i am atheist so religion is a pretty loaded subject in our circle my dad was the last to be saved and he has gotten progressively more extreme to the point where my mom and sister seem almost laid back my dad does not have a middle ground it is either one extreme or the other before he was saved he would not be seen or associated with my mom and sister in their christian circles but once he converted he would follow every rule he came by my dad has always had quite an explosive temper so while we were always close with our parents growing up we feared these seemingly random temper tantrums once he came into my room and made some snide comments about my weight and questioned me about my thermostate he kept getting more angry and ended up kicking me out of the house i still have no idea what brought this particular mantrum on i slept around a lot from a young age just so i wouldnt have to go home and literally the moment i turned i was out my relationship with my parents have gotten much better since i dont live with them but my sister hasnt been able to cut the cord she has the conscience of and she has always been my parents doormat they constantly neg her and she has no trust in herself because of it my dads latest fad is that women should have long hair and he is now imposing this on my mom and sister he has a tendency to get word from god just as something is bugging him fx my mom was knitting a lot at one point it made her happy and he got annoyed and conveniently had a dream in which god said she should stop perfect timing right my mom has always been into short hair but she is growing it out so she wont have to listen to his bitching my mom and i dont agree on much and we easily disagree and my dad has been playing the victim with me whenever im around he seems like my mom is whipping him but behind closed doors he is still a tyrant i cant make the changes happen for my sister but i encourage her indenpence daily this particular episode where my dad got so offended by my sisters short hair that he had to leave pisses me off to no end but he actually pulled this shit in front of my son and that i will not accept if you read this far thank you so what do i do i dont want my son to be a misogynist asshole
creepyPMs,not_removed,off topic but the comments on your post are my continuous reminder of how shitty the imgur community is
creepyPMs,not_removed,your dad seems super similar to my dad in some of his characteristics my dad has narcissistic personality disorder and is an absolute tyrant he is absolutely horrid to deal with and trying to bring up any grievance we have with him will bring explosive confrontations and he will not take anything we have said into consideration its gotten to the point where we just deal with it by confiding in each other behind his back as its much less of a hassle in our experience confronting him will do nothing as but give us grief and wont solve any problems so we just leave it and talk to each other instead not saying this is a good way to handle the situation but its how weve survived i recommend this article to pinpoint whether this is how your dad is httpthenarcissisticlifecommyfatherthenarcissistanarcissisticfatherisatyrantandabully and reading up more on narcissistic personality disorder if it does sound like him i also cant recommend the book why does he do that by lundy bancroft enough
creepyPMs,not_removed,what does being saved mean
creepyPMs,not_removed,you have said the keyword good i am happy something is good for you bot
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre welcome obamabotramen
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry it took a few mins to type out i am posting there too but i specifically want this subs advice
creepyPMs,not_removed,its years of constant negging so i understand her pattern is quite set i always try to avoid telling her how to do things in favour of asking questions to get her there on her own shes had an extreme amount of abusive people latch on to her so she thinks its her fault and she is less important than basically anyone my mom has such a strong hold on her that she feels like she has to get approval for every thought she has and my moms initial reaction to anything is negative i keep reminding her that she doesnt have to tell her things if she doenst want to its a hard habit to break
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah theyre pretty dumb
creepyPMs,not_removed,shes and she has been staying with me for a few months moving into her own place today even when shes lived hours away from them they called her every day and stayed on the the phone until the point where theyre just sitting there breathing together she feels guilty if she doesnt spend every waking moment with them even when she lived with me my sons and we see my parents at least once a week they often take him when were writing papers or get home late my son adores them and especially my dad i was initially worried about their religion being an issue but they have been very low key i have several times told them to stop yelling in front of him though they are fundamentalist christians the thing with the veil is that i told my sister to ask him if he would like them to just wear a burka instead it is the most insulting thing i could think of from his perspective so it might make him listen my dad has aliented basically every one they know because he feels the need to impose his religion on them in very intrusive ways no one is good enough and ive told him several times that if he keeps up this behaviour hes gonne be sitting in his righteous ivory tower all alone
creepyPMs,not_removed,im sorry you have to deal with that its such an annoying solution not being able to take it to the source its become kind of like this here as well we just talk to each other about his bad behaviour its fine for me but not when my son gets involved i never thought about it before i found this sub but reading here makes me worried i might have two nparents im definitely going to check out the literature
creepyPMs,not_removed,what christians call it when someone fully becomes a christian accepting christ into their heart and all that junk then they are saved from hell
creepyPMs,not_removed,its their own term for when they see the light and converts completely to crazyanity
creepyPMs,not_removed,you have said the keyword good i am happy something is good for you bot
creepyPMs,not_removed,ooops sorry there o
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah they are im really sorry you have to deal with the bs you deal with on a day to day basis if you ever feel the need to vent to someone feel free to pm me just goes to show that religious fundamentalism in all of its forms is hurtful to those that are forced to confront it and society in general
creepyPMs,not_removed,no problem
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you religion is the worst i realise its the people practicing in these ways that are awful but i hate that they have religion as their disclaimer like that somehow makes their shitty behaviour justified ive had heated discussions with my parents about how the bible is subject to interpretation but according to them normal people havent gotten the code to unlock it i tried arguing that everyone even their saved friends read it differently and thereby interpret what they read but then they just werent really saved you cant win with these people my grandad on my moms side was the awesomest person ever he was nice and positive and easygoing and he was a true believer without having to shove it down anyones throat he accepted other peoples views and kept to his own
creepyPMs,not_removed,my sister has lived away from home for a few years before but that was at a bible school so it was kind of the same crowd im hoping this time it will be better for her since its in a nonreligious setting she is trying to be more independant but she always ends up going back to my parents its more about what my son sees when im not there i want him to think for himself and i agree he will understand more when he gets older but personally i find it problematic conditioning kids into religion i think its something he should be able to decide when hes old enough
creepyPMs,not_removed,your grandad reminds me of my grandmother my moms side of the family isholy to say the least multiple priests and nuns and the like they came over from czechoslovakia before my grandma would i guess be considered a devout catholic but for all the bad things about religion there are some good and it was like all the good got concentrated into her every year shed raise up around to send to a pastor in ghana she even let said pastor stay with her when he was visiting the united states i never heard a hateful thing come out of her mouth the whole time she was alive she despised people who used christianity as a tool for discrimination her reason being that were all gods children and he wouldnt create something that he wanted us to hate im atheistagnostic myself but its people like her that made me feel that there are genuinely good people who want to use their religion to help rather than hurt
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks for your feedback my sister has lived away from home for a few years before but that was at a bible school so it was kind of the same crowd im hoping this time it will be better for her since its in a nonreligious setting she is trying to be more independant but she always ends up going back to my parents and im sure she will keep doing so for a while but hopefully things will start to change over time does she have social contacts who are in other religions or atheistagnostic it also looks like the conversations youre having with her are helping too its more about what my son sees when im not there i want him to think for himself and i agree he will understand more when he gets older but personally i find it problematic conditioning kids into religion i think its something he should be able to decide when hes old enough of course were in complete agreement basically id caution against taking him away from his grandparents because it might cause some friction and end up with you being painted as the bad guy does your dad know about your atheism whats his reaction also apologies for not acknowledging that your parents might be conditioning your son without your knowing if you think that this is going on you might want to have some discussions with him yourself about life the universe and everything id hope that the exposure to both religion and irreligion would be beneficial but of course if you feel this is not the case at his age then get him out of there or i recommend only having supervised visits im completely against religious indoctrination of children but its a sticky issue when you have religious families who want to save the childs soul or whatever
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats exactly like my grandad we prayed with him every time we slept over but it was always just something fun we did together it meant a lot to him and we were never pressured some people can moderate their religious tendencies and theyre awesome but i gotta say i dont know many of those
creepyPMs,not_removed,currently she goes to a normal school with nonreligious young people and she has some good friends there one of them is her new roomie so i really think thatll help her get out from under my parents a little i wont take my son away from my parents they really adore each other and theyve been a huge help since he was born my mom always wanted grandchildren so she was super excited when i got pregnant whereas my dad ignored the news completely for a while until he realised that the bible says every child is a blessing we dont talk about my atheism but we talk about their christianity because i dont have a problem with talking about things i disagree with i avoid certain topics such as homosexuality islam sex since their views on those are pressing all my rage buttons i want my son to know about religion and nonreligion both sides of everything but i dont want him to be influenced by religion early on i hope hell grow up to have an open mind we talk about how my parents sometimes go to church and that they sing and such fortunately my parents werent religous at all when we grew up and i know that had they been the way they are now none of us would ever have gotten out theres so much guilt tripping passive agressive remarks and shaming
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think it has more to do with the person than religion itself your dad from what you describe seems like a control freak religion is just the means that he uses to exert control sorry if that sounded brash but i remember stories my grandmother would tell me about her brother in law and its really similar my great uncle was a priest and was super narcissistic and controlling there was a whole bunch of family drama when my grandfather died as to who got what and what was going to the church and my great uncle was at the center of all the drama and obviously on a macro scale religion gets used as tool for control just pick any time period in the last years and there will be plenty of examples
creepyPMs,not_removed,currently she goes to a normal school with nonreligious young people and she has some good friends there one of them is her new roomie so i really think thatll help her get out from under my parents a little not that i think it matters hugely but do you think your sisters attitude has become more healthy for want of a better way to put it over time the fact she has a roommate is better than moving out alone since presumably the roommate might take note of and mention the ridiculously long phone calls and such shell have a sounding board for her thinking and decisionmaking i just hope they get on well and that your parents dont somehow drive a wedge between them i wont take my son away from my parents they really adore each other and theyve been a huge help since he was born my mom always wanted grandchildren so she was super excited when i got pregnant thats great whereas my dad ignored the news completely for a while until he realised that the bible says every child is a blessing well maybe not so good but at least your dad now presumably has a good relationship with his grandson we dont talk about my atheism but we talk about their christianity because i dont have a problem with talking about things i disagree with im not surprised by this state of affairs given your dads singlemindedness i want my son to know about religion and nonreligion both sides of everything but i dont want him to be influenced by religion early on i hope hell grow up to have an open mind we talk about how my parents sometimes go to church and that they sing and such its great that you have these kinds of dialogues with your son does he go to church with them sorry did you say whether your parents church is as extreme as your dad or is he an outlier within his religious community fortunately my parents werent religous at all when we grew up and i know that had they been the way they are now none of us would ever have gotten out theres so much guilt tripping passive agressive remarks and shaming its such a shame that this is the case more moderate religious influence could be so much more helpful in this scenario i was raised catholic but very liberal eg i was never told that catholicism was the only way to get to heaven i was never told that transubstantiation was literal i knew from an early age that i was an agnostic atheist and was never attacked for that even my defection via httpsenwikipediaorgwikiformalactofdefectionfromthecatholicchurch was met with good humour by my family well it still sounds to me that youre doing everything you can obviously if change occurs with your sister itll probably happen very slowly
creepyPMs,not_removed,no worries i completely agree that he uses religion to control people its often how religion is used generally i feel which is why control freaks and religion is such an explosive combination my dads father was always very stoic old fashioned and never showed emotion then he got cancer and he completely changed he started telling us grandkids what we meant to him everytime we saw him and it was obvious he was trying to make up for things and enjoy the rest of his life my grandparents were the usual churchonchristmas patrons but my parents shamed them into getting properly saved so he would go the right way its disgusting that you can be so entitled
creepyPMs,not_removed,it definitely has both she my mom and my dad started out really extreme they wouldn watch films they used to enjoy talk to people who were beneath them etc my mom and sister has dialed way back and they can now enjoy normal things such as comedies youtube fails etc my dad has gotten more alienated everything offends him people taking selfies fails films with violence cussing sex lying magical elements anything fun my sister recently had another room mate who was also a christian but she did super weird things and was generally a strange person after she lived with me for a while shes loosened up a bit more and this new roomie seems like a really chill person and they get along well im sure my parents will say negative things about the new roomie but i get the feeling my sisters really excited living with her so im hoping she will think twice about the accusations my son hasnt been to church with them yet im not comfortable with the way the manipulate the children there my family only recently rejoined their congregation after having slacked a bit on their demands the church is quite extreme but my dad takes it to a new level he really is singleminded he always has been but never this much every time i see him he has some new aversion his mom actually threw a tantrum on christmas eve because our phamplets with the bethlehem song had disappeared and we didnt know it by heart so she stormed out slithered back in and passive aggressively sang her own song really loudly im wondering if this childish behaviour runs in the family its awesome that your family respects your decision im glad to hear of people who can control themselves when it comes to their belief systems i think i was when i started questioning everything i drove my parents nuts with questions like but if god made everything who made god
creepyPMs,not_removed,shit like this drives me up the wall i wonder if thats how they act in real life
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cant believe you told the nigerian prince to fuck off o
creepyPMs,not_removed,no means you are a good girl ahhh this tells me everything this person is from a culture where men heavy pursue women and do not take no for an answer that it is seen as being good virginal by refusing a man repeatedly because accepting advances straight away is seen as bad this person believes refusing and saying no is just proof you are a good girl innocent virgin and want to be pursued i feel for women in these cultures because the men do not understand that no is not please convince me i am a shy sweet innocent good girl that needs pursuading
creepyPMs,not_removed,i need your permission to be your friend no thank you lol i dont care let me show you this big list of excuses for you to be my friend regardless of your answer
creepyPMs,not_removed,so you a you two maik the frendz yet
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds semi similar to arguments ive had with microsoft when they ring about my viruses
creepyPMs,not_removed,you have my deepest and sincerest condolences as someone who has been dishurted in the past i can only imagine what youre going through the fact that the media offers little to no coverage on us outcasts who have been dishurted is rather unfortunate stay strong sister saynotodishurt
creepyPMs,not_removed,no is good because it means you are good yes is good because it means you are bad in a good way such nobility s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i believe that many of them certainly act like this in their real life interactions towards women in some mens minds a girl who says no is just someone who plays hard to get because apparently not even good or respectable women can resist their charms and the supposed honour of being wooed by such a fine lad
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont ever want to meet someone like this in real life but id really like to be a fly on the wall to see what theyre like
creepyPMs,not_removed,i should not have dishurted him his friendship comes with no fees i missed out s
creepyPMs,not_removed,he does come from a noble familyim not saying hes a prince but hes a prince
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats interesting i guess he missed the part in my profile where im with a year old then 😂
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love you
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh i dislike people except you guys you guys are cool
creepyPMs,not_removed,after all hes from a noble family they show honesty in every relation and they are human being the same as you
creepyPMs,not_removed,his friendship comes with no fees all you have to do is wire us in order to claim a million dollars worth of friendship benefits
creepyPMs,not_removed,most guys dont seem to read profilesif this reddit forum is anything to go by i get messages on a social site asking to marry me despite my profile being plastered in my wedding pictures references to my husband unless of course he thought your child was immaculate conception
creepyPMs,not_removed,every time i get called madame i feel like ive aged fifty years
creepyPMs,not_removed,i can be bisexual too bruh
creepyPMs,not_removed,backstory for the past year this dude has been messaging me with the same thing several emojis and nothing else i simply just delete them all recently he decided to write me an actual message
creepyPMs,not_removed,as for the bi comment why would anybody male or female want to sleep with a creep like that i wouldnt inflict him on any reasonable human being
creepyPMs,not_removed,what is extra nice about madame is that it translates literally to my lady so
creepyPMs,not_removed,as if its a costume he can slip on and off at his leisure how nice for him wish i would have known about these magical costumes when i was struggling to come out over years ago would have saved me from lost friendships and judgment from family members ugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,it evolved
creepyPMs,not_removed,tips fedora
creepyPMs,not_removed,match at least his profile is honest
creepyPMs,not_removed,this made me laugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,this creep is years old its long past time for them to grow the fuck up
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really didnt give a fuck in that moment
creepyPMs,not_removed,whenever a sentence starts with you dare me to on this subreddit i know shits about to get weird
creepyPMs,not_removed,until he figured out you were joking i bet you made that creeps day
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah look hes from florida that explains it
creepyPMs,not_removed,when you try to bluff the creep but he raises and calls
creepyPMs,not_removed,dare him to do it just like on his own time
creepyPMs,not_removed,well this one took a very unexpected turn
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am confused op he asked to be tied up but why do you gag him instead
creepyPMs,not_removed,i double dog dare you to eat your own cum something tells me you dont have to dare this guy to eat his own
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,after that specific message he viewed my profile every minutes for about an hour definitely creep status
creepyPMs,not_removed,my boyfriend was dumbfounded that he was serious
creepyPMs,not_removed,so he shuts the hell up
creepyPMs,not_removed,is that like a dating appwebsite i dont judge but im guessing the boyfriend part was just to throw him off
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh yes its a dating app no the boyfriend mention wasnt a lie im bisexual and like to bring other women into our bedroom sometimes so the easiest way to meet women is through datinghookup apps the real downside to this particular app is you cant block a certain gender from messaging you
creepyPMs,not_removed,ahh i see confusion over
creepyPMs,not_removed,whats this app name
creepyPMs,not_removed,meetme
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,fucking then straight to friendship this dude works backwards
creepyPMs,not_removed,the poo image is just the cherry on top the months between each message is the framework and the fact they want to be friends after not getting a response to fuck somehow i doubt friendship is the focus not sure why just a feeling edit i have a habit of repeating some words it seems
creepyPMs,not_removed,lets have children then have sex then get married then go on a date then we can be friends s
creepyPMs,not_removed,funny enough thats how my closest friendships worked but we actually knew each other prior to the fucking
creepyPMs,not_removed,nbsp i literally glued myself on the phone to read the fine print worth it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i get what you mean by this but i feel like the majority of people have sex before marriage now p
creepyPMs,not_removed,p i suppose that is true but wording it either way can sound normal fine we can get married then have sex s
creepyPMs,not_removed,according to the ops methodology they should have babies before they have sex
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know this sounds all kinds of crazy but the fact is my health has been in decline for some time now im not looking for sympathy mind you ill get by i always do im just pointing out the fact that well ive seen better days to put it mildly but hey who hasnt right anyway wanna see my schmekel
creepyPMs,not_removed,you know whats really sad theres an entire subreddit filled with people who have body dysmorphia aka distorted body images and obsessions about their appearance they downgrade themselves and also famous models obviously they have other issues themselves they want people to rate them objectively but combined with the depressionwhining the whole thing comes across as ridiculous which it is and they dont realize they need serious help one of these guys i spoke with a few days ago actually said i was a liar bc i found him attractive it doesnt matter how many times you tell them the truth they either deny it or become extremely hostile they are very very attached to their persona of being hideously ugly not deserving to pass on their genes and other such nonsense its really really sad
creepyPMs,not_removed,rinsanepeoplefacebook
creepyPMs,not_removed,i got a similar message from a dude asking me if he could send me naked pictures because he was phobic of being nude and it was ruining his life i blocked him on reddit so i dont have the messages anymore but damn dude no i dont want to see your dick
creepyPMs,not_removed,rsadcringe
creepyPMs,not_removed,if he can take care of himself what the hell was the point of this message
creepyPMs,not_removed,you know i kind of feel like this isnt doing wellno idea why
creepyPMs,not_removed,how to write sentences using paragraphs
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i would say not responding is the safest choice in this situation
creepyPMs,not_removed,you won his game then
creepyPMs,not_removed,youve got crazy space money
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats so sad i probably shouldnt be surprised that a sub like that actually exists itd be great if they could get professional help obviously you or me telling them our opinions isnt going to help them get better once you have an identity that helps define you its hard to give that up
creepyPMs,not_removed,its honestly shit you always feel like youre always shit anybody who says otherwise is lying anyone who says nothing agrees even though theyre better off saying nothing when you live with this you either have to admire from afar or you get close and that person begins to see you as ugly not because you are but because you cant stand to be complimented you either shut down or pop off and over time they see you the real true ugly you and its just horrible and tragic
creepyPMs,not_removed,is rrateme the sub you mean didn t really get a weird vibe from there
creepyPMs,not_removed,i come here to laugh at people not feel sad
creepyPMs,not_removed,with an angle like that i think his only option is to take care of himself
creepyPMs,not_removed,my thought was consent to dick pics that or he really isnt fine in which case he wanted me to fix him
creepyPMs,not_removed,account hacked
creepyPMs,not_removed,my thoughts exactly
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre so right about that
creepyPMs,not_removed,have you tried to get help i say this as someone who needs regular help myself for other disorders on that subreddit in the sidebar it says that youre not allowed to recommend therapy one of the youger members told me therapists are just manipulators theres ample evidence that talk therapy will work for this disorder why hasnt anyone in the sub put the pieces together yet genuinely clueless i dont think any enjoys being miserable but i do think that of the incels need professional help and are afraid or too arrogant to get it
creepyPMs,not_removed,no its the incels
creepyPMs,not_removed,im really sorry if it helps the week or so i spent on that sub was emotionally exhausting i did make two awesome friends from the subreddit maybe are either normies aka regular people who dont hate women andor friendly incels i didnt mean to make anyone feel bad but i saw a chance to show a hypothetical relation between what op posted and what the incels main problem seems to be i dunno we need an incel behaviorist up in this joint
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh yes those are weird
creepyPMs,not_removed,why wont you date me you find me attractive and youre a female so
creepyPMs,not_removed,im talking to one right now whose hero is eliot rodgers whatever that assholes name who killed women is and is complaining that other people in his hs are having sex gasp while its denied to him apparently he joined incel when he was and is now oh and he doesnt understand why people dont want to be friends or date him
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus is it normal to get laid with nowadays
creepyPMs,not_removed,til i was an incel until i was or something wat
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think hes whining about upper classman he says he acts normal in public but obviously that level of hatred towards women will come out in all of his interactions with them imo
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus i didnt lose it until i was boys in high school were idiots i didnt want anything to do with them xd
creepyPMs,not_removed,better calm him down a bit before he trys to get on the level of his idol
creepyPMs,not_removed,he reacted extremely defensively when i said he sounded like the type to commit a mass murder at his hs its a real shame if this guy isnt a troll that they can get involved at such a young age in the type of hatred that the incels forums foment because then they become radicalized rincels is absolutely a hate group
creepyPMs,not_removed,i visited that sub a few weeks ago when i saw it mentioned on the front page thats when i learned incel was shorthand for involuntarily celibate i saw a youtube post linked there just showing pictures of women narrated by an american man who never showed his face consisting only of his rambling nonsensical diatribe about american women c who should be murdered or put in concentration camps he said the young supple ones could be saved for men to use for sex this went on for nearly half an hour was he a troll a mass murderer telegraphing his intentions your gardenvariety sociopath with a stunted vocabulary some incel posters seemed onboard with him some said they thought mgtow was too extreme for them i dont know what mgtow is after reading the incel posters debating its merits or lack of same i knew this sub was not for me reading men debate the merits of massmurdering american women also described as parasites whom they didnt even know was beyond comprehension it looked like something isis would post about infidel women but this man seemed to be referring to all american women it was deeply disturbing i dont understand why people would create an entire subreddit to unite and selfidentify in such a deeply negative way i stopped reading and never read it again as far as the original post goes i have no idea what is motivating this man whether its some type of oblique comeon body dysmorphia or simply confusion about how to engage with a woman in a way that doesnt involve the superficial ones appearance
creepyPMs,not_removed,mgtow stands for men going there own way iirc i dont know what it really means but if its too extreme for incels then i dont think i want to know
creepyPMs,not_removed,he has experience but not in the use of punctuation
creepyPMs,not_removed,u like sex i give u money youre being offered a coveted sex grant
creepyPMs,not_removed,u are a creep i call the popo for soliciting sex
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read his words in my head in a bad russian accent it fit well
creepyPMs,not_removed,shudders
creepyPMs,not_removed,who is sexy and why would i want to wrestle them
creepyPMs,not_removed,sexy is the champion wrestler in their village
creepyPMs,not_removed,just be gross with consenting people your own age or younger people who explicitly state theyre into that 😂
creepyPMs,not_removed,neither of us has seen inches before amazing and he only gave an inch back after that
creepyPMs,not_removed,just checked theyre still on ha
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just literally enjoy asking questions and receiving answers how big are your tits abraham lincoln he just said he enjoys receiving answers he made no mention of them needing to be correct
creepyPMs,not_removed,savage i love it
creepyPMs,not_removed,instructions unclear still have underwear on lol in any event that was an awesome comeback edited
creepyPMs,not_removed,do these guys have a bunch of bras of different sizes to hand or something so they can double check what your size actually is
creepyPMs,not_removed,theyre too big for my bras c rabrathatfits
creepyPMs,not_removed,i enjoyed that part as well
creepyPMs,not_removed,he actually said that he enjoys reviving answers i take that as any that he does receive are pretty likely to be dead
creepyPMs,not_removed,this feels like something exactly michael scott would say
creepyPMs,not_removed,rsadcringe
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry but im totes stealing that dad joke
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats either the most dangerous psychopath ive ever seen or hes a sentient toaster strudel attempting to lure you into a trap of some kind
creepyPMs,not_removed,itslikei dont know man its harder to say anything mean this time other than goddamn he kept messaging
creepyPMs,not_removed,just pathetic
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly this person was kind of sickening and i am really uncomfortable right now wow
creepyPMs,not_removed,at some point he almost sounded like a broken sexobsessed bot but maybe i just watched too much westworld
creepyPMs,not_removed,httpimgurcomallauu
creepyPMs,not_removed,please tell me this man is in jail now
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like he was having a stroke while writing those messages possibly in more ways than one but we can only hope at least one of them was fatal
creepyPMs,not_removed,this was the most disturbing exchange ive ever seen on this sub i strongly suspect some poor child is going to be a victim of his if nothing is done
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is actually fucking horrifying and i need to scrub my skin
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit this was the single most concentrated block of glorious replies i have ever seen talking about periods you really need to learn how to use them commas and other punctuation too i like to play with legos yeah pretty much everything here was i know creeps such but thanks so much for sharing this these comebacks were spectacular
creepyPMs,not_removed,this may be the grossest thing ive ever read
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,should be crossposted to rcreepy this is downright fucking disturbing op did you report them or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,not only is this disgusting and horrifying but im laughing because this bastard is using talktotext every time he says period it puts an actual period fucking dumbass
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive rarely been so disturbed by just text
creepyPMs,not_removed,op please report this to the authorities this could be potentially really serious and shouldnt be taken lightly
creepyPMs,not_removed,fucking hell theres a horrible vibe off this guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is the kind of post you have the instant instinct to downvote because the subject matter is gross before realizing that oh yeah you actually want to upvote these posts to promote shaming
creepyPMs,not_removed,why does he talk like why does he talk like this
creepyPMs,not_removed,the repetition made this so much grosser for some reason like it turned him from just normal pedophile into fucking serial killer pedophile
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats crazy its scary to think that theres someone out there who would actually do this stuff
creepyPMs,not_removed,i sincerely hope this is illegal
creepyPMs,not_removed,well i hope this fucker gets hit by a bus
creepyPMs,not_removed,its talking to a fetish instead of a person
creepyPMs,not_removed,all his messages sound like really terrible attempts at erotic poetry jesus that was disgusting
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is the first creepypm that i cant finish reading is there anyway to report that guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,far most the creepiest pms ive ever seen on here what a sickening piece of shit he is
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should try and report him hes disgusting
creepyPMs,not_removed,this sounds like a poem gone wrongperiod
creepyPMs,not_removed,im so glad how op handled this situation op is the real mvp
creepyPMs,not_removed,report this pedo to the police or fbi
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit that was disgusting i hope that person never encounters children and gets therapy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i need to bleach my body after reading this im ops age and a guy and this made me feel disgusted and dirty with how the dude thinks its even remotely ok to approach girls that way op please send this guy to jail cuz it makes me wanna vom
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus fucking christ i need a shower after reading this
creepyPMs,not_removed,ewwwwww i suggest fbigov tips to at least feel a little better
creepyPMs,not_removed,anyone have an answer to why he types like that hes repeats a lot within the same message
creepyPMs,not_removed,why do most creeps have an inability to type
creepyPMs,not_removed,this legit made me nauseous
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is the epitome of this subredditso much creepy so much no the pervert kept going what the actual hell is wrong with him
creepyPMs,not_removed,why dont you take a seat
creepyPMs,not_removed,after you mentioned that you were he should of stopped
creepyPMs,not_removed,this actually got to me i cant laugh this one off
creepyPMs,not_removed,ew ew this is disgusting please report him to the police he could possibly hurt a child
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is fucking unnerving creepers who run around talking shit to adults isnt in any way acceptable but its at least understandable shitbags like this who are obviously deranged and dangerous should not be allowed in society i hope hes jailed before another child is traumatized for life
creepyPMs,not_removed,report this
creepyPMs,not_removed,shouldve finished it with this is chris hansen with dateline nbc and were filming a program called to catch a predator
creepyPMs,not_removed,but really report him to the police or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,call the cops
creepyPMs,not_removed,that sick fucker needs to be reported
creepyPMs,not_removed,fucking gross
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should post his details on b or rcrimewatch
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a sick sick piece of shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,what goes through someones mind while behaving like this
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should send this to his family members if they havent already disconnected from him results would be pretty golden
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel violated just by reading this
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just threw up
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read that in run for the cubes voice
creepyPMs,not_removed,a lot of things on here make me think people use the word creepy for anything that makes them annoyed in fact i find the vast majority of posts here to not be creepy however this is one of the most disturbing things i have read
creepyPMs,not_removed,knock on door man walks in introduces himself hi my name is chris hansen please have a seat
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah that guy needs to go to prison
creepyPMs,not_removed,jeezus christ just reading the title made me retch
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wouldve reported him err somehow
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh hell yeah please send this to the police i also would like to say maybe while hes sitting in prison he could learn to spell but whats the point of that i mean with someone like this education is a total waste of time
creepyPMs,not_removed,i laugh because every fucking time they dont even pay attention to your responses just bombard you with repetitive shit questions
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes so frantic that im honestly kind of worried hes doing something else while he asks you these things thats why his grammar is breaking down and why he repeats things over and over
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly i know im really late but i save all my creepypms for the end of the month but this is the worst fucking thing ive ever read im actually seeing red the only thing saving me is your awesome responses
creepyPMs,not_removed,is that supposed to be like copy paste gone wrong
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly from the dialogue hes giving this may be a bot it looks mostly like its throwing out keywords and then responding to certain words or phrases the most likely reason the programmer wants to see what response the bot gets i hope knowing that it might be a program with no concept of what its doing spewing words at you like a parrot might give you some relief
creepyPMs,not_removed,god it just keeps going and going and the whole itll be our secret went from skin crawling to vomit inducing gyagh its like every one of those awful it was a family friend stories played out by text
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah usually the pms posted here make me laugh a bit because of op responses or just annoy me this was one of the few that made my skin crawl this guy was persistent and disgusting ugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,i made it or panels and just couldnt take it anymore
creepyPMs,not_removed,now would be a good time for chris hansen to show up lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was really grateful for the chuckle that i like to play with legos gave me because i was a bit nauseated
creepyPMs,not_removed,its like my brother when he turns source have bros ones a pedo
creepyPMs,not_removed,same not a fun one at all i just want to go home and take a long nap
creepyPMs,not_removed,never thought id see a westworld reference on reddit love that movie
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my god this is totally what i was thinking bot creepy chimo bot
creepyPMs,not_removed,now i wonder what it would be like to sext cleverbot
creepyPMs,not_removed,does he still want to stuff legos in your privates
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats horrifying i was kind of hoping he knew you were older but somehow decided you were role playing being because well hes clearly pretty damn delusional already but no yuck
creepyPMs,not_removed,now
creepyPMs,not_removed,now huh if i didnt know any better
creepyPMs,not_removed,nope and theres plenty more just like him
creepyPMs,not_removed,its very rare for a pedophile to be convicted
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was definitely using talk to text and my guess is because he has one hand on the phone and one hand jacking off fucking disgusting
creepyPMs,not_removed,you should always pee in a toilet stars out of
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes reported in app so hopefully he wont find any real children there at least
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes probably using talktotext cause one hand is busy wacking off to the dirty things hes saying to a presumable child
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just thought of why he might have been using it and now im twice as grossed out as i was before
creepyPMs,not_removed,unnecessary trauma to the person driving the bus and all the passengers in the bus but yeah this guy should definitely not exist anymore
creepyPMs,not_removed,talk to text most likely
creepyPMs,not_removed,seriously justi dont
creepyPMs,not_removed,im definitely ill at ease now there should be a way to report this guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,seriously fucked up stuff
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my god
creepyPMs,not_removed,same could not go on
creepyPMs,not_removed,apparently its a show now i havent watched it yet but ive heard good things and its on my to do list
creepyPMs,not_removed,seriously its all over reddit theres an entire sub for it
creepyPMs,not_removed,like we all didnt try that within minutes of learning about it
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive reported and blocked him already so we will never know
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah my original intent by saying i was was for him to argue with me that no youre it says so in your username and thus avoiding the sextalk then after id convinced him that i really am a child he would realize just how wrong it is to send sexual messages to a stranger out of the blue you never know who youre talking with after all but no
creepyPMs,not_removed,sad but true law enforcement could use all of their resources on luring those predators in and still not get them all thats why its so important to teach kids how to stay safe anywhere not just online but you still see stuff that makes you shudder unfortunately
creepyPMs,not_removed,and when they do its usually after theyve had numerous victims
creepyPMs,not_removed,didnt even consider that thats so horrible imagine if he got in contact with an actual child thats such a scary thought
creepyPMs,not_removed,removed for violating rule
creepyPMs,not_removed,its very good i get a serious phillip k dick vibe from it dont know how the movie compares though
creepyPMs,not_removed,o cool i did not know that
creepyPMs,not_removed,the show is amazing i knew it was a movie beforehand but ive never seen it or had an interest in seeing it now i kinda want to see it lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,might be the best show on tv right now really really terrific
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hope something happens after hes reported like they give the info to the police or somethjng that man is a vile pedophile and needs to be checked
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would never ever make any excuses for a creepy pmer so im putting that out there but if it does say on your profile that you are he may have been genuinely thinking you were roleplaying then again i work for an adult site and i see people do this kind of shit all the time that does not make it okay obv
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i could see where you were going there but oh wow what a charmer
creepyPMs,not_removed,weird question but law enforcement cant do anything unless the pedophile acted on something right i think i know someone who intentionally hangs out in a store packed with women of all ages for the sole purpose to ogle at elementary school girls but is there anything i can do about it he hasnt done anything else yet i think
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont know who downvoted you that seems perfectly logical to me as sick as it is
creepyPMs,not_removed,its like blade runner meets hunger games so good
creepyPMs,not_removed,agreed its brilliant
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hope so too its really sick how someone can talk like that to a child
creepyPMs,not_removed,usually i would give an anonymous tip on the fbi website or put up their contact info on ive had an encounter with someone openly expressing their interest in child pornography that was a mess
creepyPMs,not_removed,considering most guys from how to catch a predator are just let go i wouldnt hope too much
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh god i never even thought about that
creepyPMs,not_removed,in the us probably not if hes in a public space then he can look at peopleeven if his intensions arent pure hes causing discomfort maybe but not actual harm
creepyPMs,not_removed,unless hes taking pics of them no
creepyPMs,not_removed,most of them get at least some probation time
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive reported him in app i contacted kik the app directly about the last pedophile that contacted me they replied that they couldnt really do much about it and that if i was really concerned i should go to the police however unless the guy lives in my country which i doubt he do the police here cant do anything about it either hopefully he get banned from the app at least so he wont find any real children there
creepyPMs,not_removed,the company is happy to provide a less than more untraceable app there wont be any support action even if banned hell just start a new one there is an episode of black mirror where sexual predators get blocked from seeing and being seen by any individual kinda wish we had that
creepyPMs,not_removed,man that persons passionate about chinese food s
creepyPMs,not_removed,dedicationall i got to say
creepyPMs,not_removed,like to eat or keep them alive plus thats also just really creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,geeez

creepyPMs,not_removed,she also threatened to curb stomp me the whole thing was ridiculous
creepyPMs,not_removed,im going to guess youre asian or that you appear to be i base that on the little blurb he has about himself where he wants to kill all asians of a certain age and also their mothers i hope you reported him he could be just a harmless troll who feels ohsopowerful sitting at his keyboard but he could also be someone who poses a real threat of physical violence no one should tolerate this sort of thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like someone didnt get the fedora he wanted for christmas from mommy

creepyPMs,not_removed,well i mean i met my so on pof and weve been dating for years and just bought a house together so i dont think his view is totally realistic
creepyPMs,not_removed,i met my fiance in pof too three years so far
creepyPMs,not_removed,basically this is from a few months ago and he asked for a current picture to make sure i wasnt catfish ing him which is understandable so i obliged the barest edge of my underwear was sticking up over my pajama pants and i didnt notice he had to zoom way in to even see it
creepyPMs,not_removed,you purposely flashed your panties at him so youre clearly signaling that you want to send him nudes s i like how your reactions quickly devolved into monosyllabic apathy good shutdown technique
creepyPMs,not_removed,sometimes its the only way to handle them i blocked him after he started sending me links to porn with accompanying messages such as oh my god i came so hard from that
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not sure if thats better or worse than an unwanted dick pic its certainly more creative i still wonder why creeps do things like that nobody looks at unwanted porn links and goes boy i sure would like to show that guy a naked picture right
creepyPMs,not_removed,it was weird fetish stuff too like scat and vomit porn i noped out of there at the speed of light
creepyPMs,not_removed,today i learned that there is such a thing as vomit porn i may never eat again
creepyPMs,not_removed,okay its fine my bad just got a little excited btw heres a ton of my fetish porn nice to meet ya
creepyPMs,not_removed,or maybe the speed of nope one of the few units of measurement that can sometimes exceed the speed of light boundary
creepyPMs,not_removed,you and me both buddy you and me both
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont worry about it oh gee thanks i was wracked with guilt until you told me not to worry about it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like op is overreacting by posting here he said if not dont worry jeez its like she didnt even read his message s
creepyPMs,not_removed,well gee i love watching women twiddle themselves on the internet for hours and hours so clearly you must like the same thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,sigh i never get these kinds of messages i need a new user name
creepyPMs,not_removed,i got this same exact message now i feel less special 😰
creepyPMs,not_removed,i laughed when i read your username funny throwaway
creepyPMs,not_removed,rcreepybutpolite or rpolitecreeps
creepyPMs,not_removed,im a female youtuber i get shit like this all the time too im sorry you have to deal with that
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive got a feminine username on league of legends a moba game mostly populated by teen boys i get a lot of people asking me r u grill my standard go to response is im a year old dude but im happy to send you a picture of my dick usually shuts them up
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a nice guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,what do you mean not everyone likes stuff i do and not everyone is pervy i have great taste
creepyPMs,not_removed,twiddle themselves never heard that one before tbh that works better lottocard themselves or shick themselves got the perfect amount of subtlety i think ill keep that one in the mentalslangtoolboxtm
creepyPMs,not_removed,rip in peace your inbox
creepyPMs,not_removed,but he told you not to worry about it
creepyPMs,not_removed,so did i this guy really gets around
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i dont think ive ever had even the faintest desire to watch a dude masturbate not thinking theres a huge demand for that im not saying it couldnt happen but i doubt he gets many any takers
creepyPMs,not_removed,i remember when i read christopher moores you suck and read the expressing flicking the bean for the first time
creepyPMs,not_removed,rest in peace in peace your inbox
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes pretty obviously joking well i hope so
creepyPMs,not_removed,gt not thinking theres a huge demand for that you dont know the internet very well do you p joke aside ive seen at least subreddits catering to this fetish and at least one request on rtipofmypenis for gifs of guys getting off but seriously until then i thought just like you ¯⊙ʖ⊙¯
creepyPMs,not_removed,rest in pepperoni in peace your inbox
creepyPMs,not_removed,its still a good idea to put s after posts like that as we genuinely do sometimes get some creepers
creepyPMs,not_removed,im into watching men get offid accept an offer like that if they just wanted to send me a gif or we i dont trade my own pictures but i like to watch but i wouldnt like a question like that from out of left field in a porn subreddit sure but not from nowhere unsolicited so i get why its in this sub
creepyPMs,not_removed,op meant specifically demand for the creep i think they did say not saying it couldnt happen
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds good im in
creepyPMs,not_removed,s happy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like brown people semenyou look smart not sure which one to facepalm harder at
creepyPMs,not_removed,yikes that is not okay is this the femcreep equivalent of the i like going down on girls honest thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh wow i am really cringing at this one
creepyPMs,not_removed,plus i like brown people semen spit take what
creepyPMs,not_removed,first screen be like oh rly lets check the pics second screen be like abort
creepyPMs,not_removed,found my new band name
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is unfortunate the plus i like brown people semen has me thinking this may be a troll but either way this is justwow
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh look a racist who wants your kids cant get any better than that s
creepyPMs,not_removed,would order restraining
creepyPMs,not_removed,my first thought was wow it couldnt get creepier faster than that but then i clicked on the second image holy fuck why would anyone think that thats an appropriate andor sexy way of talking to someone
creepyPMs,not_removed,no no i think the phrase brown people seamen is actually the extra points i can just imagine marques brownlee getting this sequence of messages and being confused as to how someone like this can exist
creepyPMs,not_removed,yikes
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,on an unrelated note dualsim or what
creepyPMs,not_removed,why is it that when women come on too strong it nearly always seems to involve getting pregnant as soon as possible
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like something wants you to come in stronger
creepyPMs,not_removed,brown peoplesemen
creepyPMs,not_removed,racist and stalkerish qualities every man goes for s
creepyPMs,not_removed,it absolutely is just as creepy i once had a woman check my teeth like a horse probably the biggest turn off ive ever encountered
creepyPMs,not_removed,well im sure a lot of people look smart to the sort of person whod utter the phrase i like brown people semen
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah smart enough to know better
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit i just looked at it on the page and didnt realize that there was a second image until i saw your comment i thought it was creepy enough as it was that immediate transition of do you like kids to id have kids with you was stalkery as fuck
creepyPMs,not_removed,i saw this as the counterpart to the asian girl fetish
creepyPMs,not_removed,commitment tell that to my dad
creepyPMs,not_removed,right why is it thats what they want if they just wanted sex i might let that slide but she had to get disgustingly reproductive about it gross edit space removed
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wonder if shes implying others taste worse
creepyPMs,not_removed,fill me in here what exactly is a spit take
creepyPMs,not_removed,makes me think of
creepyPMs,not_removed,did you know that guyss semen is just like cows milk because white milk comes out of white cows chocolate milk comes out of brown cows and oreo cookies come from black and white cows semen works exactly the same way
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think she just wanted a brown baby
creepyPMs,not_removed,not at all diet health hygiene and just genes affect the taste but i dont think race has anything to do with it except for different genes
creepyPMs,not_removed,apparently the flavour depends on what you eat and the texture is variable too
creepyPMs,not_removed,technically every mans sperm is entirely unique
creepyPMs,not_removed,more or less yes there is variation of uh flavor and texture between people and even with the same person between orgasms but what exactly makes that happen isnt really known theres all sorts of urban legends about how drinking pineapple juice or fruit juices or whatever will make it sweet and eating red meat will make it sour but in my experience thats completely untrue and ive never seen any actual scientific evidence showing that connection its all just shit that people repeat on the internet similar to the whole you know the size of a mans penis by the size of his handsfeetdistance between blah blah blah all bogus but commonly believed different people just make different stuff even if the basic composition is roughly the same it certainly doesnt have anything to do with race ethnicity geographic origin or the color of ones skin though
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have been told no flavour changes
creepyPMs,not_removed,brown people semen
creepyPMs,not_removed,car rentals
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wondered if it was a troll as well this doesnt seem like normal human speak
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment has been removed in accordance with httpiimgurcomvkforaspng httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahaha you guys are so funny stick it to those men who look like that do this to women s
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah no dont do that
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre most likely right about that
creepyPMs,not_removed,right
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think it was probably both at the same time the first image was creepy oversharing and the second was racial fetishism
creepyPMs,not_removed,he will be back as soon as he finds those cigs
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like youre being facetious but im not sure exactly what youre getting at
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow we dont allow that sort of language on this sub please read rules before commenting again cheerio
creepyPMs,not_removed,its when you spit out your drink
creepyPMs,not_removed,auwch those poor black and white cows
creepyPMs,not_removed,so mixed race people ejaculate cookies
creepyPMs,not_removed,what about michael jackson
creepyPMs,not_removed,why the quotes around brown
creepyPMs,not_removed,its both all the hennessy makes it sweeter and mayo makes it bitter and sour
creepyPMs,not_removed,texture is variable like viscosity or like grittiness or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,you can even say that every sperm isprecious
creepyPMs,not_removed,depending on what you eat not by race
creepyPMs,not_removed,a band popped up on my spotify with a song called kentucky meat shower
creepyPMs,not_removed,im serious im grossed out by the ticking of a biological clock
creepyPMs,not_removed,can confirm that that doesnt happen
creepyPMs,not_removed,we dont speak of him here
creepyPMs,not_removed,i thought this was hilarious not sure why youre downvoted
creepyPMs,not_removed,i didnt want it to offend anyone so i used quotes to show i was just quoting the text
creepyPMs,not_removed,its not politically correct
creepyPMs,not_removed,its more like pineapple juice will make it a little less bad and bitter bad diet with lots of beer dairy products and junk food will affect taste and smell of all bodily excretions
creepyPMs,not_removed,viscosity is definitely variable significantly so wikipedia says it ranges from centipoise where cp is viscosity of water at room temperature in my experience semen is never gritty
creepyPMs,not_removed,semen can be gritty thatd taste off ew
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes we must wait to years for traditions sake
creepyPMs,not_removed,here as a novice debater let me give wellthought out constructive points as to why he will not be shoving his cock into her tight vagina according to washington times when creeps provide information as to their penis size they are actually using the cdi system in which the number they give is actually the number you divide by to get their actual size so this man would be inches or not even so that isnt even physically possible advanced researched at national geographic has done studies on mating habits in human beings which have shown that in general responding to id prefer not to hear that with a grotesque and descriptive erotic fantasy actually ends up driving members of the opposite sex away as opposed to attracting them a recent study performed by harvards department of human psychology gathered that although people generally dont look for someone exactly like them in a romantic partner as the common saying goes opposites attract they do often look for individual traits that they pride themselves on so given that this woman is a debater implicitly she would be looking for a certain amount of intellectual rigor to match her own however this guy who can be scientifically classified as moron cant even hope to reach that level
creepyPMs,not_removed,what kind of response does he think hes gonna get oh yes thats much better now its not creepy at all ill let her know you fancy her then c
creepyPMs,not_removed,what even
creepyPMs,not_removed,sending this over facebook seems especially stupid if youre going to be a giant fuckbag anonymity is your friend
creepyPMs,not_removed,i found myself pleasantly surprised to learn that his dick isnt the or inches that most people claim to have but since i think most guys in posts i read in this subreddit at least exaggerate i suspect this guys dick is really inches im not criticizing anybodys dick size just be honest guys not everyone cares so much that saying its huge is your ticket in
creepyPMs,not_removed,debating chicks am i missing something because im pretty confused
creepyPMs,not_removed,anyone who talks about their dick size is insecure he could be inches but he is not secure in himself guys even brag about dick size to other guys my guess is that is a quantifiable stat that they assign a social value to in order to win and can have some sort of proof that they are better than someone else kind of like comparing paychecks it is a number to use to make themselves feel happy because they are not losing in this small aspect of life people who are secure with themselves dont need to bring up things like this because they dont need to be better than someone else
creepyPMs,not_removed,i agree in the context of online dating it feels to me like theyre dangling it as a lure to entice people i find it repellent when i read pms where its mentioned in the gettingknowyou phase i get it if its in the context of hookups but in dating no thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,good point unprompted penis brags are what i meant time and place for everything
creepyPMs,not_removed,well hes sending you dick pics and trying to get you to have sex but he says hes not hitting on you so how dare you accuse him s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont understand this mentality if i were looking to bang someone id oh i dont know try to find someone who would actually want to have sex with me
creepyPMs,not_removed,im pretty obsessed with this sub like a mixture of fascinatedconfusedappalled when i was dating many years ago before meeting my fiancé online stuff was just in its infancy reading stuff like this makes me so relieved i am not dating in these modern times i feel so bad that you have to be subjected to the bizarre and creepy logic of so many of these guys out there
creepyPMs,not_removed,were online no ones around clearly doesnt understand the internet
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is so annoying because this is okc im guessing and there are so so many gay girls on there its a great place to find girls
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wonder if someone invaded their personal space like this if they would like it ugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,nope he isnt hitting on you at all he is just being friendly hahahaha smh
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is kind of unrelated but does anyone else find android emojis super creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my bad s
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe she only hangs out with guys who send dick pics s
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe hes one of those idiots who thinks his dick is so bomb that it will change their mind
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am newly single after being married for almost ten years and i am horrified by the dating scene
creepyPMs,not_removed,or sexual orientation lol its not a public persona
creepyPMs,not_removed,use of gif
creepyPMs,not_removed,the app in the screenshot is actually meetme we can safely burn that to the ground without hurting any gay girls
creepyPMs,not_removed,normally id say theres no need for those s at the end but with reddit you never know
creepyPMs,not_removed,platonic dick pics dicks of friendship if you will
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean doesnt everyone obviously creeper asks his guy friends what they think of tall guys big dick because those are important things to know for any friendship
creepyPMs,not_removed,time for the magic cureall penis s
creepyPMs,not_removed,the i like looking at you just smacks of serial killer skinwearing youllneverseeyourfamilyagainness
creepyPMs,not_removed,damn it has the same look
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive always wondered why this subreddit specifically uses s so heavily the vast majority of comments here ending in a s are obviously sarcasm and the s just ruins the comment
creepyPMs,not_removed,its suggested that it be used as a rule in case your comment could be seen to be breaking a rule i only use it because id rather my comments werent deleted if a mod or someone else reads it another way
creepyPMs,not_removed,because you know as well as i do that someone wont get it and go off on a rant about how dumb they think you are
creepyPMs,not_removed,sometimes when im reading these my brain tosses out a valley girl ew
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have known several people nicknamed the italian stallion and so far of them were being made fun of
creepyPMs,not_removed,im kind of known as the jesus of the modern yeah im gonna go on a limb and assume that he is the only person who calls himself that
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus was an italian stallion
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you want me to personally cure you wtf
creepyPMs,not_removed,so does this mean that creeps lurk on this subreddit as well if so that makes me highly uncomfortable
creepyPMs,not_removed,guys obviously his dick is magic and can turn any lesbian straight its not like they can actually be happy with another woman because neither of them has a penis i dont get why women arent swooning at his feet ssss edit spelling
creepyPMs,not_removed,im an asshole so id probably attempt to convince him to wire me the money for a ticket to the uk so he could cure me personally and then not go
creepyPMs,not_removed,sitting here reading that shit making face
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you have to say you are something then youre not
creepyPMs,not_removed,the bit that really bugged me was how he thought he could turn you straight again as if you used to be straight and could therefore be turned back
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow what you need to do is ask the modern day jesus to make some wine out of water just think of the extra income s
creepyPMs,not_removed,singing its the circle the circle of creeeeps
creepyPMs,not_removed,barf
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey free trip just make sure he cant cancel the return portion of the ticket once he realizes youre not going near his gross ass
creepyPMs,not_removed,so creeps lurk creepypms looking for people to send creepypms to
creepyPMs,not_removed,these posts make me wish you didnt have to black out their usernames they deserve the public shaming
creepyPMs,not_removed,the only italian stallion is rocky
creepyPMs,not_removed,barf why would he assume you were even interested in being cured thats literally the most disrespectful thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,i seriously have no words smh
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes one of those people
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh yeah they definitely definitely do creeps creep apologists etc fortunately the mods here are super awesome and dont tolerate any of that crap
creepyPMs,not_removed,i kind of want to message him and say im a gay guy who can cure him of his straightness although no self respecting gay guy would touch someone as rude as him i just suspect he wouldnt like it too much
creepyPMs,not_removed,that sounds like a movie trope the magic dick
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont really have any lesbian tendencies but if the choice was between sleeping with this guy or a woman i would definitely pick the woman
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah this is the type of creeper it would be fun to string alongget money from
creepyPMs,not_removed,well then that is one hell of a drawn out message
creepyPMs,not_removed,i recognize my past self somewhat in this i feel bad for her she only wants well terribly low self esteem and issues she should probably get a dog instead until she goes to more therapy dolphin mail so cute
creepyPMs,not_removed,oo kind of makes you feel bad for her but this is so many shades of crazy did you say anything back or are you going with not responding
creepyPMs,not_removed,damn i made it only pages in this person is setting themselves up with a lot of conditions which im guessing were all deal breakers with past boyfriends
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is just full of so much cringe she even acknowledged it might ruin her chances and sent it anyways
creepyPMs,not_removed,how many dates before this message damn
creepyPMs,not_removed,wellok then thank you for vomiting in my mailbox
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh god i see a lot of me in there ocd can string itself all over relationships and communication and it can be really unpleasant for everyone involved its a super awkward message to receive like im not trying to frame it like its not a creepy message or downplay any distress it made you feel i hope her therapy keeps working and shes able to be little better with boundaries her own and those of the person shes talking to
creepyPMs,not_removed,my first reaction was asking myself what am i smoking and i dont think you can train a pikachu to do that
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont see how anyone managed to read the whole thing i lost interest sentences in starts speed reading and gave up after the second page
creepyPMs,not_removed,my eyes cannot get any larger oo
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my god now i have a chronic and sometimes difficult to control mental illness and even i think this shit is crazy sweet jesus
creepyPMs,not_removed,claims to be selfaware is really really not
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a lovely read i bet you feel like shes a keeper eh
creepyPMs,not_removed,this was about two years ago i unearthed the message from my okcupid profile i didnt respond it was just so much and took me by complete surprise i couldnt think of anything to appropriately respond she has since deleted her profile
creepyPMs,not_removed,one we just met once before this and had been talking for about a week leading up to it
creepyPMs,not_removed,made it to the end of the letter
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment has been removed in accordance with httpiimgurcomvkforaspng httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think she tried to guilt me honestly i think she was well aware how well crazy she was coming off when she sent her incredibly long message and wanted to assure me that if i didnt have any interest or didnt respond which is what happened that she wouldnt lose it harm herself andor kill herself
creepyPMs,not_removed,are you kidding me right now
creepyPMs,not_removed,and here we see the subjects attempt to court the female of the species watch his attempts at using what appears in his mind to be the successful attempt but instead the failed experimental approach of insultingly negating the recipient and expecting the debunked psychological response of riposting his statements with sexy pics and sexual high praise as promised by expensive seminars that he is still paying for six years later we call this misguided attempt at appearing to be sexually desirable cranial rectal autoinsertion syndrome or as known in common vernacular head up his own asshole
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not advertising anything i wouldnt be advertising anything to a man old enough to be my father
creepyPMs,not_removed,more transphobic than homophobic doesnt change it being gross af though
creepyPMs,not_removed,how do people this old get through life without exploding in a cloud of their own idiocy
creepyPMs,not_removed,wiener chick wow just wow
creepyPMs,not_removed,is it too picky to point out that this is transphobia not homophobia
creepyPMs,not_removed,shane the stash whatever the hell that was supposed to mean
creepyPMs,not_removed,lpt other person not responding send them a screenshot of your texts to make sure they get them
creepyPMs,not_removed,what app is this
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wouldnt have replied in the first place except i thought he might be one of the older people who get confused with technology
creepyPMs,not_removed,what you said not interested ah umfag
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think he means shave
creepyPMs,not_removed,meetme its like facebook but with strangers
creepyPMs,not_removed,😂😂😂 oh my god op this is the funniest thing ive read all night
creepyPMs,not_removed,shave the stache aha you are definitely right i totally missed that connection the first time
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh i was about to ask if it was slang for some sex act i hadnt heard of like receiving anal sex in a way characteristic of shane from walking dead or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive told this story before back when i did online dating i started talking to this guy he was cute and nice and we had a lot in common but he kept trying to get me to come to his house and smoke weed and shoot guns i told him id meet between our houses at a fast food place since i didnt go to someones house the first meeting he kept lightly pushing during our conversation i just thought he was being flirty i told him brb and and went to jump in the shower i was gone minutes and came back to a plethora of messages each getting nastier until he called me a bitch and said nevermind about meeting because i didnt respond about going to his house after id said no several times already and he missed where i sent brb he called me a bitch again after i pointed out i had been willing to meet but was no longer interested guys what if he was the one
creepyPMs,not_removed,apparently not responding to texts is merit enough to qualify for being the next stalin
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow what a creep you seem like a nice person op and its a shame you have to put up with stuff like that edit your not gonna reply to my comment i was just being nice to you but if you want to be a sociopath i dont like you at all and your a horrible person and i never really wanted to talk to you anyway s
creepyPMs,not_removed,how long was it between the first two messages and the last one
creepyPMs,not_removed,what is the halflife of his patience if it reaches a negligible amount within minutes
creepyPMs,not_removed,smh at people in this thread supporting new stalin
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wonder why hes single he sounds like such a catch
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol bye felicia its great when the gross ones reject themselves saves me the trouble
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had somethjng similar happen to me with a guy i went on one date with i was letting my phone charge in the other room for like min and i came back to like texts from this guy getting increasingly more paranoid and crazy there wasnt a second date haha like im not always on my phone chill out bro
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes just like trotsky
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol of all people why stalin
creepyPMs,not_removed,there wasnt even enough of a time gap between messages and for a new timestamp to be relevant
creepyPMs,not_removed,sociopathic
creepyPMs,not_removed,pretty amazing almost like evolved natural selection
creepyPMs,not_removed,the way out of the conversation they created
creepyPMs,not_removed,woooow
creepyPMs,not_removed,minutes like the title
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think the one would freak out after minutes
creepyPMs,not_removed,it wasnt even that she didnt respond they didnt respond within fucking minutes
creepyPMs,not_removed,not anwsering my texts is like literally worse than the great purge
creepyPMs,not_removed,stalin never replied to texts so it is a fair comparision
creepyPMs,not_removed,httpmimgurcomyagrmrq is now relevant
creepyPMs,not_removed,holodomokcupid
creepyPMs,not_removed,minutes
creepyPMs,not_removed,not a clue looked away from my phone for ten minutes and all three were there
creepyPMs,not_removed,about four minutes the length of a quick wank
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,weve built a better creep
creepyPMs,not_removed,did he get that second date s
creepyPMs,not_removed,if i had to guess id say he thinks its like invoking hitler but less cliché
creepyPMs,not_removed,this one time i didnt return a call from my mom for an hour im a monster
creepyPMs,not_removed,look at the timestamp on the messages vs the time on the top right corner of the phone screenshot yes minutes like the title
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah yes i think shehe dropped this s
creepyPMs,not_removed,purge me despot i dont give a fuck come at me bro
creepyPMs,not_removed,with a pillow and a flashlight at best
creepyPMs,not_removed,my god my mom once called me at and i had the audacity to wait until the morning to call back i must be the worst kind of heathen
creepyPMs,not_removed,look man i was calling someone out who asked how long it was i dont know how it posted as a new comment thread instead
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah yes i was being sarcastic and i cant do that very well
creepyPMs,not_removed,its okcupid and it only does if you subscribe
creepyPMs,not_removed,broseph
creepyPMs,not_removed,well poo
creepyPMs,not_removed,good response
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think my username speaks for itself
creepyPMs,not_removed,technically it does though
creepyPMs,not_removed,i got three pill bugs evolving into two dungbeetles and one butterfly
creepyPMs,not_removed,technically but did you ever see something work as it should
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wonder how long its gonna take this guy to work out that getting attention isnt always a good thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,what an enticing opener be my jizz receptacledisposal or youre a prude be still my heart
creepyPMs,not_removed,plus he got it wrong spitters are quitters if a spitter was for a quitter then wouldnt that make the person who had their ejaculate spat out the quitter or is a spitter a special cum holder that quitters buy just in case they take a shot to the mouth
creepyPMs,not_removed,til that reacting negatively to dirty messagescommentsquotes from random strangers prude
creepyPMs,not_removed,let me get your attention with a sexual statement woo hoo pay attention to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,whoo hoo
creepyPMs,not_removed,four score and seven years ago did i get your attention
creepyPMs,not_removed,nohamlet act iii scene iii line
creepyPMs,not_removed,romeo oh romeo wherefore art thou romeo deny thy manners and refuse thy decency or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love and ill no longer be a swallower
creepyPMs,not_removed,well duh you should feel honored that he was brave enough to message you in a sexually harassing way its like totally a complement you know sheesh must we men always have to explain how these things work to you women
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dislike words i have an utter contempt for words if words were enemy soldiers and i but a simple civilian on the french countryside during world war ii i would take to them not unlike a savage flaying the skin from them with my pitchfork and setting their heads upon my fence dimly lit by my lanterns a last minute warning that posthumously pleads for mercy and tells a tale of futile escape i cannot simply write enough about my hatred of words alas if you crave them i shall give them to you also the butt sex and halo
creepyPMs,not_removed,i could maybe believe the one guy that sent the same message three times within a minute had some kind of glitch maybe but what the fuck was with gambit guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,its like a for deal
creepyPMs,not_removed,im deep and intellectual im too smart for you and also i will condescend every time you want to communicate uses terrible grammar
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh that first one come on dickface using lots of wordz doesnt make you sound clever even when you do use them properly and spoiler you didnt the use of clever language to try and sound smart is one of my bugbears and it never ever works no one communicates like that take a breath calm down and write out a sentence that an actual human being might use
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is by far the edgiest post ive ever read s
creepyPMs,not_removed,shindiggity doo
creepyPMs,not_removed,horrible sweet things umm those two words dont really work together there bud
creepyPMs,not_removed,swoon you had me at french countryside
creepyPMs,not_removed,yea i was just thinking it waa a message glitch too boy did gambit lose it after rogue dumped him
creepyPMs,not_removed,for the record im sure i know who that guy is and not only is he not but hes a huge asshole who has two protection orders against him by women he harassed
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre supposed to prove him wrong with your rapid and enthusiastic reply its a test of his that no one else gives a fuck about
creepyPMs,not_removed,might be a mixture of his conversation skills and mustache i take it back that mustache is a thing of beauty i take that back as well
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre beautiful but all your fellow women suck gosh take me im yours s
creepyPMs,not_removed,he seems like one of those guys that puts you in competition with other people to manipulate you into doing what he wants women are so rude and stuck up but youre not unless you ignore this dumbass greeting and then ill tell you how i was right i consider it one of the first warning signs of an asshole tbh
creepyPMs,not_removed,its like he already accepted failure
creepyPMs,not_removed,truly he is a man of deep introspection
creepyPMs,not_removed,how are you doing why are women so stuck up he sent this in the same message why
creepyPMs,not_removed,why are women so rude when they call me out on my blatant lie about my age when im clearly at least and a horrible liar
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont light a match around that hair
creepyPMs,not_removed,huh
creepyPMs,not_removed,and he started off so well
creepyPMs,not_removed,hold up hold up so if youre saying i can tell him some bs about womengirls i can get a million dollars because sorry cool rcreepypms posterscommenters under the bus it is jk id def share it with yall
creepyPMs,not_removed,literally the first thing he says to you is manipulative lol what an asshole
creepyPMs,not_removed,how are you still single you could ask him the same question but i guess the profile picture kind of answers that for you
creepyPMs,not_removed,no way no lie
creepyPMs,not_removed,i didnt want to say that dude looks because it is mean but now that i know he is definitely not but that dude definitely looks at least
creepyPMs,not_removed,ha my first thought wasthat guy is not im a bit shit at guessing ages and now i feel validated yeeeesssss
creepyPMs,not_removed,totally unexpected not at all unexpected
creepyPMs,not_removed,not me mister im not one of those nasty bitches and ill prove it ill prove it with sex
creepyPMs,not_removed,jimmy buffet may have wanted a pencilthin mustache but that doesnt mean you should
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre not like all of those women who reject me so frequently step one demonstrate value check
creepyPMs,not_removed,he probably knew he was going to get rejected so might as well include his postrejection whiny post with his intro
creepyPMs,not_removed,did he
creepyPMs,not_removed,tacos for everyone
creepyPMs,not_removed,he actually recently changed his pic to the stereotypical no face just a picture of a guys chest which i highly doubt the one he posted is really him p
creepyPMs,not_removed,yup when i first saw the pic im like is that and then i saw san antonio and said totally has to be
creepyPMs,not_removed,ohh i didnt realize that his match percent wasnt his age
creepyPMs,not_removed,its just dumbfounding that his opening line is a combination of compliment plus misogyny ive never seen that before negging weve seen compliments and pet names before the rejection lashing we see misogyny just another day but combined this dude is creative and very smarts absolutely foolproof schemes because all of us women are just tripping over each other in our rush to jump on thundercocks dick and well do anything to winok that sounds ridiculous but you might be surprised by how many people believe it
creepyPMs,not_removed,hundreds of other girls have decided im not worth their time but you might be more shallow than them insult intelligence check
creepyPMs,not_removed,but then why bother sending the message
creepyPMs,not_removed,ehh he wasnt going to win any awards with that opener but it certainly was a hell of a lot better than the insult that followed it
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy is possibly older than he claims yet he pulls this nice guy crap man act your age and how is it im still single oh i dont know maybe its because im trying to avoid being with a creep like you p
creepyPMs,not_removed,some people are unhinged lunatics
creepyPMs,not_removed,because then hed have nobody to blame for his sad lonely life but himself op is the scapegoat of the day shell validate his anger toward women and all will be right with the world
creepyPMs,not_removed,you can be with a creep like me
creepyPMs,not_removed,sure thing bebeh
creepyPMs,not_removed,sweet
creepyPMs,not_removed,not sure if this fits but this person is crying ageism and trying to recruit helpers after asking a yearold barista on a date while she was at work this persons page is a goldminenightmare
creepyPMs,not_removed,its the telomeres guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh boy
creepyPMs,not_removed,your postcomment has been removed in accordance with httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,whoa im having a flashback to when i was and working at mcdonalds i was pleasant because it was my damned job but not even remotely flirty because i didnt even know how one of my regular customers asked me out he was probably in his i didnt know his exact age but had i been pressed i would have used the word grandfatherly to describe him and it was very obvious that i was a teenager
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not familiar
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive seen him posted a lot on cringepics he complains on facebook about millennial women being ageist bigots because they wont date him he says he deserves to date and breed wirh younger women because older men provide lots of telomeres or some bullshit
creepyPMs,not_removed,there are more around rniceguys and rcringepics but yeah dude is gross
creepyPMs,not_removed,well damn he just came across my facebook feed today gross gross entitled gross tons of suicide threats if he doesnt get dates too what a sad place to be
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh gosh from this he sounds straight up mentally ill and borderline developmentally delayed
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just saw him on facebook as well this whole thing is crazy looks like he is trying to get his supporters to give the starbucks a bad rating
creepyPMs,not_removed,my question is why does he have supporters other niceguys who have nothing better to do but hate women for not picking them
creepyPMs,not_removed,sigh i wish i knew on the positive side it looks like more people are posting positive things on the starbucks page and praising them for banning him and protecting their employee
creepyPMs,not_removed,i want drink ur boob thats a new one
creepyPMs,not_removed,update the moment i posted this on imgur i got a dick pic there wow
creepyPMs,not_removed,you are my hero
creepyPMs,not_removed,so i have a friend who sends me some really gross and disgusting pictures im talking poop needles all kinds of grossness because we find it funny when i get unasked for dick pics i send the gross pictures in response works most of the time
creepyPMs,not_removed,i tell them im a nurse and their abnormal penis needs to be medically examined i like to think it instills paranoia
creepyPMs,not_removed,so the next time i want a good fight i send dick pics got eet
creepyPMs,not_removed,although the poor language skills are very familiar
creepyPMs,not_removed,imgurians are the equivalent of man children dont expect anything helpful there
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah that place is a fucking cesspool i always upload stuff create an album and avoid the share to community button like the plague you can always count on them being inappropriate in some manner and proud of it and you can always count on them to mansplain to you how you should react to creeps
creepyPMs,not_removed,why thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,nice i worked at a haunted house so i have all these pictures of gross monsters and gorey makeup and stuff sometimes i send them that especially if they demand pictures
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is like some nextlevel friendship there
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think that guy was smart enough to understand something like that ugga ugga me want boobie me have boner poop pee sex
creepyPMs,not_removed,genius
creepyPMs,not_removed,not exactly
creepyPMs,not_removed,well now come on thats just not fair i mean the reddit community has its fair share of bad apples too
creepyPMs,not_removed,its great to see creeps burned like this that would be a great show like to catch a predator but for these bastards host sam jackson reads their creepy messages and tears then apart
creepyPMs,not_removed,that was my first time posting there i had not clue
creepyPMs,not_removed,send them some of the dick pics youve gotten from other guys
creepyPMs,not_removed,heck yeah and she makes amazing lumpia too
creepyPMs,not_removed,actually youre right
creepyPMs,not_removed,the imgur hate in this sub always makes me sad
creepyPMs,not_removed,news flash theyre all shit people are fucking animals all over the internet reddit is so full of shitty people i basically only use this sub anymore because its actually modded and doesnt let entitled man children gather and harass people here
creepyPMs,not_removed,i agree
creepyPMs,not_removed,its a bit embarrassing to admit but i used to frequent that damn page the thirsty and sexist behaviour noncisphobia and racism got old pretty fast i deleted my regular account and keep a reddit throwaway now imagine if you couldnt filter out trumpets terpers and other uhm interesting subs from reddit thats imgur for ya front page every fucking day theyre not all horrible people but theres enough of them there to make you want to invest in a flamethrower
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think of usersub as kind of like rall avoid at all costs if you look at mostly the front page and avoid dwelling on the dumber comments imgur can be just as fun as reddit when you unsubscribe to all the defaults and find the cool people places
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly the average imgur user doesnt go into usersub often it really is filled with mostly crap and recently also child porn and so the comments you encounter when you accidentally submit your image are not representative of the majority just like the comments on a thread in trp isnt representative of all of reddit
creepyPMs,not_removed,nsfwd just in case wonder if hes actually
creepyPMs,not_removed,what these people dont seem to understand is that it is not socially unacceptable to blatantly say things such as im super horny can we trade nudes i have a hard cock and especially i will cum if we trade like no idea what country he was raised in where any of these are acceptable things to say especially to a stranger people need to learn the difference between thoughts you can voice and thoughts that you need to keep to yourself
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like how he asked still want to trade nudes as if he thought youd forget that you didnt want to
creepyPMs,not_removed,if i ever have a daughter can i stop her going online until she is this kind of interaction shakes me to my bones just so predatory
creepyPMs,not_removed,im only
creepyPMs,not_removed,even if he were actually a minor he would still be in possession of child porn because he clearly wouldnt give a shit about you getting in trouble for distributing it
creepyPMs,not_removed,since this post contains an underaged person we like to offer help paging unosefetish
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes not
creepyPMs,not_removed,always ask them their age first only way to get something close to the truth and usually itll go like this f how old are you btw m im what about you f im m oh typo i meant im
creepyPMs,not_removed,not a chance in hell
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh just the fact that he has a cock should make me swoon i should definitely give nudes to some guy who asks four messages in s seriously though i cant understand this thought process i know its easier to say things on the internet than rl but really
creepyPMs,not_removed,unfortunately its best for a girl to get used to sexual harassment because its not going to stop learning the skills to deal with perverts is very important
creepyPMs,not_removed,good luck with that but they time shes well probably all have eyephones
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment has been removed in accordance with httpiimgurcomvkforaspng httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean youre on creepypms read the rules before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,creeps are the worst pedophiles are the worst of the worst
creepyPMs,not_removed,i only thought of that afterward unfortunately
creepyPMs,not_removed,i swear this literally reeks of a pedophile the way you asked i mean
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know it is impossible to shield young teens from this online sexual harassment my friend has a young daughter and she has parental controls and said no mobile until but only one that is controlled also i think this young woman dealt with this creep amazingly mature i worry that some young women however may feel pressure due to low self esteem sadly the internet grew too fast and too quick for us to deal with effectively the social consideration of anonymity that affords predators online
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hear you it wasnt that long ago that i was a teen and am amazed at some of the shit i had to put up with and young women today it makes me sad i guess i am hopefully that dealing with that the cauldron of misogyny and bullshit will make most of them stronger but i cry for those who cant handle it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i doubt that you can enforce the nomobiles till with the rapid advancement of technology phones will become an essential part of our community but what you can do is actually following the regulations given by the social media sites there are age limits and regularly check out their social media accounts to make sure they dont make any mistakes even the age of isnt enough if you want to protect your kids my sister for example almost ruined her life when she was the predator was just on another note you shouldnt turn your children into a glass flower when they leave your protection what will happen stand behind them not in front of them i would link a certain social experiment here and you can be sure that the parents warned their kids till the poor kids ears grew sore but did it help children are naive from nature if you isolate them and keep them protected they will be even more naive having children is a big responsibility the internet itself made that responsibility even worse again i would recommend these two videos to all parents especially those who say my kid is smart she wouldnt do xxyy xxx sounded awkard note that everything above is what picked up i am not a father no i am not a mother either and have less then two decades on my back but i wanted to share the things i picked up left and right
creepyPMs,not_removed,bonus points for the nword of course racism and sexism go well together
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh ffs because you dont have pity when nothing happens to a person you should be raped wtf is wrong with those people
creepyPMs,not_removed,this person is involuntarily celibate because he cannot stop himself from saying horrible shit all the time and it turns people off not his fault guys just the way he was made
creepyPMs,not_removed,what are incels
creepyPMs,not_removed,not again in two or more instances just in this past week i had commented how people these days are handling rejection and anger by issuing rape threats or wishing rape upon the other person and that they somehow think its ok sad
creepyPMs,not_removed,literally the rodger elliots of the world they even fuckin idolize the guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah incels truly one of the most toxic groups of people to ever meet on the internet hey guys this stupid bitch i met wouldnt let me fuck her what did you say i said hey bitch after we eat at sizzler lets go home and make sexy i dont get it man she seems like such a dumb whore like the rest of them we incels need to stick together and well figure out whats going on
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cant imagine why hes incel
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have never encountered the word incels in my life
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont even know what to say what is wrong with people
creepyPMs,not_removed,they hate black men so much
creepyPMs,not_removed,that seems to be their goto go get raped yawn
creepyPMs,not_removed,well at least now hes communicated with an actual woman hes going to have to refine his technique sure but hes gotta be the envy of incels worldwide i talked to a girl on the internet woohoo
creepyPMs,not_removed,extra stupid for the fact that most rapes are someone the victim knows happen in the victims home in a friend or acquaintances home away from home according to google so yeah not a lot of gang rapes in alleys
creepyPMs,not_removed,wrong with those people a profound sense of entitlement especially regarding sex mixed with a total lack of social skills and a victim complex
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is the kind of common sense logic that would get you banned in rtruecels
creepyPMs,not_removed,celibate i think you mean celibrate
creepyPMs,not_removed,yup obviously they all think theyre sweet and putupon but some people dont form relationships with others because theyre genuinely unbearable
creepyPMs,not_removed,its supposed to be short for involuntarily celibate in theory it could describe anyone who wants to be in a romanticsexual relationship but for whatever reason isnt able to make that happen ok no big deal not being able to find a partner doesnt make you a bad person but if you head on over to the truecels subreddit its a bunch of angry men who think women owe them sex lovely people really
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh god turn back now you dont want to know this exists
creepyPMs,not_removed,his pic used to be at the top of the sub until a few weeks ago
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hadnt until i came to reddit
creepyPMs,not_removed,no it doesnt i didnt recognize it so i looked to see if it was a throwaway account or a real one most of their posts were on mgtow and trp no surprise
creepyPMs,not_removed,please dont ask for identifying information
creepyPMs,not_removed,if happen in your home or ann acquaintance home and away from home there is one obvious question
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus christ that sub sidebar had a bullet point about how its totally okay to say that women deserve rape three posts talking about how they think pedophilia is okay
creepyPMs,not_removed,surprisingly ive given my rather colorful opinions about a particular poster on that sub on another account and he didnt remove my comments or ban me he just said youre entitled to your opinion and im entitled to mine i suppose getting any attention from a girl is better than no attention at all i take solace in the fact that they will likely die alone and never inflict their awfulness on anyone else
creepyPMs,not_removed,fun fact heres what that subs automod responds with if you call their users entitled sex or at least romantic interaction with females is a basic necessity like food and water a man deprived of women wont necessarily die but he will over time go insane when people criticize us for being entitled they are saying that we dont deserve to be with women they are saying we deserve to be alone they are saying its better for us to go insane than for women to be inconvenienced with interacting with us
creepyPMs,not_removed,that sub freaks me out
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had no idea what this was until i clicked im disgusted what a bunch of entitled little shits
creepyPMs,not_removed,dat pinned post
creepyPMs,not_removed,i went there and now i regret it
creepyPMs,not_removed,as soon as i made a post about incels at the blue pill i knew i would get a rape threat so that should tell you something
creepyPMs,not_removed,sex or at least romantic interaction with females is a basic necessity like food and water a man deprived of women wont necessarily die but he will over time go insane when people criticize us for being entitled they are saying that we dont deserve to be with women they are saying we deserve to be alone they are saying its better for us to go insane than for women to be inconvenienced with interacting with us thats taken directly from what their automoderator spams whenever someone calls them entitled emphasis mine
creepyPMs,not_removed,and a lot of them have had sex some of them have sex fairly regularly they just dont have as much sex as they believe theyre owed
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks for the explanation i hadnt heard that term before i believe i understand the type of guys you mean though sorry youre being targeted for calling them out on their shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,and to think i almost became one of those losers
creepyPMs,not_removed,for whatever reason jesus i think we all just learned the reason
creepyPMs,not_removed,too late im already past the point of no return
creepyPMs,not_removed,this just makes me really fucking sad how do people get like this im autistic i have crappy social skills i grew up being bullied in school yet i dont feel the need to go round saying everyone who rejects me deserves to be raped also i dont blame other people for my own problems
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just looked it up to reddit teaching me new things all the time
creepyPMs,not_removed,sorry
creepyPMs,not_removed,where do ones happen
creepyPMs,not_removed,they are saying we deserve to be alone with that attitude yes yes you do
creepyPMs,not_removed,having spoken to a lot of them im ok with that assessment of how i feel you deserve to be alone its better for you all to sit alone and be crazy than for women or men or anyone to have to put up with the shit you are saying and demanding i feel sympathy for people who struggle with social interaction and are awkward im that way too but i have no pity for those who wish death and rape and harm on others simply because they cant get the they think they deserve
creepyPMs,not_removed,do the females need to be human or do they not specify edit i wonder how theyd like it if we rewrite that from the point of view of a gay man sharing similar viewpoints
creepyPMs,not_removed,according to that logic i should be writing this comment from a mental hospital wearing a straightjacket in a dark room talking to the ghosts of my own sperm eating buttered bread with my eyes
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit usually people like this at least have the basic awareness to explicitly deny their entitlement while still showing it through their posts these assholes straight up say that sex with women is a basic necessity like food and water whoever wrote that is mentally disturbed
creepyPMs,not_removed,well its not wrong that romantic interaction is a basic need but its very different from material needs its not something someone can simply give you like food or water the word interaction shows that its mutual and the people from that subreddit fail to live up to their part you obviously cant get it with someone you hate people in that subreddit seem to generally hate women
creepyPMs,not_removed,why dont they hire hookers
creepyPMs,not_removed,i discovered the truecel sub the other day bleargh
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know what trp is unfortunately whats tbp im reluctant to go looking after looking at the sidebar of the truecels page
creepyPMs,not_removed,i blame maslows hierarchy of needs the whole thing is clearly bullshit at the very least because asexuals and voluntarily celibate people exist
creepyPMs,not_removed,my condolences
creepyPMs,not_removed,no problem
creepyPMs,not_removed,happen in outer space
creepyPMs,not_removed,there always seems to be a vocal group in incel and foreveralone communities that insists one day sex robots will replace women and wont that show them
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know its good to make jokes here but this is really fucking disturbing how is that sub still around
creepyPMs,not_removed,well it wouldnt hurt
creepyPMs,not_removed,are you okay do you want a cup of coffee and a blanket
creepyPMs,not_removed,the blue pill points out shit that happens at trp basically
creepyPMs,not_removed,what ubelindamshort said tbp is actually pretty funny if you wanna have a laugh at the little shits thats the place to do it
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh its a satire of trp and related subs
creepyPMs,not_removed,or normal people who havent been laid exist without raping people or being little shits
creepyPMs,not_removed,asexuals and voluntarily celibate people exist yes and every single one of them is insane s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think its bullshit its a hierarchy so some things are more important than other things what maslow got wrong was building a static pyramid the needs are different for different people sex and romantic interaction are needs for most people nothing wrong with you if they arent the problem is that they dont see that its not a givetake relationship like with food or water its mutual and you also need to fulfill the needs of your partner they ignore that part totally and treat people they want mutual interaction from like objects
creepyPMs,not_removed,please we are begging for it until then feel free to fuck your toasters fuck a vacuum fuck a computer all hail the sex robots obviously msg intended to read for incels
creepyPMs,not_removed,obviously because what are women going to do when all they guys they would never fuck in the first place start sticking their dicks in technology
creepyPMs,not_removed,iced tea and a blanket maybe its pretty hot out but god yeah some comforting would be nice it was nightmarish in there
creepyPMs,not_removed,gag
creepyPMs,not_removed,it is indeed a scary place i kinda hit my limit the other day and let one of the sad pieces of shit have it actually hes the saddest piece of shit of all he freaked out on his mom for not taking his virginity blackmailed some poor girl into having sex with him demanded the government provide him with a girlfriend and just this week bragged about how he lied about his age to a year just so he could fuck her so yeah im not allowed to play in that sandbox anymore
creepyPMs,not_removed,or just go about their business not paying any attention to those sad little men
creepyPMs,not_removed,ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
creepyPMs,not_removed,yup awful
creepyPMs,not_removed,okay i tried did you tho
creepyPMs,not_removed,hello i own these three animals now im going to talk about my penis i hope you are interested because im ugly up close but i love to laugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean am i wrong to assume on a site for hooking up that ddf stands for drugs disease free
creepyPMs,not_removed,im a army specialist thats basically saying im an entrylevel employee nothing wrong with being a specialist just not something that anyone who has any other redeeming qualities would use to try to impress someone not that being any higher rank is impressive or not cringeworthy to use as an attempt at impressing someone just that being a specialist is the opposite of impressing someone by your job
creepyPMs,not_removed,strike a pose bull dogue dogue dogue
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol i love to laugh im a nerd bra thats the most obvs cliche after this isnt a dickpic i promise
creepyPMs,not_removed,let me pound my flaccid inches into you for several hours until the chafing consumes us both
creepyPMs,not_removed,where exactly is he keeping his bulldogue tarantula and scorpion under his bed at the barracks
creepyPMs,not_removed,im confused too was he calling himself ddf or you
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am similarly unconvinced
creepyPMs,not_removed,gotta say when youve been working hard and need to relax nothing hits the spot like a refeeshing simple sex drink
creepyPMs,not_removed,bulldogue and a scorpion i wonder if hes ment a
creepyPMs,not_removed,okay i tried oh he gets that youre not interested and is retaining some digni kidding shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh goddamn that is some major cringe
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha so were agreed that hes saying that about himself then and not me also i think he thinks im threatening to shoot him
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats what i thought it meant
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive never heard of any other meaning
creepyPMs,not_removed,whats the site
creepyPMs,not_removed,i died at that part congrats bro youve been in the army for like four months
creepyPMs,not_removed,i laughed my ass off at that part im married to a specialist and i cant imagine him using that as a way to sound impressive
creepyPMs,not_removed,deleted
creepyPMs,not_removed,isthat a quote
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have no idea i think he just looked up an alternative meaning when i called him out on the bullshit logic
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha yea he threw me off there im always seeing the bratty responses on this sub but i honestly get a lot of really nice responses to me saying upfront that im not interested not that im happy people act like this but it sure was entertaining
creepyPMs,not_removed,its not wrong to look for sex on a dating site but this guy has no seduction skills if i had sex with every guy who asked for it up front on a dating site id have no time left in my day to not be having sex women have to be selective because there are too many guys wanting to get laid and not enough hours in a day guys can try for sex on a dating site all they want but they probably wont have success unless they are at least a little bit charming and attractive i have three pets and a bigger than average schlong is not a charming opening women generally dont care about penis size when picking out a partner and trying to win a woman over with a measurement is basically shouting i have no redeemable qualities to show off other than the penis size i inherited by genetics scrape the bottom of the barrel and have sex with my desperate brainless self you have to seduce a woman out of her pants online just as much as you have to offline this guy didnt fail because he wanted sex he failed because he had no social awareness

creepyPMs,not_removed,more info here i hadnt posted for a couple of days on account of battling a raging chest and throat infection i was feeling a little better so i went out i was taking a cigarette break from a house party and was looking for a video of a puppy id saved on my reddit account up pops this message this loser decided that im pathetic for liking my own cats and just really needed to tell me urgently also that i should kill myself note that they say they cant give their best material because i would kill myself and yet they also told me i should do it so i dont know what the point of this was either way it was amusing to say the least my friends were all really pissed off but hey its the internet nothing you can do i also would never have replied to this sober had too much dutch courage and dragged the creep disclaimer i in no way want to come across as someone who mocks others and their hobbies but they looked through my entire post history and i thought i may as well be an asshole too mock me for having a cat and not a great family life ill mock the shit out of you as someone who uses reddit for support and help through various issues etc and someone who is severely depressed this is really not okay but i have been able to laugh it off and i hope they dont pick on someone in a worse spot than me
creepyPMs,not_removed,ill never understand why internet people think that tactic will work likesome rando on the internet thinks i should kill myself even at my lowest and most suicidal i would never take something like that seriously
creepyPMs,not_removed,how rood
creepyPMs,not_removed,id kill myself if i were you stop hurting my feelings blocked
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre right will you be my friend wouldve been my response to the first two messages and i wouldve responded with wow youre quite the edgelord or watch out weve got a badass over here to the you would definitely fucking kill yourself line
creepyPMs,not_removed,as someone whos a wrestling fan im really sorry one of my tribe was such a dick to you id guess that person probably does spend all day on reddit so the idea never even occured to them that someone might just be check in during an idle moment they lose you dont
creepyPMs,not_removed,someone literally responded to you liking cats with this remind me never to mention my babies on reddit
creepyPMs,not_removed,it almost has the opposite effect for me like yes i am depressed well done internet creep but im hardly going to off myself over some person telling me my cat doesnt like me thats probably the most redundant reason to give someone to kill themselves plus theyre wrong theyve never met my cat hes the clingiest motherfucker on the planet no dice creeper
creepyPMs,not_removed,talk about randomi got one of these pms telling me to kill myself once it was the weirdest shit ever at no point had i interacted let alone had a disagreement with this person we dont frequent the same subs or anything they just found me somehow then told me to kill myself at first it was funny but then i got kinda sad that people are unhappy enough with their lives to stalk random strangers online
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahahaha its great right they go from telling me to kill myself and no one loves me to youre blocked for being rude ahhh it give me a laugh what a time to be alive
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know what i expected although i am now thinking into it and perhaps just maybe i know this person and when i mentioned their post history they had to bail and block me oh shiiiiiiit
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahahaha i was so tempted to throw in a go back to your mothers basement you fucking neck beard but im too pleasant in real life and i was in a good mood although next time theyre going down
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh man i want to apologise for my harsh words i actually dont mind wrestling ive watched it in the last couple of years but i was a big fan as a kid i in no way think that all wrestling fans are assholes just this one the comment on me being on the internet with them made me snort like dude i was drunk and was looking for an awesome puppy video to show me equally drunk friends im not with you so awkward
creepyPMs,not_removed,even creepier i hadnt even posted about my cats in the last week they seem to be angry that i like my cats but also pleased that no one loves me an enigma wrapped in a mystery
creepyPMs,not_removed,right its like this guy has never had a pet before if they only saw me as a food source they wouldnt go ballistic with the need for cuddles when i pick them up from the sitter after a long vacation
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe hes like that guy from hitchhikers guide to the galaxy who spends his immortality flying around the galaxy to call each individual a dick to their face
creepyPMs,not_removed,complete and uddernutters that one is
creepyPMs,not_removed,wrapped in a kinder egg
creepyPMs,not_removed,its a pointless argument to make i know my cats are clingy little shits and im aware they need me to feed them but if you saw the way they wait for me after work in the front window and then barrel towards me as i enter the flat youd get it too i feel a bit sad for the creeper it was the early hours of the morning and their entertainment was to tell me no one loves me the cat hates me and i should kill myself while i was at a house party with a group of my best friends like were you not hugged as a child did you never have a pet or friends i couldnt even be that angry i sounded mean but i was pissed and it was hilarious at the time everyone was shouting out possible things to call the creep for the greatest maximum effect one of them shouted cum dumpster it could have been worse hahah
creepyPMs,not_removed,hehehehe i like that you made me snort my tea up my nose
creepyPMs,not_removed,i always think that when i see trolls what went so badly wrong in your life that this is the only thing that makes you happy that seems to be a common view of cats from noncatowners though i think because youve got to work for a cats affection they see them as heartless meanwhile my girl came flying over the fence as i drove up crying to be picked up and my boy is currently sat on the back of the sofa playing with my hair and purring like a tank hes just jealous that youve actually got something in your life that makes you happy
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha silly youtea doesnt go up your nose
creepyPMs,not_removed,eh im used to noncat people saying they dont give a shit i know of some cats who are literally the worst but mine in particular are the daftest cuddliest little bastards i mean i love all animals i will make a goat be my friend with my tenacity i just love me some animal friends and my eldest cat immediately jumped into my lap the very first time i saw him at the shelter anyone accusing him of not giving a shit is highly mistaken hes a slut for fusses the more i look at those messages the more pity i feel actually im the opposite of a mean person and i feel like theyre obviously in a rough mindset that theyve randomly targeted me and in the early hours and trying so hard to break me down into pseudopsychological crap its pitiful i hope they find themselves or some shit like that or at least not seethe online to people they dont know for no reason what happened to make them so toxic and mean
creepyPMs,not_removed,i learnt this the hard way also happy mother fucking cake daaaay braj
creepyPMs,not_removed,cuddleslut my old cat hated everyone except me and she was a big angry git shed climb on my brotherinlaws lap because she knew he was afraid of her then hiss and scream every time he so much as shifted position then shed give me the smuggest look possible god she was the best but yeah ill happily befriend everything other than arachnids or squid i carried a ladybird around all day once because it was a cold day and it seemed to be happy where it was dont feel bad about your responses like you say you were drunk and having fun you cant be held accountable for anything youve said its a shame they feel the need to do this sort of thing but they know what theyre getting into they cant expect everyone to just say oh okay guess youre right
creepyPMs,not_removed,also happy mother fucking cake daaaay braj wuuuuuuuuuuuuuutttttttttt fucking years already im fucking reddit old now
creepyPMs,not_removed,also thank you i didnt even notice
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahahaha ive known cats in my life that are so sneaky i used to be terribly allergic and without fail if there was a cat it would find me and rub itself on me while i struggled not to touch their furry faces however i was cured magically at some point so now cats all the time i did just get a bit shocked by a big spider in my kitchen luckily he just kind of left me alone chopping apples and i left him alone said hey yknow as you do and that is so sweet that you carried a ladybird i did that with an aphid he got stuck on the bus so i carried him to the nearest leaf thats true i also feel bad saying things like that i get the rage as my friend calls it its like an alter ego that is such a bitch like grade a drag bitch its both hilarious and terrible
creepyPMs,not_removed,get yourself a rocking chair and a porch to sit on youre old now
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah now im actually a bit allergic to cats which i only realised when i went to university when i came home after a few months away boom allergic then after id been home for a little while getting catfaced not allergic anymore so all those cats who made a beeline for your face they were just helping your immune system god the rage i know it well do you get that thud where all the blood hits your brain at once too i think its worse when youre otherwise pretty quiet or easygoing then the psychobitch comes blasting out just spitting curses and throwing punches
creepyPMs,not_removed,doesnt help that i live in the south and that is everywherehaha
creepyPMs,not_removed,i got cured by an elderly cat named ozzy he couldnt see or hear but by god he found me in my friends house and he stayed with me the whole time i miss that scruffy boy thats exactly my problem i am chill as fuck i dont get mad i never raise my voice and i hate confrontation but if i get pushed enough all hell breaks loose my friends think its hilarious because im small and quiet for the most part i tolerate a lot but not this fuckery ive nearly had fist fights with guys twice my size until they realised i was actually willing to fight them in the name of justice and then they back off oh the amount of times ive lost my shit after months of quiet seething hahaha its like in cartoons when their eyeballs catch fire boom bitch mode
creepyPMs,not_removed,ol man riiiiiiverrrr
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly you could be me im about and legends are told about the night it took two of the football lads to wrestle me out of a club i was deadset on fighting this dickhead who was getting rough with my mate for not wanting to sleep with him a complete stranger a full foot taller than me pretty solid and ragebrain is going yeah we can take him plus the angrier i get the more i smile ive been told its disconcerting i think the problem is because you hold onto things you stay calm and stay calm and then suddenly all the back pressure releases and its like someone setting off a fire extinguisher of rage and justice
creepyPMs,not_removed,do you have cute bare feet yes i do i have several pairs in fact all kept nicely wrapped in my freezer s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i lost my feet in the great defeeting of thanks for bringing up the bad memories you bastard
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just do not understand foot fetishists the whole cute feet i mean what constitutes cute feet or pretty feet i once asked a foot fetishist who shrugged nonchalantly and said they are just pretty thats all that same fetishist offered a foot massage to me so i agreed and was immediately grossed out when he kept sniffing my toes making me want to gageveryone has kinks that to others are hard limits but i felt nasty do people know if they have fetish worthy feet why are feet so special why is a foot fetish so common i have too many questions
creepyPMs,not_removed,something something words with creeps
creepyPMs,not_removed,the fact that he sent that at makes this whole thing
creepyPMs,not_removed,did you guys see the top comment on imgur i asked you not to post this
creepyPMs,not_removed,send nudes
creepyPMs,not_removed,just tryin to keep you on your toes oh
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have heard and someone correct me if im wrong that the place in the brain that processes the feeling of arousal for the genitals is close to the zone that process the feeling in feet and so some people have those lines crossed so to speak and get aroused by seeingtouching feet
creepyPMs,not_removed,feet with friends
creepyPMs,not_removed,no thats a different person i already asked for permission if you check that guys submitted gallery images you can see that he has a lot of upvotes
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think the imgur commenter is joking that theyre the creep
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,there is a pretty big leap from cute to sexually arousing though dogs can be cute toddlers can be cute a good looking girl can be cute only one of them make me think of sex though it is the last btw
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats fair my bad im always skeptical when i see friends sharing other peoples private messages and wonder how many of them got permission to do so sorry about the assumption i made
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats probably more likely my mistake
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah exactly and your partner might think a part of you is cute but not want to fuck that specific thing such as feet or your nose or your back
creepyPMs,not_removed,no problem dude
creepyPMs,not_removed,hi lets play a fun game if i win you become my slave forever and have to do everything i say just some harmless fun lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,surprisingly the guy has an empty profile and no pictures of himself

creepyPMs,not_removed,what a delightful ol chap
creepyPMs,not_removed,i aint a hexer but dont push me
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read it as mother of a turkey am i wrong is it not a turkey mama p
creepyPMs,not_removed,he steals your hat and fucks your mom
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep its the nickname for primeapes mega
creepyPMs,not_removed,rofl
creepyPMs,not_removed,that explains so much
creepyPMs,not_removed,makes total sense
creepyPMs,not_removed,he has time for apostrophes but not full stops okay i was calling you that cus you like me thats worryingly delusional
creepyPMs,not_removed,you know whats typical hes trying to get with you yet everything he says is about him and how he feels
creepyPMs,not_removed,the amount of times he tried to say he was only talking to you because you liked him when you made it quite clear that you did not is very worrisome get a clue dude his manipulation tactics are blatant
creepyPMs,not_removed,you think im just like every other guy says the guy who wont take no for an answer and makes his obsessional feelings your problem fault no dude youre not like every other guy most guys would take the fucking hint
creepyPMs,not_removed,ok bye hey ok bye hey bye im sorry hey
creepyPMs,not_removed,i want to be with you but i dont want anyone to know in my experience means i want you to only have sex with me while i fuck around and do what i want bleh
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont believe he would be the best guy for anyone
creepyPMs,not_removed,but im just being nice to you ugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,sweet fucking jesus wow
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey
creepyPMs,not_removed,you dont have to say im sorry when you reject him in his mind hell probably take that to mean you are taking responsibility for rejecting him or some bullshit
creepyPMs,not_removed,intensifies
creepyPMs,not_removed,pattern ive seen mostly nonnative english speakers with a sever disdain for punctuation
creepyPMs,not_removed,the most annoying part for me is he was saying if you tell me you dont want me ill leave you alone so i tell him i said that already and hes like okbut what if
creepyPMs,not_removed,when i read that i thought he wasnt a native english speaker because in spanish to like verb works different for example i like you is translated as tú me gustas if you translate back word by word is tú you gustas like me me that translation is incorrect but a common mistake although after reading everything i think hes just a creepy guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey hey babe hey whats up hey i have something i want to say hey there
creepyPMs,not_removed,my friend tried to set me up with him cause she was interested in his friend and it did not work out he threatened some dude at the bar for looking at me sideways and i was like nope
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was trying to be as clear but as nice as possible because hes one of my friends friend and i didnt wanna cause any discontent in their friendship i didnt want him to start harassing her to talk to me so i tried to just lay it out but not be so mean about it
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah hes just a creepy guy i still get a message every couple of days that says hey in some various form
creepyPMs,not_removed,that was the laziest fantasy feeding i have seen in a while
creepyPMs,not_removed,why very u like
creepyPMs,not_removed,uh eew
creepyPMs,not_removed,his last response reminds me of doge
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes do very u like
creepyPMs,not_removed,such kink very sex wow
creepyPMs,not_removed,his tung nice spelling dude
creepyPMs,not_removed,wait wait wait i need clarification would these be jello fun packs if so im in
creepyPMs,not_removed,my tung sounds like a name i should use it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have teacher named mr tung so maybe youre onto something
creepyPMs,not_removed,removed for violating rule
creepyPMs,not_removed,im telling you its totally a person
creepyPMs,not_removed,if youd like to discuss your comment removal please feel free to message us in mod mail please reread the rules before commenting again thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,the rules dont change just cause you disagree with what a person posts and the rules say to not put op on trial and to not offer unsolicited advise if you dont like a post downvote and move on
creepyPMs,not_removed,no problem i apologize for making a spectacle out of it i didnt realize the rules were so expansive i saw them in the sidebar and thought it was just be civil and supportive which is somewhat open to interpretation i never realized that scrolling over the rules expanded them i didnt even quite realize it was a support sub as opposed to a laughandpoint sub ill adhere to the setforth rules from here on out apologies ubooofedoof and umahogannyteakwood
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks for the assist
creepyPMs,not_removed,well that was refreshing thanks for being so understanding
creepyPMs,not_removed,do you have iphones the new ios and imessage allows you to love or laugh at messages by tapping them he may have done it by accident
creepyPMs,not_removed,if hes texting from a company phone assume that the device has some kind of tracking or logging system which is specially useful when you have company email configured on the phone in case it gets lost
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have had to have a talk about an employee using his phone for this kinda thing very awkward to make the matters worse it was not his wife he was texting the problem is we have to keep data for litigation purposes please have him get a cheap personal phone and save the it guys an awkward conversation
creepyPMs,not_removed,does he have an iphone it seems possible that he may have accidentally pushed down on that text maybe forgot to lock his phone before placing it in his pocket and he hit one of the reaction buttons thats how the reactions from other people pop up on my phone on the lock screen
creepyPMs,not_removed,just remember that winces its a work phone if he ever gets called into litigation all his work emails calls and text can be made evidence that includes any pictures he sends or receives
creepyPMs,not_removed,if he has imessage on that can in theory be hacked just the other day i had texts going to one phone and not to another because my phone used the wrong icloud account
creepyPMs,not_removed,that sounds possible he has an iphone i have an android if that is all this is im going to feel very silly but relieved
creepyPMs,not_removed,right that wouldnt surprise me hes mentioned before that people generally treat their phones like personal phones i would think that if they would give him a talkingto or a warning about inappropriate phone use instead of creepymessaging his wife thats what freaks me out about all this
creepyPMs,not_removed,that sounds possible he has an iphone i have an android if that is all this is im going to feel very silly but relieved
creepyPMs,not_removed,update thats exactly what it was i feel dumb
creepyPMs,not_removed,you never know it is full of weirdos source i work in it and deal with weirdos all the time anyhoo i think the lesson has been learned do not sext your husband to a company phone not only the device is company property but also the info contained on it messages emails security tokens etc
creepyPMs,not_removed,glad you figured it out
creepyPMs,not_removed,so we tested the iphone emoji theory and thats exactly what it was man i feel dumb i didnt think the nsa would want to look at my saggy old tits anyway
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont you feel dumb its always best to err in the side of caution and be a bit paranoid regarding your privacy not nsa levels but it weirdo levels 😊
creepyPMs,not_removed,did he just brag about paying for sex
creepyPMs,not_removed,the best part is when he admit the only a girl will be with him is if he pays her also she should charge him extra everytime he talks
creepyPMs,not_removed,how does one suck at orgasms
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive got a really hard time understanding why the heck people tend to just message someone and start spouting off all this sort of madness i mean if the guy were interested in you seems like hes going about it the wrong way
creepyPMs,not_removed,im going to embroider sexually liberated feminist whore on a pillow thats just gold
creepyPMs,not_removed,yuck please report that craziness
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow what a pleasant guy lolglad you dont let it bother you too much
creepyPMs,not_removed,well he tried to bad you arent insecure
creepyPMs,not_removed,also poly also get hate for it im sorry you had to put up with this bs op
creepyPMs,not_removed,what the fuck did he even say
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive always wanted the orgask of my dreams wistful sigh
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh every time i think hey ill try out online dating again lol nope
creepyPMs,not_removed,jokes on him most of the poly people i know are no younger than
creepyPMs,not_removed,well op is your bf good at orgask
creepyPMs,not_removed,why hide his user name
creepyPMs,not_removed,he has so much rage im betting it actually makes him impotent and he cant get off
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus christthis is real
creepyPMs,not_removed,as a fellow poly person solidarity even with okcupid dating isnt easy
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats true people like that arent even worth it
creepyPMs,not_removed,im so sorry but orgask had me cracking up sounds like the name of a sub that would exist on here
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit what a nice guy howd he get your number is that how okc works if so deleting account asap thxs for sharing your horror story btw
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah and it was so weird he was basically like ill have you know i cant get it unless i pay for it and that was supposed to make him sound superior he just kept sounding lonelier and more bitter about it as time went on very obvious he wants what op has
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats why she sits on his face so she doesnt have to listen to him talk
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes so proud of it too
creepyPMs,not_removed,is dirt cheap too legal brothels stateside run you several hundreds does he live in the actual philippines or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes yes wait dammit i think i did that wrong consults orgasm manual i knew it totally wrong
creepyPMs,not_removed,its like saying you suck at having period
creepyPMs,not_removed,it makes me think of a toddler pulling a girls hair because he likes her and wants to get her attention
creepyPMs,not_removed,me too please
creepyPMs,not_removed,fun feminist crafts
creepyPMs,not_removed,id buy one of those
creepyPMs,not_removed,id buy one too
creepyPMs,not_removed,id like one also
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would also like one
creepyPMs,not_removed,love it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think anyone in their right mind would ever take that dude seriously
creepyPMs,not_removed,also a poly male and there is such a stigma the assumption is that if youre a poly guy youre cheating if youre a poly girl youre loose easy and will sleep with anyone sorry youre getting hated on for it
creepyPMs,not_removed,hi i cant tell if you mean that as why did you shut him down what did he even say or i cant believe thats what he said could you clarify
creepyPMs,not_removed,because its against site rules as well as sub rules to reveal identifying information we dont want to incite a hunt check this link for more reasoning
creepyPMs,not_removed,that screen is their mobile chat function no numbers exchanged
creepyPMs,not_removed,im going to guess hes lying even about that sad bit of data and is too much of a coward to even venture outside to pay for sex
creepyPMs,not_removed,orgasm manual kek
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes yes wait dammit i think i did that wrong consults orgasm manual i knew it totally wrong orgask
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am bad at have period i am boy am period cum out of penis or bum or testicles is n no period yet help pls
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats probably about the mental development level of a toddler
creepyPMs,not_removed,or that if youre a poly guy you cant please your woman thats why she wants to step out absurd its all good though this person is clearly a lunatic
creepyPMs,not_removed,also poly guy very lucky that i dont associate with anyone who has this mentality around poly relationships and the women ive been with have been open and respectful i also dont use the internet to meet people so that may help not a slam on datingmeetup site users
creepyPMs,not_removed,yup poly guy here that assumption just fucks over my dating life in a small town
creepyPMs,not_removed,i meant wow he sounds like a fucking idiot
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh i see thxs very new to the online dating scene
creepyPMs,not_removed,yo your comment is a little backwards the misogyny is the problem here not the facesitting
creepyPMs,not_removed,well a correct orgask is hard to achieve
creepyPMs,not_removed,as someone whos worked with toddlersthis is pretty uncalled for they play with their own poop but they dont do this kind of shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks for the clarification
creepyPMs,not_removed,how is babby formed
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep
creepyPMs,not_removed,when a whore lets a chad pee in her butt i think but i could be getting my subs mixed up
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive never said anything hurtful says a bunch of hurtful things ive never said anything hurtful
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus christ its amazing how hes the one upset because you arent nurturing him through not being a shitty person every step of the way how selfentitled can you be good job breaking away from an abusive friend its never easy
creepyPMs,not_removed,he keeps going on about how he hasnt said anything hurtful to you today so how can you still be bothered by shit he said before as he calls you crazy in every other sentence dont you know he is special and gets to be forgiven each morning for the shit he did s this guy is delusional glad you cut him out
creepyPMs,not_removed,and just when i thought i didnt understand what gaslighting was i see this
creepyPMs,not_removed,supreme mommy issues with this one wake up call its not up to your female friends to nurture you nurture yourself get therapy find a support group join a meetup group have some goals and work towards them youre not a plant you dont deserve to get watered and fertilized youre a person sheesh
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is some max level gaslighting stay strong
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre crazy seriously crazy like so crazy super crazy echoes endlessly in the empty space inside his head while he talks to himself
creepyPMs,not_removed,says a bunch of hurtful things
creepyPMs,not_removed,he doesnt think those hurtful things are actually hurtful it says a lot about him
creepyPMs,not_removed,but he didnt do anything today
creepyPMs,not_removed,my mother used to be like that dumping all her work and relationship related trouble on me and getting angrycalling me a leech when i didnt want to listen and comfort her the fudge woman i was what was i supposed to do but depend on her for my livelihood i often used to be depressed because i got bullied in school when it was exceptionally obvious shed try to go for being motherly and would sit me down asking whats wrong after a maximum of around minutes shed just stop me saying something along the lines of thats enough for now this is putting me in a bad mood didnt stop until i totally exploded on her and told her to either dump her shit on her friends and boyfriend who can actually relate to her problems or id move to my grandparents we saw each other at most during dinner until i graduated and moved out
creepyPMs,not_removed,when i first read this what with him going on about how hes being blamed for things he did in the past i thought i didnt do anything today was his way of saying he hadnt done anything in the present and that op was just going off on him for stuff that happened months ago i mean of course i took today at face value at first but i thought no way he seriously means to use i didnt do anything today literally to absolve himself of things he did very recently then i read that he threatened to kill himself op and ops friends the day before this conversation how could i have been so naive
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes holy shit youre weird pisses me off so much i know sometimes friends say it in jest but its also something manipulators use to make you question yourself and break down your self esteem and the way he says it with mock concern ugh this guy is trash and im so glad op is getting rid of him
creepyPMs,not_removed,not to sound like dr phil but the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour wishing hed go back to being the friend you valued wont make it so and hes showing you who he is this is who he is people should enhance your life and you deserve that im glad youre done with that mess and hope you stick to it even though its hard besides if he thinks youre so awful he should be glad youre not in his life anymore plus ditto what everyone else here has said now go put your time and feelings into nice people people being nice to you is a pretty basic expectation not some unrealistic demand to put on someone oh and they should be nice to you every day not just for the minutes since they woke up today omg what an ass
creepyPMs,not_removed,im so glad you got out i dated this kind of person for years
creepyPMs,not_removed,i totally read that first line in dr phils voice the best preedictor of future beehayvyor ees past beehayvyor
creepyPMs,not_removed,totally missed a title opportunity i turned the stables
creepyPMs,not_removed,what the hell is wrong with people only creeps would look at that photo a completely innocent photo and still manage to turn it into something sexual
creepyPMs,not_removed,outfuckingstanding and this students is how you keep a creeper at bay
creepyPMs,not_removed,xd he couldnt take it
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol love that you gave him no room to give a douchebag reply and turned it immediately into him being uncomfortable about bestiality well done
creepyPMs,not_removed,golf clap i say good form op top marks
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg op youre my new hero i work in the animal care field and i frequently get creepers joking about bestiality when i tell them what i do or the sexy nurse thing ugghh you totally just gave me a new tactic to dealing with them genius
creepyPMs,not_removed,admittedly if hes in the following states he may still have a chance with his equine lover hawaii kentucky nevada new hampshire new jersey new mexico ohio vermont west virginia and wyoming are all lacking in laws according to wikipedia be sure to tell him if he replies
creepyPMs,not_removed,quietly hands over a medal to op
creepyPMs,not_removed,and missing out on a golden opportunity to compare his dick to a horses what an unimaginative creep tsktsk
creepyPMs,not_removed,bwua nice p
creepyPMs,not_removed,slow clap
creepyPMs,not_removed,what is this app
creepyPMs,not_removed,that was amazing
creepyPMs,not_removed,wild applause
creepyPMs,not_removed,what did he expect how in the hell do you turn this animal is cute into something sexual unless youre into bestiality i just i would ask why i always think fucking men when reading creepy pms but i already know why fucking men
creepyPMs,not_removed,brilliant
creepyPMs,not_removed,that was awesome table turning
creepyPMs,not_removed,hay now lets not start a pun thread here
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive shared photos of pet stick insects and had people go mm sexy people are fucking weird
creepyPMs,not_removed,bojack disagrees
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had a yahoo id for a rp group years ago asterthearabianmare or some shit like that the amount of creeps who wanted an arabian beauty or wanted to talk about horse fucking was way too high i have no idea how they found me half the time
creepyPMs,not_removed,neither could mr hands
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes probably bitter op shut him down so fast that he didnt get a chance
creepyPMs,not_removed,its whisper
creepyPMs,not_removed,i find this a really great commentary and reflection of myself when i come here majority of creepy pms are male being creepy af some are violent manipulative gtfo call the police i think they may have a mental illness disorder level that kicks my gut instinct into gear there are also submissions in minority that are female some are creepy af but most hit the i think they may have a mental illness disorder violent manipulative gtfo call the police that kicks gut instinct into gear note mental illness or disorder is no excuse for being creepy i think what im trying to say is men and women can be creepy is just that this harmless ignorant flirty misplaced creepiness feels far more prevalent in men and taken far less seriously by men maybe by women but not in the same waywe get used to it you know we can label them douchebag infinity i honestly think a lot of men appearing her would be thrilled if a woman initiated a conversation with them like that spew im also not meaning to portray women creeps as crazy in my earlier comparison but as mentioned some men are cool with the female version of their creepy comeons so its not likely to posted here until things have progressed women definitely still are creeps to other women regardless of sexuality its just different because we are familiar with it already theres definitely still a likeness between make and female creepiness but a huge hugs difference as well i wish i could articulate myself better and hope my words and wording hasnt offended
creepyPMs,not_removed,the guy took something innocent and turned it creepy all op did was turn it back on him even as a joke it sort of crossed a line
creepyPMs,not_removed,do you frequently joke about bestiality are they ever regarded as funny
creepyPMs,not_removed,gonna have to go ahead and say neigh to a pun thread
creepyPMs,not_removed,i want to know what goes through the heads of people who see a photo of an animal insect ect and go hmmmhow can i turn this around and talk about my penis
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg you have pet stick insects
creepyPMs,not_removed,bojack is the one exception
creepyPMs,not_removed,so more people like mr hands do existgreat
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you for putting that horrible sound back in my head
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just watched a horse go through a person
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was anonymously dropped off at the enumclaw community hospital on july a man asked hospital staff for medical assistance for his companion pinyan was found dead in the emergency room aged the man who brought pinyan into the hospital had disappeared by the time hospital staff came to contact him yeah i get that httpsenmwikipediaorgwikimrhands
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre completely right im a guy and im absolutely not offended im bi and ive experienced male and female creep before and the majority of creeps absolutely are men many men not only feel entitled to womens bodies but also other men if they swing that way there are obviously women who feel the same way but women are less likely to pose an actual threat to me if im conscious at least and yeah mental illness is not a good enough excuse i hope that mentally ill people can get the help they need but when their behaviours threaten the safety of others their needs should be considered secondary to those they are actively harming
creepyPMs,not_removed,especially to someone that you just metdont know very well
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeahhh thats enough horsing around for one comment thread im drawing in the reins on this
creepyPMs,not_removed,i want to know what goes through the heads of people who see a photo of an animal insect ect and go hmmmhow can i turn this around and talk about my penis funny you should ask you see my penis thinks thats a sexy question im going to pm you a picture of him so you two can talk about it s way too fucking easy i dont even own a penis
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont i want to remain blissfully ignorant p
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had macleays spectre stick insects two of them theyve since passed
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you so much for including your experience ive found some women can also feel entitled to other womens bodies but they are more a minority and often called on it
creepyPMs,not_removed,anonguy said something creepy that was inappropriate and op responded accordingly what do you want op to respond with at least this way maybe he will think twice before making a joke to someone he may not know about being into bestiality
creepyPMs,not_removed,could have owned up to it instead of getting heated though
creepyPMs,not_removed,it doesnt make it any less creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,horse
creepyPMs,not_removed,where does one buy a penis
creepyPMs,not_removed,my condolences
creepyPMs,not_removed,likely because calling a woman out on shit behaviour is less dangerous to your person than doing the same with a guy most guys i know have crazy ex stories but usually theyre like oh this girl broke my playstation or she slept with my friend most women i know have a crazy ex story that involves getting beat up or stalked for a year to the point where she had to move to a different province those stories are less fun to tell your friends
creepyPMs,not_removed,why the long face everyone
creepyPMs,not_removed,craigslist probably
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,very true youre forgetting the ones who arent alive to tell their crazy ex stories
creepyPMs,not_removed,come on guys its pony harmless puns
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think id want a used penis just too personal a thing kinda like getting underwear off of craigslist i usually get mine online or at babeland there are some good options out there
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just wish they were alive and didnt have those stories
creepyPMs,not_removed,please remember to tag materials like this as nsfw thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,he must have really wanted to believe those belonged to a woman what a creep

creepyPMs,not_removed,fucking amazing
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is fucking lit
creepyPMs,not_removed,what was that nude you sent him anyways
creepyPMs,not_removed,seriously it was pretty obvious from the get go that they were male chest photos id love to see if he replies
creepyPMs,not_removed,dude deserves a gold star for his imagination i have no idea how he couldve even begun to convince himself those were lady breasts
creepyPMs,not_removed,somehow i dont think this guy has seen many real ones to compare with
creepyPMs,not_removed,and the hands definitely looked like man hands
creepyPMs,not_removed,cis womans
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i wouldnt even be mad at that reveal
creepyPMs,not_removed,no unfortunately he never replied he saw the message and i think stopped using the throwaway account
creepyPMs,not_removed,even if he hasnt seen them in person im sure hes seen them in porn it should be pretty obvious that theyre a dudes
creepyPMs,not_removed,what the fuck you werent even rude
creepyPMs,not_removed,i havent been to this sub in ages but i remember it being much more trans inclusive than it is now im sorry youre getting downvoted
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not sure how people can see this and not think societys at least a bit unfair to transnon binary people
creepyPMs,not_removed,welcome to reddot com front page of the internet 🙃🙃🙃
creepyPMs,not_removed,to be fair i knew it was a man just because this is rcreepypms and im guessing the overlap of ladies who send titty pics to anonymous creeps who bug them incessantly and ladies who post here is fairly small i wouldnt take a small correction as overly critical just a minor tip to be more inclusive
creepyPMs,not_removed,its not that you meant to hurt anyone that is apparent from your comment just know that there are trans women out there who are probably self conscious about this kind of thing heck even cis women night look at those pictures and think oh no do i have square breasts one of the ways we can get rid of what is currently rigidly traditionally feminine is to change our language to be more inclusive
creepyPMs,not_removed,i never said you were attacking anybody i was simply trying to correct your comment to be a bit more sensitive
creepyPMs,not_removed,the attitude here has changed recently im not sure what happened but the inclusiveness its definitely gone
creepyPMs,not_removed,at least i guess edit
creepyPMs,not_removed,because they live comfortably in their own bodies and dont give a fuck about anybody else
creepyPMs,not_removed,is it i guess i dont go outside often enough if someone doesnt want to call me she or use my name because its feminine and they know im biologically male then theyre either heavily religious or an asshole and i dont think taking those things personally is productive to the way i feel
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats true i am a ciswoman who didnt get breasts until i was like and they balloned when i started giving birth and breast feeding they sort of deflated after that lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,continuing on to sensitivity wouldnt this whole post be insensitive technically its about tricking a man into believing that what he is seeing is a woman but infact is really a man since your saying we shouldnt assume a gender based on preconceived notion of what a specific gender should look like this is not an attack its curiosity since this is a sensitive subject at what is it okaynot okay to make fun of gender
creepyPMs,not_removed,to be fair the community here is still quite inclusive and the rules are still crafted to make this a more inclusive place for minorities we also do have mods who are trans you must also consider that when a post receives hundreds or thousands of upvotes it will trend higher on rall and bring people not familiar or normally part of the community here which can really skew how the community looks or how votes are reflected please continue to report any comments that violate the rules and message the mods if you feel like there is a growing trend
creepyPMs,not_removed,your username is the name of a song by a band i like i mean spelled differently of course
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wont pretend to know any individuals experience better than they do but i dont think im the only one who knows otherwise notcompletelyassholeish people that say oh i just cant handle pronouns and intentionally use the wrong ones that said i typed that comment when the parent was at so at least i have some more hope for reddit now
creepyPMs,not_removed,the biggest thing that makes me feel like the community has changed is people using ableist slurs the r slur specifically in their messages with people fairly often and no one calls them out on it are those messages something to report
creepyPMs,not_removed,the reason why it was downvoted was probably because its totally unrelated to the original comment ops comment was not an attack on gender identity they were pointing out the physical difference between a male and female body not their gender
creepyPMs,not_removed,one percent is seventy million people about three times the population of london its a vast number of people also its probably more like two percent
creepyPMs,not_removed,criticizing the way op handles a creep encounter is also bannable so no probably not
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes they are something to report
creepyPMs,not_removed,well dont you lead a charmed life maybe meat some of your sisters who have been harassed
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i figured because something similar happened when an op said sex work was degrading or something like that its really depressing to come on here and see people using slurs like they dont mean anything and still see the sub called inclusive somehow
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not engaging your other comments on the topic either way one its a slur using it as an insult given its history and the history of mental illnesses disorders and delays and the way retarded people have been treated in the past and are treated now makes it a slur like any slur its the history and present use that makes it one its extremely depressing to see people using it as an insult in the same day and age that people with autism developmental delays etc are still called retards by strangers authority figures parents and teachers and even doctors the it means something else now has no validity until it stops being used toward people in seriousness and until the people it effected in history are no longer stigmatized by the word two the medical use of it is outdated if a professional uses it you know not to see them anymore because theyre not up to date on whats current thats a big red flag
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment has been removed in accordance with httpiimgurcomvkforaspng httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,no you are being downvoted because of your snottty attitude and your implication that anyone who has been harassed must be some hyper sensitive snowflaque
creepyPMs,not_removed,you can shut up now thanks im glad you dont experience shitty treatment but that doesnt give you the right to judge other people for not wanting to give or get it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i didnt thats why i used the word personally i was never talking about other people only my personal experience and opinion
creepyPMs,not_removed,when you say something like i dont know why anyone would feel x way about y it comes off like i think youre an idiot if you dont feel the way i do about this maybe you should work on your communication skills in that case you may not have meant anything harmful butwell i just explained how that could still go wrong so
creepyPMs,not_removed,you could have explained that to me in your first comment instead of throwing you can shut up now thanks at me someone isnt going to want to engage with you when you open with something rude like that just present your valid pointreasoning from the start
creepyPMs,not_removed,the irony here is incredibly laughable
creepyPMs,not_removed,what irony im telling you that a civil conversation doesnt involve being purposefully rude which i have not done okay yes i get it you find what i said offensive because you thought i was talking about all minorities you cant reevaluate your position now that i have clarified what i actually meant
creepyPMs,not_removed,the irony that you were being downvoted in the first place because you came off as rude and youre attempting to lecture me on not coming off rude i didnt mistake your comments as applying to all minorities i said that your phrasing made people feel like you felt any other transperson shouldnt feel offended by certain things because you personally had not experienced them and thus were not offended by them im supposed to be acting like the adult here so im going to end my part in this conversation now have a good night
creepyPMs,not_removed,and as we all know nothing makes someone change their mind like harassing them with images and links they dont want to see
creepyPMs,not_removed,i made a comment on here about how child porn is wrong and got downvoted to hell then messaged by this pedo guy mocking me its creepy the amount of people who think jacking off to abused children is cool
creepyPMs,not_removed,an art site recently banned drawn material depicting underaged characters in adult situations because they realized it was scaring off a lot of artists cue the push back from people whom immediately threatened to leave the site if said material was banned blaming and harassing artists all the while
creepyPMs,not_removed,man the amount of people on here who try defend stuff like that is pretty disturbing
creepyPMs,not_removed,on circlebroke once i made a post about how people in a sub were defending drawn cp wait a day and suddenly the full pedo defense squad attacked the post
creepyPMs,not_removed,pedo image like contraband
creepyPMs,not_removed,and following me around subreddits and social media trying to defend drawn child porn doesnt make them look like nolife pedophiles at all
creepyPMs,not_removed,hello mod here please send us a screen cap of the unedtited message you relieved and we will take care of it thank you very much
creepyPMs,not_removed,does his username start with a t because i think the same guy messaged me
creepyPMs,not_removed,holy shit theres people that seriously think looking at year olds is fine because theyre drawn as animals wow remind me to stop giving my buddy a hard time about liking girls feet
creepyPMs,not_removed,afuckingmen
creepyPMs,not_removed,these people are weirdly defensive for people who will swear up and down that theyre not doing anything wrong
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you seriously think that looking at year olds isnt pedophilia because they have tails or some shit you need help
creepyPMs,not_removed,nope a j
creepyPMs,not_removed,t is actually probably the person in the screenshot hes following me around reddit i reported him to the relevant subreddits
creepyPMs,not_removed,he messaged me last night too with some link i and whining about being blocked like yeah i reported you and now youre blocked wtf is wrong with these people
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy messaged me too ended with him apologising
creepyPMs,not_removed,really
creepyPMs,not_removed,the cherry picked fetish was pedophilia just because they are anthropomorphic animals doesnt change that people with that fetish are specifically interested in the children of whatever weird type of furry shit theyre into youre in here defending pedophilia related fetishists stop rape and gore is also pretty gross however wanting to fuck children is a dangerous fetish and i fucking promise extends past cheetahs with tits for most of those people the odds of those people consuming child pornography is much higher than gore enthusiasts stabbing strangers to fuck their neck hole you know there is a difference get therapy edit omfg i just got creepy pms because of comments i made on rcreepypms the circle is complete send me hate mail all you want i didnt create the definition of pedophile its not my fault you fit it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know if help could help people like this i think their brain is just wired to be a nasty gross piece of shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,he keeps sending me furry porn links to prove he doesnt just like cub porn
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey mod here please please send us an unedtited screen cap of the poster who messaged you and we will deal with them in short order
creepyPMs,not_removed,whatthefuck dude seriously if you really think that its ok to see a kid like that you need help in all honesty if you think that it would be aok to say that paragraph in public and think people would agree with you you lost it
creepyPMs,not_removed,well that sure speaks of a man of excellent character closing sarcasm tag stories high
creepyPMs,not_removed,do i reply to this or send you a pm
creepyPMs,not_removed,please send it through modmail cheers
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think you understand what neutral means trying to convince people that its okay that you like jacking off to watching child pornography just because they have fucking bunny ears is not in fact a neutral argument
creepyPMs,not_removed,part of me wishes i could see the nowdeleted arguments and the rest of me is glad that i cant because i dont have a prescription for anything to bring down my blood pressure
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey op your post has been removed because you didnt block out the profile picture you can resubmit once youve done so
creepyPMs,not_removed,desperately trying to push a tacosvaginas conversation but so high he keeps getting distracted by thoughts of actual food
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was trying so hard to be creepy and sexualize food but he was too high to follow through at least his stomach has top billing over his dong when it comes to conversations not that it makes it ok it just makes him easy to mess with
creepyPMs,not_removed,its so sad when a straight boys are too distracted by their dicks to ask the real questions for instance would you share your favourite soup recipe
creepyPMs,not_removed,fuck id love to join a couple for tacos people with a pretty much guarantee of no drama count me in
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive been considering getting a whisper is it worth the creeps
creepyPMs,not_removed,did you make the dough yourself for the pizza is it rising under that cloth
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hate to say this but all the perverse lusty creepers ruined whisper for me on the bright side ill join anyone for tacos
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think im going to keep sending him photos of food ive made and never send him anything else
creepyPMs,not_removed,there are aloooooot of creeps misogynists racists etc if you like engaging them then it can be fun im trans and the trans community on whisper was fairly good although i posted one selfie and i got flooded with chasers
creepyPMs,not_removed,there is dough under the cloth although im using a packet in that picture sauce is home made though
creepyPMs,not_removed,in all honesty if i was as high as this kid thatd be just as good as getting laid id be so confused but pleasantly surprised haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,its kind of cute honestly hes trying to be tactful enough to not say anything outright id keep feeding it and see where it goes no pun intended
creepyPMs,not_removed,shrug i think ill stick with what ive got
creepyPMs,not_removed,ohhh yum it sucks that you had to deal with a creeper but i bet dinner was delicious
creepyPMs,not_removed,indeed this conversation made me rather hungry and curious about ops pizza sauce sure sure lesbians tacos sour cream whatever you making crust in that cast iron
creepyPMs,not_removed,i do make my crust in cast iron its the best way
creepyPMs,not_removed,roopsdidntmeanto
creepyPMs,not_removed,not to mention he wrote holland instead of the netherlands thats to me his biggest fauxpas
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was almost proud of this guy because i misread that that was a dumb question alas no such thing i am disillusioned once more hehe
creepyPMs,not_removed,as opposed to a dumb dick friend he has different body part friends
creepyPMs,not_removed,reply oh i just saw your messages and was excited when you sent the first one too bad it was sent by your friend i really wanted that sex l
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like the word naughty should only be used for naughty children or pets it doesnt sound right for an adult it creeps me out when guys use it to mean sexual things like have you been naughty as if sex is something bad or to be ashamed of
creepyPMs,not_removed,are u feeling aroused by this convo no i am not ok bye
creepyPMs,not_removed,the only person allowed to say naughty like that is the guy on courage the cowardly dog
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think it could work in a bdsm context with the whole punishment thing but yeah unless someones chained to the bed awaiting a spanking have you been naughty is just weird similarly someone trying to get me to go home with them once asked if i was dirty i was like wtf no i showered before i came out weirdo
creepyPMs,not_removed,with you on that i feel like that word has been ruined for me
creepyPMs,not_removed,my girlfriend uses it but if you heard it in her accent it might be a bitdifferent for you creeps ruin everything
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think this fits because he did the same thing a lot of creeps on here do he started by calling a stranger a pet name after being corrected on that he went on to pay a compliment that the op reacted to with no hint of interest k and then he went into detail about it then he brought up being naughty in a conversation about interesting people like come on who equates naughty with interesting then once again op expresses no interest in this in fact actual distaste for talking about naughty things and instead of getting this and moving on the guy keeps trying to make his point that being naughty is a thing tldr its creepy cause he gave a pet name then kept wanting to talk about being naughty also he should pick up on ops disinterest and move on
creepyPMs,not_removed,i get what youre saying but lets look at all the other guys on shown on this sub like really how many times has saying im not interested or dont say worked with these guys imagine you are these girls and day in day out on these sites you get guys ignoring those responses at a certain point you just go to being harsh and or just not responding at all plus looking at this post we all know in this context k means shes not interested like it might as well be in big bold letters and underlined but instead of seeing that disinterest and moving along this guy continues to push his naughty agenda
creepyPMs,not_removed,this made me laugh surgery doctor from texas of america
creepyPMs,not_removed,glod bless that surgery doctor

creepyPMs,not_removed,dont worry youre the most beautiful creature that he hasnt seen
creepyPMs,not_removed,compliment of the season ugh i wish a surgery doctor would notice me like that i am most concerned that he still uses hotmail
creepyPMs,not_removed,a surgery doctor from texas of americaand i am a unicorn mythical from dream world of imagination land
creepyPMs,not_removed,was compliment of the season supposed to be a line of code that loads the current seasons most popular compliment
creepyPMs,not_removed,big deal dude people only care about the texas of canada
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is obviously a scam guys hes from texas of america come on
creepyPMs,not_removed,sn some of the surgery residents ive met are huge creeps and probably have shown up in this sub before so i dont think it is so farfetched
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont know what creeps me out the most the weird doctor or someone still using a hotmail account
creepyPMs,not_removed,my grandmama lives in texas of america im just gonna start doing that for every state now
creepyPMs,not_removed,can we please get a glod bless flair
creepyPMs,not_removed,a surgery doctor doesnt sound like a real position maybe he means surgeon
creepyPMs,not_removed,glod bless
creepyPMs,not_removed,hard pass
creepyPMs,not_removed,why somebody think referring to a woman as a creature beautiful or not is a compliment its straight dehumanization a typical tactic of the mrm
creepyPMs,not_removed,seems legit
creepyPMs,not_removed,surgery doctor from texas of america never heard of that company
creepyPMs,not_removed,surgery doctor does he mean surgeon or guy who cuts his victims apart to make them harder to find
creepyPMs,not_removed,if that is not made into flair soon i just dont know what ill do with myself anymore
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol if that doesnt give it away the skype and the hotmail will
creepyPMs,not_removed,surgery doctors are my favorite kind of doctorsand my favorite kind of surgeons
creepyPMs,not_removed,from texas of america
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think that person is a native speaker either no one would say surgery doctor or from texas of america
creepyPMs,not_removed,ill guess he is trying to reference eve being made out of adams rib
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe theyre referring to the bible where god created woman from a single rib from a man i think thats how it went
creepyPMs,not_removed,its one of those mass spam emails sort of like the prince of nigeria needing money to give you his riches this is just in the form of a supposed surgery doctor in texas of america they send you their email information so that you can email them through that and at some point theyll try to scam you i see this on a dating site im on all the time best that you report it as spam andor fake user if possible or block them and yes the rib reference is in reference to the bible they like to use christian based wordsphrases to appeal to the general average american christian
creepyPMs,not_removed,native english speaker here uk and i have no idea what he means by the rib reference overall confused and creeped out for you
creepyPMs,not_removed,its biblical adam have his rib to god to create eve because he was lonely
creepyPMs,not_removed,my guess is that he means that in some sort of relation to the story in the bible that god took a rib from adam and made it into eve so i guess he means that you are eve to his adam the part of him that was missing and is now returned to him to make him whole
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think the ribs is a biblical reference since eve was supposed to have been made from one of adams ribs hes saying he found the woman who completes him his perfect match hes just saying it very poorly
creepyPMs,not_removed,i guess that makes me a minnesotamerican
creepyPMs,not_removed,alberta
creepyPMs,not_removed,but only if they are from texas of america
creepyPMs,not_removed,its like a winwin
creepyPMs,not_removed,good point indeed but it makes the whole message even more strange to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,well i thought about it too because of the reference to hands of god on the other side it might be also related to his job idk maybe he loves restoring the ribs of his patients
creepyPMs,not_removed,that was my guess
creepyPMs,not_removed,great thanks for explanation honestly i feel better knowing its a spam not a creepy surgeon browsing my fb profile
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks i feel better about my english now and a bit worse about the messaged
creepyPMs,not_removed,bratac hammond of texas
creepyPMs,not_removed,hello dear im a guy and i cringe when i read this cant imagine how a girl would feel
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe rib restoring is some sort of fetish we dont know about only this weird man will truly know the answer d
creepyPMs,not_removed,shit checks out
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah it gives the creepy crazy old man kind of vibe im glad the profile was deleted before i got an opportunity to read it thanks facebook for filtering my messagesd
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is how they write in india and other south asian countries it means nothing really ill take a wild guess and say he is indian and living in the us as a surgeon since a huge south asian population is in dallas im going to venture to guess that area the god mention also fits with south asian culture
creepyPMs,not_removed,it might bed i am actually glad ill never have to find out
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive dealt with a lot of indians and south asians who message me and im pretty sure your suspicion is accurate
creepyPMs,not_removed,if he were a surgeon practicing in the united states even if english werent his first language he would know that they are called surgeons and not surgery doctors and he would know that you just say texas not texas of america although i absolutely love that now when i was on ok cupid id get tons of these types of copypastes frequently from men pretending to be american a lot pretending to be military officers but doctors were also common i read up on a bit apparently a lot of them are nigerian scammers
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like that he felt the need to defend that he doesnt go to bars as if that were at all relevant and finally i confirmed that yes indeed the anonymity of the internet makes it okay to be creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i misread that as he was in bed after pitching a tent i was thinking wow that must have been a labour intensive tent
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dose ill bet you do
creepyPMs,not_removed,the mental image of someone trying to actually verbalize that message is confusing
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would have been so tempted to answer my day has been faggoty
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am offended this is if you claim i am a faggot you will put the apostrophe in the correct position
creepyPMs,not_removed,might as well open with ay fuck you lets grab coffee soon
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was once called a faggot on grindr because i turned a guy down wat i mean sure youre half right i guess if they called me a breeder that might make more sense but wat edit for those who dont know grindr is a dating app
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats quite the statement
creepyPMs,not_removed,this padawan has much to learn about negging
creepyPMs,not_removed,neggy neg follow with otherwise normal conversation nailed it this dum bich has no idea whats going on inside her head lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,it wasnt intentional lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,running your mouth really hit a nerve to some reason
creepyPMs,not_removed,just cuz ur pretty dont mean youre useful to anyone or anything in life well he does have a point there
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre like me i say what is on my mind i love how you say youre ugly as fuck lmfao
creepyPMs,not_removed,i said i was sorry you fucking bitchs
creepyPMs,not_removed,i find the people who brag about always saying whats on their mind are often not very well liked tact is considered a positive attribute by most
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh what a fucking moron how does such stupidity still exist kill it with fire
creepyPMs,not_removed,i could make you straight i know someone who can make you gay best come back ever mind if i use that line for any fuckboys that come my way
creepyPMs,not_removed,his constant emoji usage just screams look how cute and quirky and awkwardly charming i am no no youre really not
creepyPMs,not_removed,i honestly hate guys like this take no for a fucking answer and stop being so damn desperate low life sack of donkey dick
creepyPMs,not_removed,do thesecguys honestly believe we get wet at the mere sight of a random dick do they not understand how to arouse or please women at all
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think the double standard sailed right over his head hes sure he can turn you but doesnt want to see any other dicks even though hes so proud of his own
creepyPMs,not_removed,more gay women just need to see the right cock to make them realize that they love it i wish women would understand that this guy is a service to everyone online and you should look at his dick so you can see exactly what youre missing obviously this is a joke
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh you have clearly defined boundaries allow me to smash them with my dick
creepyPMs,not_removed,why do you just have a leg just chilling on the floor op i mean its a nice leg but still
creepyPMs,not_removed,god i hate it so much why do they do this why do they disrespect peoples sexual orientation they think they can change you but you cant change them fills me with rage
creepyPMs,not_removed,i can make you straight ugh ive heard this one too and it doesnt even make sense because im bi ill enjoy it so much ill want sex with men fucking groundbreaking
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wish we could get approximate locations ie nyc or tampa or smalltown usa it would be vastly more interesting
creepyPMs,not_removed,its so fucking infuriating when they keep pushing that their dick will turn a lesbian straight lets just turn it around shall we if a gay man pmd a straight man in this manner hed fucking lose his shit wouldnt he just imagine oh dude wtf im straight dont send me dickpics yeah well maybe i can turn you gay just have a look at my huge dick no dude go away why should a lesbian turn straight just for him this guy is clearly horny and idiot with a side of godcomplex
creepyPMs,not_removed,im remember when i was a kid and we had just got dial up and it was aol people could just randomly message you anytime id be looking animal fact or reading random shit and a message would pop up of some weirdos saying theyre somethings that wanted to sext id just write back im a something male with a huge cock too they would usually fuck off after i think the equivalent is to just say a pic saying here fine a pic of my pus and its a drippy cummy wiener no chicks or dudes in the shot just cocks just spam them with cock
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am totally behind this trend ive noticed of calling every person who ignores a no rapey all the thumbs up
creepyPMs,not_removed,you have nice leg op but only one leg the other oneeeeeeeeeh hopefully obvious s
creepyPMs,not_removed,shit like this makes me so angry
creepyPMs,not_removed,this kind of thing is so fucking rageinducing i dont know how anyone gets them ever manages to be calm in response like dude do you even conceive of the idea that if a guy couldnt make you gay you couldnt make a lesbian straight how does your logic even work wtf actually wait i do know how it works and its much worse than just being an idiot lesbianism is not a valid sexual orientation to these people because obviously if there is no penis in a relationship its not real right do i have that correct ugh ugh ugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,im almost always against the term fuckboy but i feel he earnt it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think its because either a they want to get a rise out of someone or b if i harass enough women like this one of them will eventually say yes edit spelling
creepyPMs,not_removed,i looooove how he completely missed the point and the hypocrisy when he proclaims that definitely wouldnt be the case as he loves pussy ops pussy in that convo apparently btw heres a pic of my dick you didnt want totes will change your sexual orientation should have followed up that line with a dickpic of your own op to follow through
creepyPMs,not_removed,go for it use any means to get these dudes away from you
creepyPMs,not_removed,his emoji usage annoyed me his thought process probablyi know im being a creep but maybe if i throw in enough emojis shell ignore my disgusting behavior s
creepyPMs,not_removed,or in this case wont take lesbian for an answer i dont know whether to classify this type of creep as pushing a fetish or having delusional magic dick syndrome
creepyPMs,not_removed,twists your nipples ° can i put it yet
creepyPMs,not_removed,they think that their dirty dick is different like every dude thinks they can pull out excalibur out of the stone
creepyPMs,not_removed,its by saying the magic words and doing a rain dance right
creepyPMs,not_removed,it actually really pissed me off that it didnt click with him like how can you be so stupid that your own reasoning fails you
creepyPMs,not_removed,there are seriously guys out there who just think lesbians are women who have had dud sexual experiences with men and just need some of the right kind of cock presumably theirs often talk of turning lesbians newsflash if a womans dating dated another woman she isnt necessarily a lesbian and having sex with mentioned woman just maybe perhaps might not have been entirely consensual sometimes buddy it blows my mind seriously thinking a womans sexuality centres around men and the experiences they have with them brainsplosion
creepyPMs,not_removed,might wanna slap an s on the end of that there
creepyPMs,not_removed,to smash them httpsgithubcomweffenigelthornberrybot
creepyPMs,not_removed,cause im a serial killer s i have one picture that shows me in shorts and my legs arent even the focus of the shot
creepyPMs,not_removed,literacy isnt their specialty
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey i noticed that you creeped on my friend you wana sum fuk s
creepyPMs,not_removed,they wouldnt see it as the same thing at all in fact a certain f lettered slur would probably be used
creepyPMs,not_removed,not to mention they would then want to commit violence against the guy in question for threatening their masculinity orwhatever the excuse is i dont even know
creepyPMs,not_removed,spamming with dick pics is really funny but i dont want to go out of my way to look at schlongs i really like pointing out their shitty logic and disgusting attitudes
creepyPMs,not_removed,the other one is super fucked up i mean people vom upon looking at it
creepyPMs,not_removed,me too thankfully dudes like this dont come around often
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was anything but calm talking to this fuckwad i usually get the angry shakes dealing with stuff like this shit some gay men dont see lesbians as valid because of a lack of dick but theyre rare
creepyPMs,not_removed,reminds me of a joke my dad used to tell two men are in a bar when an attractive young lady walks in one of them immediately turns to her and says hey wanna fuck and the woman promptly slaps him for making such a lewd suggestion the man next to him says wow that was pretty forward of you and the slapped man says yeah i say the same thing to every single woman who walks in here the other man says gosh you must get slapped a lot and the man replies true but i also get laid a lot growing up i realised it really isnt very funny but i guess thats the kind of gross logic these guys apply
creepyPMs,not_removed,one thats really really big and impressive though im not sure any are impressive theyre kinda weird
creepyPMs,not_removed,i saw a facebook thing once like in order to show how easy it is for your gay son to change his sexuality you should try being gay for a year to prove how easy it is
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think its a little bit of column a and a little bit of column b
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hate the entire idea that there is something wrong with gay people or that something made us this way and shit even if i could be straight i wouldnt want to be i love being gay sorry about the rant
creepyPMs,not_removed,bless you nigel thornbot
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh god lol i am currently a socio major at umd left econ in the spring and i feel like studying creepy behavior would be interesting is it culture self entitlement lack of parenting or too much parenting or maybe the wrong type of parenting certain types of personalities all of them combined these people suck but learning through their suckyness is important what makes people jerks would be an amazing paper
creepyPMs,not_removed,they look funny especially flaccid and in the how do i make it look bigger angle photos i reluctantly touched one that bent at a ° angle once
creepyPMs,not_removed,butbut thats different s
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is beautiful
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats a good point
creepyPMs,not_removed,id read the fuck outta that study i feel like entitlement is definitely a good part of it some lesbians and gay men have this mindset as well so looking at entitlement and such in the lgbtqia community could be interesting neil strauss writer of the pua handbook the game wrote the book the truth an uncomfortable book about relationships which could help with what youre doing also a few former niceguys™ and terps have talked about their previous mindsets that led to things like this so finding those could help as well sorry bout the wall of text
creepyPMs,not_removed,im a dude here and even i think genitalia of both genders looks kind of weird or unsightly when removed from a sexual context
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh fuckboys ugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont apologize with discussing stuff i love it i still have a mind that social sciences are still hard and vague to define because a lot of the stuff isnt testable do to the restrictions after the stanford prison experiment it was a shitty experiment for the record they needed to put in place safe guards and them not doing so did allow for data to be gathered but at the same time did a lot of psychological damage to those poor people ill see if i can find the book at the library i dont have a lot of money so i have been abusing the shit out of the internet for books ill be the first to profess not knowing much about the lgbt community i know there is a large divide between the lgb and the trans community tends to back the b but that information is i dont know if they are more or less united than previous its an wasis interesting divide and wonder if the separate cultures should be studied alone or if they should be combined regardless i no doubt think youll find more sexual aggressiveness in the male population not that its always truth biologically but most of our anecstors have the men traditionally more aggressive than the women as for straightmen i agree its entitlement and i guarantee that you would probably see a near equal divide among liberal and conservative people though conservatives are probably least likely to hide it i think youll also see a lot of factors but as an under grad i have zero access to that i could bring it to a ta or a doctors candidate but to collect the population itself and designing the experiment and data restrictions would be up to them
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know sometimes in a sexual context i can still be really turned off by penii more likely if i dont have an emotional attachment to them or dont have some insatiable desire to aggressively have penetrative sex everythings going great and then after a little bit of penis time yeah about that im sorry im really not feeling it anymore sometimes it feels like when the dick comes out theres usually this generic script that goes along with it and it centres around the dick and the needs attached to it and thats about it im just a supporting role prefer it when theres two leading actors who improvise with each other my sample size with vulvas vaginas and their owners isnt comparable to penii and their owners but its certainly always felt far far less scripted with the former
creepyPMs,not_removed,i guess you have to be kinda turned on for them to be interesting like the first time i accidentally saw one i was like why are people licking something plastic
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive seen some people pretend that the lgbtqia community is a big family but that is simply not the case bisexuals and pansexuals are seen as untrustworthy sentiments that bisexuals are cheaters and will cheat on you with the opposite sex or that they only do it for the attention are surprisingly common and profiles that say no bisexuals or some variant of that are common transphobia is strangely common from what ive seen ive heard things like transwomen arent women and shouldnt call themselves lesbians before actuallesbians is usually a nice place but you can find things like this on there usually downvoted but still there ive heard so much gross shit towards ace people that i wish i could unhear things like corrective rape and they face no discrimination ive seen some racist shit in the gay hookup community seeing things like no rice no chocolate or something similar is disgustingly common from what ive seen grindr is its own thing that deserves special mention there are a few posts here on creepypms from grindr now all of this is just from personal experience and things ive seen with my own four eyes and ymmv but jesus its also slowly getting better which is amazing
creepyPMs,not_removed,pretty much what i have heard its to be expected a lot of new tribes have the biggest problem with outsiders when finally being excepted by the current power structure because they have been hidden from public view for so long that they dont want to lose that new found acceptance its bad that its going on but historically speaking it should get better as they are go on there is a few historical groups that still havent been accepted black people in america the roma people in europe the sunni cant remember that other group because my brain is turning off right now group in islam the various mongoloid tribes in russia but hopefully these groups will finally be accepted as time goes on i guess my point is that new groups want to keep their acceptance acutally their is a community scene tv show that sums it up very well i will find it tonight when i get home the episode is called gay dean he comes out as a pansexual and is dropped from the schoolboard immediately its meant in jest but it shows you the ongoing uhh displacement of pansexuals in sociecty for him not just being gay its a mildly interesting scene that shows the intolerance towards these groups edit i have more to write but i am really tired and my mind is else where i am pretty sure these last minutes have mind repeating sleep now and this cup of coffee just isnt doing it for me
creepyPMs,not_removed,unfortunate i cant find the scene on youtube where he comes out as a pansexual but there is the lead up it bothers the hell out of him
creepyPMs,not_removed,time out romani people are still being ostracized in europe im sorry for being ignorant but i literally thought that died out after like the or
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah there was an article a few years back about french government abuse
creepyPMs,not_removed,hahahaso little at the base but it looks like its gonna pop like a pimple great response op
creepyPMs,not_removed,does his tattoo say use yourself
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like your response about his dick you just know hes gonna be insecure for a few weeks cuz of that lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,another digital sexual assualt arrest him and make him register as a sex offender lets see how many dick pics he sends then thats the solution that needs to be implemented
creepyPMs,not_removed,its kinda small isnt it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i freaking cracked up at pop like a pimple lmao
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was hoping it said use your brain as if he needed a reminder to not send unwanted dick pics to girls hes never even spoken to before that doesnt seem to work well
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe its a reminder that he should take care of his penis issues himself instead of trying to pester other human beings to allow him to use their bodies as a fleshlight for a couple minutes
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe it says use your head it makes sense given its location
creepyPMs,not_removed,too bad its upside down he mightve heeded it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really feel like this unsolicited dick pic thing needs to become a crime if it happened out in the world it would get them arrested
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats entirely too insightful for someone sending strangers dick pics
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think youre absolutely right
creepyPMs,not_removed,im so fucking done with guys trying the emotional manipulation route i was on a second date with a guy a couple days ago and he started sobbing out of nowhere saying youre never going to love me so im going to probably just jump off a bridge i wished him the best and excused myself from the table
creepyPMs,not_removed,impressive defence to gaslighting accusation oh you think im gaslighting you that sounds like the kind of thing a crazy person would do
creepyPMs,not_removed,you crafted ideas in your head about him op how dare you do what is literally the definition of thinking
creepyPMs,not_removed,not gaslighting just telling you youre creating false stories in your head in order to manipulate you duh
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am by no means a pro at tinder i dont even own a smart phone but there is one thing that seems pretty clear to me if youre going through some difficult stuff in your personal life stay off of casual hookup stuff if you simply cant stay away dont be surprised or angry when a person youve literally never spoken to before couldnt give two shits about your fragile mental state otherwise youre gonna have a bad time just like this creepo did
creepyPMs,not_removed,when people start speaking with the intent of being all mysterious and misunderstood it doesnt make me cringe or laugh it just makes me want to not be there i read this and just didnt want to be here anymore it genuinely repels me lmao
creepyPMs,not_removed,does my sob story turn you on baby
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus i didnt even know this was a subreddit and this is the first one i read im hooked its sad that some people are so unaware of how damaged and creepy they are
creepyPMs,not_removed,creep uses guilt trip its super ineffective creep fainted you win
creepyPMs,not_removed,wasnt gaslighting proceeds to gaslight
creepyPMs,not_removed,ill just stop wasting my breath good because you dont expend breath when you type so hopefully that means youll stop breathing altogether obvious joke is obvious
creepyPMs,not_removed,ex used to manipulate me into not hanging out with friends because he thought i was cheating and then once we broke up he cheated he called me threatening to commit suicide if i didnt forgive him and be his friend again i said i forgave him i didnt begrudgingly then never talked to him again
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wish these guys would start actually leaving the conversation when they said they were the first time
creepyPMs,not_removed,who the hell does that
creepyPMs,not_removed,that string of messaging truly has become formulaic hasnt it
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh but he does psychedelics you sure you dont wanna rethink this he seems super interesting s
creepyPMs,not_removed,okay cool goodbye forever
creepyPMs,not_removed,is it so hard to say im sorry if something i said turned you off is there anything i can do to make you reconsider and being open to accepting a no
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont you know theres a lot influencing his psyche hes clearly the real victim here
creepyPMs,not_removed,it seems really standard for both sexes to unmatch with someone for anything at the beginning
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is kind of sad
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah the beginning of a lifelong fulfilling and meaningful friendship or not
creepyPMs,not_removed,gaslighting doesnt look good on you i spat my drink out
creepyPMs,not_removed,i need a shower
creepyPMs,not_removed,so ill just save my breath breathes heavily on computer
creepyPMs,not_removed,actually i wasnt gaslighting you i was gaslight gaslight gaslight how how is this man real fling into the sun
creepyPMs,not_removed,dude its tinder fucking tinder chill pill comment directed at the guy not op
creepyPMs,not_removed,is it just me or am i the only one that gets irritated when people say something the affect of ill savewont waste my breath when typing a message not that ill spare my fingers andor thumbs this task is a better replacement
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not gaslighting but let me do the exact same thing again whatever you may call it this guy is a work
creepyPMs,not_removed,such slight whim
creepyPMs,not_removed,are we being brigaded bunch of really tense posters in here that appear to be antagonizing the conversation
creepyPMs,not_removed,glad im not the only one who wastes breath typing
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love how a good majority of these are always filled with multiple i guess ill just let you be since you dont like meare busywont give me a chance then they vomit an avalanche of words immediately after rinse and repeat at least times in the convo
creepyPMs,not_removed,i didnt realize people actually tried this hard
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wish i could be as sure of myself as this guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,he needs to lay off the peyote
creepyPMs,not_removed,but op dont you see that its your responsibility to help him a complete stranger on tinder feel better in a shitty time in his life s
creepyPMs,not_removed,wait no youre right let me sit on your face
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like your style op i quite like it
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not gaslgihting proceeds to gaslight its almost as if he doesnt know what that means or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,definitely emotional manipulation definitely creepy but gaslighting is a specific thing and that wasnt it
creepyPMs,not_removed,whatd he say to you on tinder
creepyPMs,not_removed,how the fuckity fucking fuck did this fucktard find your instagram did you leave your full name a location gps enabled for pics how
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow how full of yourself can a person be
creepyPMs,not_removed,he sounds like a serial killer about to snap
creepyPMs,not_removed,i reckon i know this fella if not dead set same deal crazy needy bloke
creepyPMs,not_removed,riamverysmart
creepyPMs,not_removed,he tried to gaslight by denying he was gaslighting
creepyPMs,not_removed,run run far away
creepyPMs,not_removed,not saying that this guy isnt crazy and manipulative but how is this gaslighting he never accuses you of being crazy he just plays the victim by saying hell go back to seeing death everywhere
creepyPMs,not_removed,let me share a quote dude its tinder dont take things so seriously
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont forget straight up emotional manipulation by implying youre personally responsible for me hurting myself
creepyPMs,not_removed,some people really need to seek out professional help i wish the best for them but i also wish they wouldnt take it out on women
creepyPMs,not_removed,on some level i feel bad because i have serious anxiety and i have those kind of intrusive thoughts virtually every time i go out on dates but you still dont fucking say that to another human being thats when he should have excused himself to go get his shit together and cry on his own its really tough to feel that way but its not your problem at all and whatever emotional issues hes having dont justify burdening some hapless second date with all of that ugh
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had a summer fling in college with a girl who like me was getting over a recent breakup just a fun rebound for both of us right things seemed fine until she started calling me at midnight saying she was going to jump off a bridge or cut herself open ended up going to her place many a night to find her with a bottle in one hand and kitchen knife in the other would not recommend
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had a roommate who pulled this shit im going to kill myself if she didnt get her way my response was always just dont make a mess
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah that guy needs help from a professional its not your job to take care of him so dont let that get to you its just a shitty way of him trying to guilt you to stay
creepyPMs,not_removed,waaaaaaaaattttt
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus christ
creepyPMs,not_removed,my so is bipolar i was the one helping her getting help dont write someone off just because they are emotional they might not have a choice in the matter but at the same time dont get into something you are not willing to deal with just try to understand why people are the way they are the fact that some people have problems should not make you turn around but if you are not ready or willing to deal with it then i suggest you tell them why you dont want to have anything to do with them and that they should get help this way you can help them without being a part of their life and hurting yourself im not saying you did the wrong thing but to me your comment made me think that you might have been dealing with a person who is undiagnosed with something and that can be dangerous to both you and him if left untreated be careful when writing someone off who seems off you never know what they are capable of that is what i want you to get from my comment
creepyPMs,not_removed,its like gaslightception
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know wtf was that shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,no gaslighting no gaslighting youre gaslighting
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not disagreeing i just dont quite understandhow is this an example of gaslighting
creepyPMs,not_removed,god i wish more people understood that dating a stranger isnt going to do much for your mental state i went on a date with a total nut once he was essentially just having a breakdown i dont have a car so i just had to sit through it but still insisted that he wanted to date me then he told me he loved me and then he told me his long term relationship of years had just ended weeks ago after dealing with hours of this bullshit and the date ended with him telling me he just isnt ready basically he threw himself into the dating pool hoping to find a woman that would fix him and was shocked to find out it wouldnt work
creepyPMs,not_removed,speaking of creepos nice user name
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol this is what i think every time i read something like on this sub this guys got game
creepyPMs,not_removed,soooo many people try this stuff and it doesnt even seem to matter in how many ways you try to tell them that its manipulative and a turn off these sorts of people just cant seem to understand that theres never a good reason for this sort of behaviour or that if you have so many issues maybe fucking keep it to yourself instead of unloading it onto strangersunsuspecting people
creepyPMs,not_removed,dude get out while you still can it goes from wow some guys on the internet can be super creepy haha to holy shit how many of them are there and finally jesus fuck does every guy on the internet want to wear a womans skin
creepyPMs,not_removed,check out the top rated of alltime posts on this sub and you will very quickly see just how damaged and creepy people certainly can be 😆
creepyPMs,not_removed,can someone tell me what gaslighting is genuinely have no idea what it is
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think you should look up gaslighting he is using emotional manipulation but it isnt gaslighting
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had a guy email me like that on okcupid on the platform thankfully but it was a lot of why wont you give me a chance what did i do wrong etc etc i told him he wasnt helping his case and looked desperate
creepyPMs,not_removed,im guessing that he gets lots of rejection doesnt get a lot of feedback he thinks he is entitled to feedback
creepyPMs,not_removed,seems prudent actually

creepyPMs,not_removed,my god i was just about to come correct op wagging my finger all like well actually thats not really gaslighting
creepyPMs,not_removed,read over this article and his messages still look like gaslighting to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,it seemed like gaslighting to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i was wondering about that
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean its stated in my bio that im not looking for anything serious
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not playing
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe this isnt the sub for you
creepyPMs,not_removed,and the rest of it literally told her that her thoughts are invalid the nonapology plus all the negging yikes
creepyPMs,not_removed,i went out with a guy who regardless of how many times i said he didnt have to and id rather not decided to take me to a really nice restaurant for a first date the check was and i asked to spilt it thats waaay too much to spend on a first date he insisted on paying it himself then the second the waitress walked away with it kept boasting about how much he spent on me and how great he is etc etc all of this after spending of our date complaining about past exes leaving him afterwards i went home and took a shower minutes max and in that time he texted me times and called me when i got out obviously i saw this as a warning and politely explained i just didnt think wed be a good match he went off the rails calling me a whore and a leech etc then tried to apologize the next day i blocked his number on blocked him on fb after much harassment for him to make countless other accounts telling me that i got a wrong impression and hes going through a lot and lonely and blah blah its been years and i still get texts from him when he somehow finds out ive gotten a new phone
creepyPMs,not_removed,and vice versa edit whoa guys i just meant to point out that its not only men who can do crazy shit like this women also do it for reference i am a woman im not looking to point fingers or pit one against the other i meant this in a friendly way
creepyPMs,not_removed,does the fact that im poly and have a primary partner and told this guy before we even met that i wasnt looking for anything emotionally heavy mean anything in this context im genuinely curious because that means even though he has anxiety about being alone and had been given information that he wasnt going to get what he needed from me he still went out with me its like a self deprecating spiral i like this girl i want to feel things with this girl oh this girl does not have that kind of space for me and let me know ahead of time oh well gonna go get hammered with her anyways
creepyPMs,not_removed,i had a friend who would use threats of suicide to get her way you obviously want to be there for someone whos genuinely suicidal but it gets hard to maintain a compassionate response after a while there are definitely people who weaponize their mental health issues and try to make others responsible for their wellbeing you can only put so much of your weight on other people and expect them to hold you up you only have so much right to put any weight on a near stranger
creepyPMs,not_removed,welp just add to the tally board gosh darn it i just love being responsible for others emotions s
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha im not gaslighting you i didnt say any of that wtf are you talking about im not even a real person youre not even having this conversation its still you dont even have an iphone yet avatar the last air bender is still on tv
creepyPMs,not_removed,sad
creepyPMs,not_removed,basically her saying shes convincing herself of her perception of reality attempting to make her feel crazy and unsure of what she experienced is definitive gaslighting
creepyPMs,not_removed,if youre trying to scare me away that isnt working
creepyPMs,not_removed,its manipulation that tries to get the person to question their sanity or reality of what ishas happened
creepyPMs,not_removed,most definetly gaslighting going out of his way to bother her on instagram the telling her that her reaction is based on a figment of her imagination albeit a terrible attempt but an attempt all the same
creepyPMs,not_removed,youve made up stories in your head about me is supposed to get op to second guess her own perception of reality and think she is overreacting
creepyPMs,not_removed,i agree with you i guess its kind of gaslighting if you really stretch it its easier for people who actually know you to gaslight you because theyve been in actual situations with you that they can change to make you question your sanity a random tinder dude doesnt really have any ammo for gaslighting
creepyPMs,not_removed,gonna get downvoted to heck but im with you on this and wish people would stop throwing the term around so much
creepyPMs,not_removed,no need to be a jerk
creepyPMs,not_removed,ive said so many times in this thread that i was under the impression that this is what gaslighting is you need to stop being butthurt tbh
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,well being educated on psychological terms is great when youre calling someone out
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh well i suppose that makes sense then kinda weird that hed know what your insta was meaning that he probably wrote it down or followed it before even starting conversation with you
creepyPMs,not_removed,its been years and i still get texts from him when he somehow finds out ive gotten a new phone holy shit what in the actual fuck
creepyPMs,not_removed,its always both amazing and sad that people like this dont eventually just move on
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wonder if he does that with all his exes like keeps a list and goes through periodically to insult them or whine how strange
creepyPMs,not_removed,years oh hell no
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is why i never let anyone pay me anything on dates i once got stalked over an ice cream
creepyPMs,not_removed,sometimes you dont know until youre actually on a date like you feel fine then you realise youre not responding appropriately to the person
creepyPMs,not_removed,what are you talking about
creepyPMs,not_removed,do you know what that means because i dont quite understand what you are getting at edit cool thats just not exactly how that term should be used in response to the wording of the comment above so your meaning was not clear thanks for clarifying
creepyPMs,not_removed,i mean i hear you completely and this dude is in the wrong here that said ive put myself in virtually the same situation before because sometimes you overestimate your ability to handle emotional stressors in my case the guy i liked told me straight up that he wasnt interested in dating anyone but wanted to be friends and maybe hook up i thought i would be okay with that because i genuinely liked hanging out with him and didnt want to let my romantic feelings get in the way of letting the friendship play out i had zero expectations from him and i had no intention of trying to emotionally manipulate him or even to try to woo him or something and bring about a relationship that he didnt want i then got hammered like your dude because i was trying to drown out my romantic feelings which needless to say was counterproductive i blurted out that i had a crush on him along with some other embarrassing things pretty sure i told him i masturbated thinking about him but that part of the night was a little hazy so im still holding out hope that i dreamt that part but then i sobered up and never mentioned it again and we have a pretty good friendship nowadays i never actually told him any of the depressed selfloathing stuff because its not fair to him to do so but its still there in the background i dont expect him to resolve those feelings for me theyre my problem but i also dont want to let my anxiety stop me from living my life if i stayed home every time i felt that way i may never leave so its something i just have to confront this time was exceptionally bad and honestly i kind of spiraled a little after that first encounteri stopped eating more than calories a day and i started sleeping with a lot of strange men i met online because i had this overwhelming feeling that i would live and die alone and there was nothing i could do about it again not his fault or problem though and i never told him any of this im pretty much over the crush but those thoughts have still stuck with me and truthfully i expect them to persist no matter what is happening ive been in multiple longterm relationships before and still had the same anxieties it just feels like a fluke that somebody mistakenly thought they wanted to date me im not sure what the solution is i just know that i cant isolate myself but i also cant take it out on other people i dont know your dude was absolutely wrong to tell you any of that but wasnt necessarily wrong to go on the date maybe he really didnt expect anything to happen and just got overwhelmed in the moment it could have been malice on his part in thinking that he could convince you to date him against your better judgment but maybe he thought he would be okay with whatever you offered and it turned out he wasnt i dont know and im not trying to defend or excuse his behavior thats just my perspective on why he could have gotten himself into that situation you know he still shouldnt have said anything though because that absolutely crosses the line into emotional manipulation and abuse nobody is responsible for your happiness other than you intellectually thats obvious but its just that it doesnt feel that way sometimes you have to keep that shit to yourself though
creepyPMs,not_removed,take me with you
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks for the explanation i was also a bit confused as to how this was an example of gaslighting that actually makes perfect sense once its explained
creepyPMs,not_removed,i must be missing something where does this happen i dont really see where gaslighting comes in dude says he didnt mean to sound crazy hes been dealing with a lot took matters into his own hands and found her on ig and then tried for a pity card that hes dealing with death all around him
creepyPMs,not_removed,rmadlads
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes it works when the victim starts to believe that the other person is right and theyre wrong because of whatever reason its a power play and very difficult to set straight in your head if youve been exposed to it long enough the name comes from an old movie called gaslight i believe
creepyPMs,not_removed,no its not really a good example of gaslighting
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think the point that people are trying to make is that he said thatgaslit her after she accused him of it it didnt occur before that point
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats not really a good example of gaslighting its more of an accusation and a better example of mindreading
creepyPMs,not_removed,again i was under a false impression of what the term actually meant
creepyPMs,not_removed,the reason i threw it around is because this is what i was under the impression that it actually meant
creepyPMs,not_removed,for the record im not as hung up on this as the person who replied to me my jimmies were slightly rustled because i was gaslighted my whole childhood but i definitely wasnt trying to say your feelings are invalid because of a simple word misuse
creepyPMs,not_removed,but yet you get on my case for giving you the information plus research that proves you were using the wrong term and trying to make excuses that you didnt know what it meant im pretty sure that is what constitutes as being butt hurt plus the others who told you it wasnt gaslighting im explaining my case and letting others know that i said the same and got deleted for it so dont use words or terminology that you dont know the definition of end of story
creepyPMs,not_removed,it does support ones jab more adequately
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not very educated on the term gaslighting then because i thought it was just manipulation to get what you want from someone
creepyPMs,not_removed,i believe the word youre looking for is than not then
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh god shut up already
creepyPMs,not_removed,tinder connects with instagram you can access someones insta right from tinder
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not op but okay i replied to a post that made assumptions and accusations about op without any information suggesting this may not be the sub for the poster thats all
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment has been removed in accordance with httpiimgurcomvkforaspng httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,like a rolodex of remorse
creepyPMs,not_removed,also his attempt at making you feel bad doesnt make sense since every time you go back onhes already been on there
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah i dont anymore if youre gonna get uppity about paying when i offered to spilt the bill we arent going out i actually ask people this before i accept dates now if youre gonna try to be emotionally manipulative about wasting my time and money you can definitely move along i dont need either its different when my partner of a year and i treat the other one to lunch or something as a romantic gesture but of the time its a split bill
creepyPMs,not_removed,i refuse to let people pay for the first and second date if i cant afford a date yet i tell them and if they try to insist to pay i just let them know that that would make me uncomfortable i once had a guy go a little nuts just because i wouldnt let him pay
creepyPMs,not_removed,that some women also need professional help and shouldnt take it out in men
creepyPMs,not_removed,yes i think ive been misunderstood i mean that women do this kind of crazy shit to men too
creepyPMs,not_removed,do you know what that means
creepyPMs,not_removed,thank you for this clarification it really hurt when he mentioned jumping off a bridge because of me even though i barely knew him it was as if he had stabbed me in my stomach ive had boyfriends over the years either threaten or attempt to commit suicide thank god none of them ever did and it pushed me right back into that space and memory after that all i felt was anger like blinding red hot rage at him for pulling me back into that place i never wanted to visit again i didnt take it out on him i very calmly told him that i was going to leave and hoped he had a better night when i was grabbing my coat he was just staring angrily at his phone and didnt say anything to me or look at me the next morning i carefully constructed a text letting him know that i hoped he was able to work on his stuff for himself
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you find a way let me know
creepyPMs,not_removed,in the third panel he outright says she is crafting things in her mind to convince herself of things
creepyPMs,not_removed,yup in gaslight the husband is slowly making his wife believe shes going insane one of the things he does is mess with the gas that fuels the light in their house she keeps seeing it dim but he only does it when shes alone
creepyPMs,not_removed,k den
creepyPMs,not_removed,i see youre getting attacked on here a lot and im sorry about that this guy really was a douche and you handled this very well i wasnt trying to be a condescending know it all and i dont think the person i replied to was either i think we just want to make sure people know what gaslighting really is so it doesnt get overused the person who clarified and explained what it was got a ton of upvotes so im not sure why were all getting downvotdd though
creepyPMs,not_removed,not a personal jab ive just seen it misused a number of times on this sub is all
creepyPMs,not_removed,never said her feelings were invalid corrected her on a term as many others have and since i was the first on to do so they jumped all over my case but thats ok stay uneducated sheeple
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol keep reaching
creepyPMs,not_removed,er pretty certain then was used correctly here edit a comma would have definitely helped though on the term gaslighting then because edit replied to the wrong comment my bad
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know so when she unmatched him he wouldnt be able to see it anymore thats why i said hed have needed to write it down beforehand to access it
creepyPMs,not_removed,aka remorsodex™
creepyPMs,not_removed,woah its almost like different people feel feelings differently
creepyPMs,not_removed,you sound like the kind of person that only sees other people as a benefit or lack of benefit to your life
creepyPMs,not_removed,she told him she wasnt ready and he pressured her into it and then set up a scenario where he could manipulate her into more dates stop victim blaming
creepyPMs,not_removed,exactly this i didnt mean to cause offence
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats horrible and im so sorry you went through that seriously you did nothing wrong and absolutely none of it was your fault he has a chemical imbalance in his brain it happens to the best of us and he needs serious help from a professional not someone he dated twice its sad that hes suffering but its not your fault or your responsibility in any way and its disgusting for him to try to shift the blame to you im so sorry that you were burdened by it
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah but thats all after she said he gaslighted her i can see how that is gaslighting just not what he said at first to make her say he is gaslighting
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really dont understand either it seems like a pretty clear and easy subject to me the only thing that could be taken as gaslighting here is the you unmatched me on such a slight whim but thats not gaslighting thats his opinion of what happened she didnt say that was gaslighting either if she had retorted that it was much more than a slight whim and he argued it then i could see a gaslighting angle but she said gaslighting after the guy tried to play a pity card to get some affection which is not gaslighting at all
creepyPMs,not_removed,thanks for explaining
creepyPMs,not_removed,i did and id prefer not to be called love by strangers
creepyPMs,not_removed,im sure he didnt go through all the trouble of writing it down who does that nowadays she probably needed followers so added him on insta before he creeped
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know man give me a shout when you figure it out

creepyPMs,not_removed,repulsodex
creepyPMs,not_removed,riamverysmart
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wish the best for them but i also wish they wouldnt take it out on women and vice versa does that really not make sense to you the first comment is speaking in general terms saying some people need help and they shouldnt take it out on women the comment saying vice versa is saying the women who do the same stuff shouldnt take it out on men either i think you need a lesson in english tbh
creepyPMs,not_removed,ditto he was definitely trying to emotionally blackmailmanipulate her but gaslighting isnt quite whats going on in the first instance ive been gaslit pretty sure most women have 🙁 and its a very very different style of manipulation im still having issues with gaslighting due to a medical condition not being consistent and doctors nor being consistent im still working on deactivating some very mild discomfort triggers around it heck a threadbanger episode made me uncomfortable the other day because the wife felt embarrassed about her husband being right she was the last one with the stapler so she told him i found it in the your stuff and you could see he was confused and racking his brain for how but he accepted it as truth because he trusts her and also because it was a planned joke for the video i guess but still i was so uncomfortable
creepyPMs,not_removed,i thought it was more of a sustained campaign type thing too using it in line with its definition seems to be a touchy subject around here tho
creepyPMs,not_removed,you are right there i must have read the reply to the wrong comment thanks for the clarification
creepyPMs,not_removed,im gonna assume thats not the case
creepyPMs,not_removed,so what should she have a sign on her at all times saying shes not ready because before the first date is too late to speak up besides she told him repeatedly to not spend a bunch of time and money on her and he did anyways
creepyPMs,not_removed,you are the hostile one here op stated a preference and you got pissy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just said id prefer not to be called pet names by strangers
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe its a cultural difference and we are from different places but some people myself included feel its condescending and overly familiar to be using pet names for strangers you may not have meant it that way but if you are that caring for others then i figure youre probably confused and want to know why they have a problem with this
creepyPMs,not_removed,hostile much
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think the op is the hostile one here are you the annoying who messaged the op on tinder here
creepyPMs,not_removed,ooh a psychology degree
creepyPMs,not_removed,lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think were talking about different stories sorry man

creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like excellent advice perhaps you should take it
creepyPMs,not_removed,write out your rants but sleep on it in the morning if you still feel as strongly go for it likely youll wake up wanting to edit yourself theres honor in brevity no one needs a wall of text to understand your point of view the older you get the better the filter you develop and the only way youre going to develop that filter is by messing up sometimes take note when someone doesnt respond the way you expected them to and move forward
creepyPMs,not_removed,all teens are creepy source am a teen
creepyPMs,not_removed,best way to not be creepy is to take no for the answer it is you will notice most of the pms that end up here are because of things either they didnt respect the no or because they immediately started off with over the top fetishes and sexual advances also when wanting to get to know someone dont insult them or their interests if youre on a dating site read their profile first the profile is there for a reason a final thing if someone your interested in turns you down dont be mean and insulting calling that girl you think is cute a whore bitch or slut for not going out with you is low class and is guaranteed to not get you the date best of luck kid
creepyPMs,not_removed,aww the blunder years those are fun buckle up and try not to make the same mistake twice if its still going on after you get your first legal drink seek some help most likely youll be fine a guy who pmd his first girlfriend about his fear of being buried alive with bugs crawling all over and fetish for bondage and sex outside in response to her saying tell me something i dont know about you
creepyPMs,not_removed,check out dr nerdlove he offers mostly dating advice but often talks about more general social begaviors
creepyPMs,not_removed,good idea will implement it thanks a lot
creepyPMs,not_removed,gee thanks bro oh shit its jesus
creepyPMs,not_removed,also starting off with really aggressive wording or pet names is usually not recommended honey sweetie gorgeous love sexy etc
creepyPMs,not_removed,how do i handle myself to fix an oncoming rejection how do i handle broken relationships instead of whining and stalking them
creepyPMs,not_removed,okay but i dont want to wait and see how it turns out damn lol its not that bad in my case but nevertheless i need to change and can u help me gve some adviceidea or just weather it out
creepyPMs,not_removed,ill keep that in mind thanks a lot
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think being a teen even with most of the advice its all about trusting your gut and weathering it out most of us have been through it and even though weve had our cringe moments or why the fuck did i saydo that moments we look back and laugh as long as you dont cross the threshold of becoming a fulltime aggressive creep learning how to deal with rejection is key to not becoming that if youre in the online dating scene keep your intros short and sweet and dont overthink it keep your own profile simple too dont fill it to the tits with puns if someone rejects you just say good luck hope you find what youre looking for and move on to the next
creepyPMs,not_removed,i might not be the best one to get advice on how to be normal i wore suits from the grad up until holy shit ones on me right now but the real trick is to not be cringey unfortunately these cringy moments help mold you for later you need to learn not to talk about how your house was painted with lead during your about me or that picking all the hearts out of the lucky charms and putting them in a bag for your sweet heart is not a good way to ask someone out for a valentines day dance but is a good way to attract ants by making these mistakes you are going to be cringy once in a while but its just part of life its pretty much a just weather it out kinda thing real important part is to learn from the mistake and not repeat it be and dont just keep doing the same mistake over and over and over blaming others for the failure because thats how you end up on the front page of this place
creepyPMs,not_removed,how do i learn to let go any tips on handling that and rejection
creepyPMs,not_removed,that video was eye opening thanks i dont blame others i talk about my own failures and that seems to act like im just garnering attention
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think everyone is different in how they let go im a bit of a clinger meaning i get attached easily and its hard to let go but i dont become a stalker or anything its just the emotional side lol i try to convince myself that its for the best if youre infatuated or in love with someone and they dont return those feelings then convince yourself its not meant to be and that there is someone better out there no matter how much you think you have in common with that person we cant force people to like us it just wouldnt be right right dealing with rejection itself is tough for most people and anyone who says its not is a liar or likely has it easy in life it stings it hurts it even gets you to a low sometimes take a few days to soak it in but dont let it overtake you or make you do anything stupid our initial reaction is to lash out in defence as if that person we approached hurt us by simply stating they are not interested it doesnt mean you have nothing going for you its just a compatibility thing and sometimes even an oversight the main thing to keep in mind is to just be happy with yourself confidence is attractive if youre feeling angry after a rejection do something that gets your mind off of it quickly go for a jog play with your dog dont stay in front of that computer thinking up of a way to hurt the other person
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont be afraid to talk about failure but if you do its best to try and put a positive twist on it like what you learned from failing but to much focus on your failures will sound like a pity party that sort of thing is usually best left for later datesafter youve gotten to know a person or for close friends
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg thats made it clear thanks for telling me that really means a lot to me its exactly what i needed to know its basically like holding onto water youll never have it if its not a strongly bonded water like ice thanks again
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats where i keep going wrong now that i realize it i will take steps to make sure i dont make the atmosphere gloomy and try to make it seem positive really opening thank you
creepyPMs,not_removed,my favorite part of this shit show is that he sent you messages while criticizing you for writing a sentence paragraph next time you better break your thoughts up into multiple messages for no reason so people dont think youre too literate
creepyPMs,not_removed,fuck this is funny so you wouldnt like fuck for fuck sake
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really hate the way the people in posts here handle rejection i have to say reading the posts has made me think quite a lot about how not to actwhich is great i just wish they would think about it too
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes obviously a rational gentleman rolls eyes
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know why but this post made me say fuck off out loud lol also i would smack the everliving fuck out of somebody who acted like this in person
creepyPMs,not_removed,im so confused on what he was expecting with that last message like did he honestly think you were going to change your mind and be like oh of course ill sleep with you after i ignored your other messages
creepyPMs,not_removed,i really wanted to get all the way to the bottom and have you say yep should have gone with not dignifying next time
creepyPMs,not_removed,not enough jpg
creepyPMs,not_removed,love it when their last message really drives home their creepy fuckboi status
creepyPMs,not_removed,it wasnt very effective
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats hilarious i didnt even realize that
creepyPMs,not_removed,irish accent certainly illustrates the diversity of the word irish accent

creepyPMs,not_removed,was a damn good max repel though
creepyPMs,not_removed,the answer is probably
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe hes rapidly deaging benjamin button style he does seem have to regressed by the end of the conversation
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe if you listened to what he fucksaid youd know gosh op get it together s
creepyPMs,not_removed,creeps trying to get around age differences is one of my favorite things around here
creepyPMs,not_removed,just like even half your face if your a victim of cyber sexual harassment or soemthig weird dude what get a load of captain foreshadowing over here
creepyPMs,not_removed,because obviously the burden of proof is on you s
creepyPMs,not_removed,brongyourbf brongyercat idiot thefuckwasthisdudeeventryingtodo hashtag
creepyPMs,not_removed,im most bothered by the fact that he suggested you bring your cat on a boating trip
creepyPMs,not_removed,i have this problem i got a new phone number and as bad luck would have it the last guy had the same name so i have to explain to his friends and relatives of this guy who i am and get the whole dude if you didnt want to talk to me anymore just say so on the plus side i chatted with one of them who ran into kevin sorbo and got his autograph it was mildly interesting enough ive had this number for years now and still happens
creepyPMs,not_removed,send me half your face if you have been a victim of sexual harassmentbecause if its the full face get prepared for all on sexual harassment
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a weird dude
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a strange way to try to get a picture off someone why dont people just go online theres porn eveeerywhere
creepyPMs,not_removed,whats wrong with not shaving your thighs its barely peach fuzz even if you let it grow out dude needs to grow up
creepyPMs,not_removed,this wasnt the first time they texted a random number trying to bother people they know what excuses to expect
creepyPMs,not_removed,of course where else would blame be
creepyPMs,not_removed,you can put to evade the header formatting in case you care
creepyPMs,not_removed,brong he wanted her to brong her cat on a boating trip
creepyPMs,not_removed,an elderly lady called me once she insisted that i was a plumber that she had used a year ago and that this was the number i gave her because she wrote it down in her address book after politely telling her that i was and there was no way i could have done whatever job a year ago she asks when i got the number i had the number three years and told her so she went off on a rant about how im lying to her because i didnt want to do work for her i ended up just agreeing with her and then hanging up she never called me again
creepyPMs,not_removed,could just send never ending pictures of random shit until he gets the hint
creepyPMs,not_removed,i honestly think he was just trying to get proof it was the wrong numberbut thats still really really creepy
creepyPMs,not_removed,jealous with my ethnic background i absolutely need to or look like a dude
creepyPMs,not_removed,what i could practically braid mine it gets so long when i shave my legs i gotta save my thighs
creepyPMs,not_removed,hell my thigh hair wont even catch in a lot of razors because its so fine
creepyPMs,not_removed,i honestly didnt know that i was definitely surprised by the font size lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,no on a boatig trip bronging is fine while boatig
creepyPMs,not_removed,you never brong a cat near water bronging is a dryland kind of game
creepyPMs,not_removed,well the authorities in craig alaska believe that my phone number belongs to someone skipping trial i live in kansas with a kansas area code i keep getting threatening callsmessages that this is my last chance to call them ive actually gotten the final opportunity message three times now
creepyPMs,not_removed,ditto but probably not ethnic because am irishnorwegian just did not luck into that finelightcolored hair dangit also depilate my upper lip and pluck under my chin
creepyPMs,not_removed,you need to get better razors then rwickededge can help
creepyPMs,not_removed,there has only been one study that says bronging a cat while boatig is safe and it was funded by the boatig industry so im very skeptical
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know right this is why i joined the better bronging bureau
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like a scam
creepyPMs,not_removed,excellent way to deal with these types of non consensual fetishists
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha i was worried when i saw i gave in and nsfw in the title of the post got eem
creepyPMs,not_removed,posts like this give me inspiration for when i eventually foray back into online dating and this sub has given me a wealth of responses to have in my arsenal unsolicited foot fetish comments send pictures of gangrene negging neg right back sent an unsolicited sexual roleplay send a roleplay response back about how im a woman full of spiders
creepyPMs,not_removed,ok words of true defeat
creepyPMs,not_removed,he probably still rubbed one out to that
creepyPMs,not_removed,i i never want ganggreen i could have gone my whole life without seeing that
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,creeps like this guy give us such a bad name
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love his persuasion technique which solely consists of the word yes
creepyPMs,not_removed,nsfl jesus christ
creepyPMs,not_removed,aw yeah love that
creepyPMs,not_removed,woman full of spiders i now have a new irrational fear
creepyPMs,not_removed,fucker youre giving him too much credit
creepyPMs,not_removed,sadly they showed us too
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats actually one of the photos they use to detract smoking in australia they plaster these images all over the packaging of cigarettes to try and convince people to quit
creepyPMs,not_removed,you cant even be certain you arent talking to a woman full of spiders on the internet right now
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy fucks
creepyPMs,not_removed,i okay i am so lost right now i am not a smart man
creepyPMs,not_removed,im more of a mother fucker myself but thanks for the offer
creepyPMs,not_removed,hopefully this helps
creepyPMs,not_removed,but why use the foot shouldnt a picture of the lungs be enough i guess whatever effects people more i suppose
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh they use a whole heap of scare tactics for all the different ways smoking can fuck you up so there is a lung with emphysema but theres also a destroyed heart rotten teeth a man in a hospital bed with cancer a toilet with blood in it and a dead baby edit i forgot there was also a picture of tongue cancer and another kid on an oxygen tank
creepyPMs,not_removed,okay this is def worth knowing i have learned two things never look at antismoking messages from australia and have a deeper appreciation for my nonsmoking status now only if we had a strong anticoffee ad
creepyPMs,not_removed,do you think that works in any capacity id imagine all it does it desensitize people to gross medical stuff
creepyPMs,not_removed,in canada we had one of a limp cigarette and it mentions how cigarettes cause erectile dysfunction that limp cigarette always makes me giggle
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont know if its the same picture but we have a man in a hospital bed on the package as well turned out the guy was in the hospital for a broken neck and they used his picture without his permission the picture of sperm helped us explain sex to my then year old nephew though his dad never knew how to start the conversation so when we were all on a holiday he saw my pack of cigarettes on the table and asked what sperm was and there ya go two hours of sex ed at in the morning with a hungover aunt dad and grandma my friend watched my brothers kids the night before while we were out drinking
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think its very hit and miss i dont think its been as successful of a campaign as they thought it would be but it has stopped some people from smoking and given the tobacco companies a bit of a fuck you though probably saved them a lot of money on marketing my brand of smokes used to be in this stylish black packet and looked fancy as hell now everyone has the same horrible images to deal with it may have made some of the lesser known symptoms like gangrene more apparent but apart from that every smoker already knew how terrible it was for them i still smoke so it hasnt worked for me
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think it may be more preventative than anything else probably wont stop those that are already addicted but may deter the curious from trying cigarettes
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh old mate bryan such a mad unit would you look at that cigarettes are once again a staple for transitioning into adulthood haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,i still smoke too and drink i didnt start either because i thought it was good for me to im pretty sure nobody who does anything like that does
creepyPMs,not_removed,love it
creepyPMs,not_removed,meetme was supposed to be just a thing for people to meet friends but that cant exist its impossible these dudes are everywhere hes so obsessed with your fiance finishing work its so nice that he puts job responsibilities first what a guy
creepyPMs,not_removed,when you deactivate your account you can choose too much like a dating site as one of the options as to why youre leaving i guess he has never deactivated before
creepyPMs,not_removed,in june the company formed from the combination of myyearbook and quepasa was renamed meetme this change is because yearbook means more about meeting friends from the past while meetme would convey the meaning of users making new friends which is what the website is intended for from its wikipedia page but nahhhh its totally just a dating site s
creepyPMs,not_removed,httpimgurcomanmvmb im just messing with him at this point edit conversate
creepyPMs,not_removed,swop phone horny
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes fighting for such a noble cause but seriously its none of his business and its not exactly meant for dating right i never used it
creepyPMs,not_removed,myyearbook took a turn for the fuck no about five years ago
creepyPMs,not_removed,you could probably start a website called justfriendsnodatingcom and some poor person would still get a creep demanding to know why they were on a dating site
creepyPMs,not_removed,i used meetme for a while all i got was dudes wanting to suck on my wiener not that i wasnt flattered but wtf probably the closest ill ever come to what women experience on dating sites every day
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes just there to teach females a lesson it seems
creepyPMs,not_removed,tells you to show trust for your husband suggests you swap phones and read each others texts every day
creepyPMs,not_removed,much disloyal such slut you used my favorite meme to shut down a creep im so happy
creepyPMs,not_removed,i am greatly enjoying him saying horny because my brain is reading it like an acronym and trying to guess what it stands for
creepyPMs,not_removed,no it isnt meant for dating its meant to be literally what its name says a place to meet people it just seems like creeps primarily use it for that
creepyPMs,not_removed,though he only says to see what i get up to during the day its hilarious really
creepyPMs,not_removed,sounds like hit the nail on the head for him to reply just fuck you lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,good for you for taking the high road for someone who still really didnt deserve it i often wonder how many bulliestrolls on the internet harass others because they are miserable themselves if i had to guess its probably a significant number
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you dont mind my asking which sub another writer
creepyPMs,not_removed,that guy cried
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe theyre just this shit at writing and hate you because youre better i cant imagine anyone soaking up with aggression this intensely on an innocuous sub like that for any other reason in any case good job killing it with kindness they didnt have the nerve or imagination to say anything more eloquent than oh yeah well fuck you
creepyPMs,not_removed,no joke could you paste your response here so i can copy it and have it at the ready for trolls that was perfectly executed and thats exactly how i want to handle things as well
creepyPMs,not_removed,yikes im not familiar with the site but sounds like a while lot of angry in this person i like your reply took the wind right out of their sails
creepyPMs,not_removed,yep hes triggered lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was gonna guess one of those where its all about quantity backlog niche and earning
creepyPMs,not_removed,i want one too
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh you rock thank you so so much
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly this is kind of just good life advice in general
creepyPMs,not_removed,saving that as well thats a quality answer
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,but he loved your cock
creepyPMs,not_removed,what the hell
creepyPMs,not_removed,he never saw it we met at a bus stop and he offered to help me out with figuring out if i could afford a mortgage then he called me at asking if we could hang out and i was like maybe another time then he tells me about how hes gay then he says im being homophobic because i didnt want to hang out with him in the middle of the night then he says hes been with a few different straight guys already so i have nothing to worry about
creepyPMs,not_removed,who doesnt love his
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont think he knows what straight means
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats actually a pretty magnificent cock
creepyPMs,not_removed,preemptive reminder that bestiality the definition of abuse and other can animals consent questions are still not up for debate here if your comment comes across as defending or justifying animal abuse and bestiality in any way or if you continue to derail your comment will be vaporized and you can and probably will be banned please report comments that you feel are inappropriate so that we can get to them sooner thanks for keeping our sub safe and supportive
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is horrifying
creepyPMs,not_removed,what the fuck
creepyPMs,not_removed,hes not even going to provide the dog now thats just dumb if she wants to fuck her own dog why would she even need to involve him at all s
creepyPMs,not_removed,at least he didnt continue to hound her for further conversation maybe his dogged attempts will pay off one day illseemyselfoutnow
creepyPMs,not_removed,the audacity of the proposal and the gall to ask aside if he did write to someone who was interested in this what would they even need this guy for
creepyPMs,not_removed,what in the ever loving name of god is going on first i am pretty sure that is illegal and secondly how the fuck can someone come up with the idea of sending that kind of shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,talk about tactless
creepyPMs,not_removed,the little smiley he makes adds to the creepiness
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think he got severely confused by the term dogging and thought this fetish was more commonplace
creepyPMs,not_removed,who would say yes to this seriously this is the kinda shit that freaks me out
creepyPMs,not_removed,first comment of reddit for the day and already creeper out
creepyPMs,not_removed,can confirm i met my last exes on whisper and after the last one i vowed to never ever go on there again to put it lightly they did not treat me very well and one or two still stalk me online throwaway for reason above
creepyPMs,not_removed,opyou dont happen to live near la the state do you there was a guy like this posting in whisper here too
creepyPMs,not_removed,what
creepyPMs,not_removed,whisper really is terrible i downloaded it because i dont like yik yak anymore and i got pms asking if i was a girl and wanted to send nudes
creepyPMs,not_removed,this guy probably runs a petting zoo and charges by the minute to go second base with the goats
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hate that people think just because its a fetish that means its okay no some fetishes are actually disgusting and should not be normalized
creepyPMs,not_removed,wut
creepyPMs,not_removed,literally was going to say this this exact way
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like im probably going to hell for laughing at that
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like he screwed the pooch opening up so strong
creepyPMs,not_removed,my guess taboo porn im sure theres a market for amateur bestiality porn
creepyPMs,not_removed,there are states where its legal yo
creepyPMs,not_removed,nope im in the uk i received this a year ago so i dont know if its the same bloke
creepyPMs,not_removed,we have one in massachusetts too 🙁
creepyPMs,not_removed,have one in nc too
creepyPMs,not_removed,the fuck what is how i was going to put it your way is much better
creepyPMs,not_removed,prolly
creepyPMs,not_removed,beastiality is legal in states i guess if we can kill em and cut off their nuts in all thats not too surprising how could that in any way not be the rape of an animal
creepyPMs,not_removed,iirc in states where its not specifically illegal as a sex crime its still illegal as animal cruelty and can be charged as such
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is even more fucked but well i am in canada and i just look here too it is legal as long as there is no penetration where the fuck are we going
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh lord
creepyPMs,not_removed,good fucking questionat least in many of those you cant fuck something smaller than a breadbox
creepyPMs,not_removed,its a felony in some states a misdemeanor in some others and legal in the rest
creepyPMs,not_removed,a lot of states banned bestiality via their sodomy laws when those got overturned many states never got around to recriminalizing it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i sure hope so but i havent heard that before
creepyPMs,not_removed,hi it looks like the link you used is inaccessible could you try submitting it again
creepyPMs,not_removed,so by potato you mean please tell me more of your thoughts on my sacks of fatty tissue congrats on having boobs that look like you paid for them i guess i think thats a compliment
creepyPMs,not_removed,so now this guys problem is that your tits are too big for him the tits he so admired that he messaged you salty salty excellent comebacks op wish id had you as my online dating coach back in the day if he had a fake tan now i bet he looks like a lobster now mwahahahahaha
creepyPMs,not_removed,when i read threads like this i just wish i could see the people im just wondering if dude really looks like a potato and if she really looks like a nerd with plastic boobs
creepyPMs,not_removed,httpiimgurcomztovhjpg
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow now i really want a baked potato with sour cream and bacon bits
creepyPMs,not_removed,are you aware that a couple of your edits to block out his face look like a penis and balls im just curious if its intentional because i thought it was funny like youre indirectly calling him a dick
creepyPMs,not_removed,i was reading along and saying yeah yeah but then all of the sudden fake tits potato started and i was on the edge of my seat
creepyPMs,not_removed,how is nerd an insult my bf calls me nerd all the time lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,hey whats your name mean
creepyPMs,not_removed,im feeling all these potato comments
creepyPMs,not_removed,curiously what was the reason you blew him off straightly not defending the creep its just curiosity
creepyPMs,not_removed,you say fake and i say potato you say tan your tits i say potato catchy tune in there somewhere
creepyPMs,not_removed,glad i ate my baked potato for dinner before i read this would have spat it out laughing my ass off
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would say so like hey if i ever feel insecure about my boobs i can remember that they look fakeenoughtoyeah i dont get it
creepyPMs,not_removed,you have the kind of boobs someone would pay for is the most devastating insult of them all s
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh thanks i switch between being super harsh or super silly the guy did look like a potato but changed his profile pic to a crotch shot with underwear on fear me
creepyPMs,not_removed,fake
creepyPMs,not_removed,im sure thats exactly what i look like haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont forget chives chives and sour cream are delicious together theres a reason sour cream and onion is a potato chip flavor
creepyPMs,not_removed,and the tears of man children for that extra salty taste cant forget those
creepyPMs,not_removed,ha yes i am aware i didnt have the time to do it to all his pics
creepyPMs,not_removed,maybe he looks like a potato because hes over and hasnt quite caught up to pop culture yet
creepyPMs,not_removed,he looks delicious
creepyPMs,not_removed,neat im glad i could invoke an emotion from you
creepyPMs,not_removed,read the rules before commenting again thanks
creepyPMs,not_removed,removed for violating rule
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read his profile it sounded pretty much how youd expect it to haha
creepyPMs,not_removed,dont comment with anymore rule breaks this is your only warning
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats cute thanks for saying it
creepyPMs,not_removed,one question bucko why did you capitalize girl
creepyPMs,not_removed,he was just looking at my profile pictures i didnt send him anything extra
creepyPMs,not_removed,like bags of sand he sounded pretty anrgy virginy
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg an orange potato with underwear i almost want to see the zoomed out version
creepyPMs,not_removed,nerd
creepyPMs,not_removed,grated cheese and sour cream all that dairy would make me explode into a cloud of farts
creepyPMs,not_removed,a friggin genuis i didnt even notice it woman he was such a dick have some fries as appreciation
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think he means to insinuate youre a child as in youre a girl and not a woman the whole logic train that commenter is on really seems to be quite misdirected with a basic fault in the understanding of reality
creepyPMs,not_removed,im not dissing fake boobies if you go to a good surgeon and they fit your body type they could look very real its just super dumb to try and use fake tits as your go to insult oh yeah well are your tits even real is one of the dumbest things you can say to show off your insecurities
creepyPMs,not_removed,nah if i wanted attention for my boobs id go to gonewild and post there honestly i try to have tasteful pics for profile pics so that people dont get the wrong idea but you see where that gets me
creepyPMs,not_removed,careful announcing that we had a fart fetishist posted the other day
creepyPMs,not_removed,will do thanks for making it easy on me cheers
creepyPMs,not_removed,well hes been on reddit for years and im the first person hes commented to so ill take that as a win
creepyPMs,not_removed,both of your comments have been removed for violating rule read the rules before commenting again this is your only warning scratch that new account made specifically to start shit on this post enjoy your ban
creepyPMs,not_removed,my favorite is people who accuse others of flaunting things like that
creepyPMs,not_removed,i always thought it was just a poor attempt at getting a girl to start talking about her boobs
creepyPMs,not_removed,i guess some things just cant be hidden
creepyPMs,not_removed,he should give me a call ive got lots of farts to give and no one to share them with
creepyPMs,not_removed,its simple if you dont want someone to think youre a creep dont make comments about their tits and tell them how to dress or photograph themselves recognize that not wearing turtlenecks is neither flaunting nor entitling you to comment not that i think any creep will grasp this
creepyPMs,not_removed,right like im not flaunting my tits just because they exist theyre big and theyre going to be noticeable unless i drape myself in a tarp
creepyPMs,not_removed,wait you mean doing creepesque shit will get you labeled as a creep mind blown
creepyPMs,not_removed,honestly sometimes simply existing with large breasts is too much for these guys i wear high necklines though not actual turtle necks i leave them for the turtles and still get so many boob comments
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know insane right
creepyPMs,not_removed,the fuck wtf is up with all these guys i see degrading girls like this i mean i know some people have kinks yada yada but dude they dont even know you you would think that they would at least see if the person is even interested in them let alone that kinda stuff
creepyPMs,not_removed,creep used alpha bravado it hurt its self in its confusion s
creepyPMs,not_removed,dr jeckel and mr hyde shit right there hes trying so hard to sound like a badass lol what a loser
creepyPMs,not_removed,uhoh begging didnt work this is a job for captain alpha
creepyPMs,not_removed,jesus christ talk about a future sexual assulter ಠಠ do guys like this not know what fucking respect is or do they think every girl ever is into extreme ds and being degraded
creepyPMs,not_removed,i might have replied with my ugliest granny period panties on the floor he asked for a pic of them and didnt specify that you had to be in them
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre hot pics nope just kidding youre fat
creepyPMs,not_removed,wth is wrong with people
creepyPMs,not_removed,hoo boy homeboy hulked out hard
creepyPMs,not_removed,creepiness random insult then top it off with rage out of nowhere this is surely a winning combination
creepyPMs,not_removed,insulting her and demanding she do something shes already said no to that should do the trick
creepyPMs,not_removed,well damn
creepyPMs,not_removed,im usually honest with these people i tell them im fat
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow that really escalated
creepyPMs,not_removed,stupid douchebag
creepyPMs,not_removed,they cant actually get girls irl so they try to play big macho man online or theyre already rapists
creepyPMs,not_removed,its not effective at all creep fainted
creepyPMs,not_removed,and then they continue to beg for pics
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh indeed
creepyPMs,not_removed,your response is everything to me
creepyPMs,not_removed,iim confused this creep seemed disjointed like he was having a conversation with someone other than op
creepyPMs,not_removed,was this person sober
creepyPMs,not_removed,god this sounds like when a kpop group tries putting english in their music 😂
creepyPMs,not_removed,is that a bot
creepyPMs,not_removed,well someone was using google translate to disguise their lack of english fluency lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like the subtle bigger than your arm
creepyPMs,not_removed,was the rainbow cake stuff in response to your sn or is your sn in response to his nonsensical rambling
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a lucky woman you are op
creepyPMs,not_removed,your rainbow my cake wat
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cant help reading this in trumps voice
creepyPMs,not_removed,i would have said its a bot if you didnt already confirm that he actually built stuff from your profile into it in a way that bots normally cant
creepyPMs,not_removed,i see way too many dudes jumping to the i love yous as if someone told them that womens emotions are so fragile and easy to manipulate youll always get laid if you tell a new girl youre in love with her
creepyPMs,not_removed,that was confusing i doubt english is this creeps first language regardless of his country of origin he needs to back off and learn some social awareness
creepyPMs,not_removed,first he starts off with the whole asshole approach and when that doesnt work he does a whole and goes for a gentleman approach and then he comes to his final approach of crazy its like to him talking to you is like a route in a video game and hes just reloading trying to get the right answer to get that true end
creepyPMs,not_removed,how many conversations is this dude having
creepyPMs,not_removed,i want your rainbow on my cake im sorry what now im afraid i quite missed the implications there
creepyPMs,not_removed,i want your rainbow on my cake fucking shakespeare over here
creepyPMs,not_removed,i almost wonder if he was having both a conversation with himself and service issues parts of it read like his messages were just coming sporadically but that doesnt really make sense unless he was typing out multiple messages regardless of response
creepyPMs,not_removed,you take that back fantastic fantastic elastic elastic makes waaaay more sense than this and now i am going to be singing that all day
creepyPMs,not_removed,infinite love yeah online your mine it does roll nice of the tongue ill give it that
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh that makes way more sense
creepyPMs,not_removed,his stuff is in response to my sn
creepyPMs,not_removed,it has to do with my username i think
creepyPMs,not_removed,haha trust me i love kpop but when they incorporate english sometimes it never makes sense 😂
creepyPMs,not_removed,somehow i forgot about that song so this just brightened my day
creepyPMs,not_removed,that makes sense also his replies become ten times funnier if you read it in the voice of the vietnamese prostitute from full metal jacket
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre fat and i meant it wasnt to be petty httpiimgurcomsbfouqygif
creepyPMs,not_removed,found him on facebook messaged the screenshots to his mother and the company listed as his workplace no regrets
creepyPMs,not_removed,i wear a us size uk size so i think he may be blind
creepyPMs,not_removed,its a sad predicament to be in if you find somebody fat and unattractive but youre still desperate enough that youd pay them to perform sex acts on you
creepyPMs,not_removed,the salt this guy has is unreal
creepyPMs,not_removed,awesome update
creepyPMs,not_removed,the guys color changed from orange to yellow this bothers me for some reason
creepyPMs,not_removed,if you get a response from either please please please update
creepyPMs,not_removed,excellent way to show his friends and family what a disappointment he turned out to be bravo
creepyPMs,not_removed,dude you could be a size and hed still call you fat these dudes think being called fat is the female kryptonite or something
creepyPMs,not_removed,this was from about three weeks ago the mother was horrified and apologised for her son i emailed the employer rather than a facebook message to let them know their employee was soliciting prostitution online with an account that was easily linked to his facebook which had them listed on it along with the screenshots and links to his account they sent a generic thank you for informing us message emphasising that they were unaware of and did not endorse his actions hes no longer listed as working there on his facebook page
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel bad for the guys mom well you too but like you did the right thing telling her better to know and be horrified than not know and oblivious
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh shoot dropping the hammer baffles me that there are still people with no concept of how available their social media makes information soliciting in this very clear fashion is foolish to say the least
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh sweet sweet update
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre a legend
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love this so much youre my hero
creepyPMs,not_removed,i felt terrible for her she genuinely seemed mortified i told her not to apologise because it wasnt her fault but as he appeared to still live at home i thought she probably should know what he was up to under her own roof and on her own wifi
creepyPMs,not_removed,his username was literally his full name which was fairly unique and the same as his name on facebook plus he used the same photos it perplexes me that somebody would do this so openly
creepyPMs,not_removed,still live at home damn does he fit all the stereotypes was he offering to fly you in to his moms house for the sex
creepyPMs,not_removed,was he offering to fly you in to his moms house for the sex i think he actually was unless he was planning on springing for a hotel room
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow that actually makes me feel a bit ill im just imagining trying to have sex in a basement with someones mom walking around upstairs and gack
creepyPMs,not_removed,omg so so hot having sex with a stranger under his mothers roof i dont know about anyone else on here but thats always been my secret romantic fantasy fuck all those prince charmings and fabios d
creepyPMs,not_removed,in italy couples for generations that arent married have been having sex in cars to avoid having sex at their parents house sigh loselose d
creepyPMs,not_removed,im a he thats a she and yes its all the same person we had one conversation about a band we were mutually interested in and this ensued
creepyPMs,not_removed,obviously this guy needs a caps lock and boldfont no to get it
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh but you didnt really say no sssss
creepyPMs,not_removed,your comment has been removed in accordance with httpiimgurcomvkforaspng httpwwwredditcomrcreepypmswikirules if you would like to discuss this decision please message the mods please read the complete rules and sidebar before commenting again
creepyPMs,not_removed,see funny thing is thats not the type of thing you just bring up in conversation if you had a bad case of diarrhea would you mention that when talking to someone no
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a disrespectful jerk it doesnt matter how many of these creepypms i read i cant get over how some guys think women want to be treated like a piece of meat
creepyPMs,not_removed,at least he asked first instead of just sending a photo and then being all isnt that the most amazing penis you have ever seen small victories
creepyPMs,not_removed,ughhhh
creepyPMs,not_removed,wanna see
creepyPMs,not_removed,or treated to a piece of meat
creepyPMs,not_removed,welcome to life
creepyPMs,not_removed,he also managed to send a sorry before i blocked him but it was clearly waaaaay too little too late
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats cool i had a bran muffin for breakfast about two hours ago wanna see
creepyPMs,not_removed,typed like someone with a dick in one hand
creepyPMs,not_removed,too detailed and creepy to be a bot
creepyPMs,not_removed,my optic nerves just braided themselves into a knot reading that
creepyPMs,not_removed,i swear ive seen copypasta just like this before but actually coherent its like he once read it and then retyped it three days later in the dark whilst wearing mittens and drunk
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my god that is so fucking creepy he somehow managed to make his way through past present and future in one paragraph
creepyPMs,not_removed,man that hurt to read
creepyPMs,not_removed,theres something about guys like this calling female genitalia kitty that just makes me sputter in disgust
creepyPMs,not_removed,this dude should probably not go on okcupid when he smokes meth
creepyPMs,not_removed,yoir ad is my equal does anyone speak fucktard translate
creepyPMs,not_removed,its very concerning how fucking horrible this dude is at communication if he wants to get into bondage
creepyPMs,not_removed,for some reason im stuck on the fact that hes going out and shes laying up sexy for him
creepyPMs,not_removed,that or he typed it with his dick
creepyPMs,not_removed,either way someone went to the trouble of writing this all out
creepyPMs,not_removed,bahahaha and digging and utilizing all your wholes what
creepyPMs,not_removed,look at keys that are close by on the keyboard your ass is my equal only shifted two position on the keyboard and added one letter still doesnt make sense though
creepyPMs,not_removed,its almost philosophical isnt it d
creepyPMs,not_removed,aha thanks for that yeah youre right still not enlightening d
creepyPMs,not_removed,unless of course he was trying to say i am a total ass in which case yes
creepyPMs,not_removed,im old why would that hurt
creepyPMs,not_removed,shes confused and thought he was an anatomy tutor
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my god not even tutorial chats are safe now
creepyPMs,not_removed,gotta love chegg i had a student on there who had the audacity to demand free tutoring and then got super racist when i asked for money said something like sorry i didnt bring my rice with me today eyeroll
creepyPMs,not_removed,what tutor chat is that my partner has been looking for a place to tutor online for a while and cant find anything that is super good
creepyPMs,not_removed,is there a photo of you thats blocked out and thats how she knew what you looked like
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh my god not even tutorial chats are safe now edit im sorry i hadnt noticed i commented twicemy internet is laggy and sometimes i dont see it
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think she meant that like sorry if its inappropriate i dont think she meant it literally
creepyPMs,not_removed,jeeze so far ive gotten a lot of do my homework for me and understand it in seconds
creepyPMs,not_removed,i just started on this site called chegg it has a pretty cool way of explaining the question like drawing it out or even talking face to face seems affordable for students too
creepyPMs,not_removed,yups
creepyPMs,not_removed,u didnt have to say that twice
creepyPMs,not_removed,or maybe like hurt from cringe
creepyPMs,not_removed,shit thats a good idea
creepyPMs,not_removed,i laughed hard and cringed at the same time first student
creepyPMs,not_removed,this dude is hallucinating a completely different conversation his replies sound like hes talking to someone else
creepyPMs,not_removed,that guy is this entire sub
creepyPMs,not_removed,obviously hes just annoyed that shes been showering with his man guys its a valid complaint his man guys are special to him and he doesnt want them trifled with
creepyPMs,not_removed,i read these messages and feel like there should be a little red light flashing that indicates someone on the other end is masturbating right now i mean so many of these convos are really just nonconsensual sexting its as if some guys believe that is their fabulous parting gift for not succeeding
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont like shower sex its cold only one person can really be under the water at a time
creepyPMs,not_removed,reverse the logic op tell him you dont want to add another guy to the long long long list of dudes you already regret sleeping with
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cant believe people like this walk amongst us they could even be our cashiers at the grocery store for all i know hes so fucking belligerent
creepyPMs,not_removed,the really sad part is that i bet a lot of women tell him the exact same thing but hell be like these girls are so defensive and rude
creepyPMs,not_removed,you had sex with other men therefore you must have sex with me every man who doesnt think of women as human beings you dodge a helluva bullet
creepyPMs,not_removed,my man guys
creepyPMs,not_removed,how do you fit five man guys in a shower two in front three in back
creepyPMs,not_removed,he is ugly inside for sure
creepyPMs,not_removed,push your push what
creepyPMs,not_removed,my man guys pushing your push i feel like hes on a whole different page from reality
creepyPMs,not_removed,ah yes the classic signs of a shower sex addict refusing to fuck somebody you dont want to politely replying to increasingly gross and obnoxious questions and asserting yourself to a whiny asshole you must be the mofukkon monarch of shower sex
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a nice guy i hope he gets exactly everything he deserves
creepyPMs,not_removed,as soon as i saw the word babe in the first line i knew this was going to go to shit real fast
creepyPMs,not_removed,he knows op better than she knows herself surely no one can be that confident otherwise
creepyPMs,not_removed,what horrible messenger with ads is that
creepyPMs,not_removed,i cannot grasp my head around people like this
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow
creepyPMs,not_removed,last text shouldve said oh i forgot youre delusional too
creepyPMs,not_removed,i hope that was the original fright night you were watching
creepyPMs,not_removed,wow thats some denial on his part
creepyPMs,not_removed,and its slippery but not in the good way
creepyPMs,not_removed,and the positioning is just awkward
creepyPMs,not_removed,i dont really know anyone who actually likes shower sex its a good way to ensure that all of the lubricant gets washed down the drain not to mention just the hazard of slipping because its cramped with two people and theres water everywhere the last time i showered with my husband i fell pretty hard my knees turned lots of fun colors
creepyPMs,not_removed,i feel like shower sex is only enjoyable for people rich enough for a large steam shower with at least shower heads ooohh or those vertical body sprayers i aspire to be this rich or have a shack built around a really really nice bathroom
creepyPMs,not_removed,it can work for foreplay though
creepyPMs,not_removed,and water is a terrible lubricant its like an antilubricant
creepyPMs,not_removed,also you need a big shower cubicle otherwise theres just not enough room
creepyPMs,not_removed,i guess that really depends if you got a big tub or not i have one meant for but it sucks up a lot of water so i rarely use it
creepyPMs,not_removed,have you seen those showers that have two shower heads though that only improves one aspect of this terrible experience
creepyPMs,not_removed,i know 😞 you have to have a fancy dual headed shower and a bench seat or something for it to be a fun experience
creepyPMs,not_removed,he immediately blocked me after saying i was full of shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,that is the perfect response
creepyPMs,not_removed,unfortunately basically the internet in a nutshell anonymity hides and people do actions theyd never do in real life to your face because they dont face the consequences and get away with it
creepyPMs,not_removed,all i did was ask a simple question and she fucking bit my head off man bitches be crazy its always these types always
creepyPMs,not_removed,he meant five guys he likes a burger in the shower
creepyPMs,not_removed,i think it was supposed to be pussy
creepyPMs,not_removed,oh yeah and hes totally not pushy with all those freudian slips of saying push
creepyPMs,not_removed,meet me
creepyPMs,not_removed,unfortunately it was the remake playing on syfy
creepyPMs,not_removed,but david tennant is pretty great in the newer one too
creepyPMs,not_removed,all the good slipperiness gets washed away after a bit and then its awful for everyone involved
creepyPMs,not_removed,so you have had shower sex s
creepyPMs,not_removed,also with water not full of chlorine and chafingness
creepyPMs,not_removed,well on the plus side you wont have to enter his name on the big ole list of regret
creepyPMs,not_removed,ill let you off i havent been able to bring myself to watch it yet
creepyPMs,not_removed,im sure ill give in and watch it one day i do like david tennant in general
creepyPMs,not_removed,and standing doesnt work too well if theres much of a height difference and depending on the type of shower being in any kind of sitting position fills the tub so every movement sounds like a gross plunger
creepyPMs,not_removed,creeper op s
creepyPMs,not_removed,owwy just make sure you kiss em better
creepyPMs,not_removed,its actually not that bad david tennant makes it fun
creepyPMs,not_removed,that guys man guys too
creepyPMs,not_removed,time management drop everything and fuck me whenever i want huh who knew
creepyPMs,not_removed,a guy who is sure his dick game is great ill have to remember this one the next time im on a date irresistible
creepyPMs,not_removed,imagine being so egotistical and out of touch with reality that you think your genitalia is literally lifechanging
creepyPMs,not_removed,how the fuck is this guy in uni i mean he seems barely literate i ironically misspelled literate but luckily caught it before posting
creepyPMs,not_removed,i love this particular mo the i cant handle rejection so ill pretend its my decision not to pursue this so funny
creepyPMs,not_removed,that music major struggle is very true and this dude is a cunt i see im not getting anywhere as i try to be more passive aggressive so ill just all about my cock in a last ditch effort because i have no shame
creepyPMs,not_removed,yeah because just having dick game is gonna win the ladies over facepalm the ones who brag like this usually have zero game lol
creepyPMs,not_removed,obviously you should stop being productive and lay in bed with this romeo s
creepyPMs,not_removed,being sick ah i see so the only reason shed say she was sick was purely to get out of hanging out with your charming self and not because she actually was sick makes perfect sense s
creepyPMs,not_removed,i like to call them magicock they think their dick is so magical that a woman should neglect any and all responsibilities to ride it
creepyPMs,not_removed,soooo youre not going to give us his number because yanno the girls like it when a guy talks freaky s
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre not making any sense youre not
creepyPMs,not_removed,gotta love entitlement
creepyPMs,not_removed,perhaps the college has a douchebaggery sciences graduate program
creepyPMs,not_removed,the rural college i went to accepted people with this level of education it was heartbreaking finding this out
creepyPMs,not_removed,ummmight wanna read the rules before posting
creepyPMs,not_removed,he should be arrested go to jail for sexual assault and have to register as a sex offender
creepyPMs,not_removed,
creepyPMs,not_removed,wowi guess harassment is a big word now i think this is classic riamverysmart material edit erri am very dumb
creepyPMs,not_removed,i need only stupids think they know the truth on a shirt now ugh what a delusional narcissist how can anyone possibly be raised to think thats an acceptable way to socialize
creepyPMs,not_removed,thats not something you can decide
creepyPMs,not_removed,saying smart and big words like harassment im pretty sure harassment has more letters than he has iq points
creepyPMs,not_removed,someone took a semester of intro to psychology
creepyPMs,not_removed,his lack of accepting responsibility is infuriating what a cuntwaffle fuck people like this seriously cant stand it can we make social etiquette a required course edit word fix blame the phone
creepyPMs,not_removed,ugh what a giant piece of shit
creepyPMs,not_removed,if harassment is a big word for you then you definitely shouldnt be talking to me wouldve been my response to that last set
creepyPMs,not_removed,this is one of those times that rcreepypms and riamverysmart merge
creepyPMs,not_removed,what a fucking idiot
creepyPMs,not_removed,only stupids yes im sure this strategy will work very well for him vis a vis obtaining sexual companionship
creepyPMs,not_removed,i guarantee you this guy is from trp
creepyPMs,not_removed,op handled this pretty great dude was a huge douche
creepyPMs,not_removed,youre a really good sport for keeping the conversation going for that long
