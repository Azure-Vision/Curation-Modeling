dataisbeautiful,removed,and this is why i despise israel with a burning hatred they are absolutely nothing but sadistic genocidal selfrighteous murdering scumbags and why all because of some moronically magical and mythological douchebag promised them that land thousands of years ago in their little fairy tale book where they just happen to be the chosen people how convenient of course its ironic that this douchebag deity promised them that land only to have it almost immediately disappear for thousands of years until humans started to rebuild it by murdering and slaughtering innocent people that have lived there for thousands of years i have zero sympathy for the jewish plight when it is nothing but killing innocent men women and children that rightfully have a claim on the territory far too many civilizations have fallen in human history and we arent rebuilding all of those before they were called jews they were the hebrews which were nomadic warrior tribes who like all other warrior tribes claimed their land by means of violence but they eventually got their asses kicked and civilization moved on like so many other times so unless were going to start rebuilding the ottoman empire the mongol empire the roman empire the english empire the russian empire etc etc etc then we shouldnt being trying to rebuild this dipshit empire of the past either americans have been lied to mislead manipulated misinformed and coerced into supporting a disgusting genocide based on the lies of politics and the lies of religion all because some dumbfucks think their magic cloud daddy needs them to recreat israel in order to make their stupid fucking book of mythology come true as an american i would like to sincerely apologize to the palestinian people for the murder torture and the advance of illegal occupation of their land not that the jewish people dont also have a right of claim they certainly do but not at the cost of lives land homes communities and the history of the people that also have a claim

dataisbeautiful,removed,and get europe is gong batshit over having to take in just thousands of migrants between each country
dataisbeautiful,removed,i will have a go at it then basically it is completely true that women on average earn less than men the exact figures are difficult to say because everybody has there own number but it definitely exists now people argue that when you control for variables such as women working less hours or women caring for children or women not wanting to negotiate for pay raises or whatever then the wage gap goes away that is true although even after controlling for variables a small gap in earnings still exists the thing is by correcting for those variables you essentially say if you control for the causes of the problem there is no problem the wage gap shows there is a problem with women not getting as many hours or being expected to stay home with the kids or being seen as bitchy if they want a pay increase people that claim it is proof of a secret cabal of white men intentionally paying women less are wrong but people saying that the wage gap was made up by the spooky sjws and that it disappears when you control for a shit ton of problems with the perceived roles of men and women and society are ignoring the problems with the perceived roles of men and women in society thats how i understand it at least

dataisbeautiful,removed,i love the movie but it was ultimately propaganda in reality the american soldier fell out of the helicopter and it was his own fault the movie changed it so it was a baddie somalian that shot a rocket at the helicopter which deftly dodged it causing the american soldier to fall out in the movie the inciting incident was somalian rpg in reality the inciting incident was the failing of an individual american soldier
dataisbeautiful,removed,well yeah the point being generally if youre doing anything really important keeping information memorized in your mind only and keeping your physical self out of harms way is the only way to go that way the only way anyone can get the information is physically torturing you in fact maybe a better way of doing it is not memorizing the info but memorizing a key for the info to be decoded but have the coded info with someone else then they have to catch two people and torture the secrets out of them lol

dataisbeautiful,removed,white women are the most attractiveevery body knows this
dataisbeautiful,removed,yes there is a name for the practice which i unfortunately dont remember off hand but it basically involves shuffling them from one department to another they kill someone in one county and get moved to another one hired no questions asked because hey theyre a cop in one case they killed people over the course of being shuffled around different departments at least but kept being moved around never being charged or brought to trial just internal reviews which are bullshit anyways being a cop in the us is the best job for a serial killer they can do it and have it known about without ever even being tried for their crimes in a court of law
dataisbeautiful,removed,nice to know you are a retard who cant google a single thing google it up find a trust worthy source and voilà theres your data you are nothing but a pathetic ignorant if i say obey the police to not to get shot it doesnt mean i justify every kill the police do if i were to commit a crime i would acknowledge the risk of getting shot by the police why because crime is illegal still if you commit a bad crime are armed and dangerous and run away when the police say freeze its completely justifiable to shoot but as we know there have been cases in which the police have shot an innocent person they are rare but usually exaggerated by the media due to the media attention many simple minded degenerated people probably like you usually draw conclusions that they are common only because of the media attention these people usually lack skills in interpreting and analyzing statistics too whats the most annoying thing they are impossible to reason with why am i saying this ive met too many people like that too many i hope you are not one of them
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats funny i dont agree with many of these
dataisbeautiful,removed,have you spoted them yet ಠಠ
dataisbeautiful,removed,these infographs arent great hardly beautiful the same piece of information just displyed in different ways what is the insight im supposed to gain from looking at this
dataisbeautiful,removed,idk most first world countries seem to be able to stop criminals getting guns when guns are banned and i remember uk police said that they didnt want guns as it would cause an arms race with the criminals so a better comparison would be a country where essentially nobody is allowed guns not a developing country where police have them
dataisbeautiful,removed,yea if alcohol even stays legal in germany by too many islamists for the issue to not come up tbh

dataisbeautiful,removed,the day of september i was home alone watching shrek i heard a ring at the doorbell and walked over looking out the door i saw a car driving away and a small package sitting on the doorstep curious i brought it inside and unwrapped it it was a case with jacob slendtorius written on it in comic sans confused i scratched my head and pulled out the case i opened it up and inside was a cd i placed the cd in my cd player and white noise played i heard scratching at my window and as i approached the noise on the cd got louder and so did the scratching my heart was racing faint noises of breath hitting a microphone sounded from the cd i listened closer it was jacob sartoriuss distorted mixtape the sound of autotune echoed in the background suddenly from my window i saw a beanied gnomelike figure the stench of popcorn singeing my nose behind him was a tall dark figure wearing a sweatshirt and bearing the most hideous of braces the mixtape the gnome figure the scratching i knew it could be only one thing it was jacob slendtorius i thought he was just an urban legend but the hideous beast was standing mere meters away from me what is up dramalertnation lets get roiiiight into the news the gnome whispered i screamed and my ears began to bleed the taller figure the one i had now recognized to be jacob slendtorius slowly walked forward frantically i pulled up the youtube app on my phone and disliked all of his videos and unsubscribed the slendtorius approached me slowly and awkwardly now only feet away in a raspy prepubescent autotuned voice with a menacing chuckle and intrusive grin he told me that i could wear his sweatshirt i dont want to please leave me alone i replied his grin dropped and his face went blank he came closer making me increasingly uncomfortable he warned me that if i do not post this on reddit i will be forced to listen to his mixtape for the rest of my life and he will make me wear his sweatshirt the slendtorius left seven lyric pages and selfadvertisements and promotions on the ground and forced me to hide them in the forest he vanished into the night along with his smaller gnome figure i took the godforsaken cd and attempted to break it but it wouldnt crack hammered it scratched it threw it sat on it digested it but it wouldnt break i put it in the cd player once more and it was a message from the slendtorius you must share this cd give it to an unsuspecting person and do not mention me you will otherwise be forever cursed just like this cd i put it in the mail to a random address and my life has been normal ever since i had my phone on me at the time and was able to take a few pictures for proof i took pictures of the cd case the silhouette of the slendtorius at my window and a few other pictures that ended up being corrupted these are those images

dataisbeautiful,removed,mod pls
dataisbeautiful,removed,im not meaning to sound like im saying that you are trying to instigate an argument with your response im sorry if it came across that way but i was meaning here was that all of these topics are gray areas where valid points can be had on both sides of it just to pick one of the less controversial ones as an example theyre definitely arguments to be made that legalization and regulation of prostitution can minimize the impact of sex trafficking by giving people who are in those situations that way out and providing a legal pathway for the service which is being provided illegally but really with all of these topics there is a real discussion which could be had im just generally voicing my frustration at the fact that such discussions breakdown online in most cases taking mid line stances on issues generally gets you attacked by both sides
dataisbeautiful,removed,flu shot or hpv the multidose flu shot is still one of the only vaccines that contain thimerosal flu vaccines in multidose vials contain thimerosal to safeguard against contamination of the vial httpwwwcdcgovfluprotectvaccinethimerosalhtm there are seven types of flu vaccines one of which causes vaccine shedding from a live virus which as the back of the box states can spread to any person you come in contact with and recommends to stay away from those who have compromised immune systems for up to weeks of the remaining six vaccines several are multidose vaccines which contain more preservatives aka thimerosal july the american academy of pediatrics and the public health service agencies agreed that thimerosal should be reduced or eliminated from vaccines because of the potential risks mercury is a known neurotoxin with cumulative effects multi dose flu vaccines from csl limited merck novartis glaxosmithkline and sanofi pasteur all contain micrograms mcg of mercury per ml the epas safe limit of mercury is to be able to tolerate mcg of mercury and still be at a safe level a person would have to weigh lbs more in regards to the flu shot in australia in june more than adverse responses following seasonal flu vaccine in children under five were reported to the therapeutic goods administration — young children were more likely to end up in hospital because of side effects from a flu vaccine than they were from the disease itself research into the outbreak showed that the vaccine caused two to three hospital admissions due to febrile seizures for every hospital admission due to influenza prevented thus the vaccination program in children under five clearly did more harm than good corduroy a side effects worse than the disease the sydney morning herald september package inserts of all flu vaccines start off with the same disclaimer the indication for vaccinating against influenza disease is based on the immune response elicited by the vaccine there have been no controlled clinical studies demonstrating a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination finland vows care for narcolepsy kids helsinki times october according to many metaanalyses of the influenza vaccine by the unbiased cochrane collaboration based in italy there is no evidence from many systematic reviews of the scientific literature that inactivated influenza vaccines have any effect although studies are plentiful they are generally of poor quality and lack convincing evidence supporting the conjecture that vaccination minimizes transmission of disease medimmune flumist fluvirin fluzone package inserts a study published in the lancet contested the accepted wisdom that influenza vaccination programs for the elderly reduce hospital admissions for pneumonia it found that in a us managedcare population of older adults over three seasons the effect of influenza vaccination was strikingly lower than previous estimates jefferson t influenza vaccination policy versus evidence british medical journal vol october so ask yourself this so if the flu shot poses potentially serious health risks contains mercury has varying doses of flu virus and mercury if it comes from a multi dose vial weakens the immune system and doesnt protect against the flu – what would be the reason to actually subject oneself or ones children to this vaccine i could go on and on and on with more scientific studies news articles from current events and professionals giving their experience with both vaccines but this should be plenty enough for you to do your own research and question how youre being turned into a revenue stream sorry folks hate to be that guy but stop eating the shit theyre shoveling down your throat vaccine science is todays tobacco science the conflicts of interest have been proven and the junkscience has been debunked whitewash period removing people from studies with adverse reactions int he first hours etc

dataisbeautiful,removed,my job is to make you feel cool and like you know what youre doing without letting you choose something that wont impress youre a young couple who dont normally do this kind of thing and youre considering having beer all night because the wine list is intimidating my job is to break down the wall and help you choose something fun and affordable that you feel comfortable with i should also be able to recommend a great beer if you really dont want wine i am curious how many somms actually put numbers to this sort of thing do you find that making recommendations is more of a gutfeeling basedonexperience kind of thing or is there any kind of quantitative analysis put into it do somms ever keep note of how often their recommendations are successful vs not successful in relation to the original basis eg i categorized the customer as belonging to category x and therefore i recommended wine y but im only successful here so instead ill try this instead and see if things improve also something that isnt really mentioned in the series is the fact that hospitality can be really draining in the kind of settings these people work its hard to work hours a day or days a week on your feet with a smile permanently fixed to your face constantly using your brain and trying to keep up the patter to build rapports and all of it for shit pay a qualification like ms or mw is the door for some people to work for better pay during normal hours at a normal pace thats another thing i never understood if the pay is shit and the work is hard why do people do it is it the norm or do most people see it as a stepping stone to the betterpaybetterhours framework you mention i imagine most people would have to really love it to stick with it but at the same time it also seems to be a lovehate relationship from what i can tell even in your other post you mention thin margins the whole thing just seems torturous long hours high risk low pay due to thin margins high stress etc whats the light at the end of the tunnel for those situations

dataisbeautiful,removed,the green part at the top bronxville and scarsdale
dataisbeautiful,removed,tho i havent analyzed this particular data in depth yet raceethnicity and parental education levels usually
dataisbeautiful,removed,or race
dataisbeautiful,removed,being poor gives you more excuses if youre from a welloff family in a mediumhigh ses and you get bad scores youre dumb do that with low ses its because youre poor both have external factors but it comes down to family outlook on education working hard and not making excuses those are the outliers in low ses environments is it hard to come up in a family that doesnt value education yes how do we fix it holding students accountable in schools is one way specifically if they are not held accountable at home then the public gets upset that a spade is being called a spade
dataisbeautiful,removed,most likely its fairly wellknown that sat scores correlate with the ability to pay for sat classes
dataisbeautiful,removed,if they had shown the jersey side just by the hudson there would be lots of green rich affluent koreans all along the bank just sayin
dataisbeautiful,removed,why would a smart driven and capable being be a teacher when they could use their resources in the private sector and make way more you want highly qualified then pay them highly and weed out the bad ones just like in any business however what you have is a large deficit in teachers entering the workforce because of subpar support for teachers with behavioral students not being held accountable pay related to testing even if students are not being held accountable and training programs that only look at pedagogy and not in classroom management to hold students accountable i am for having qualified teachers in the workforce but if you dont make teaching a respected field anymore then you will get shit people trying to fill the void a lot can be fixed with localized control away from national curriculum giving the teacher what they need to be successful with training and when you have those quality teachers then you can hold students accountable because the reason for their failure with be on the student its a lot of moving parts that can be fixed but it will always upset someone i take it that you dont know much about the teachingeducation climate in the us not to fault you but simply going from headlines about horrible teachers will lead into the thinking that it is a simple switch for a better one it wont be because the better ones know better than to get into teaching at this point same with law enforcement those bad apples could use more regulation and at the same time citizens should be held accountable for their actions if that is mutual then there shouldnt be an epidemic
dataisbeautiful,removed,or ethnicity
dataisbeautiful,removed,whitechinese
dataisbeautiful,removed,lol my students do nothing and im the one held accountable they fail why didnt i give them retakes oh you gave them retakes why didnt you make sure they came in why didnt you remind them why didnt you call home every day why didnt you emotionally engage them when we dont even give you a curriculum to work off of or a textbook to use theres a reason im getting my masters in statistics and finding a job that pays literally as much
dataisbeautiful,removed,that doesnt really hold true in nyc they get qualified teachers even in tougher districts with regularity through the ny teaching fellows program even with that a lot of those kids are fighting an uphill battle against very tough circumstances though
dataisbeautiful,removed,if intelligence is at least partly hereditary and we live in what is mostly a meritocracy isnt this expected
dataisbeautiful,removed,sats correlate with iq iq is genetic iq correlates with income levels
dataisbeautiful,removed,i laugh at the idiots who say the tests are racist give me a break its not the tests its the morons who are taking them inner city types dont value a proper education plain and simple nor do they have the proper parental support to guide them through the early stages of their educational development you are talking about a class of people who scoff at our founding fathers yet wax fantastic for saint skittles and michael brown its very much a cultural issue and until its addressed properly theyll continue down into an abyss of poverty and crime whitey is done taking the blame for their misdoings
dataisbeautiful,removed,this is wrong this is what no child left behind set out to accomplish it leads to teacher attrition and underperforming schools receiving less funding when in reality they should receive more to offset the higher educational burden they hold that combined with standardized testing forced teachers to put all of their effort into ensuring that their worst performing students get very good at standardized tests and not much else it left high performing students with no challenge it then penalized underperforming schools and thus lowers wages for teachers at those schools meaning those schools will almost always attract subpar teachers anyway what you need to do is flatten federal budget assistance for all schools based on student population and then directly incentivize new teachers to work with atrisk populations or underperforming schools you cant fix education by shuffling budgets because schools will always try to game this its terrible for students its terrible for teachers
dataisbeautiful,removed,no one would argue the fact that google is one of the most useful on the internet unfortunately most people only use aboututmsourceredditutmcampaignsamreenutmmediumcpc

dataisbeautiful,removed,imagine how green the whole new york would be if it was vastly populated by white males instead of negreos and other minorities

dataisbeautiful,removed,colorblind people are disgusting learn to see colors jerk
dataisbeautiful,removed,yall dumb
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah but the top score is still
dataisbeautiful,removed,wow that other is really carrying that school
dataisbeautiful,removed,also heat map of where most asians in nyc area reside that or middle to upper class whites
dataisbeautiful,removed,wow ive been looking for a guide to the blackest neighborhoods in nyc thanks
dataisbeautiful,removed,as a trump supporter i wonder where the black people mexicans and muslims live also as a trump supporter i am convinced that any aryan kids that scored bad is because of the bad influence of black mexican or muslim kids because aryans are never to blame for their own demises like i am not to blame that i am unemployed without college education and on welfare and still demand to be middle class its the blacks mexicans and muslims fault
dataisbeautiful,removed,theres some loser outside my house hes been sitting in a fucking car for four hours doing god knows what he must be one of the lucky ones maybe if i work really hard i can be that guy one day
dataisbeautiful,removed,he said he graduated in so i dont think the internet had much to do with his application process like it would today but it probably should be pointed out that plenty of poor schools in america dont have access to computersinternet for their students or they have to share a handful of machines for too many kids if they have access at home im sure it can help if they know where to look for help which is another big hurtle knowing what websites and resources to trust seems obvious for those of us who casually browse reddit but is a skill to learn my sister is a professor at a smaller college in a very very poor area all of her students graduated high school but they werent educated and most of them are very unprepared for college despite what their hs grades reflect every other semester she has to teach the english type course and she always has very sad stories about students who dont know how to structure a paper at all their grammar skills are terrible and many of them plagiarize without thinking about it because nobody in high school cared if i did it then they dont read or prepare at all for her course because they got away with never reading or doing pretty much anything in school before she usually spends most of the semester just getting them to what should be standard for a graduating high schooler and since many of her students are rural poor cable is not standard whatsoever in their towns many of them probably didnt have internet beyond shitty satellite until they got to college if that all that is to say despite the internet being around now its still a tool that needs to be taught properly for kids to properly use itif their schools have the resources to do that sorry for the long response when you didnt even write to me to begin with hah
dataisbeautiful,removed,all of the black neighborhoods are red tell me again how its not true at all let me guess you have an anecdotal story about a guy you once knew
dataisbeautiful,removed,fuck
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,a more accurate test would be to remove the shower faucet from the wall and connect it to two tanks of water one tank is filled with cold water whereas the other tank is filled with hot water the water only mixes at the faucet so the hot water tank remains hot and the cold water tank remains cold this is similar to how the faucet is connected in the shower however it removes the variability of the water temperature in the hot water tank but impractical they just need to sample each angle several times randomize the order they sample and wait each time so that its the same initial state what they really ought to do is plot temperature curves for each angle over the a desired shower length though rather than just taking an instantaneous reading for each angle
dataisbeautiful,removed,you should have googled my quote you would have gotten this
dataisbeautiful,removed,nice integral

dataisbeautiful,removed,great now i want to play civ
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,they sorted by perceived average and put the actual average where it would lie in that data set im not saying thats a good way of doing it but its not completely illogical
dataisbeautiful,removed,the gspot is in inches in the empowered american woman needs to stop reading shit
dataisbeautiful,removed,so youre arguing the source and specifically not the content is that right
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,it is deceiving because tooltip shows that they have an erect size of cm i think it should be interpreted as shrinking in case of erection instead of having only flaccid ones
dataisbeautiful,removed,not fat obviously
dataisbeautiful,removed,i aint giving you no tree fiddy you goddamn loch ness monster
dataisbeautiful,removed,also have lived in both and have to disagree americans make a habit of doing everything bigger than everyone else including obesity the first time i touched down in america my mind was blown just by the blubber on display at the medium size airport its possible of course that coming from the south of england the north has a crazy morbid obesity problem ive never seen but seeming as the fuckoff big obese people in america are noticeably present in every state and every city i dont think you can explain it away that easily after all iirc obesity rates around the world are usually measured just by number of people who are regarded as clinically obese not by average weight it makes sense too with the income inequality in america the average person is shopping at a place like target buying food that is filled to the brim with additives and hfcs its not great even for the not poor in this country as the food industry goes out of its way to make food as addictive and terrible for you as possible but especially for the many poor people their choice of diet is limited to appalling options
dataisbeautiful,removed,my dick seriously can grow up to in length from its smallest flaccid size i think its kind of brilliant like the sexier version of what jesus did with the fish and wine but the downside is that time that girl tries to suck your cock and youre too drunk and nervous to get it up so rather than impressing her you worry she thinks you have a micropenis and will never want to see you again luckily she tried again a few times so she got to witness the incredible jack in the box dick trick before it was too late were married now pats penis
dataisbeautiful,removed,remind me to never ever meet you or the women you apparently go after

dataisbeautiful,removed,because we are fat
dataisbeautiful,removed,yes for sure the code is not for the faint of heart alongside the python script you need a folder called data where there are all your gpx files then you will have a huge png picture something like import it in gimp or something else add a black layer for the background and voilà
dataisbeautiful,removed,am i the only one that thought scandinavia was just a penis going through puberty
dataisbeautiful,removed,the results come from the httpimgurcomaogzkt and are a remake of the previous visualization m i used photoshop excel and paintnet for the charts
dataisbeautiful,removed,so were just gonna ignore that sweden and finland look like a big green dong
dataisbeautiful,removed,haiti and west africa have my respect
dataisbeautiful,removed,i believe this is a repost
dataisbeautiful,removed,no and you really should be embarrassed to be a such a fucking moron to not understand that there is a difference in the use of resources per capita
dataisbeautiful,removed,probably because the european population has been going down hill for a long time now dont worry muhamad will fix that
dataisbeautiful,removed,finland and swede must have the freshes air
dataisbeautiful,removed,we forgot to respect each other due to excessive use of social media we discuss almost everything of ourselves at the social media kareena kapoor said it while talking with correspondents

dataisbeautiful,removed,so when do we feed it joyce
dataisbeautiful,removed,i dont think there is anything machine learning related on this page its builds a visual tree of the sentence structure thats an algorithm for sure but not machine learning a correct way to title this would be watch a computer algorithm interpreting the grammar structure of mark twain
dataisbeautiful,removed,error does that mean it had a tough time learning
dataisbeautiful,removed,an useful ressource httpwwwdatavizcataloguecomindexhtml
dataisbeautiful,removed,portugal is currently the safest country in the world our middle east population is almost it is literally impossible for terrorists to act here without being instantly flagged also were very isolated from the rest of the world due to our location remember that economy alone doesnt make a country
dataisbeautiful,removed,united kingdom very stable interesting
dataisbeautiful,removed,finland is eternal
dataisbeautiful,removed,australia has had prime ministers in years and portugal is verging on a debt crisis and yet they are listed at the same level as norway which has a huge sovereign fund and is listed under the human development index guess what country is second in the hdi australia the pm thing is how the system works we dont directly elect a president we elect a party to form government who lends its support to one of their own as pm they can change who they support if they are unhappy with the current one generally if they consistently poll poorly since the only pm who did not replace a sitting pm or get replaced while pm was john howard and on the other hand kevin rudd did both
dataisbeautiful,removed,wow islam sure is a destructive force in our world
dataisbeautiful,removed,shhhhh
dataisbeautiful,removed,ouch
dataisbeautiful,removed,in countries that are more egalitarian such as sweden you see more gendered roles than countries that are less egalitarian like pakistan the number of women in stem fields is higher in less egalitarian countries
dataisbeautiful,removed,if youre making a year helping sick people that are having their lives ruined by medical bills but their health some what improved you should be ashamed of your selves i paid for an ambulance ride everyone in the medical industry should be ashamed of them selves all i know is if i get really sick im renting a ferrari and running it full speed into a wall to kill my self before i step in a hospital and have a bunch of spoiled little college kids steal all my money

dataisbeautiful,removed,this is a good question
dataisbeautiful,removed,please answer this
dataisbeautiful,removed,interesting content
dataisbeautiful,removed,how much increase in book sales are you getting by doing this ama
dataisbeautiful,removed,i was in middle school when the first came out and skipped it to continue playing catch now years later i can say that i have never seen any of them and have no plans to in the future
dataisbeautiful,removed,this is entirely an issue of how society shapes scientific study and not scientific study itself no then you add the clear shameless conflicts of interest caused by pharmaceutical industry authors doing trials or reviews on their own products better a society that isnt given a proper education cant be held responsible so why does our education suck im gonna get really high while you realize how depressing the answer to that question gets you are close to the right track if you think im crazy go look at how the ama was founded now tell me what about that has changed sometimes i am amazed just how fucked up this world and medicinescience in particular is then i look back at history and i wonder how the fuck we even got this far two spliffs it is
dataisbeautiful,removed,this is common knowledge he doesnt need a source of course a google search can find it if youd like to catch up
dataisbeautiful,removed,natural gas is definitely much cleaner than coal but nuclear and hydro and both far far cleaner than anything viable plant out there and yet we arent building new plants because of environmental concerns we are idiots
dataisbeautiful,removed,coal use dropped in for global economic reasons to some degree we have fracking to thank but mostly its because chinas economy slowed down
dataisbeautiful,removed,there are tons of uninhabited places that can support hydro please look at a map of northern canada
dataisbeautiful,removed,you have no idea what youre talking about hydro is more environmentally friendly than any fossil fuel
dataisbeautiful,removed,there are thousands of rivers in northern canada
dataisbeautiful,removed,youre probably one of those people who think wind and solar on a large scale is economically viable we need to build nuclear and hydro to dump coal and oil burning power plants today not in years when green energy is viable
dataisbeautiful,removed,on the scale needed to replace fossil thats the reality if youre not brainwashed by propaganda
dataisbeautiful,removed,instabul was constantinople now its istabul not constantinople
dataisbeautiful,removed,it also wont break if dipped in lava
dataisbeautiful,removed,you need to get labor up to northern canada dam up rivers and people to work all year and deal with the brutal cold up there you realize this is already done right and that hyrdo quebec produces of quebecs consumption from only a handful of damns
dataisbeautiful,removed,per kwh it the cheapest of them all
dataisbeautiful,removed,does does it come with free spying
dataisbeautiful,removed,oh for christ sakes everything you said here is wrong we literally already have hydro plants in the north
dataisbeautiful,removed,a mapping of information to a visual property text in a table is not sufficient a data variable must be transformed and mapped onto a visual property such as color size or position note if the visualization features spatial data geographic position alone is not sufficient it must be more than dots on a map based on above — from your own rules on data visualization — its still pretty weak no
dataisbeautiful,removed,once again new zealand and australia are cut out
dataisbeautiful,removed,location of catalhoyuk is shown wrong here

dataisbeautiful,removed,correlation does not equal causation fucking morons if you idiots got real degrees instead of your liberal art crap you would know this of course with an actually useful degree you wouldnt agree with the notion that you wont be able to pay down student loans and own a house either i graduated yr ago and im making more than no problems buying a house
dataisbeautiful,removed,dude who fucking cares they get paid the salary they agreed to less thats it news flash lower taxes are never going to make you rich you will still be poor find a better job and stop whining about taxes ffs

dataisbeautiful,removed,double yaxis is for charlatans
dataisbeautiful,removed,awww im sorry bernie didnt get in for you kids and pay for your everything hhahahahhahhahah
dataisbeautiful,removed,can you add a quick comment about correlation not being the same as causation part of the reason for this decline is due to more millennials living in apartments rather than buying homes
dataisbeautiful,removed,are you made because your che guevara shirt is dirty with bong water
dataisbeautiful,removed,you didnt hurt my feelings you didnt apologize calling a mixed race person a chimpanzee and then calling them oversensitive to a racial slur is not an apology you didnt make any cogent points all you did was call trump a racist bit youre that we have documented proof of you calling a mixed race man a chimpanzee and then victim blaming me as being oversensitive trump has never called me or anyone else of color a chimpanzee all i want is for you to stop responding you won youve proved how smart a racist you are congrats
dataisbeautiful,removed,i landed a pretty good job right out of university and to own a house before if you dont come from a family with money even with a job you either a have a significant other that youve cut your expenses in half and created cost synergies with eating at home ect or b you seriously want a fucking house and you financially make it work through strict investing and spending i personally have to consciously aggressively save or you could work without a job and never meet the requirements for a reasonable mortgage theres so many stupid micro exceptions that a majority is bound to disagree with me based on their personal experiences but hopefully everyone can agree that even with an ok job youre not going to land a house pre without consciously striving for it
dataisbeautiful,removed,owed avoided it for years finally realized its not going away paid off this year alone main loans greatlakes government loans of which is interest american education services was will have it paid off this year mohela navient note i am a digital nomad and travel the world and pay off my loans

dataisbeautiful,removed,if i were to graph how many shits were taken per year in america the graph would look something like notice that the number of shits increases along with the number of americans you cannot infer anything from a graph like this other than the population of america is increasing therefore more shit is being made if you normalized this data as number of shits per american per year you might actually be able to deduce that for some reason americans are shitting more now than they were in the
dataisbeautiful,removed,i think it was when ellen pao was banning all the hate speech subs
dataisbeautiful,removed,this data is literally hitler
dataisbeautiful,removed,and that liberals is how you destroy any credibility you had in one word
dataisbeautiful,removed,each spike is another spielberg or film designed to make you never forget
dataisbeautiful,removed,really you just explained common sense and facts
dataisbeautiful,removed,trump is hitler global warming is hitler my neighbor who lets his dog crap in my yard is hitler everything is hitler
dataisbeautiful,removed,everything is hitler to liberals legally enforcing border laws that are already in effect does not compare to a person in charge of a regime that murdered million jews the most ironic part of all of this is that they are sticking up for islam a religion that quite literally follows the ideas of hitler and is actively seeking to slaughter jews around the globe thankfully the adults are back in charge
dataisbeautiful,removed,i guess a lot of sjws are stupid enough to keep comparing trump to hitler spoiler alert he literally isnt
dataisbeautiful,removed,ive had relationships where ive quit contributing anything positive the relationships finally end me shouting that my ex is a whore is the same thing as calling our president hitler

dataisbeautiful,removed,i hear hes mighty popular
dataisbeautiful,removed,i was sure ive done this while posting added now thank you
dataisbeautiful,removed,holy shit the anti polsci cirklejerk may be the most annoying thing on reddit
dataisbeautiful,removed,yesterdays post about mentions of hitler on rworldnews was interesting but it did not take into account the overall number of comments on rworldnews it is expected that as the subscriber count of rworldnews increases so would the total number of comments and therefore the number of comments with the word hitler as shown in this version the trends in mention counts are less convincing after normalising to total comment count data plotted using ms excel one plot has a log scale for comment counts for ease of viewing as per the previous post the dataset was published and compiled by ustuckinthematrix in rdatasets tables are available on bigquery at httpsbigquerycloudgooglecomtablefhbigqueryredditcommentsall i used the following queries select yearsectotimestampcreatedutc as year monthsectotimestampcreatedutc as month sumcase when instrupperbody hitler then else end as count from where subredditworldnews group by year month select yearsectotimestampcreatedutc as year monthsectotimestampcreatedutc as month sumcase when instrupperbody then else end as count from where subredditworldnews group by year month

dataisbeautiful,removed,ah ill elaborate then in my example im talking about adjacent states virginia and west virginia northern virginia is basically a huge metropolis surrounding the geographically tiny city of dc a lot of virginias population lives there about million of virginias million total population its a rich area with lots of well educated people most of west virginia on the other hand is mostly in or on the other side of the appalachian mountains and is isolated culturally and economically from this prosperity west virginias economy was largely based on coal mining which has been in decline since the since then little investment has been made in the area their largest employers today are walmart and the local university hospital system wv has a total population of million and their largest city is the capital charleston with just over people the state is mostly rural and mostly poor

dataisbeautiful,removed,is that also the reason you punch her in the face and she cant return any punches
dataisbeautiful,removed,to be fair biologically women are also attracted to financially stable mates but you would call them gold digging whores
dataisbeautiful,removed,the ones who do are losers likely quite weak compared to their male counterparts taking joy in their comparative physical superiority all the while ignoring the suffocating reality that none of these physical traits matter in a supermajority of modern professions
dataisbeautiful,removed,i like graphs
dataisbeautiful,removed,those who take a known biological difference as a bragging point heh i am such an alpha are pretty lame
dataisbeautiful,removed,now lets apply that to the different mental abilities which cannot be measured directly like strength imagine the level of denial and dishonesty they can reach in that case
dataisbeautiful,removed,haha so weird that despite men being superior to women in every conceivable way were all just equal thanks kikes

dataisbeautiful,removed,as the rational sort i know that women are all fat and men are all muscle allways when my gf gets angry as hell and i feel like she would love to beat the shit out of me i offer her to work out hard while i keep sitting on my ass for months as allways so at the end we beat the shit out of each other in a fair an equal fight she didnt agree till now but who knows one day the rage may be big enough that she is into the competition i drink protein shakes and eat chicken every day and know for a fact that no woman is as strong as i am
dataisbeautiful,removed,its absolutely does in almost all manual labor jobs dont be a naive fool
dataisbeautiful,removed,you must have forgotten how you were acting when your pubes busted out of your nutsacks you were yelling running screaming jumping and flipping shit because you couldnt handle the new hormones running through your veins
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats a really big jump from theres a theory to we literally think ya know because the fact that theres a theory doesnt mean we think it it means we think maybe it and its a theory i dont think has much support anyway you wont make much headway trying to convince people that a woman suffering pms is manly in any way
dataisbeautiful,removed,but slim what if you win wouldnt it be weird
dataisbeautiful,removed,not like guys have been practicing their grip strength since puberty or anything
dataisbeautiful,removed,men are physically strong but woman are dangerous people dont think for once men are being used as tools and woman can get away with things and can trick you or plot anything towards you men are learned not to touch woman ive experienced these kind of evil woman you will go to jail these days for simply catcalling let alone having sex just because women are weaker than us does not mean we can control them its the other way round women are manipulative species and only use men for their agenda and protection thats a fact they dont love you just use you for their sake﻿ but no its genetically proven that men are physically superior and more emotionally stable my issue is not all women are like that but my mom is a different type of women but she warned me that there are manipulative sexual controlling gold diggers and i now know how evil this world is especially with these type of women﻿
dataisbeautiful,removed,ur mum
dataisbeautiful,removed,minute one ur mum go humans
dataisbeautiful,removed,ive had people actually tell me that being stronger is male privilege i asked them if dolphins have swimming privilege and their heads promptly exploded
dataisbeautiful,removed,cue comments of well you try to squeeze out a baby and well see how strong you are
dataisbeautiful,removed,lol that is just flat out fucking wrong man test levels peak at and start declining from then on
dataisbeautiful,removed,i am laughing because i was able to dead lift more than when i was like
dataisbeautiful,removed,i just spit beer on my computer thanks
dataisbeautiful,removed,careful with those facts and studies dont want to trigger some sjw land whales
dataisbeautiful,removed,most of the males here on reddit are below the average and are weaker then the female
dataisbeautiful,removed,lol i think youre the pedantic twat you keep referencing a video im telling you what happened get over it twat
dataisbeautiful,removed,physically but also mentally because we dont bleed out of our pee holes once a month and make bad decisions
dataisbeautiful,removed,and a raucous cheer goes up from the neckbeards as an added bonus by moving some of them discover halfeaten sandwiches in their flab
dataisbeautiful,removed,just out of curiosity where did you get this data
dataisbeautiful,removed,the war of the sexes rages on
dataisbeautiful,removed,well dont you think that it might have to do with training and culture if you take a brother and a sister neither of whom ever work out who eat the same as one another im sure the sister could probably beat the shit out of her brother if she were really pissed at him a woman who works out and builds her muscles regularly can easily whip a man who never does but women are trained not to get strong they are trained not to hurt men they are trained to fear them and submit to them men are trained to dominate to hurt its not about we have to acknowledge differences this study is worthless just propaganda for male supremacy almost all what the hells the point of that no this is just fodder for the reddit misogynist circle jerk
dataisbeautiful,removed,this just in social justice feelings do not overcome fact something we all knew for years of human existence yet fat tumblrites couldnt figure out men are great at some things and women are great at some things gender roles exist due to nature
dataisbeautiful,removed,oh fuck off with the grandstanding the rules are in the fucking sidebar and noone needs your pointless shit at the top of every fucking thread cunts
dataisbeautiful,removed,benches he benches benches
dataisbeautiful,removed,alternatively why do some women take such perverse pride in their ability to bear children we evolved to do different things dont be an asshole about it
dataisbeautiful,removed,uh i am transgender hormones are responsible for like of a persons upper body strength and estrogen wrecks upper body strength like i can barely carry cat food to the counter at target anymore at only a year on hormones i was relatively strong pre transition a year before and why quote the word transgender
dataisbeautiful,removed,i think youre talking sense there are smart and intelligent women no doubt turn on for me too problem is bravery men can take risks with their intelligence history is full of those i dont want to demean women because men will be nothing without them its just that we should all know our places in life and our abilities and try and be comfortable with them rather than trying to be in another ones shoes women fighting that sounds like feminists pushing women to show off just how could a woman survive long drawn out war with no space to freshen up and all that just sad theyre trying very hard over the years to be something theyre not designed to bevery sad and vain﻿
dataisbeautiful,removed,feminists this data is sexist and shows how oppressed women are by the white male patriarchy
dataisbeautiful,removed,we open jars for a reasonjust saying
dataisbeautiful,removed,this graph is a lie because feminism told me i could be anything i want even stronger than a man
dataisbeautiful,removed,fucking sexist reddit strikes again way to not so subtly state that men are better than women
dataisbeautiful,removed,we also have bigger dicks
dataisbeautiful,removed,its in the data its beautiful right the data that is it is beautiful
dataisbeautiful,removed,stickied so no one even has to come look in on this anymore because that seems like exactly whats happening in this fallacyridden fallusfest
dataisbeautiful,removed,make an iq bell curve comparison between blacks and whites the results are quite considerable
dataisbeautiful,removed,dude i worked as a stablehand shoveling shit and carrying buckets of water and feed throwing around hay bales etc just fine as a thirteen year old girl its hard work but its not impossible
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah and our dicks are bigger
dataisbeautiful,removed,lana
dataisbeautiful,removed,basically women was able to keep up until they hit puberty that monthly loss of blood is scary
dataisbeautiful,removed,vast vast majority which is my original question how do you quantify that i agree its a majority a vast vast majority is opinion unless you have some method you intend to use to quantify that
dataisbeautiful,removed,ssh baby is ok
dataisbeautiful,removed,omg hide this from the feminists theyre going to get triggered so hard
dataisbeautiful,removed,knowing reddit some feminist was angry and started screaming reeeeeee like an autistic child unfortunately for her real data temper tantrum
dataisbeautiful,removed,at hand are we still doing phrasing
dataisbeautiful,removed,httpyoutubelayoutstopwatchbvbypukcqtt
dataisbeautiful,removed,i just read through a few of the comments here and wtf mate do you guys actually like sexism do you think its a good idea and things should just stay as they are there seems to be this backlash against feminism examples of unreasonable behavior of feminist women is made fun of while the actual debate is completely neglected youre going to find idiots in any sufficiently large group of people these bad examples are completely overrepresented in most online discussions i think in my experience the percentage of feminists that are actually going around devaluing people and propagating women biased double standards is extremely small yet this is apparently all the internet wants to talk about i think people are searching for ways to discredit feminism because they fear it deep down killallmen
dataisbeautiful,removed,oh and testosterone mostly testosterone
dataisbeautiful,removed,the notion that men are somehow the stronger gender is a deeply embeded socially constructed myth that is what sjws actually believe
dataisbeautiful,removed,what is even the point of these kind of inflammatory posts people who make these kinds of posts are really better off dead
dataisbeautiful,removed,found the woman
dataisbeautiful,removed,many women seem to believe they have have strong legs
dataisbeautiful,removed,this is obviously because of the way women are brought up in our patriarchal society and theyre also taught to be shorter because there are no genetic differences s
dataisbeautiful,removed,do you consider yourself an mra do you advocate mens rights do you support donald trump are you a pua no if you say yes to any of those you are none of those it turns out my fucking faggy friend that you are a repressed homosexual so go fuck a butt and maybe relax with all the fucking bullshit
dataisbeautiful,removed,how was combined strength calculated average over most common lifts squat deadlift bench ohs etc
dataisbeautiful,removed,correct
dataisbeautiful,removed,youre just looking for an argument at this point his point was clearly that its idiotic to say things like women are capable of much more then men see birth etc
dataisbeautiful,removed,i for one cannot afford robots to mow the lawn fix things build things or go to work for me
dataisbeautiful,removed,doubt it
dataisbeautiful,removed,oh god signed in just to comment on how much this made me laugh
dataisbeautiful,removed,hell i saw a tampon commercial about closing the wage gap yesterday

dataisbeautiful,removed,actually nyc hired a two females that failed their pt test and one got injured on their first shift trying to take down a ladder from a truck and the other was injured on their first medical call thats what affirmative action is doing to first responders
dataisbeautiful,removed,i dont like your title so what feels inflammatory not at all as if youre trying to get people to click thats the point of a title in the first place even if you put in grip strength studies gss it feel more neutral and evidence based care to rephrase that in english
dataisbeautiful,removed,oh and just let her legs dangle
dataisbeautiful,removed,i would say most men are more agile than most women
dataisbeautiful,removed,you were wrong look at who youre replying to im not the same person you were replying to earlier no my argument was simply that you were wrong so like i said youre just looking for an argument at this point
dataisbeautiful,removed,thanks for that while were at it when it comes to people being idiots with data i feel an analogue case is that the majority of people seem to insist that average representation is the same as equality if for example group a represents of the population but ends up being qualified to enter university more often than the average person we cant look at our nice affirmative action program see them fielding of all university students and be like yup thats equality in reality what happened in this example is on average people from group a have to compete more for less spots than other groups simply because they belong to group a the exact same is true for the opposite example tldr people having completely equal opportunities with zero discrimination in any shape or form will in all likelyhood not result in nice and tidy equal distribution the mere fact that certain jobs have low amounts of people of specific groups working in them does not automatically imply bias we need to be able to show and prove said bias for that to be the case
dataisbeautiful,removed,that one dude thats weaker than all of the women is me
dataisbeautiful,removed,this applies to mental emotional strength as well maybe in another years it will be politically correct to admit this

dataisbeautiful,removed,why do people on reddit always feel the need to let other people know they read their history i dont give a fuck
dataisbeautiful,removed,hmmm very interesting checks op submitted page

dataisbeautiful,removed,thanks mr porn peddler
dataisbeautiful,removed,rcatgirls
dataisbeautiful,removed,so youre a karma pimp well done sir
dataisbeautiful,removed,graphic proof of no life at all
dataisbeautiful,removed,i noticed the bible belt lit up in red and i can help but wonder what the map would look like when describing other things like poverty unemployment and cancer rates obesity education levels and other atrocious numbers we could probably assume would underscore the southern baptist areas quite perfectly
dataisbeautiful,removed,maybe if you got that chode out of your mouth youd stop coughing
dataisbeautiful,removed,im sure all the founding fathers would agree with you they were dumb to believe in god and put all the stuff about god in all our founding documents if they were alive now im sure they wouldnt believe it what they regarded as the most important part of their lives and this country
dataisbeautiful,removed,usa usa usa
dataisbeautiful,removed,no i made a joke about hookers and blow and then you saw your arse
dataisbeautiful,removed,its easy to be met negative when rent alone is of your income
dataisbeautiful,removed,once you start going down the road that is inceldom there is no going back there is no real coming back or escape from inceldom life is no computer game there is no quicksave you can go back to you have to live with the knowledge of never experiencing the young love so you constantly battle inside your heart a warring dichotomy of whether its too late and have to accept that or if maybe theres some way to still capture those days but its measured against the realisation that anyone else your age will not be in the same place as you and you grudgingly have to accept that reality even if a fuckton of fortuitous circumstances aligned and you are able to meet someone there are years of loneliness and inceldom that cannot easily be unmade though you secretly hope that the person that is with you might have extraordinary patience and empathy to understand the full measure of this if they do they are surely a miracle and its nothing to do with entitlement in the sense that most normies might assume its more a question of wasnt there anything about me that appealed to someone the secret hope of experiencing love from someone that wasnt a given family for example almost like a conditional love opposed to unconditional because its actually conditional on who you are as a person and how they cherish you for that how do you go through life without ever having anyone who you can be vulnerable with someone where you can let your guard down without consequence or reproach i do not know what that even feels like youre expected and assumed to be strong all the time that takes a colossal toll on you the effects of which you may not even be aware of yourself if theres a question of entitlement surely its just the permissable allowance of hoping to feel like a normal person the entitlement of being human yet i look towards the normies and ask am i really the subhuman incel monster am i really too far gone are incels really not entitled to feeling human
dataisbeautiful,removed,because those groups commit crime disproportionately more often its rather simple to assume the amount of police interactions with each group should be the same we have to assume that each group is just as likely to commit crimes we know that isnt true
dataisbeautiful,removed,they happen to everyone but more often to groups that commit crimes more often it would be disproportionate if all groups committed crimes at the same rate but they dont so its proportionate given the difference among those groups in propensity to commit the crime in the first place
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah fun
dataisbeautiful,removed,there are more stars in a galaxy than there are brains in my body
dataisbeautiful,removed,since both are mostly empty space there wont be many if any star collisions most stars and their planets will end up in a new combined galaxy while some will be flung out to travel intergalactic space man think of looking up at the night sky to see only the other objects in your system and maybe a few nearby galaxies anyway a simulation of the event
dataisbeautiful,removed,legit lol at the fireballthumbsdown representing the end of time
dataisbeautiful,removed,call me crazy but im betting against the personal taxi business in the longrun teslas ride sharing program will be the future in my opinion put you car in taxi mode select the minimum rating for people to use your car and the time that you need it back then forget it cheaper for everyone involved
dataisbeautiful,removed,i didnt read anything past after i stalked your comment history if you want to stay someplace fine but dont go whining on the internet that wah uber takes too much and they are bad while youre working for them that makes you look like an entitled ass
dataisbeautiful,removed,so much mind blown
dataisbeautiful,removed,well the timescale on the video is about million years a second but yeah from the perspective of a human life this is far too long to even consider entire civilizations will rise and fall in the space of a microsecond in this scale an intelligent species could develop and die out in less than a millisecond it would be safe to say that from the perspective of any intelligent species that end up experiencing this merger there will be no concept that the galaxies are in the process of merging they will either be two relatively close galaxies or just one galaxy with odd perturbations
dataisbeautiful,removed,we are so small
dataisbeautiful,removed,i had no idea gossip was so old
dataisbeautiful,removed,that end bit is charmingly naive hi person who clicked here from reddit if youre reading this today youre probably here from reddit so i feel like that was fair hi if youre new to the site i have a deal for you you sign up for the wait but why email list and i in turn promise to be incredibly unannoying about it lol fuck off will ya
dataisbeautiful,removed,black holes are normally created by a stellar collapse and i dont think the merging of galaxies will result in more stars being collapsed than usual however both the milky way and andromeda galaxies already have a super massive black hole at their centers one of the major events of this sequence will be the two spiraling into each other and merging weve before but this time it will happen in our proverbial front yard
dataisbeautiful,removed,cbcamclubcom my buddy fuck absolutly all holes here you should try too
dataisbeautiful,removed,and this is why i believe in god
dataisbeautiful,removed,my bro fucked kitties any here dont miss them

dataisbeautiful,removed,if someone gets offended by just reading a word on their screen specially in the context its used in this thread then its really not your problem
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah i just love the absolutely awful conclusions people have been drawing from this following some of them youd have to conclude that racism literally never existed because of so many black people that use nr
dataisbeautiful,removed,automod is an ass and removes any comment that spells it out see my previous comments before this comment

dataisbeautiful,removed,could you maybe get a video of what she enjoys for science
dataisbeautiful,removed,this study is going to do for misogynists what black on black crime statistics have done for racists ie reinforce their shitty worldviews and give them the illusion of justification for their shitty behavior
dataisbeautiful,removed,all the sluts just upvoted you
dataisbeautiful,removed,you mean nigerian
dataisbeautiful,removed,white people times black people times not really that big of a difference
dataisbeautiful,removed,but he might still be a midget
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,if the contextual analysis the researchers carried out is decent then endearing uses of the words would not be counted so the comparison youre drawing doesnt make any sense
dataisbeautiful,removed,there are certain decent sized populations online that have a narrative this report is at odds with
dataisbeautiful,removed,what numpty
dataisbeautiful,removed,most people arent
dataisbeautiful,removed,but thats only because the blacks havent stolen a phone recently so they can get online
dataisbeautiful,removed,yes but slut and whore are not terms of endearment between women context is very important
dataisbeautiful,removed,there are n words they tweet the one ending with a far more than the one ending with er i reckon
dataisbeautiful,removed,the northeast also searches it much more than the south
dataisbeautiful,removed,yes
dataisbeautiful,removed,he means naggers
dataisbeautiful,removed,i had a black bf and can confirm this sometimes hed just randomly say it just because he hadnt said it in a while
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,most women trade sex for securitygoodsshelteretc what does that make them
dataisbeautiful,removed,guys you can say the word nlgger here you are not going to get banned
dataisbeautiful,removed,how do they compare to asians from cali
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah but i doubt as many women use the words slut and whore as an attempt to reclaim the words
dataisbeautiful,removed,one of my biggest peeves ever you can cuss on the internet dude theres no profanity police here
dataisbeautiful,removed,actually black people tend to refer to it as the nword when talking to people of other races source me
dataisbeautiful,removed,as a nerd i find this derision by black people highly offensive
dataisbeautiful,removed,this was my first thought upon seeing this moronic headline glad to see im not alone
dataisbeautiful,removed,too bad its difficult to quantify context i wonder how often they are saying so and so called me a whore or we have to do something about this slut shaming
dataisbeautiful,removed,my friends and i call each other the n word all the time were mostly white i dont think ive ever used the word in a negative time in my life
dataisbeautiful,removed,you can say nіggeг on the internet its ok
dataisbeautiful,removed,chillin with my nwords say it like a white kid
dataisbeautiful,removed,they controlled for nonaggressive uses of the terms httpwwwdemoscoukpressreleasestaggeringscaleofsocialmediamisogynymappedinnewdemosstudy its pretty standard in such analysis to control for this kind of thing if you want to get credible data to fail to do this would be like writing code to analyse customer feedback assuming its positive if you find the word good of course thisd give you false positives if you fail to consider context of the words or phrases eg this product is no good
dataisbeautiful,removed,that pisses me off so much everyone knows he meant cunt everyone heard it in their head no one was offended for fucks sake he wasnt even cunt to swear at someone
dataisbeautiful,removed,twisted comparison slut and whore are considered insults if they are said by both men and women in most social situations the nword is considered racist if said by a nonblack person but not if its said by a black person
dataisbeautiful,removed,and that has caused a ton of animosity dont tell other people not to use words and then turn around and use them yourself one its trolling two it will make them hate you and resent you three it leaves the impression that the law exists to serve you and not them allowing white supremacist thought to spread with no logical opposition available what can you honestly say to a poor white man who points out protections poor black people get but that he doesnt you can make an argument but it wont have logic in it and lets be honest here a lot of people are sick and tired of modern women acting like the most oppressed people to ever walk the face of the earth cunt is not the nword and never fucking will be
dataisbeautiful,removed,when will white men end this blatant racism
dataisbeautiful,removed,when will white men end this blatant racism
dataisbeautiful,removed,that would be slut and whore i guess
dataisbeautiful,removed,words anchor babies
dataisbeautiful,removed,i wonder if i can find a study that contradicts something i dont agree with
dataisbeautiful,removed,also another study has found there are studies that support anything you want to be true
dataisbeautiful,removed,men are bad and women are good yet another study finds
dataisbeautiful,removed,oki haha warmer no thats retarded
dataisbeautiful,removed,sounds like an incredibly targeted and biased study meaning the data is useless congratulations whoever wasted hours of their life on this
dataisbeautiful,removed,guys we found the shemale
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,hi umungoflago can you please explain why you think this is not a data visualization automatically generatable this is drawn by based on nonvisual data this is based on text data the transcripts from the talk run through some text analysis based on real or simulated data this is based on real data the transcripts from the talks a mapping of information to a visual property several data variables are encoded into visual properties here the top terms are placed with their x position as the average of the timestamps when the term occurs the y loosely as the tfidf score the tfidf score is redundantly encoded as the colouring on the boxes hover behaviour visually encodes the places in the talk where the terms occurred both with circle glyphs on a timeline and by fading out thumbnails from sections of the talk where the terms did not occur made with the intent to communicate data the intent is to communicate the main topics of the talks and to provide an interface to jump to those topics the user gets to see which terms are ranked higher or lower than others and gets a summary of what might be discussed in any given talk

dataisbeautiful,removed,people who voted for trump are either behind his bigotry or they are okay with it there is no effective difference between the two apathy is just as dangerous as active hatred yes actually if hillary had said something so blatantly abusive had run on a platform of racism sexism islamaphobia classism ableism and basically further disenfranchisement for anyone who isnt a white christian straight cisgender male yes id feel exactly the same way about her and anyone who voted for her and probably be looking for a bridge to jump off if both of our candidates were so uniformly awful because it doesnt matter who does it its equally as crappy its not about championing a particular issue its about not championing the administration who literally wants to institute policies that will kill people it hit me so hard because no matter how much i gave dire warnings to the people who handwaved trumps chances away i never truly expected him to win i never ever in my heart of hearts believed that so many people in my country believed in his racist sexist ableist vile rhetoric the us is much more racist and backward than we ever thought
dataisbeautiful,removed,saying im not racist but i voted for trump is a lot like saying im vegetarian but i ordered the steak trump won because of his appeals to racism and sexism and his vicious misogynistic lies about hillary clinton he won because a large percentage of the country is hateful and does not share progressive values you cant persuade them because theyre racists and racism is an irrational feeling instead you fight them by mocking them and trying to turn out your own base we give up on any attempt to actually appeal to trump voters concerns and interests since racism is not an interest worth appealing to who could support people who voluntarily vote for the kkks preferred candidate they laughed at the nazis in the man with the funny moustache and his gang of silly brownshirted thugs they werent laughing so much in things could be the same when it comes to the man with the funny hair and the orange face hah hah hah oh shit we know donald trump is a man without a conscience yet we have just handed him near absolute power in part enabled by the joint democraticrepublican expansion of executive branch authority over the years for all we know there could be death camps on the horizon trump inspires people by appealing to their nastiest most inhuman and unneighborly instincts this is why he won

dataisbeautiful,removed,actually you gave two sets of instructions one in the title and one in the survey this survey is flawed at best nice clickbait title though

dataisbeautiful,removed,its a shame you couldnt have access to actual data because youve included almost the entire population of the planet by posting this article and its wrong more and more people are leaving religion for a more sane pursuit of science so a fluff bit of writing like this with an agenda is meaningless unless you can actually include the people that claim a religion but in fact have no belief in any supreme being this data is flawed unless tested and i urge you to do your own work on this so you wont be posting garbage in the future
dataisbeautiful,removed,a population of in is almost the entire population of the planet in that year none of this data includes the massive number of atheists and nonobserving persons that get counted into these numbers am i a scientologist because i read a couple books no i go to a church occasionally because i like the music or i attend mosque because i like the service but that doesnt make me a christian or a muslim im only there for the show i dont know a single person in my circle of friends that attends a service regularly and im pretty sure most of them arent stupid enough to believe in any gods or prophets church is more for social networking within a community than it is for worship of a deity i may have been baptized in the anglican church as a baby but dont think for a minute that i would identify myself as someone that believes in an imaginary sky being that created the world man created gods because of a lack of understanding the world around them god or gods did not create man and you would be foolish to think otherwise

dataisbeautiful,removed,this chart is bullshit we have no idea to what extent the earth is warming there are major battles in the scientific community about the basic question of what level of climate change is occurring even the shift from global warming to climate change betrays that uncertainty for example the economist reported in between and the earths surface temperature rose at a rate of °c a decade far slower than the °c increase in the it also forced global warming advocates to claim that the oceans somehow ate up all of the excess heat in the air all of that led people like obama to claim to the world in paris that of the past years have been the hottest on record but when scientists said that was the hottest year on record and none of this takes into account purposeful data fabrication like this comic does in order to achieve

dataisbeautiful,removed,and none of this could possibly be due to the accuracy of temperature measurement equipment or placement of said equipment in the past as opposed to now but nah im sure the opiumaddicted people taking measurements from handmade mercury thermometers in the early were absolutely spot on deadaccurate why does everyone so desperately want to believe that a trace atmospheric molecule that exists as less than parts per million has that great of an effect on the entire planet we will die from overpopulation and resource depletion long before does anything mentionable to cause problems people need to stop shitting out kids and back off the world population by a few billion thats the real answer to any and all environmental and sustainability issues
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah because people traveled back in time to take accurate worldwide temperature measurements from the last million years s its downright shameful for anyone to claim they know the average worldwide temperature further back than maybe the last years to an accuracy close enough to matter or draw conclusions from is fucking plant food im not sure why people are going apeshit when ppm plant food is in the atmosphere
dataisbeautiful,removed,except b roll footage of glaciers melting is not proof of global warming try digging into the scientific proof of global warming anytime you get near a real data set its always mysteriously unavailable in an uncorrected unmodified form weve only had accurate temperature instrumentation and enough global dispersion of said equipment for the last years at best and maybe not even then all proof of global warming draws a line of best fit through the data points that support their hypothesis the real chart looks like signal noise on an oscilloscope its a plausible but ultimately unproven hypothesis perpetuated by people that would end their career if they admitted there wasnt much substance to it

dataisbeautiful,removed,this is cute are you stop eating meat or severely limit animal consumption this is huge look at the stats so die of malnutrition glad we saved the planet so we could starve to death or at least suffer nutritional deficiencies as most vegans do move closer to work great idea let me just buy one of those multimillion dollar housescondostownhomes right by my office why didnt i think of that buy local to limit overseas shipping yeah because fuck efficient assembly lines lets be way less efficient by doing everything locally also fuck things that cant grow in your climate and fuck everyone in a cold hot or otherwise unpalatable climate use public transportation because thats available and convenient everywhere even if it was do you know how inefficient it is to run an lb subway car with people on it during off times for comparison a honda civic is about lbs and probably closer to this is all forgetting if you need to carry something big or heavy or cant wait a fucking hour to get somewhere get a fuel efficient car or an electric one most cars are fuel efficient and most people want that just to save money electric cars are mostly coal powered at this point so it doesnt do anything to help until we make the switch to nuclear or some other source with the capability of replacing coal also it takes a ton of energy to ship the materials around the world to make the batteries so battery tech would need to come a long way for them to make a positive difference vote out climate change deniers yeah because fuck questioning an unsubstantiated hypothesis that claims we knew the exact aggregate temperature of the planet years ago down to the degree people used to take opium and cocaine as medicine less than years ago and we just figured out that bread and other carbs are actually bad for you most scientists are fucking useless idiots just trying to stay employed by lying about evidence to support their claims i never believed it until i witnessed it first hand write your representatives to eliminate oil and farm subsidies yeah lets let overseas control all of our oil and farming that will end great write your representatives to support nuclear energy well youve got one right congratulations
dataisbeautiful,removed,they arent refusing to acknowledge the idea of science theyre refusing to accept that youve proven your hypothesis there is no bigger group of people that dont believe in anthropogenic climate change than engineers which is certifiably the most difficult college degree to get and arguably the most rigorous in tangible science not dicking around with hypothetical quantum dimensions and other shit on the other hand the loudest claimants of global warming are liberal arts majors that had to retake entry level science courses times

dataisbeautiful,removed,there is one solution people stop shitting out kids and cut the world population down to about of what it is any pollutionrelated issue in the world can easily be mitigated by a conscious reduction in population but everyone is super egotistical and thinks they need kids running around
dataisbeautiful,removed,i say this all the time and everyone ignores it or makes a hokey claim about theyre scientists they know what do its atrocious that we will take speculation about years ago as fact hell i dont trust temperature readings from even years ago do you really think some crappy mercury thermometer was accurate to degree and never had any parallax error in reading its ludicrous
dataisbeautiful,removed,this all rides on the assumption that the estimated temperatures from thousands and millions of years ago are accurate to degrees i cant believe youll accept a hypothesis based on sediment composition to positively identify temperatures as a global aggregate i just cant even right now years ago people were chugging opium and cocaine as medicine we only figured out bread was bad for us like years ago do you really trust some old mercury thermometer to be both deadonballs accurate and to be correctly read each time with no parallax error and that the positions of said thermometers dont have localized factors skewing measurements like additions of concrete or reflections off of buildings which will increase local temperatures but are not indicative of global climate change and other things also is it not interesting that in the they were sure we were on the path to global cooling this whole thing is a manipulation tactic to exploit minor up or down cycles in temperature to push agendas and policy changes that otherwise wouldnt gain support its a political move nothing more youll live to see im right

dataisbeautiful,removed,thats like saying we shouldnt trust the cars we drive in because of speculation on how metals react under stress there is more speculation than you realize that goes into the engineering of cars the difference is that engineers are better scientists than climatologists i dont give a shit what you think of a scraping from an ancient ice glacier it does not prove temperature to the degree of accuracy claimed and to even insist so is infuriatingly dishonest on their part
dataisbeautiful,removed,really wooooow you are aware humans breath oxygen while plants breath right being green means doing things that are good for plants putting more in the atmosphere is good for plants time for you to learn what httpsenwikipediaorgwikiphotosynthesis is jesus fuck youre retarded

dataisbeautiful,removed,there is simply no way that a ppm trace chemical has that much influence on overall surface temperature im sorry the fact that this horseshit bogus theory is allowed to be presented as fact is an insult to science as a whole by comparison venus a place that does have significant greenhouse warming from has a concentration of compare that to earths and try to explain to me again why you are not a complete moron im not denying that can have a greenhouse effect in high concentrations but we are not have not ever been and are not in danger of coming anywhere near high concentrations if concentration of is enough to substantially make a difference compared to the it was allegedly before human activity it is by far the most potent greenhouse trace chemical ever conceived

dataisbeautiful,removed,did anyone else know that woolly fucking rhino walked the earth

dataisbeautiful,removed,vegans as a population are not malnourished that is a myth many people actually become vegan or severely limit their animal product consumption because of doctors orders every vegan i have ever known has gained weight from an increase in carbs due to a limit of available nonmeat options or lost weight considerably and if doctors made any assertion it was for them to continue eating meat before problems started to manifest you dont need to get a million dollar house downtown to move closer to work you can move out of your bubble into a bad neighborhood where people will leave you alone if you dont bother them just like where you are now only theyre not all white oh fuck you in every way possible thanks for that wonderful implied racism how do you know im not black and live in one of those bad neighborhoods for the record many people do that and then people bitch that theyre pricing the poor people out of the neighborhood also its cute that youre so naive to think that the people that will steal anything not chained down will leave you alone you must not have grown up near these places i have and i know what goes on not everything can be made locally but many things can shipping vessels use insane amounts of fossil fuels and its usually the least refined most polluting type the option isnt always available but it should be a purchasing factor when it is very little can be sourced locally without insane markup that most people simply couldnt afford to even insist on this one just shows youre obliviously elitest and sheltered public transportation is more efficient there are are studies on this again youre speaking without studying flawed studies by people not factoring in offhours inefficiencies it may be more efficient at moving people at rush hour or minimizing space taken up by transportation but they are not more energy efficient holistically and they are horrendously inconvenient if youve ever had to live with them electric cars have the possibility of not needing fossil fuels to run non electric vehicles dont and batteries come from pixie dust and turn into magic powder when they dont work anymore right climate change is not an unsubstantiated hypothesis calling it one makes you sound like an idiot to anyone who is cursorily familiar with the science just come out and say you think the earth is flat the sun revolves around it black people are another species and dinosaurs walked around with humans white people years ago when the universe was brand new youll sound about as educated as you do right now on that point again with the racial accusations is it fun in your liberal arts college have you taken the course on love and happiness yet where you sit in a circle and talk about love and happiness climate change is an unsubstantiated hokey hypothesis and im sorry youre too naive to understand why eliminating subsidies changes our spending habits it doesnt allow other countries to control our interests um yes it does people buy from where its cheapest if we dont subsidize local production people will buy more from overseas with makes us royally fucked if we get an embargo placed on us or a war breaks out you are naive to think the us wouldnt get fucked sideways by a number of countries if they thought they stood a chance

dataisbeautiful,removed,wheres the sources that prove the temperature is that accurate you cant possibly prove it global warming was deliberately chosen because the scope is so large its far too difficult to ever directly determine how true it is or not you can perpetually skew data either way by cherry picking data but enough people are gullible enough to believe whatever they are told and thats where the government gets to do whatever the fuck they want in the name of corrupt money laundering global warming prevention
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats preposterous so what happens at ppm the earth drops to c if ppm of is enough to increase the worldwide temperature of earth c that is the most potent fucking trace molecule in the universe im sorry but just no the in our atmosphere is like a spec of sand in a glass of water have you ever heard the phrase correlation does not imply causation i bet i could find a similar correlation in global warming to the number of democrats in texas or some other ridiculous quantity it doesnt make it true or proven

dataisbeautiful,removed,because ionizing radiation effects on a human body are exactly the same thing as solar reflectivity in an atmosphere eye roll what the fuck is even the source for that horseshit graph once again its very poorly defined shows no source for data doesnt explain where such measurements were taken or the experimental conditions for a hypothetical correlative equivalent to atmosphere yes is a greenhouse gas we know this but we also know its an astronomically minimal part of the atmosphere there is an amount of everything that is below a threshold of mattering there is even an amount of polonium i could feed you and youd be fine this is all ignoring how ppm concentration is even measured to prove the ppm then vs now are even true and accurate which i never seem to get a clear answer about
dataisbeautiful,removed,who said anything about no atmosphere if went away completely theres still the of everything else that comprises our atmosphere again a grain of sand in a glass of water and a grain of sand essential for plant life no less
dataisbeautiful,removed,once again the negligible amount of in the atmosphere is not proven to be enough to significantly effect climate even if fossil fuels are responsible for the increase the question is whether the extra is responsible for temperature changes or if true climate change is happening at all remember in the they were certain global cooling was going to be the problem its all a ruse to sell a bunch of government policies that conveniently get contracted out to the friends of politicians looking at carbon isotopes doesnt prove anything jesus christ do you think just because you use a sciency word like isotopes that it makes you irrefutably correct

dataisbeautiful,removed,it was about censoring things they didnt like you stupid fuck

dataisbeautiful,removed,there are no doubt some ridiculous theories regarding srs but there is also years of evidence to show that srs is a harassmentbullying sub the fact that there is ridiculous theories shouldnt turn you away from the truth of the horrible nature of the sub and i will again remark that that is against reddit rules my only real problem with the fph ban is that subs that engage in the same behavior like srs didnt get banned as well again theres no arguing this you can say its absurd but there are years of srs activity that demonstrate srs should have been banned for the same reasons that fph was banned

dataisbeautiful,removed,at this point which americans do not find themselves sympathetic toward at least one of the myriad of sociopolitical groups the splc labels hate groups the splc has taken a once powerful term hate and so watered it down that it is now a less meaningful increasingly impotent term for organizations with nonliberal agendas it begs the question what do we now those groups which really do promote genuine hate what nomenclature can we now draw upon to differentiate those who oppose extending the sacrament of marriage to nonheterosexual couples from those who say that those practicing the homosexual lifestyle ought to be executed how can we now distinguish those who disapprove of affirmative action from those who leave flaming crosses in citizens front yards the splc has watered down a once powerful word to the detriment of a language

dataisbeautiful,removed,i can already tell this is fake and here isuzu reasoning a person that waste this much time plotting out his reddit interest is guaranteed to spend a cast majority of his time on all nsfw subreddits in conclusion the lack of rnsfwgifs and rporninaminute solidifies my original statement that this data is flawed and manipulated
dataisbeautiful,removed,the day is saved

dataisbeautiful,removed,also congrats on successfully arguing your case against cock sniffing zit poppers mods love to drop the ban hammer and then double down on the fascism when called out
dataisbeautiful,removed,its a good illustration of one of the deep fundamental flaws of reddits structure and super thin and apathetic administration kooky mods can kill significant users out of pettiness and that destruction can kill the users contribution across other areas the whole community loses because of the pettiness and preselection and imbalanced structure
dataisbeautiful,removed,pretty sure you should scroll up and read what you said because im pretty sure its easy to tell youre full of shit

dataisbeautiful,removed,so perfectly true
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah im going to choose a color coding scheme that arbitrarily breaks off at exactly the united states while im at it rather then have my color coding scheme continue down the spectrum im going to make it bright yellow so it really sticks out this is definitely not a thinly veiled attempt at provoking a political discussion no this just beautiful data what a beautiful map you made op truly amazing
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats because men get things done women just talk complain and manipulate people in a cry for attention but theres more funding towards helping women out because theyre essentially children
dataisbeautiful,removed,most women are valued by the genetic lottery gods what they look like so are men unattractive men tend to have trouble getting laid too ill never understand why people like you can never just sit back and say yep both genders face problems that the other doesnt appreciate or comprehend stop turning it into a competition and actually try to contribute to something positive you may be physically attractive but your personality is ugly as sin
dataisbeautiful,removed,actually yes she is maybe not sexually but if she were killed people would consider that a greater tragedy ive seen people lament that women are of homeless and suicides clearly a minority but they claim this proves we need to do more to help women and they arent all attractive youll see headlines like killed in a fire including woman they dont specify hot woman no pun intended
dataisbeautiful,removed,shitty color bar is it linear or log we have no way of saying this data is confusing misleading and ugly
dataisbeautiful,removed,i once punched my laptop and this was exactly what the resulting scar i left on it looked like
dataisbeautiful,removed,is there one for lake tahoe
dataisbeautiful,removed,most women are valued by the genetic lottery gods what they look like exactly they are valued by what they are if she is unattractive she has less value than an attractive woman pretty much regardless of her other accomplishments there are of course a few exceptions to this rule but its true by and large
dataisbeautiful,removed,europe was considered the backwater of the world for centuries until colonialism in the and its not until the industrial revolution in the that europe actually become richermore powerful then say the mughals ottomans and ming
dataisbeautiful,removed,doings are lottery too dont you think what you achieve in life is purely a function of where and to whom you were born this has been studied to death at least women have a decent chance out of poverty if they have good looks

dataisbeautiful,removed,where are you from then hotshot if you dont know shit about the medical field then shut the fuck up
dataisbeautiful,removed,mine was pretty much every time i tested it in december last year i had a bmi of around and was doing roughly hours of low intensity cardio every day keeping my heart rate around and no other exercise right now i have a similar bmi and im sedentary and skinnyfat but its still mostly in the early
dataisbeautiful,removed,its really interesting if you look into the studies that have been done on how peoples heart rates can rise due to mental stress i think there were several done on people giving presentations and if iirc a lot of the people in those studies went a lot lot higher than also there was a really interesting one done on musicians giving performances that one of them a pianist actually exceeded their maximum predicted maximum heart rate i cba to dig for more but here is that study i myself had a heart rate of bpm once in a hospital at rest just from anxiety even though my predicted maximum at the time minus age was only i got really worried about it until i started reading lots about the topic i remember there was a study on racecar drivers before a race that showed they were at like before the race even started one on a teenage girl in the audience of a pop concert where her rate went to something like just a whole bunch of interesting ones

dataisbeautiful,removed,you really dont think there are community organizations working towards ending the gig crime rates within these communities could it be that news media and reddit is not interested in hearing these stories
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah if only your parents and grandparents werent a bunch of worthless immoral sacks of shit that sat on their fucking ass while the government systematically took action to impoverish blacks all across this country we might not be here but lucky for any chance of a shred of human decency coming to america we have people like you who are so incredibly worthless you just decide to blame blacks for the effects of systematic racism that you seem too fucking moronic to comprehend shit wouldnt it be funny if someone shot you in your fucking spine and then blamed you for being unable to walk
dataisbeautiful,removed,the rate of occurrence of unarmed black people being killed by police is much greater than of unarmed white people
dataisbeautiful,removed,well we could always turn to the soylent majority then no class would be starving
dataisbeautiful,removed,in unarmed people are killed by the police doesnt really deserve the qualifier only thats sort of ludicrous rate anyway its spun

dataisbeautiful,removed,no one on reddit cares about black people killing other black people except when they can use it to distract from the message of blacklivesmatter thats why the movement exists it can get support from people as being against police brutality which a more substantial portion of the population can relate to than black on black violence which most people dont give half a shit about because it doesnt affect them
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah because thats the purpose of blm police brutality against poor black people thats like criticizing peta for not caring about food safety protocol

dataisbeautiful,removed,just curious have you ever lived or worked in an area with high crime there are tons of people who work around the clock on literally every conceivable aspect just to reduce violence from within these communities blm as a movement has a focus on police accountability and criticizing them for what is really the fault of selective media coverage is kind of an insult to all of the people that have been working on the issue for decades many of whom also support blm theyre not mutually exclusive plus its not a bad thing that blm can focus on one issue isnt the biggest criticism of occupy wallstreet that it had like separate messages all overlapping without a clear vision
dataisbeautiful,removed,can you still text use a gaming controller
dataisbeautiful,removed,i will never get this comment why arent the people at this oncology conference talking about diabetes dont they know that kills waaaaay more people
dataisbeautiful,removed,most pedophiles and rapists are white still waiting on the campaigns for white people to stop raping children meanwhile there are so many organizations specifically created to target inner city violence this is a list just for chicago alone
dataisbeautiful,removed,about because its black men mostly
dataisbeautiful,removed,agreed im talking income potentialwise
dataisbeautiful,removed,have they adjusted for population a cursory look indicates there are more than as many whites as negros in usa
dataisbeautiful,removed,is this a socialpublic health concern it is only a socialpublic health concern if it disadvantages women please remember if you do scientific research into the differences between men and women you must portray whatever you find to be true of women as superior and when you read reports about scientific research into the differences between men and women use the hypothesis that the scientists are following that rule it makes reading the reports quite humorous
dataisbeautiful,removed,the hundreds of blacks that are murdered each month by other blacks goes largely unmentioned as well as all the whites that are killed by police unarmed and armed what innercity violence and getting black youth out of gangs is talking point number one for almost every africanamerican urban community its what almost every community initiative is intended to prevent blm is about the prejudices inherent in the system not just within the police force black people who are unarmed are times more likely to be killed by the police than white people black people are consistently discriminated against in housing education and the workplace theres this little thing called racism weve never totally addressed in our country and the legacy of slavery and jim crow that was also never really fixed oh my apologies sir i see you are white and oppressed and as such do not have access to information telling you what all these uppity blacks are in a furor about please go on about your day avoiding the oppression that smothers your people
dataisbeautiful,removed,im doing nothing here you are as ignorant as any white supremacist they suggest that they are superior you suggest that black people are victims cops are people they are usually more educated than the average american the country is big and the media specifically takes odd cases that support the case that cops are some evil force out to get groups in reality it may be percent those percent of actual bad cops cant account for a percent difference in crime rates the reason for higher crime rates poverty being higher in black populations but ignore me for saying this as in your view it does not fit despite the correlation being true just right me off as a biggot to fit your ignorant views parents being poor kids being poor more crime more cop encounters more deaths lets attack the cops and call everyone racist instead of addressing the root problem that will fix things
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah for indiana its definitely tom crean iu is a basketball haven though hoo hoo hoosiers

dataisbeautiful,removed,no wonder everyone wants a football scholarship fuck that im starting my own university where you require is a high school diploma successful completion of our standardized test and required college credits optional must have sat score or you are not allowed in oh wait a minute
dataisbeautiful,removed,a day after kirk ferentz gets a raise this is on the front page iowas highest paid male state employee is a football coach and the female state employee is a basketball coach
dataisbeautiful,removed,at the ohio state university our coach urban meyer leads our football program to do incredibly well the football program actually funds most of the other sports with its revenue
dataisbeautiful,removed,it is the opportunity cost associated with coaching college in most cases the coaches can be paid a lot if they went pro the same cant be said for a physics professor or beuracrat
dataisbeautiful,removed,such a bullshit economic system the world has where entertaiment is paid more than profession like doctors i hate this world capitalis is utter fucking bullshit

dataisbeautiful,removed,every muslim wants to kill infidels they are all terrorists in their hearts
dataisbeautiful,removed,jesus christ someone make a graph of the ignorance in this sub im unsubscribing i hope you all get to fight in the global war youre itching for
dataisbeautiful,removed,and as per sharia law itself it would literally be a violation of sharia law to impose sharia law on nonmuslims thats not actually true though not really sure where you got that
dataisbeautiful,removed,terrorism isnt the main reason we should ban muslim immigration we should be ban it because we should only allow whites to immigrate and most muslims arent white
dataisbeautiful,removed,will do as soon as your moms stitches heal from last night
dataisbeautiful,removed,yet you still group all cops into a single group of people who want to kill all blacks
dataisbeautiful,removed,funny how people bring up statistics to justify profiling of african americans they commit of the crimes they say yet show them data like this and how the vast majority of muslims are not committing terrorist acts and they cry well thats misleading
dataisbeautiful,removed,a terrorist throws a gay man off a building a muslim says he deserved it this data is incredibly naive
dataisbeautiful,removed,its time to show a chart of religious belief in every terrorist attacks in recent history
dataisbeautiful,removed,it doesnt matter how big they are really just that they suck and continue to suck kill them all
dataisbeautiful,removed,fuck you dont tell me what to do i get that enough from my girlfriend
dataisbeautiful,removed,its like self sabotage is ingrained in idiots like you i dont understand this mindset
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,now do a circle graph puting into perspective human vs ebola virus
dataisbeautiful,removed,that wont happen s youll probably have to just finish jerking off while fantasizing about it
dataisbeautiful,removed,given that youre sitting there agitating for a war to kill all the muslims thats some hypocrisy youre wearing
dataisbeautiful,removed,one excellent response is to reinforce that should this turn out to be a terrorist attack the individual does not represent all muslims what a disgusting comment i hate you op should this turn out to be a terrorist attack you knew it was and we all knew it was instantly verified within minutes and yet you feel the need to hint that it could be anything else fuck you the individual does not represent all muslims innocent people lost their lives and your immediate thought it is defend yourself instead of mourn the loss of those who had their lives take due to your shitty religion shame on you you disgusting piece of shit
dataisbeautiful,removed,plot twist the red circle is also bad
dataisbeautiful,removed,seriously you might be autistic
dataisbeautiful,removed,im sure this is a massive comfort to the parents who lost their children
dataisbeautiful,removed,the one thing these crazy muslims are doing is making the israelis look like relatively calm rational people who have known about this sort of thing for ages
dataisbeautiful,removed,i thought this was data is beautiful this is a shitty what to show data
dataisbeautiful,removed,you are exactly the type of people who would go and join isis go ahead let them bomb you as well just like the rest of your fictional bombingwithoutareason you wrote about
dataisbeautiful,removed,not all muslims are terrorists because they havent read enough of their terror book
dataisbeautiful,removed,httpredditprivcheckcom
dataisbeautiful,removed,oh so the religion of peace had only produced thousand terrorists thats way better than i thought before how about a circle showing how many support sharia and suicide bombings
dataisbeautiful,removed,yea fuck you op right in your pee hole

dataisbeautiful,removed,so what type of autism do you have
dataisbeautiful,removed,now do george soros
dataisbeautiful,removed,this is just disgusting literally buying her way in
dataisbeautiful,removed,curious as to what bombshell comment got over upvotes before being removed
dataisbeautiful,removed,its ok everyone the swamp is being drained with this pick
dataisbeautiful,removed,great her choice right
dataisbeautiful,removed,it makes sense in and seems simple in concept but things often get complicated in process for instance youd have to prevent proxy donors and itd be difficult to enforce that more specifically someone out of state could gift money to an in state individual and im sure there are ways to anonymize and hide such a thing and then that in state individual will donate as well theres the obvious issue of citizens united and without repealing that the change you propose would not be effective in stopping much im not implying we shouldnt try to rain in corrupt campaign financing but its hardly as simple as what you proposed
dataisbeautiful,removed,this guy gets it
dataisbeautiful,removed,please dont say todd young oh fuck
dataisbeautiful,removed,if its even a little anti trump the mods will let it fly no matter what sub its getting old
dataisbeautiful,removed,lol you are a special kind of stupid you do realize politicians utter hundreds of thousands of statements that are recorded and thus can be verified as true or false would i be biased if i ran a fact checker website that exclusively evaluated false statements made by hillary ofc not because guess what — hilary is a liar over of the time she lies from above almost all of the charitable work from the clinton foundation goes to the clinton global initiative of the clinton global initiative which the clintons personally benefit from if you are retarded enough to think that this payment had no strings attached then youre a sucker go jump on a treadmill fatty

dataisbeautiful,removed,not this system my friend the us is specifically designed with a formal constitution to allow for minority viewpoints and the integration of opposing philosophies the difference i see as a relatively revolutionary person would support ubi want the abolition of the death penalty know the crim justice system is racist etc etc is that conservatives generally are honest about their prejudices and motives in the country rich people want to accumulate wealth and pass it down therefore they support tax cuts for the wealthy and the elimination of the estate tax thats just one example now you may not like that but the repubs openly state their intentions and advocate them not the democrats fucking liars have now suppressed free speech to the point where anyone who says anything against their system is branded a racist or an idiot sjw has gotten out of control sequestered lying affirmative action programs and a huge number of other stupid nonsense which has snowballed in a giant ball of dung crushing us all for example i dont support the tactics of gamergate but by jove i certainly support their anger thats what you get for telling everyone what to think and say for decades and decades that and trump too bad even if trump is not elected i want the liberal narrative in this country burnt to the fucking ground it will be too just how will that happen

dataisbeautiful,removed,part of the reason standards are higher is partly because of evolution men used to be considered the ones who picked a bride therefore a female would have to try and make herself as appealing as possible to compete this encouraged the use of makeup and subsequently became the overwriting social norm one could also postulate as to whether the increasing use of makeup has had a detrimental effect on natural beauty you could certainly argue it has an effect by comparison but i wonder if the continuous use of makeup has negatively affected the natural beauty of a female

dataisbeautiful,removed,rolles eyes as soon as i read the title i knew the antipie chart circle jerk would be around a piedoughnut chart makes perfect sense in this case since we are comparing the sizes of partitions of the data to the whole total number of posts and the data is partitioned into relatively few slices only in this case this chart even has the fringe case where pie charts can be more useful than bar charts the usual alternative is the stacked bar chart where we may want to compare sums of slices to the whole the chart makes it easy to see that all image posts are about half of all posts or that all multiple chart posts make up more than half if all posts or that single chart posts are usually images with little to no text while multiple chart posts are usually articles and that the combination of these two absolutely dominates the total posts made to this sub also op avoided most of the common pitfalls for pie charts the slices are labeled directly rather than with a legend so the viewer can easily identify what each slice is second the size of each slice is explicitly stated so the viewer cannot get confused as to which of two similarlysized slices are bigger the pie chart explicitly says which is bigger

dataisbeautiful,removed,you might be right for some reason i thought of upvote ratio as an average score but as you said it depends on the voting patterns of people at the raskscience i would assume that people use their voting privileges more than average subreddits i looked at some recent math posts with low upvote ratio and it seems to me that they are not upvoted because general public is not interested and they could be downvoted for similar reasons because the question is bad because they seem like homework questions or may be just tired math grad stumbled upon it and did not like that the person used some term incorrectly here are the posts that i looked at the disproportionate number of comments to the upvotes seem to be exactly because of additional questions and confusionsie the question is not stated correctly by laymen also the main reason why i think that conclusion that mathematics seems to be the most controversial subject does not really makes sense because of the nature of the subject everything in maths is provable to be true and every question can be answered with absolute certaintyunless someone is asking about the solution to some unsolved problem or talking about something new and very complex but no one really asks such questions and no one at least none of the experts is really arguing over the answers in these posts

dataisbeautiful,removed,modern economics is concerned with industrial civilization why the httpsenwikipediaorgwikirobinsoncrusoeeconomy is probably the first model every modern economist learned during their training the key concepts in modern economics eg comparative advantage marginalism etc are applicable to any situation where you have finite resources
dataisbeautiful,removed,like he said higher productivity doesnt mean higher production if you dont need more than one shirt youre still betteroff now because you can make that single shirt with less resources the concept youre getting to here is that of efficiency producing more shirts could be better but not necessarily the best use of those resources but higher productivity helps precisely with that freeing even more resources to be put into other goods

dataisbeautiful,removed,this number while nice and simple is actually far more complex than this image leads on an ev itself is not a standard measurement as population density per ev is dictated by the size of the house of representatives plus two senators this would cause a large gain in efficiency for trump as a lot of his evs came in states where an ev is worth more per person small rural states therefore youd need to track which markets the money was spent to correlate the money spent directly back to each evs and then relate that back to the relative value of each of the evs to get a better understanding of the true dollar value i wish i had time to do this today if anyone wants to take on the project have fun

dataisbeautiful,removed,we have been betrayed the earth no longer belongs to those who fight to do the best they can for everyone and themselves it now belong purely and squarely to the load popularist mean spirited people who lie trick and confuse everyone around them to get what they want i may not be an american i am in fact irish but trumps victory has further reaching effects than many who voted for him have considered in the end we voted for both almost equally forcing them to work together to govern the country and represent the people in the end we decided to vote for the lesser of all evils and the people we thought would be effective at running the country and rather than taking their word for what they would do we wanted something in between we voted with our hearts and minds trump may make you feel rebellious and safe but he has no experience at governing a country and will act how he feels or do what the loudest of you say we faced a similar decision in our previous general election where we voted to either maintain our current government or reinstate the previous government that accelerated our recession the world is disappointed in the american people but shamefully not surprised most in america considered hillary clinton to be the lesser of two evils why vote for the worse of two evils it confuses me trump represents the resurgent problems we are facing on this planet these being distrust between communities and races misrepresentation of core ideals and the worst of these a rise in humanitarian apathy and decline of empathy for your fellow man this problem is far from selfcontained in the us the recent brexit vote and reluctance to solve immigration crisis in europe proves that the truth is as we as an international community slowly come back from the chaos of the global recession we are struggling to feel empathetic towards others and instead are quickly becoming more selfinterested and selfish we see recovery as an entitlement that many dont deserve and are interested in ourselves first and damn everyone else the incoming president will be relaxed on russia allowing them to reclaim territory as they see fit and consolidating the power they hold in the middle east under a relaxed approach to russia we could see a campaign of appeasement from the us if russia decides to reclaim any old territory whose separation was hard fought for by the people of these countries while under an oppressive russian regime putin is interested in seeing a soft america so they can do as they please while they may cooperate in defeating an organised isis army they cannot prevent the radical ideology of isis from spreading in america or any other country for this matter the only tools effective at this are education cooperation and tolerance of the muslim community a very clear message has been sent to anyone who is part of or being convinced to join a radical organisation that they are not to be trusted and that they are not welcome these people are disenfranchised with feel threatened by and frightened of many americans and the american government for being a muslim another victory has been won for isis ideology today as they want a more divisive rhetoric from politicians worldwide to make the job of recruitment easier because the we push muslims away the closer they are to being convinced that they need to fight in order to live thrive and survive in a west that is becoming more and more hostile towards the islamic community while i am quite worried about what trump will do i just hope that the house of representatives and the senate will consider all trumps proposals long and hard and vote for what they believe not what is being screamed at them from the loudest of trumps supporters as this could lead to a disastrous consequences to deliver this in trumps style i believe trump is a con artist and bad man who fooled many people to vote for him he represents everything that is wrong in america and will make america hated again his campaign has spouted nothing but bile and fear and has taught america to hate again we want something different we want to make america love again love themselves love each other and love the world again make america love again

dataisbeautiful,removed,does this consider esports as a sport
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats because there is almost no racial diversity in sports and what little exists is shrinking i think we should petition congress to have mandatory affirmative action in sports we need to have sports teams represent the real america for example the yankees roster is absolutely lacking in women trans people gays bisexuals native americans muslims while there are some asians and white males they are a small minority most of the roster is blacks and hispanics this is not fair and does not represent the america i know how are we supposed to raise children in this country to want to play sports when there are no players that represent them

dataisbeautiful,removed,to flesh this out a little more here are some population percentages in the us white black other

dataisbeautiful,removed,no a true lack of belief makes the statement we dont believe in god at all untrue often atheists use the term agnostic only as a modifier eg agnostic atheist however agnosticism is actually a valid philosophical view on its own separate from atheism which makes no claims about the existence or nonexistence of god this is not to be confused with uncertainty for example if i were to ask you what color shirt im wearing you would simply not know you wouldnt believe one way or another because you do not have enough information to make a belief statement about the color of my shirt agnostics feel the same way about the god hypothesis the agnostic view is that there is not enough evidence for or against the existence of god to believe or not believe in god that is what true lack of belief means the same way you dont believe my shirt is white but you also dont believe it isnt theists look at the evidence for the god hypothesis and decide that god is probable to a certain degree maybe they believe strongly in god maybe they have their doubts but they still believe in god having doubts about the existence of god but still believing that god probably exists doesnt make one agnostic atheists look at the evidence for the god hypothesis and decide that god is probable to a certain degree maybe they believe strongly that there is no god strong atheist maybe they have their doubts but they still believe there are probably no gods having doubts about the existence of god while still being pretty sure god doesnt exist makes one a weak atheist or more colloquially an agnostic atheist to be agnostic one must doubt the existence and the nonexistence of god agnostics do not pretend conclusions are certain that are not demonstrated or demonstrable in science if you want to propose that something exists the burden of proof falls to you if you want to propose that something does not exist the burden again falls to you if someone wanted to claim that the existence of god is scientifically provable then a testable prediction based on the hypothesis that god exists would have to be formulated and then a tested to see if the prediction is fulfilled in the same way if someone wanted to claim that the nonexistence of god is scientifically provable then the same kind of testable prediction would have to be formulated and tested to see if the prediction is fulfilled either way the test would need to be welldesigned replicable etc etc for the matter to be considered scientifically proved therefore the burden of proof lies with both the theist and the atheist because both are making claims that are either verifiable or not when a theist asks can you show me proof that god doesnt exist it is a valid question but it is a question that often receives only a derisive response in return
dataisbeautiful,removed,korean here its very safe in here too according to unocd statistics homicide rate per habitant is compared to singapores honduras is problem is we kill ourselves people per commit suicide for the elderly its around when it comes to the act of intentional killing itself were worse than or im not sure which one is better to kill yourself eventually or get killed by someone well at least in korea you can choose when to kill yourself so maybe slightly better fuck

dataisbeautiful,removed,the things i describe below is all nationwide extreme workload unpaid overtime work unpaid weekend shift poor labor rights corporatefriendly laws no enough regular jobs only contractors and temp jobs job security is a joke the success of korean economy is built on the history of exploitation and sacrifice against the workers and currently few conglomerates called chaebol are ruling the entire korean economy which leads to social and economic oligopoly no trickle down no opportunities for new and innovative businesses go to number corrupt confucianism confucianism went seriously wrong it made a strongly suppressive patriarchal and authoritarian korean culture agebased hierarchy all kinds of useless and worthless ceremonies and traditions sexism machismo an unquestioned obedience strong nepotism go to number military culture mandatory military service system turned the entire country into a barrack strict hierarchy order and service you must follow what your superior said no criticism allowed do what i say all these shit go to number strong collectivistic culture high peer pressure makes you keep comparing yourself to the others no seat for personal happiness more chance of get bullied just because youre unique and not the same one go to number spoiled education youre in extreme competition for nothing in high school class starts at and ends at the name of voluntary study which is mandatory you end up in college wasting years for nothing because becoming an office worker at samsung is considered as success go to number poor mental health awareness mental illness youre a failure this stigma is overwhelming but no one talks about mental health while everyone is suffering from it anyway insurance company denies your subscription if you have a bad mental health record you said you had depression no job for you go to number poor social security thanks to massive scale of corruption all the taxes and social benefits are wasted or goes to someone who doesnt need it if you want more social welfare they will call you communist i have much more things to write but its so massive that i couldnt korea is a cultural cesspool young generation these days are looking for an exodus they are not expecting social and economic success they just want to avoid this shitty cultural pressure

dataisbeautiful,removed,webcrawler™ sends his regards
dataisbeautiful,removed,this is the dumbest thing ive seen on reddit what about hospitals schools roads fire police parks pretty much everything else needed to be a society might as well have a graphic showing mankind living in a story skyscraper on a plot of land and call it a day
dataisbeautiful,removed,most people spend their day workinglearning which requires another location you then need to lay out space for roads industry farming gardens maybe we should mix all these up and scatter them around the country in hubs and call them cities p
dataisbeautiful,removed,just give everyone on earth a mansion and we will figure out the rest on the go
dataisbeautiful,removed,every house is equipped with an ejector seat that launches you where you need to go
dataisbeautiful,removed,just think everybody would have to live in the us if trump would win the election we all would be behind a giant wall and all the animals would be able to watch us just like in a zoo
dataisbeautiful,removed,i dont wanna live in a shoebox though
dataisbeautiful,removed,vote for me as president and i guarantee you there will be mansions for everyone
dataisbeautiful,removed,those pictures that right there is my dream house
dataisbeautiful,removed,this is stupid
dataisbeautiful,removed,so are all the houses touching each other including the fronts and backs like one big glob of houses no yards roads sidewalks etc
dataisbeautiful,removed,honestly i am so incredibly triggered that you chose the us for the country to have everyone i sexually identify as dish soap and i was made in china so chinese master race
dataisbeautiful,removed,is this calculation literally putting houses side by fucking side to come to this conclusion come on
dataisbeautiful,removed,you know what this tells me there is plenty of room for evryone to have a fucking mansion and acres of land
dataisbeautiful,removed,dont measure in feet u fuckin neanderthals
dataisbeautiful,removed,where is our waste going to go where are we going to buy food why am i living shoulder to shouler with billion people on top of a mountain under a lake or in a desert this is by far the most misleading shit ive seen here

dataisbeautiful,removed,you live like in shit town india or china or africa where there are not waste treatment facilities and you just shit on your neighbors stoop as you slink your way through narrow passages the solution is not more density its less people
dataisbeautiful,removed,think how much less it would be if we got rid of all the useless chinks and dot heads at least of their population serves no practical purpose whatsoever shit we could probably get rid of all of africa without any negative effect on the useful world
dataisbeautiful,removed,what a completely silly picture
dataisbeautiful,removed,shit like this aggregates me when can humans live with just houses touching each other to where sanitation issues would spread and kill millions in just a short period of time second what about stores what about personal space and noise issues with neighbors within yelling distance from you id rather have my mansion and live my life in peace not have a house connected to someone elses im not the one having kids a household so it is not my problem when the rest of the world cries they dont have it as good and its my job to support them hell if i had kids before i hit id probably be living in a house that small myself but i guess the most intelligent of the species thrives
dataisbeautiful,removed,if we did that america would tip over
dataisbeautiful,removed,there are all kinds of obstacles to make that unrealistic hence there are all kinds of obstacles to make that unrealistic

dataisbeautiful,removed,us public opinion has turned big time it used to be that favoring israeli dominance was a political necessity and very common among the public now the most popular view is moderation between the two groups with a sizable group heavily in favor of palestine

dataisbeautiful,removed,i wouldnt put much stock in this speaking as an australian youll be hard pressed to find a single australian who is even a little bit ok with the american leadership assuming they know anything about it at all
dataisbeautiful,removed,sure it is consider india has given nothing to the world they are a continual drain on its resources and a significant risk for both disease and terrorism that we accept these risks and even shoulder part of the burden of their existence is indeed charitable indians should thank their betters upon waking every morning and pray that our largesse continues
dataisbeautiful,removed,ah yes the incense clock surely the world wouldnt be the same without this master piece of engineering i stand corrected india has contributed immeasurably to the world and is in no way a shit filled cesspool s

dataisbeautiful,removed,except hes wrong the best cure for poverty is allowing nature to run its course and allow her selective forces go to work bleeding heart liberals and christian missionaries should stay out of world countries supplying them with medical aid food and water artificially inflating their numbers when natures selective process would have otherwise allowed only the best of them to survive same thing in the us where the welfare system allows the lowest quality human beings to reproduce instead of paying the highest quality human beings to reproduce perpetuating a never ending cycle of idiots in poverty when humans arrogantly try to interfere with nature it just causes more problems

dataisbeautiful,removed,the problem with this data is that it is incomplete and we know it is incomplete the data only concern what is officialy recognized as hate crime and even though black on white violence is extremely high it almost never counts as hate crime same with women on men violence which make even the most rigourous study of that data invalid since the presented data is not only false but known to be false the distribution also doesnt take into account reported vs convicted data and doesnt discriminate the kind of hate crimes therefore the picture is as biased as rape statictics which often go with reported data or similar multiplier created to indicate more rape happen than is being reported with no ounce of data to prove the assumption rather than convicted these gymnastic serves a rethoric well but are by no mean dependable nonetheless i find the data interesting it just is not a good source of information as rigorous as the document creation was was it is based on a bunch of flawed process
dataisbeautiful,removed,lol there goes my selfesteem

dataisbeautiful,removed,easy there puss
dataisbeautiful,removed,you know what thw good part nobody follows christianity anymore there were reformations the was the renaissance and slowly christianity was pacified and made mostly harmless or at least the anglican church was its more of a social club for biscuits and tea now and the dominant religious views are all that peace and love stuff islam hasnt had a reformation or that long period of pacification maybe its happening now maybe it isnt its hard to tell but its not there yet by a long stretch before im entirely comfortable with muslims as a social demographic islam needs to be destroyed like christianity was and judaism though they still do their circumcisions ew
dataisbeautiful,removed,the young are usually fucking clueless they lack life experience and they are generally naive when it comes to the world reality and cynicism hasnt set in yet young people also tend to be more progressive and liberal too yet i cant tell you how many folks ive met that are starting to swing right as they age there is hope source am midlate going on most of my peers are fucking clueless get the fuck off of my lawn

dataisbeautiful,removed,no i have no intention of stopping with accurately characterising them youre utterly clueless leftinternationalists have never produced anything that isnt vomit diarrhea threats hatred lies harassment bigotry or anything else from the register of a psychopath who decided he had more lofty and totalitarian goals than murder and it has worked very very well for them it continues to do well thats where you are wrong your approach leads to nothing more than far more of the same being moderate pleasant and tolerant to everyone is nothing but clearing the stage for those who arent even in this thread the psycho cult are sharing and spreading the image and assertion that those who voted leave did so just for the hell of it you can let that pass and be a silent bystander or you can openly state that the cult should die i choose the latter because the former is absolutely useless

dataisbeautiful,removed,when you build a gigafactory what do you need you need tons of raw materials building machines etc where does the energy to extract and move these things around the globe come from it has to come from an enormous amount of fossil fuels even if the gigafactor runs on purely green energy it takes an enormous amount of carbon to build the gigafactory this is the same problem with other green resources when you want to build a wind turbine you need tons of raw materials to do this all of those material tack energy to extract yes you could take the energy from a solar power plant use that energy to power electric machines that excavated and transport but the problem is you cannot scale this without ultimately resorting to carbon producing energy maybe all factories could be gigafactories mostly sustainable once theyre running the trouble is it takes an enormous amount of energy to get these factories up and running in the first place energy that can currently only be produced at scale through fossil fuels

dataisbeautiful,removed,hey im the guy thats making the versions op linked to i made this back may of and actually posted it about a year ago so youre right that movie bar codes definitely has been around longer than me i was actually inspired by mbc but wanted to write a program that creates a final product focusing solely around color choices instead of compressing every frame into vertical pixelwidth lines my version compiles each line by the average color of each frame i go through frame by frame pixel by pixel to grab each frames true average color thats why my version doesnt have any difference in color in yaxis the result is a smoother spectrum of color that makes a clearer representation of the color palette of a given movie if anyone has any questions let me know

dataisbeautiful,removed,million people died in world war not million no million did european jews lost a greater percentage of their population than any other group in the war nope gays and gypsies did jews are also unique because they were specifically targeted by german state policy oh this bullshit again everyone was targeted specifically you fucking hypocritical jackass you think the nukes were dropped on japan by accident huge amounts of resources were invested in the industrial extermination of the jews insignificant compared to what was spent to build nukes insignificant compared to the invasions of the ussr it was planned out in advanced and very well organized so was everything else in what the fuck are you talking about once again the vast majority of people who died and suffered in were nonjews the german expense of building concentration for camps amounted to of all the resources wasted during the war the greatest project in human history up to that point was the nuclear weapons research so if you are going to compare costs then the nuking of japan was far worse than what the jews went through this is why most of the world has such disdain for jews and jewish media you marginalize the real suffering of others and exaggerate jewish suffering did jews die sure but so did a whole shitload of other people im sick of hollywood making dumb movies about the suffering of the jews in how about we focus on the real suffering what the russians chinese poles eastern europeans and even the japanesegermans went through their suffering was monumental tens of millions were killed some of their nations disappeared from the map for decades it was an entire nation throwing its whole weight behind exterminating a single group of people which was a joke compared to the genocide of the native americans now that was a holocaust i get that you are a jew and you need to push your jew agenda and propaganda most of the world is getting bored of it seriously million dead a few million jews any day of the week

dataisbeautiful,removed,fuck off with stupid fucking baseball analogies you lost the fucking war and theres no other fucking way you can reason out of it viet forces was a place holder for all of the militaries that fought for the communist vietnam if your going to base a large part of how i dont know the names then you can go fuck off do you seriously think that china had nothing to do with the war and that was all just russia really fucking go take a brick to the face shitcunt it was a useless war that both the us and its allies fucking lost fighting resulting in a shittonne of pointless deaths

dataisbeautiful,removed,why does the pay gap exist it doesnt fucking matter why make it even thats how feminists cry its time for equality
dataisbeautiful,removed,its like they dont read the sources they link the washington post article actually demystifies the wage gap as a result of lower wages for jobs like cashiers servers and health care aid dragging down womens average hourly wage not some systemic discrimination as the main cause and the wage gap in modelling just makes sense the female fashion industry is way bigger so they can put more of an investment in the bodies that advertise their goods the smaller wage for male models just represents the difference in interest and money spent on fashion for men in general

dataisbeautiful,removed,this is how leslie jones became a
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats just a gender income gap
dataisbeautiful,removed,you seem really oblivious and ignorant
dataisbeautiful,removed,the issue is that racism towards black people and racism towards white people isnt equal i can absolutely see why people use reverse racism because calling it racism implies that its on the same level i dont agree with blm protestors only selling tshirts to black people but them not selling a shirt to you is nowhere near the racism that black people face in mostlywhite societies i suppose it just depends on how important the semantics of the word are to you racism has over time become a much harsher and extreme word im ok with it evolving to mean something else and i dont see any reason why we need to fight to preserve it is it really an issue that people want to redefine the word
dataisbeautiful,removed,when you think of the word racism what do you think of of the time i think of racism towards people who are not white and i think thats what most people imagine when they hear the word racism so if thats what we are all thinking how is it not unanimous
dataisbeautiful,removed,i look at it as pointing out the hypocrisy of feminism if men tend to like working harder jobs or work more hours they make more money because they earned more money whackjob feminists think that working less should give women the same as a man that works harder simply because the person working less is a woman its insane
dataisbeautiful,removed,same with adult film industry
dataisbeautiful,removed,hahaha you think sjws are intellectuals god damn that was funny more like ignorant entitled children oh bernie give us everything we should have to work its not fair any disagrees with you oh shut up your white you are to privileged to have an opinion you are a racist piece of shit hope you get lynched it will serve you racist trash thats not racist btw since your white no one can be racist to whites they have white privilege trump will destroy or nation no fuck off while i burn my neighborhood protesting
dataisbeautiful,removed,so when donald trump visits foreign countries will they say he has ceased to be a racist during the trip
dataisbeautiful,removed,being technically correct does advance the discussion that is if you care at all about being correct
dataisbeautiful,removed,very carefully
dataisbeautiful,removed,well egypt is in africa but due to culture its middle eastern but i should have said afghanistan same results a mostly black or muslim country means an early death usually
dataisbeautiful,removed,what do the colors mean
dataisbeautiful,removed,that makes absolutely no sense
dataisbeautiful,removed,but what does the average age of death mean despite the increase of number of births its so hard to explain yes
dataisbeautiful,removed,i know im only bright now go suck off your father you purebred voter
dataisbeautiful,removed,ill wager that you are a year old or younger muslim omg ill know ill win ill know ill win i know ill win but tell us all how superior it is to be a minority you murderous wrectourous whore do you feel that ahmed the fake bombmaker deserves a million payoff for fucking liberals in the ass

dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah wed only need a fraction of the water we use in flushing the toilet if we all just shit in the streets
dataisbeautiful,removed,to be fair youd use a lot of resources too if you were living upsidedown
dataisbeautiful,removed,not hard to believe considering the amount of streetshitting going on in india
dataisbeautiful,removed,india is great at reusing they bathe wash clothes and shit all in the same place talk about efficient
dataisbeautiful,removed,meaning if the vast majority of people lived in squalor and didnt have toilets no thanks
dataisbeautiful,removed,nah fuck youse cunts seppos and eu are way worse then straya we can safely breathe in the southern hemisphere also indias of a planet would be a bloody nightmare i love a good curry but not for brekky lunch and tea every day and have you seen the bloody ganges

dataisbeautiful,removed,so youre saying we need a caste system where everyone shits in the street and massive wealth inequality prevails
dataisbeautiful,removed,wed also all be shitting in the street public defecation is everywhere which probably has something to do with why they use less water
dataisbeautiful,removed,rivers are quite polluted did you include the floating corpses as pollution
dataisbeautiful,removed,time to bomb the planet back to the stone age think of the res wed save
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah they are doing really good revert
dataisbeautiful,removed,ah trickle down economics now i know what trump was talking about
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah fuck you australia shit bathe and dump corpses in your drinking water so bad at multitasking
dataisbeautiful,removed,we would only need earths if we all just shit in the street and pushed our garbage into the river sign me up
dataisbeautiful,removed,this post is complete shit before you downvote me let me tell you why in india they literally take shits on streets to maintain their lifestyle
dataisbeautiful,removed,who cares bro we are not gonna run out of water better than not having showers like those indian cunts

dataisbeautiful,removed,you do realize that the majority of indians live in mud and sewage right where selling their daughters into prostitution is a viable way to make ends meet
dataisbeautiful,removed,designated
dataisbeautiful,removed,but id rather change the view of fellow redditors as regards to the opinion that india is a country still stuck in the i was thinking
dataisbeautiful,removed,indians are still working on using indoor toilets they like to shit in the fields
dataisbeautiful,removed,and every homless indian family has one child whos missing a limb its the weirdest fucking thing whenever i go back to that hell hole
dataisbeautiful,removed,india that place is filthy filled with disease barely any sanitation millions living in tent cities rabid dogs and cows roam the streets the rivers are so polluted you wouldnt want to step into it and beaches where people go to shit because there arent enough toilets they just shit on the beach you couldnt pay me to visit that hellhole
dataisbeautiful,removed,india is a horrible country i dont respect the people who act as if it was a decent place to live third world countries suck period
dataisbeautiful,removed,straight up blunts usually help a lot with power outages
dataisbeautiful,removed,nonsense india sucks when it comes to use of resources it is filthy hellishly polluted and full of shit literally
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah lets just all drink liquid shit fuck off op what a stupid comparison
dataisbeautiful,removed,of indians are vegetarian that alone makes up for all thats wrong with india if the world was vegetarian our species would have a much better chance at survival

dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,pls no salt
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,idiot the fact that you live in such shitty conditions is the reason you dont suck up that much resources
dataisbeautiful,removed,shit is depressing fam
dataisbeautiful,removed,ive heard about your dirty streets alright
dataisbeautiful,removed,and we would need earths if every country spread feces into the ocean like india does
dataisbeautiful,removed,shit on i see what you did there
dataisbeautiful,removed,stop being consumerist whores people in the developed world even from my view as another person who lives in the developed world are so fucking wasteful and living so ridiculously extravagantly people constantly mock me because i dont buy new clothes new bowls and plates new desks chairs computers new everything all the time like they do they buy trinkets and jewelry buy new phones every year or two years they constantly fill their lives with stuff they drive cars they fly everywhere for vacation their entire lives are basically spent using more resources than they have to often just to show off to others they deserve to have their planet collapse around them they have absolutely no foresight theyre addicted to consumerism
dataisbeautiful,removed,and wed only need one street to shit in too seriously india is not the kind of lifestyle i want to aim for
dataisbeautiful,removed,a wasteland that becomes more inhabitable every year oh good
dataisbeautiful,removed,india drinks unpasteurized rotten milk and has a group of people called untouchables im fine where i am thanks
dataisbeautiful,removed,disregarding geography doesnt help we dont all drive cars because we want to
dataisbeautiful,removed,i mean
dataisbeautiful,removed,yup httpmimgurcomzdcthhyr
dataisbeautiful,removed,now i understand why the indian counterstrike servers are always down
dataisbeautiful,removed,the ugh constitution
dataisbeautiful,removed,something something something shittin in the fields something something
dataisbeautiful,removed,well considering that in india people poop square km we would also drown the whole planet in shit a lot of hindus also dont use caskets for the dead but instead dump them to the same rivers where they bathe and drink from its quite a lot of resources when you realize that people die every day and we chop down trees and mine ore just to preserve waste for a bit longer india also has a lot of population living in extreme poverty so its not surprising they dont use that many resources if theyre just living off the landand streets or slaving at some jungle farm
dataisbeautiful,removed,i didnt have high hopes coming into this thread
dataisbeautiful,removed,fuck this i am quitting my job to write random crap seems to be the way forward nowadays
dataisbeautiful,removed,except india is a shit country get it because they dont know how to use toilets
dataisbeautiful,removed,makes sense india saves on resources like water by just pooping in ocean and worshipping rather than eatting them but australia uses alot cuz those antigravity generators they use to keep from falling off the earth use alotta electricity
dataisbeautiful,removed,makes sense india saves on resources like water by just pooping in ocean and worshipping rather than eatting them but australia uses alot cuz those antigravity generators they use to keep from falling off the earth use alotta electricity
dataisbeautiful,removed,india doesnt enjoy the highest living standards sure it does for like people

dataisbeautiful,removed,step stop driving around in a nice car trying to get a girl to like you instead wait for her to be in the middle of taking a shit knock her over and gang rape her by you and of your buddies raping the same woman it saves tremendously on the amount of resources you must spend getting cars and a subarban home that requires a minute daily commute save the planet
dataisbeautiful,removed,yes but the world would stink like a festering shithole if it was like india
dataisbeautiful,removed,i guess shitting anywhere in public and having a rapey culture has its advantages count me in
dataisbeautiful,removed,agreed comment hijack obvi but measuring things in terms of how many earths is just bass ackwards its too simple to actually explain resource use there are things world and all other nations will have that can drastically decrease resource use including solar power evs and better recycling programs there are also cultural changes that can happen that could reduce them as well such as reducing consumerism and increasing earth stewardship in simple terms building a solar panel requires a complicated and expensive setup but once used conserves a lot of resources so it is actually possible that within the next years nations like australia could consume earth worth of resources
dataisbeautiful,removed,yes but people in india multiply like rabbits and there are over a billion of them and still growing so yeah there ya go
dataisbeautiful,removed,shut up
dataisbeautiful,removed,d e s i g n a t e d
dataisbeautiful,removed,oi cunt fucken piss off ya bloody drongo petrol isnt fucken cheap we most certainly are not driving to work for the cunting fun of it mate

dataisbeautiful,removed,yo hold up just gonna go dump my grandpas corpse in the river and take a shit on that burning pile of garbage over there just doing my part
dataisbeautiful,removed,yes youre right but luckily there is also a realtime dataset ustuckinthematrix wrote an interesting blog post about it
dataisbeautiful,removed,how about you delete the low quality and low effort submission
dataisbeautiful,removed,so what im getting out of most of the comments here is either india is a shitty place or that yeah thats basically it
dataisbeautiful,removed,miles to go to be liveable then fuck off you twat go live in some other country where you can eat your body weight in fat and can produce lard just by sweating we have power cuts and water crisis only because of the billion people who live here and theres not enough to go around no ones saying were perfect but weve already started investing in cheaper sources of energy rainwater harvesting and green living much more than the united states and many other western developed countries who consume criminal amounts of crude oil and electricity each day if you dont like it here fuck off
dataisbeautiful,removed,perhaps you should visit india to see that a lot of people simply wrap their dead in a cloth and burn them at the shore its normal and youll see this every day rich people use caskets
dataisbeautiful,removed,if trump wins im moving to michael phelps
dataisbeautiful,removed,if we all littered like india we would need more earths

dataisbeautiful,removed,legal immigrants not the ones we cant keep track of
dataisbeautiful,removed,i can answer this if you travel the world you will quickly learn not all places are the same not all culture is equal remember who wants to be a millionaire in russia ask the audience would often give the wrong answer on purpose its culture in a lot of these areas they just scam each other all time in the usa and other parts we generally try to be more helpful remember girls getting acid tossed in their face for going to school its stuff like that among other reasons that cause these areas to be total shit and its not pc but im convinced genetically there are iq differences between different areas and before anyone gets on me about that httpmarrowdrivesorgcristinaethnicitymarrowdonationhtml there are genetic differences between groups of people freaking deal with gender isnt an identity and likewise why wouldnt intelligence be genetically related not everyone is equally smart im not saying everyone from these places is dumb but if you iq is so low you have to explain why you shouldnt toss acid on little girls faces to the majority of people i dont have much hope likewise you shouldnt kick ieds nswf come man they were beating an explosive round whod have thought it would go boom

dataisbeautiful,removed,no wonder theres so many landscaping companies
dataisbeautiful,removed,net migration from mexico is beside the point most of these illegal immigrants are coming from el salvador and guatemala only travelling through mexico every one of these degenerates should be exterminated violently and immediately and lets hope that president trump has the balls to utilize the full force of the us military to accomplish that task
dataisbeautiful,removed,what you wrote is certainly true but that doesnt erase the moral hazard presented by giving amnesty to people who committed a criminal act im sure that if i were in the same position as most of them id want to escape the shithole that is mexico and central america remember that most illegal immigrants are from el salvador and not mexico but that doesnt change the fact that the law isnt supposed to be moral or fair and that there are about three billion people who would also love to escape their respective shitholes by infesting this country too if we allow those who have already made it here illegally to stay we will be inundated by more hoards of invaders we cannot be a country of thirdworld people without becoming a thirdworld country ourselves i just hope that our new president donald trump has the balls to use the full force of the us military to violently exterminate the millions of unpunished criminals permeating our society with sufficient brutality and savagery to discourage any potential illegal immigrants in the future a nation with a white minority is not the place where you want your children to grow up we can all blame president lyndon b johnson for getting us here but presidents ronald reagan and george w bush deserve equal blame as presidents bill clinton and barack obama for perpetuating this mess now theyve so deeply infested our society with their unpunished criminality illegally crossing the border that they form a significant voting bloc in many states and are destroying american values and culture

dataisbeautiful,removed,estimates of attendance at trumps inauguration have been all over the place so i thought id try to pin down the range and compare it with previous inaugurations i overlaid it with a few data points showing subway trips as that seems to be the most reliable figure we have data sources
dataisbeautiful,removed,theres also an extended version although i felt like the numbers were getting kinda sketchy so take it with a grain of salt i adjusted for population growth with this one so all of the values can be taken as if they occurred in additional sources for this part
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah i thought of that too i felt like the estimates of protesters were even worse than the crowd estimates though so i didnt feel right trying to adjust it
dataisbeautiful,removed,why whats wrong with their numbers
dataisbeautiful,removed,oh i know i was just hoping the trumpette would actually look at the cnn article and realize its extremely straightforward reporting with solid numbers
dataisbeautiful,removed,i was wondering that too i saw some mention of how that inauguration was the first to be held at the current location but that wouldnt explain it
dataisbeautiful,removed,according to it was reagans second inauguration that was the cold one his first was actually the warmest on record °f

dataisbeautiful,removed,crime rates were plummeting across the country at the same time but we dont think that had to do with a ny law either id say pricing the black males out during the housing bubble would have had more of an impact than rounding them up
dataisbeautiful,removed,also more detailed stats by race and ethnicity arrest rate for each etc httpwwwnycgovhtmlnypdhtmlanalysisandplanningcrimeandenforcementactivityshtml for example page ii looks like homicide is still disproportionately committed by blacks and hispanics food for thought if you think nypd unfairly target minorities more white homicide suspects are arrested as a percentage compared to blacks this is what the people who are upset about racism never actually bother to study

dataisbeautiful,removed,i agree with you that that would be a great model for a welfare system but i think the theory behind ubi and why it is quite controversial is that it would be truly universal so while it may be peanuts to a ceo or lawyer they dont necessarily have to draw it down or they could use it for philanthropy or take people working ordinary jobs who have enough to provide for themselves and their family but not quite enough to retrain into some thing more interesting or to take a leap opening a new business saving up their ubi could allow them to do that and all this extra money floating around does eventually go back to the government through i assume much higher taxes its a little bit of a utopian concept in my understanding i am obviously not an economist though

dataisbeautiful,removed,but metabolism increases the amount you burn blood sugar also has a lot to do with it as it affects how your body uses the calories it does has if you have constantly high blood sugar you start developing insulin resistance and your body cant use what you take in as well and you get lethargic and constantly hungry unless you start taking in more calories your body is starving at the molecular level so it amps down energy levels and amps up hunger singles until you take in enough that its getting what it needs at the molecular level which is more and more and more as time goes on and your insulin resistance worsens or turns into full on type diabetes meanwhile if you keep your blood sugar low or your body is just naturally good at dealing with carbohydrates your body can use what you take in more efficiently and you feel full and satisfied after a decent meal and get great energy from it so while the calories incalories out is of course correct there are biological factors that go into why someone is taking in more calories than their bodies are using that go beyond just gluttony
dataisbeautiful,removed,have an upvote a fatty lover didnt like it
dataisbeautiful,removed,hes not speaking with regard to women specifically nor am i were just speculating
dataisbeautiful,removed,btw im and bench over i just study nutrition so have something of an opinion lol
dataisbeautiful,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
dataisbeautiful,removed,i dont think thats the one i remember it but its somewhat similar read all the comments the amount of very muscular with a small layer of fat is hilarious
dataisbeautiful,removed,bastard
dataisbeautiful,removed,yup
dataisbeautiful,removed,fat sluts
dataisbeautiful,removed,if you believed half the comments in here women are now amazonian bodybuilders thats certainly what we see on american city streets thousands of women with muscles bulging from their bodies moo
dataisbeautiful,removed,and just like expected some fedora wearing smegma devourer has to go right after attackingmen how about those fat cunts we all have to deal with stone them all
dataisbeautiful,removed,your worth is your girth
dataisbeautiful,removed,til i weigh the same amount as the average woman today
dataisbeautiful,removed,i was likewhat the hell is pretty fat and i dont think id see her on the beach and think damn that woman is in shape and id consider in shape just guessing but pounds more than that hell no you cant hide that many pounds and i know its insane to bring up the bmi chart but thats roughly a overweight
dataisbeautiful,removed,obese people are gross and should be put down for good
dataisbeautiful,removed,look how it spikes during the atkins diet craze years lol
dataisbeautiful,removed,g i went to mcdonalds today and got a filetofish combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side i was eating it in my vehicle in the parking lot and listening to an audiobook when i glanced up and saw the mcdonalds worker i ordered outside having a cigarette she waved at me and i nodded and had to wait minutes before she went back inside and i could eat in comfort again i dont think that employees should be bothering or even trying to socialize with customers outside of the mcdonalds restaurant or drive through but that is another story i went to mcdonalds for dinner tonight and got a mcchicken combo with a bacon cheeseburger on the side as i was driving to the second window the same girl was still working she was acting somewhat obsequious and attempting small talk when she asked why dont you come eat inside instead of in the parking lot where it is cold that really bothered me for many reasons first of all i dont want my routine or actions to be tracked by a fast food employee secondly she should not try to tell me how i should live my life i do not want to eat inside because i find it less comfortable and would much rather be inside my vehicle listening to an audiobook and enjoying myself and my privacy overall i think it was very unprofessional to bring this up i should have a clean slate with each drive through visit not have to get the third degree because i committed some sort of faux pas which i dont think i did because i often see people eating in fast food parking lots how does she know i am not busy going to work or somewhere in a rush how do you feel about eating in your vehicle in the parking lot of a fast food restaurant versus eating inside the restaurant
dataisbeautiful,removed,yup its all very cyclical
dataisbeautiful,removed,username checks out sigh
dataisbeautiful,removed,haha how tall we talkin here cause then yeah i can see that being too small lol
dataisbeautiful,removed,nah truth hurts that women are not hard done by and oppressed and that most of reddit has a bias in there favor i am starting to wonder if the pro female bias has any biological underpinning since females do play a bigger role in the survival of our species aka if you put man and women on a deserted island in about a years time about new humans will be exist on the island if you put men and woman only about new human will exist on the island in about a year resulting in people being bias in womens favor and thinking they are oppressed for being treated equally to men or thinking they are oppressed whenever men do better then them at something but being like you go girl show the men how its done any time they do better then men at something
dataisbeautiful,removed,oh yeah fat is bad absolutely that particular sub just became a bit too hostile towards fatties people seem to forget the old saying everything in moderation
dataisbeautiful,removed,you loved a place full of nothing but mentally unstable men who are a hairs breadth from masturbating to the suffering of others as for whatever sentence you attempted to just formulate it certainly isnt convincing me of your intelligence
dataisbeautiful,removed,combine this foible of human nature with the relative wealth that most americans enjoy and you have an obesity epidemic there really isnt a great answer imo ironically the developing nations are more obese the western hungry is nutrient poor brazil on track to be the most obese in the world since mexico is more obese than usa china youth obesity crisis
dataisbeautiful,removed,got downvoted as well probably cheese haters

dataisbeautiful,removed,some idiot tells me to put a hose of in my mouth and see how thats somehow analogous to the benefits plants would get from and im the retardtroll
dataisbeautiful,removed,what im saying what i said was purely in reference to the show and the madman speaking in it it doesnt matter whos seen the show and who hasnt im telling you not to take offense to me asking a question about what was happening in a fictional setting
dataisbeautiful,removed,well that escalated quickly
dataisbeautiful,removed,thanks
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,california software publishers by county data obtained from us census bureau business patterns data viz created with httpwwwfactlookcom
dataisbeautiful,removed,as i previous explained this is not earth temperature data it has an obvious northern hemisphere temperature signature additionally all major global temperature data sets disagree with the headline uah has august at which may be the hottest august i have not checked but it is no where near the hottest month that was february at all data sets rss uah hadcrut giss and neci disagree with your findings so you better have a very good explanation but i doubt i will hear from you as you have consistently failed to answer any of the concerns poised to your data
dataisbeautiful,removed,keep in mindstfu
dataisbeautiful,removed,but this isnt what the libs want to hear
dataisbeautiful,removed,that doesnt really address point a single month over even a single year of high temperatures is not a sufficiently broad data set to draw any conclusion we know that global warming is real because the multiyear global mean has risen not because of any individual month or year this post is indeed as flawed as the climate deniers claiming that one cold month or year means climate change isnt real in reality we all do ourselves a big disservice by pushing this nonsense
dataisbeautiful,removed,which means they were only land temperatures only in very isolated locations and so not very representative of the global temp the best data is from onward
dataisbeautiful,removed,true but there were still only a handful of them in very limited locations on the planet
dataisbeautiful,removed,there you go again with your leftist agenda and facts nobama they must have another planet where they are gonna go and leave the common folk to burn up and suffocate why do the peoples of the earth allow governments to ruin this rich jewel the earth can sustain many times its current population if governments and people were not so greedy if everyone were nor so eager to capitalize on others needs stop being assholes to each other stop senseless wars stop ruining the earth stop letting them divide us and lets make them work for us u pussies
dataisbeautiful,removed,didnt even cite a source
dataisbeautiful,removed,then fill it up on the outside
dataisbeautiful,removed,depending on your age you might as well feel sorry for yourself there is going to be a lot of trouble for all of us even in the west
dataisbeautiful,removed,more important question would be if you have changed your behavior upon hearing the truth many people know about climate change but few are willing to dial their consumption down cause the chinese are much worse disregarding the fact that china is just where many things get produced and then shipped
dataisbeautiful,removed,stop trying to suck up to eurotrash
dataisbeautiful,removed,no big deal the as ive been saying since forever shame on any and all scientists taking this data without verifying the quality of the source first data is useless if its tainted for those too lazy to follow the link or if the link gets a reddit hugodeath basically temperature survey stations dont comply with the noaas own rules and they have issues ranging from the wrong paint whitewash vs latex which makes a difference to being placed right next to ac exhaust or parking lots where cars get parked with hot radiators to artificially create localized hot spots that do not reflect any true increases in temperature you can create cute excel graphs all you want but the base data is shit the world is fine climate change is a bigger hoax than was an inside job and youre all suckers for believing a ppm trace atmosphere molecule that is is going to be the end of life on earth stop being a human racist and hating on people for wanting to enjoy life and trying to find reasons that theyre literal shitlords for doing so
dataisbeautiful,removed,then please sir
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,because is garbage and most probably dont know
dataisbeautiful,removed,its not malice its this is why you dont just take data compile it and be another person shouting the sky is falling they couldve gotten better data walking around asking people if they felt hot today
dataisbeautiful,removed,i dont think anyone is in favor of widespread deforestation but burning fossil fuels in a modern piece of equipment with catalytic converters is basically just creating for trees
dataisbeautiful,removed,the reason theres a consensus is because the scientists arent getting their ass into the field to see that all of the equipment is setup wrong
dataisbeautiful,removed,thanks boomers for destroying the earth gg
dataisbeautiful,removed,fuck yeah burn baby burn cold weather sucks a dick
dataisbeautiful,removed,now thats sad
dataisbeautiful,removed,also great to find element zero
dataisbeautiful,removed,i like it c
dataisbeautiful,removed,lucky for you and most scientists are only looking at the data not the source of the data hence the problem its as as being an inside job
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,a combination of natural cycles will make years fluctuate but as far as records go
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,lucky for you most scientists are apparently too incompetent to make sure their measurement stations are setup properly
dataisbeautiful,removed,why are people not doing more about this
dataisbeautiful,removed,woes words
dataisbeautiful,removed,what about blacks resentful towards whites i see a lot more of that and from what i heard that is almost exclusively a democrat phenomenon
dataisbeautiful,removed,nope
dataisbeautiful,removed,because the and this is all fearmongering made from bad data sets and bad lines of best fit in the data
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,the tldr the scientific community is basically a joke they can make cute graphs but are too lazy to setup the experiment correctly its as plants love the extra revving your pickup in the woods is the greenest thing you can do
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,what world do you live in even if these stations were properly set up in the first place do you really think people are constantly checking up on these stations to make sure nobody installed an ac nearby or built a parking lot there are hundreds if not thousands of these things scientists arent going to drive out and check up on them who gives a shit if hes connected to the heartland institute nasa is connected to a liberal president that wants to leverage global warming to enact policies that arent actually in peoples best interest when are you going to expose that scandal
dataisbeautiful,removed,its fucking pictures man you can see for yourself the temp stations arent setup properly stop thinking nasa is the great organization it once was or that the climate division holds a candle to the minds that sent us into space the nasa part is in name only its a bunch of chucklefucks that are either incompetent or are deliberately trying to show global warming to leverage government power to do what they want fix things we dont need to worry about extra because and i have yet to see a real practical experiment that proves low concentration causes drastic temperature increases
dataisbeautiful,removed,im glad youve bought into the hype can i interest you in a time share theyre a great investment i can also sell you a bridge
dataisbeautiful,removed,hes not a bullshit crusader thats what the modern shellofitsformerself nasa is the government is using the nasa name to gain credibility so they can manipulate people into doing whatever they want i am so fucking sick of horseshit manipulated graphs trying to prove trends that arent there taken from heavily flawed measurement systems ps none of your articles did a very good job of proving anything he said was wrong
dataisbeautiful,removed,so youre saying the vast majority of the climate scientists in the world are all incompetent pretty much is it so hard to believe were just figuring out that fat is actually good for you and bread is bad and that took exactly how many years you really think a shittier climate scientist is infallible if theyre all taking the same flawed data sets theyll all produce the same shitty results climate scientists are not the goldmedal winners of the scientific community
dataisbeautiful,removed,i cant state whether this study was done with any sort of actual peer review oh wait yes i can it wasnt just doesnt seem to exist here thats just one problem with this another is that while it could very well be that tons of temperature monitoring stations are incorrectly installed theres something scientists do in order to reduce the impact its called averaging im going to stop you right there when youre talking degree of temperature any mistake in setup of any much less of the stations is going to wildly skew your findings add in a bunch of people hell bent on proving global warming making up their own graph corrections to show the data they way they want and boom catastrophic global warming trends when there are none so even if this were the case it still doesnt poke a hole in anything if anything its just more evidence that the cranks dont know what theyre talking about worse this person went into the study looking for problems not data to keep the ball rolling hes literally just a blogger he tried to get a degree but according to wikipedia httpsenwikipediaorgwikianthonywattsblogger he couldnt hack it thats irrelevant the pictures are there showing the violations you dont need a phd to show something doesnt comply with the regulations of its own governing body lets put this into perspective shall we lets say you have a thermometer it reads from degrees c now lets say you scratched the numbers off and put them all back slightly lower than they were previously the mercury still rises the same distance but the number we read is now different does that mean the temperatures are different as a result no if youre always reading slightly above or below the actual temperature you simply need to determine by how much and adjust the measurement basically all this amounts to is the potential that some of the stations might have tainted data it does absolutely nothing to debunk the science and goes a long way to making this person and his followers show their ignorance no this screws up everything you dont go back and start adjusting numbers haphazardly the data set is crap and you throw it out and start over but everyones in too deep and theyre going to keep riding it out until the lid is blown off because they know theyll never find jobs again once this is recognized as the bullshit that it is

dataisbeautiful,removed,as the cats out of the bag now ill go ahead and explain how everything works basically we cheat in my garageoffice i have a small collection of lowend gaming pcs which exist for the sole purpose of connecting to games via gotv collecting data from the game and then sending it up so it can be collected and broadcasted its an unfortunate state of affairs but its the state none the less the good thing is the cheats are only reading memory and not modifying it so the likelihood of them getting caught andor dealt with is very slim the only alternative is to have humans watching the game and pushing the data but that of course comes with three major issues accuracy timing and availability gotv viewers cant see the n damage in n shots these gaming pcs are available have accuracy and their timing is nearly instantaneous my dream is to run everything off linux but the reality is were just not there yet

dataisbeautiful,removed,well i would hope us population growth is smaller than global population growth and yes were really peeved by all those brown and black folks coming to the us to turn our country into something that looks like theirs only with much better free stuff they didnt earn its known as the freerider problem and its tearing the country apart politico rates this statement as mostly true we have a legal immigration system in america that accepts one million people a year legally no other country in the world even comes close to that last were a nation of a legal immigrants using a controlled and orderly process it was never meant to be some kind of free for all take em into your own house and pay their way if you feel so strongly about it mr progressive
dataisbeautiful,removed,i just did he seems like a partisan hack although theres nothing bigoted there i dont think anyway thats not what im interested in im more trying to figure out if some people are still pushing the if you question massive immigration then youre racist narrative
dataisbeautiful,removed,i wasnt questioning the value of immigration i was wondering whether someone questioning our current immigration rate is necessarily racist i guess i dont understand how your comment bears on my question

dataisbeautiful,removed,buthis point is pretty much validated by the survey assuming we agree and maybe we dont with the idea that masculinity characteristics vary between races
dataisbeautiful,removed,probably probable based on what there is no convincing way to prove this and its extremely damaging speculation we continue to make victims where there are none

dataisbeautiful,removed,too bad the insurance it provided to low income people is garbage
dataisbeautiful,removed,my deductible is like i tore my acl and the shit was useless
dataisbeautiful,removed,well youre insuring people not vehicles and people are a lot more expensive to repair than vehicles
dataisbeautiful,removed,gay
dataisbeautiful,removed,define short comments and low effort replies
dataisbeautiful,removed,the government has the resources to police hospital inefficiencies i dont think so look at the va
dataisbeautiful,removed,and then there are people like me who just lie on their taxes and say theyre covered when they arent
dataisbeautiful,removed,my premiums went from in to in to this year for same deductible and same max outofpocket the only successful thing about obamacare is how successfully it redefined the word affordable
dataisbeautiful,removed,the healthcare system in the states is so fucking broken i pine for the days when i would bitch about a copay
dataisbeautiful,removed,im really surprised by canada i didnt think that we were that sad
dataisbeautiful,removed,well obviously you wouldnt be allowed to opt out until you had enough saved to be self insured its like being bonded as a general contractor
dataisbeautiful,removed,i have zero insurance because its so affordable
dataisbeautiful,removed,why are absolute failures at life like yourself posting in this thread if you took minutes to figure things out you would get subsidized or if your income is that bad the fee is waived
dataisbeautiful,removed,yea fuck no theres no reason to be subsidizing illegals we need to subsidize our immigrants veterans children in that order first get your priorities in order we choose your path and we wont make it years you dumb fuck
dataisbeautiful,removed,oh no swearing guaranteed incomprehension try it elsewhere i could give a shit about you softies
dataisbeautiful,removed,yes i am one of the people that benefited from obamacare because i finally got medicaid but it is very difficult to find good therapists psychiatrists and doctors that take medicaid its definitely not impossible it just takes a bit more digging
dataisbeautiful,removed,this is correct as far as i can tell when i did some research into it it said there was no guarantee you will be paid for even if you are low income people are very very proud about mandatory health insurance though i thought it was about making sure poor people get health insurance but nope not according to the websites themselves it is just to have a penalty for it and you basically have to optout if you are too poor also you dont get on benefits in general if you live with someone that makes too much money or not a female etc they only give out welfare to certain people welfare is not an entitlement as in you will get it no matter whatit is an optional government program that covers some people selectively

dataisbeautiful,removed,lets just start with the fact that virtually everyoneyes even including your iconoclastic virtuesignaling selfis a racist then lets look at how most antiracism is actually antiwhite bias in disguise black pride is beautiful white pride is evil that sort of thing finally we have the iq differences between the races that is probably the ultimate trump card against liberal platitudes of inclusionism httpsenwikipediaorgwikiraceandintelligence
dataisbeautiful,removed,everyone but me is a racist bigot sexist xenophobe how dare you have different opinions than me the supreme gentleman synackaon said shortly before choking to death on muhammads cock
dataisbeautiful,removed,this doesnt consider the fact that intelligence is hereditary and intelligence is the causal factor in income disparity or at least the more significant factor in a duelcausality it relies without any evidence on the assumption that wealthy people must be hiring more tutors and putting more pressure on their children rather than the more reasonable assumption backed up with irrefutable evidence that peoples income tends to be based on their intelligence and intelligent people tend to have intelligent offspring

dataisbeautiful,removed,well without the discrimination nor inferiority complex women are inferior mentally and physically so thats why were at the situation were in right now with women being mad about losing in life in a no holds barred competition in sports business or politics women lose every time the question actually becomes should women be given a handicap just because they were born genetically inferior even though they received the same start in life as their male counterparts in terms of social mobility education wealth and healthcare if this is true then would a race one day say they were genetically inferior and get a handicap too should a female version of that race get an even bigger handicap the question that radical feminisms are pretending to ask right now is how can we make women equal to men when society discriminates against women which is a complete farce men didnt arrive at this spot in society in the last years by accident each time men and women went head to head men have won
dataisbeautiful,removed,third wave feminism has capitulated to neo liberal capitalism and as such argues the commodification of women in the second trade is empowering completely ignoring most women are trafficked and its not a choice but a desperate act for those with no other means men can be women because they purchase feminine products and perform feminine gender roles women arent women because of the anatomical reality of being female rather only material purchased what you buy and wear makes one the sex of their performance i could go on and on but i wont bore you my fellow redditor have my upvote too despite your valiant efforts ive broke even at a big fat zero lol
dataisbeautiful,removed,dont tell feminists that though they hate to hear one gender being superior in certain aspects unless theyre female aspects
dataisbeautiful,removed,but but butaccording to anita sarkessian gender is a social construct and there is no physiological difference between men and women also the only reason that there arent female players in the nfl is that the white supremacist capitalist patriarchy is a system of oppression that forces women into misogynistic gender roles facts are a tool of teh

dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah see to the op of this chain the article i linked ended up being a rather poor source for the point i was trying to make i pretty much did a on my opinions of the author after i listed to the accompanying audio interview reddit and make it seem that way but i really dont think femnazis are that common at all i think it depends on the setting the secularatheist club at my university has quite a few people on the feminazi spectrum ive gotten into arguments with both men and women there who self identify as feminists and who assert that its racist and fatphobic to not be attracted equally to all races and body types on reddit from my experience the commenters in feminist communities are mostly alright but the mods who control them are very much feminazis i was banned and muted from rfeminism which has almost subs for pming the mods and suggesting that more academic feminist flair options aside from just radical be added the only reason i even asked was because the global ethics course i was taking at the time had a unit dedicated to feminism and our split it up academically into classical difference equity and radical feminism im just trying to say if there are too many insane feminists why dont you become a sane one i would like to and i support what and wave feminism has done and consider myself a humanist and egalitarian however i dont support a lot of the current waveradicalintersectional feminist ideals and dubious statistics that are being pushed and arguing against them just ends up getting me ostracized i dont agree with stuff like the progressive stack haes or saying the wage gape is ¢ instead of ¢ depending on the study or that in women on college campuses are raped instead of in and some of the wackier versions of patriarchy theory thus if i was asked today if i identify as feminist i would say no but im an egalitarian just to not be associated with the crazies that are make up a sizable number of feminists my age

dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah and blacks or women being inferior is also just an opinion sadly opinions not based on facts is literally cancer to a society not something you should be proud of and definitely should avoid yourself from voting with those opinions based on your own fantasy
dataisbeautiful,removed,funny how some of the most atheistic countries have adopted a new religion of egalitarians and humanism and accepted every wretched refugees from the third world and allowed their countries to turn into hell holes religious bigotry has survival value and evolved with societies throughout the ages it kept outsiders in their place and rightfully so soon the day will come when most of europe will long for the good ole days of the holy crusades
dataisbeautiful,removed,and then these enlightened atheist europeans gladly welcome in hordes of fearful and superstitious muslims good job you guys are killing europe
dataisbeautiful,removed,dont worry europe islamists will pick up the religious slack for you
dataisbeautiful,removed,this is i wonder what the data looks like
dataisbeautiful,removed,no atheism is the positive statement there is no deity very few actual atheists but they do exist and have constructed defensible philosophies that show the existence of a deity is self refuting agnosticism is the positive statement that the metaphysical reality of a deity cannot be empirically known or deduced from rational principles most self proclaimed agnostics are using the term in an informal sense like im agnostic on the merits of corporal punishment but applying it to philosophy a real agnostic would say something like while aristotles proof of a deity can be updated to account for modern science and entropy can be subbed for the movement of the spheres we dont have a good enough understanding of entropy and the first moments of the big bang to deduce the existence of a deity then there are undecided they dont have a name because academics dont find them interesting academics debate philosophy and theology and being undecided irreligious or whatever is a social phenomena then there are internet theologians who toss around made up terms like lowercase gnosticism and mash ups like agnostic theist who just confuse the whole ordeal there was a blog post that created a four block chart that redefined the terms to straw man proper agnosticism to as to include them with atheists as a way to shore up numbers in some sort of us vs them dick measuring contest it doesnt make a lot of sense and doesnt lend itself well to mapping to actual philosophical positions

dataisbeautiful,removed,you might want to take a history class or we may have fanned the flame but islam has never been about peace and it never will be no religion is about peace the only peace a religion can achieve is killing all who disagree which is advocated in all of the holy books and only one religion still has plenty of people willing to follow that quran id also recommend learning about the prophet mohammed and what he did and how he ruled remember the crusades and the spanish inquisition islam is now in that phase

dataisbeautiful,removed,herein everybody will anal fuck do she is hook up for
dataisbeautiful,removed,who cares women attempt suicide because they know itll get them help they choose easily reversible less disfiguring slower methods to give themselves and others time to save them men suffocate shoot themselves hang themselves jump or crash because they know no one is there to help them and they want gone its incredibly simple to kill yourself so i have zero sympathy for people touting well more women try so obviously they are the real victims here mentalities the logical conclusion is that women obviously dont want to kill themselves or they would just like men are
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats a disgusting accuse for the inactivity about addressing male suicides are you saying that women are too stupid to put a plastic bag full of he over their head
dataisbeautiful,removed,wow
dataisbeautiful,removed,too complicated for women is that what you are trying to say
dataisbeautiful,removed,different beige colors not exactly easy to read
dataisbeautiful,removed,ya this is basically why no one cares are the issue of suicide and certainly feminists couldnt give a single fuck
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats the idea i know tons of girls online that claim attempting suicide and rape and all kinds of other things the truth while one or two were real the rest were cries for attention they were the type to post statuses about their every social problem and talk about selfharm and how abused they are all the time while i do not like to downplay these issues because of their seriousness i cannot help but feel very jaded and annoyed about it now its become ugh another girl with a suiciderapeabuse story that probably isnt real i want to be empathetic and give everyone benefit of the doubt but its been false so many times now that ive become one that when they start on that i just try to change the subject i believe almost anyone thats truly a victim wouldnt come out so openly like that theyd be upset and ashamed of it most likely even though being ashamed of what someone else has done to you is ridiculous my logic is anyone that starts talking about it within the first few days ive met them must be lying and most of the ones ive met started going on about it within the first hour or two i think i really need to stop hanging with the weaboos that i do i hate to call them autistic as a social group but they really do behave that way a lot of the time
dataisbeautiful,removed,yet another thing men are better at
dataisbeautiful,removed,so youre a seaman huh
dataisbeautiful,removed,so the more civilised you go the more the ratio are equalized if not reversed
dataisbeautiful,removed,men actually do it women just pretend to
dataisbeautiful,removed,rdataisdepressing
dataisbeautiful,removed,only china pakistan and afghanistan have reverse trends
dataisbeautiful,removed,feminist organizations primarily help women that doesnt mean they do not care about mens issues i volunteer in several organizations who focus primarily on mens mental health
dataisbeautiful,removed,praise gender equality
dataisbeautiful,removed,jesus texas get your shit together candy corn
dataisbeautiful,removed,ratio would have come in handy here
dataisbeautiful,removed,obviously because of male privilege s
dataisbeautiful,removed,i would say over half the people i met in the late all had siblings yes of cause they have from what ive seen on pictures they all are siblings
dataisbeautiful,removed,so much for maleprivilege lmao ive been starting to hate feminists a lot as of late ever since the whole genderpay gap fiasco was confirmed to be false
dataisbeautiful,removed,women need to start doing their fair share of suicides
dataisbeautiful,removed,believe it not for the past years or so the most wealthy nations were in the west and therefore were likely to contain white people furthermore men do and did much of the wealth creating activities resource harvesting infrastructure building the manufacture of products this isnt some unknown privilege its circumstance
dataisbeautiful,removed,i want to go trick or treating in arizona and hawaii
dataisbeautiful,removed,russia is basically hank hill
dataisbeautiful,removed,rdataisscary
dataisbeautiful,removed,seems about right yes
dataisbeautiful,removed,must really suck to be a woman in china
dataisbeautiful,removed,that is literally what he said commuting suicide is not the same as trying to do it
dataisbeautiful,removed,all feminists to china now
dataisbeautiful,removed,oman seems like an omen for men
dataisbeautiful,removed,arent emergency services the ones who are collecting this data
dataisbeautiful,removed,cool
dataisbeautiful,removed,well i suppose determining what problems are worse is a subjective argument and one that will never be won however there are undeniable problems largely exclusive to men in this country that are at best diminished and at worst ignored of the chronically homeless are men divorce courts award mothers custody of the time male suicide is times higher than female suicide of the prison population is male in addition men on average receive longer prison sentences than women who commit comparable crimes though you may disagree there is definitely a case to be made that men may have it harder
dataisbeautiful,removed,so men are more fragile than women take that wsj
dataisbeautiful,removed,rmorbidlybeautiful
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats not the oppression olympics though its just the otherside of the narrative i personally dont care much for complaining about it because nobody gives a fuck and it doesnt matter
dataisbeautiful,removed,holy damn arizona who gives out toblerone
dataisbeautiful,removed,thingsimadeupinmymind
dataisbeautiful,removed,affirmative action for minorities has been in place to various extents since communist parties have socially progressive platforms nobody wants to mention this because its inconvenient for both sides to admit that theres a strong link between communism and the uss racial equality movement
dataisbeautiful,removed,what would i give if i could live out of these waters what would i pay to spend a day warm on the sand betcha on land they understand they dont reprimand their daughters

dataisbeautiful,removed,the blm campaign will slow once the presidential election is over the liberal media is churning out blm articles to get black voters to readview their media while the black voters are looking for blm articles the media outlets can feed them other propaganda to serve their own political cause black voters dont normally follow certain news outlets its all a smoke screen

dataisbeautiful,removed,please include which tools you have used to create the visualization
dataisbeautiful,removed,here come the donald bros telling us how awful muslims arecan feel it coming
dataisbeautiful,removed,that will never happen people have been convinced that muslims are a race and that criticism of islam is racist which pretty much shuts down all rational debate its bizarre that progressives that hate conservative christianity can get behind a religion that is undeniably more misogynistic and homophobic but some people are easily cowed into submission by the threat of being called racist
dataisbeautiful,removed,agreed that all religions should be subject to the same scrutiny media i see doesnt seem at all scared about calling out the church on its bigotry not so much when its the religion of refugees and minorities although in the last year i have seen this start to change
dataisbeautiful,removed,sweden is practically gay the country no surprise here although that bar is going to rocket to the right in the next few decades

dataisbeautiful,removed,canada
dataisbeautiful,removed,saudi arabia is conveniently absent
dataisbeautiful,removed,why is israel not on the list
dataisbeautiful,removed,their choices have an impacted on everyone around them homosexuality since it is true that it does not affect them in the physical sense it does affect them mentally homosexuality is nothing more than desire and urges targeted to the same sex instead of the opposite now you again might say how is that bad again it is nothing more than a sexual desire that has benefits and actually can only cause tons of mental and physical problems since it is nothing more than a rewiring of the mind towards the same sex that still means you or them as an individual do not have to give into those temptations and desires we hold men and women accountable for things still such as pedophilia which again you can argue if the man and child both enjoy the practice of sex with each other than there is no reason at all for you to judge but yet you do why they are not hurting you and so why allow it because if you start allowing men to think it is ok then it will effect the nexts generations and they will start thinking that children are up for grabs this is not debatable thus why its still an issue in most countries most allow homosexuals to live their lives but a lot of countries which like russia i agree with is that there is just no promotion of it you can be gay there just dont try and sell that to anyone else
dataisbeautiful,removed,exclave

dataisbeautiful,removed,i live in reality you cannot choose to be gay you can pretend and lie to yourself and others that you chose to be gay but you obviously dont know what gay means gay is not having sex with the same gender idiot
dataisbeautiful,removed,have you ever met a person their worldview is defined in terms of right and wrong good and evil most behaviors are morally good or morally evil many actions like lying and murder are considered wrong but justifiable in certain circumstances like to protect your child ftfy
dataisbeautiful,removed,except almost all muslims hate homos
dataisbeautiful,removed,yep washingtons coast looks good even years from now
dataisbeautiful,removed,as an armenian this is disheartening
dataisbeautiful,removed,classic homophobia boo this man
dataisbeautiful,removed,if you have no rebuttal for the facts i gave you thats ok but please dont pretend youre somehow being noble for having no response youre a partisan prejudiced bigot but fortunately for you its antitrump and antitrump supporters so youll get a lot of support for people who share you bigotry much the same way that being anti civil rights would have been a popular opinion in the postbellum south im from the country that youll claim to want to move to if your team doesnt win the election dont pretend some sort of superiority nationally its just another element of your bigotry
dataisbeautiful,removed,nope just enlightened btw i thought you were done why are you back but not rebutting anything i said you filthy bigot
dataisbeautiful,removed,lol thats no excuse kenya is just as poor and won a medal
dataisbeautiful,removed,you took the time to type that when you already are smarter and more correct wow thats awesome then bold words im so fucking on the floor laughing at you right now doesnt really matter either way sohave some more lol
dataisbeautiful,removed,no its because armenia is dominantly orthodox christian issues with lesbians are the same considering neither gay or lesbian can produce armenian offspring and to be honest that is a good thing with homosexuality comes degeneracy i prefer my country keep clear of progressive ideologies

dataisbeautiful,removed,i like how its designed to look like a decline
dataisbeautiful,removed,last year i submitted ever since then ive been thinking if there was a better way of representing the data some way thats more intuitive that makes it easier to compare different locations that makes those locations with high or low ranges stand out and that doesnt have the problem of locations with similar climates overlapping a few weeks ago i realized that the solution was to represent both values in the vertical axis and use the horizontal axis for the locations the top of each bar represents the mean temperature of the warmest month while the bottom the mean temperature of the coldest month locations are sorted from left to right by their annual mean temperature tools used excel acrobat reader dc paintnet data obtained manually from the weatherboxes of each locations wikipedia article for locations that lacked mean values i used the average of the highs and the lows its not ideal but its surprisingly accurate
dataisbeautiful,removed,the only reason cleveland is counted twice is because his two terms were not consecutive he is the only president that has had non consecutive terms so i understand why it seems inconsistent
dataisbeautiful,removed,im sure people would have said the same thing when obama was president elect and when bush was president elect and so on and so on nice try though

dataisbeautiful,removed,who upvotes this crap
dataisbeautiful,removed,came here to think this out loud in words on a keyboard good call 👍🏻
dataisbeautiful,removed,data is not beautiful
dataisbeautiful,removed,it would be liberal to reasonably heighten the tariffs in order to support infrastructure and stimulate the society as a whole it would be conservative to lower the tariffs in order to stimulate the economy of the ruling class i think when reflecting on the past its reasonable to use the definitions of today lincoln and washington would be liberals by todays standards they both believed in a strong federal government and using the power of the union to provide better lives for the people
dataisbeautiful,removed,im pleased to see that there is no long consistent band of color on that i prefer that no one party or ideology hold office for too long having the pendulum swing back and fourth keeps things balanced
dataisbeautiful,removed,fell asleep in junior high political science class did we
dataisbeautiful,removed,i believe the question deposited is which one would be liberal and which one would be conservative

dataisbeautiful,removed,ahh i see you have visited me excellent
dataisbeautiful,removed,what does this mean like what does it really mean do sample points cover an even surface area of the planet then is each area sampled every x minutes per day and then all of those samples averaged for a solar year and each year compared thatd be pretty cool i dont think we actually have that information today and we certainly dont have for im not trying to be a crazy climate denier or anything but anything i ever see any chart like this i say hrm i dont know what this data actually means at all
dataisbeautiful,removed,take a look at my op to see the version that i made using a divergent color map let me know what you think now
dataisbeautiful,removed,nobody cares about a misplaced email you fat piece of shit you should be more sympathetic as im sure youve misplaced the salad bar enough times
dataisbeautiful,removed,i much prefer a criminal over a narcissist sociopath who advocates for war crimes and runs a campaign solely on hate at least hillary understands that showing compassion is a good thing even if it might be faked at least hillary understands that respecting international law is a good idea even if she might not personally agree with it
dataisbeautiful,removed,i may not eat a lot of salad but im not fat european standards buddy not merka
dataisbeautiful,removed,she has done some bad shit but trump wants to do even worse shit this is a shitty excuse sorry to break that for you
dataisbeautiful,removed,not a fan of pc stuff but theres always a place for being polite then shut the fuck up
dataisbeautiful,removed,does he yes he wants to bomb innocent muslims just for having blood relations to terrorists hillary at worst has caused the deaths of some innocents due to either carelessness or greed but that is par for the course for politicians with as much influence as she has people fuck up that isnt a good thing but that isnt the end of the world but trump wants to actively kill innocent people not just accidentally kill them out of carelessness not even just killing them out of greed gotta get that oil and trade deals he wants to actively kill innocent people out of hatred towards that demographic there is simply no comparison here none trump is the definition of a fascist and his constant hate rhetoric and disregard for the lives of nonwhites shows it
dataisbeautiful,removed,not commenting directly to either of you but heres a general opinion that might be in the middle ground maybe the perception of privilege is due to seeing identical properties in the majority of people in the most successful groups eg race and then its reinforced by seeing that same property in the less successful groups the trouble with this assumption is its not always true and thats evident in this data for example in the education statistics it seems that the the city of chicago and atlanta public schools metrics show larger performance in the white group than other groups despite the same school system this supports the privilege argument kind of it offers no proof of correlation just some evidence what might be more interesting to note is why people regardless of race in the same economic situation perform differently at the same schools could it be privilege sure but then why do schools like detroit city show no or very little difference from my perspective the privilege argument doesnt fit all the facts but in many cases it seems to furthermore if we combine this data with peoples natural propensity to accept the first hypothesis that fits the apparent facts then youve got a pretty good setup for false assumptionsynthesis everyones looking to reinforce what they already believe i would like to point out that there is one factor that seems to fit more cases than race money if you pick through the data points you can see where demographics are in the specific cities and the housingland values school districts just join these areas directly and possibly intentionally house value sites like housevalues or zoopla are simple ways to start looking into this if you want to see for yourself one final thought people like to be on teams from my experience and most people choose those teams based on common factors be it religion skincolor whatever else but money isnt something you can always identify easily its also something you cant really see if people want to hide it certainly not as clearly as something like race this makes teaming up against it more difficult and i wonder if the effortbar might just be enough to encourage people to accept a margin of error in their theories just some thoughts

dataisbeautiful,removed,sourced from huffpoll jesus christ hahahah mods please
dataisbeautiful,removed,ive never seen him generalize then youve never looked at a trump speech ive never seen him talk down to blacks youre delusional
dataisbeautiful,removed,the cinnamon toast crunch
dataisbeautiful,removed,you certainly have a point there but the only way to fix that is to contact rthedonald s mods sometimes the stuff they say can get out of hand but i dont think doing an equally childish outlash is the way to go here
dataisbeautiful,removed,dont like illegal aliens criminals or muslims i dont care what you like you claimed he doesnt generalize people i provided a link proving that he does is the only choice unless your ok with corruption trump is about as corrupt as you can get he openly claims ownership of companies that he has no financial relation to and he openly brags about scamming people out of money love america so your solution is to elect a fascist who wants to commit war crimes which would weaken our international relations not to mention that our economy would tank if immigration was cut down to the levels trump wants there is nothing good for america if trump is elected im tired of seeing american generosity being taken advantage of around the world this doesnt even deserve a response just lol our leaders are losers right our leaders are losers that is why we are the worlds leading economic political and military pwoer yup stop blindly eating up trumps rhetoric thanks
dataisbeautiful,removed,and this is why women shouldnt vote picking a president based on vagina tingles
dataisbeautiful,removed,just because bernie might poll better than hillary against trump doesnt necessitate that hillary poll below trump both those things can be mathematically true not commenting on whether they are or not no idea what the data looks like but id have a healthy skepticism of any such polls

dataisbeautiful,removed,thank god you cant vote maybe you can go cast another vote for male model prime minister of the year what a joke the politics of your country is
dataisbeautiful,removed,dont read too much into graphs youll become like one of the people on rbitcoinmarkets
dataisbeautiful,removed,what are you talking about hillary flip flops more than any candidate ive ever heard of other than trump
dataisbeautiful,removed,those numbers are bs trump is doing better than hillary
dataisbeautiful,removed,politifact is owned by the tampa bay times which has endorsed and donated significantly to hillarys campaign they also consistently misrepresent or misinterpret quotes to further an anticonservative narrative which several posts over the past few months have already identified theyre nothing more than propaganda and havent been credible for years
dataisbeautiful,removed,neither polls were projecting losses for trump all through the primaries nate silver in particular afterward they admitted manipulating and lying about the real numbers which were predicting trump victories so polls might be bs randomly this election when done by a liberal group the annoying corollary to that is i dont see conservatives publishing polls bad for trump so objectivity is hosed on both sides and media has done nothing this election if not show that their biases make it into all of their election coverage
dataisbeautiful,removed,heres the thing charisma decides who becomes president out of the last elections charisma has been the decisive factor nothing else seems to matter given two candidates if one of them is a stiff the other one wins think about it mitt vs obama mccain vs obama kerry vs bush keep going back in time and keep doing this which of the two candidates was the stiff the other one won now can you really say that trump is the stiff and that he has less charisma than clinton i have no love for trump and even i can see that clintons the stiff this year so either the tradition of the candidate with the most charisma wins is about to come to an end after a streak not too likely or trump is going to defy those numbers of yours
dataisbeautiful,removed,i find him repulsive too in fact its hard to think of a better word to describe trump its all about showmanship clinton doesnt seem to have any qualifications yes showmanship not really
dataisbeautiful,removed,during the first republican debate i being from the south visited some people living in the north who were playing a drinking game while watching i tried to explain to them that trump really could be the nominee because the people where im from really are just that ignorant and would buy into a reality tv president whos clearly a bigot but they didnt believe me wish i was wrong
dataisbeautiful,removed,yes added
dataisbeautiful,removed,haha come try it retard
dataisbeautiful,removed,an independent company that thinks hillary is the best candidate also wants to advocate for her in a sea of negativity im fucking shocked let me know when she buys politifact maybe then youll have a point

dataisbeautiful,removed,whats better than democracy do you think a group of powerhungry politicians are going to be concerned about the wellbeing of the populace do you the unelected leader of north korea is concerned about the people he governs would taking away our right to vote make us more involved in politics the answers to these questions should be obvious the problem is that we dont have enough democracy in america not that we have too much we should be able to vote on every law before its put into place with the only exception being a constitution that protects the civil rights of all americans including minorities from the whims of a reactionary public that may wish to take them away
dataisbeautiful,removed,they dont buy super delegates keyword here
dataisbeautiful,removed,its interesting that supposedly liberal redditors envy him so much he also said that socialism is a philosophy of failure the creed of ignorance and the gospel of envy its inherent virtue is the equal sharing of misery

dataisbeautiful,removed,there is a difference between an unqualified yes and a qualified yes that is almost certainly what these answers mean some issues when i took the quiz were a hard yes or no and some were qualified i really dont know why everyone is obsessing over the qualified answers
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats dumb
dataisbeautiful,removed,all trump said in his ama was honestly i think nasa is wonderful america has always led the world in space exploration thats not a statement of intent to do anything its just a vague positive nod in their direction its possible that hes made policy statements elsewhere but i didnt find them in either of those two sources
dataisbeautiful,removed,but bernie sanders being a turncoat scam artist is just fine have fun waiting in that food line communist scum arent bernie supporters against the establishment trump is as against the establishment as it gets bernie however is a warbacking career politician and youd think he would bring any sort of change lol

dataisbeautiful,removed,its a leftover from the cold war era where everything roughly close to socialism is instantly hated thats an interesting point but the argument could have gone the other way i always thought that the welfare system of west germany was pretty well developed because of the competition next door like you wouldnt want people to think that with capitalism you were worth off than the sisters and brothers behind the curtain and a few years after the gdr was no more there was this huge reform that put a lot more pressure on people and cut some of the benefits agenda hartz

dataisbeautiful,removed,what bunch of bullshit is that exactly
dataisbeautiful,removed,yup
dataisbeautiful,removed,what in that model doesnt apply to a preindustrial economy my point with that link was precisely to show how the key concepts in modern economics are not particular to industrial societies utility marginalism comparative advantage etc still applies even if youre trying to analyse some tribe lost in the middle of the jungle the ops concept of productivity applies to a tshirt factory just as much as to ancient agriculture
dataisbeautiful,removed,not without a shirt industry you cant you develop a new weave technique or instrument you improve the textile source etc you dont a need a factory to improve the productivity in shirt production and thats besides the point youre getting to hung up in a example that was already silly to begin with a shirt industry is a waste wasteful and better are not mutually exclusives you can be betteroff and still be inefficient

dataisbeautiful,removed,this particular case is a bad one but in general i dont think the aggregate score of user ratings on imdb are the worst i find that after most movies have been reviewed by enough people and have been out long enough you can use the imdb rating as a decent way to gauge a film i also tend to compare the aggregate imdb and rt scores as that gives a more information for how it was received now that said looking at these particular imdb ratings is useless and ridiculous for gauging the film itself first off the film officially comes out tomorrow second it hasnt been reviewed by enough people third this film is majorly controversial im sure this film is neither a or a male vs female rating and i highly suspect that in time it will be between a and a
dataisbeautiful,removed,ghostbusters has positive female representation in sigourney weaver and janine the secretary both of them are intelligent independent women with very little sex appeal pandering going on in the new ghostbusters there is zero positive male representation the male secretary is a dumb bimbo whose main character trait is sex appeal ghostbusters also had a great black character with ernie hudson he was not portrayed as a racial stereotype in any way he was just a normal hard working honest new yorker and by far the easiest character for the audience to relate to contrast with the black character in the new ghostbusters she is a walking racial stereotype traditional loud crass angry black woman constantly shouting aw hellll nawwww and other such racially insensitive banalities tell me again how the new ghostbusters is more progressive

dataisbeautiful,removed,im actually able to pinpoint the suburb i live in with this
dataisbeautiful,removed,no it isnt have you ever been to manhattan or any of the outer boroughs they all have a unique character that combines to make the greatest city on earth there isnt any question about that many people cant make it here and that doesnt take a thing away from the city sf is great but isnt even a shadow of nyc manhattan isnt even that populated compared to brooklynqueens but yeah staten island kinda sucks we just consider them a part of nj though
dataisbeautiful,removed,i mean you guys have like and a half seasons who cares what you think bay area is full of boring stuck up people at least we are interesting stuck up people i dont need to prove a thing nobody even talks about sf in regards to being the greatest city in the world not to mention nobody can even afford to live near sf

dataisbeautiful,removed,its so strange the governments just dont seem to get it if the governments stopped accepting mass numbers of immigrants and refugees the people wouldnt be looking to the right for an end to the mass inflow these supposed democracies need to start listening to their peoples voices
dataisbeautiful,removed,whats also misleading is the date of the latest samples which very importantly range from today to years before parisbrussels attacks in the words of the prime minister of italy paris attacks changes everything the few data showing data demonstrate a near doubling of support for rightwing parties i think europe is in for a rude awakening
dataisbeautiful,removed,data is from preparis attacks
dataisbeautiful,removed,because the data was taken before the paris brussels attacks in the words of the italian prime minister paris changes everything

dataisbeautiful,removed,here is the intro the visualizations
dataisbeautiful,removed,you should do regressions with poverty and racial proportions as predictors for violent crime then you should be able to show that race does not improve the prediction of violence once poverty is in the model
dataisbeautiful,removed,sounds like xenophobia to me
dataisbeautiful,removed,took a second to figure out the sarcasm here
dataisbeautiful,removed,sounds like someone didnt like being called out as a xenophobe
dataisbeautiful,removed,wait isnt the european parliament elected and then the executive is chosen by the elected parliament
dataisbeautiful,removed,didnt it you must have gotten lost in the stream let me do it now aversion and avoidance of the foreign is the core of xenophobia maybe you should make a more intelligent post which would involve first not denying xenophobia accept that youre a xenophobe then lets go from there
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah english isnt my native language my bad ue stands for union européenne in french but you dont know that neither
dataisbeautiful,removed,i find it funny that xenophobes take such a personal interest in me please dont step on the flowers if you stalk my house as well
dataisbeautiful,removed,why cant you just reply with facts and opinions but always have to add insult to your posts classic trumpee
dataisbeautiful,removed,and they are never going to trigger brexit because it means scotland and northern ireland leave aka the death of the united kingdom the financial power moves to frankfurt london declines theyll just keep stringing along the idiots who voted for their own impoverishment and mediocrity
dataisbeautiful,removed,this data is trash when you realize the whole thing is skewed because strongly in favor of is or more so disregarding the huge majority of opinions this is what the most extreme of supports think
dataisbeautiful,removed,yup thats just islam for you
dataisbeautiful,removed,its not a coincidence that the frenchies are considered the rats of europe they are dirty and impulsive like that
dataisbeautiful,removed,hitler would disagree with you

dataisbeautiful,removed,russia
dataisbeautiful,removed,but norway is very meritocratic seems like in those countries youd probably have a much lower ceiling is my point if someone can come up with a brilliant idea i think they have every right to make millions upon millions pretty sure when they say inherited wealth in that one study they mean that if your parents make youre simply inheriting a better future not actual cash money meaning that when it says that it doesnt exactly mean theyve been given everything they still have to go to school and hold down a job like everyone else they just inherited an easier time
dataisbeautiful,removed,matinee normally tulsaok
dataisbeautiful,removed,i know exactly what national healthcare means maybe you mean universal healthcare
dataisbeautiful,removed,pigmentation rates too an earlier thread pointed out that maine was the whitest state
dataisbeautiful,removed,demographics the correlation is remarkable african american literacy is much lower than white literacy in the southern usa same goes for std rates and a number of statistics that people use to make fun of the south most of the time those people fail to realize theyre actually mocking black americans
dataisbeautiful,removed,louisiana mississippi and georgia of the red or most populated prison states are the most populated with african americans p
dataisbeautiful,removed,population of blacks actually looks exactly the same
dataisbeautiful,removed,and african american population
dataisbeautiful,removed,and political incorrect if you put it side by side with minority rates they would look exactly the same im prepared for downvotes
dataisbeautiful,removed,i can think of another demographic map that would look exactly the same too
dataisbeautiful,removed,sadly if you put a map of the percent of black people in a given stat the image is nearly identical
dataisbeautiful,removed,so basically the blacker a state is the higher its incarceration rate
dataisbeautiful,removed,i think hispanics are twice as likely to be illiterate than blacks but blacks make up way higher percentages of those incarcerated so even if there is a correlation it is not very strong
dataisbeautiful,removed,weird it completely mimics the race demographics for black people but noo all those crimes they are caught doing are because racism
dataisbeautiful,removed,also the blackest state in the us
dataisbeautiful,removed,yes and black people are more likely to be in poverty poverty doesnt cause crime poverty and crime are both the effects of having a shitty culture that encourages crime blaming the poverty monster is not an effective argument blacks in the us are only more likely to be in poverty than whites but commit homicide at the rate that whites do and heres the most startling thing to point out
dataisbeautiful,removed,there are alot of blacks
dataisbeautiful,removed,giulia salemi and dayane mello uncensored
dataisbeautiful,removed,striking similarities
dataisbeautiful,removed,well playing into the stereotype of black people are dangerous by riots and looting is a sure fire way for nothing to change for the better

dataisbeautiful,removed,httpwwwcensusscopeorgusmapnhblackhtml huh
dataisbeautiful,removed,hey i bet its the same group that gets longer sentences for the same crimes
dataisbeautiful,removed,i expect is has more to do with how much of the population per is black
dataisbeautiful,removed,texas actually does pretty well once one accounts for the fact its majority black and hispanic unlike any other state save new mexico which is weirder because it has a large blob of totally americanized hispanics tracing back to the
dataisbeautiful,removed,west virginia
dataisbeautiful,removed,believe it or not the map with the highest correlation is the one that shows states with the
dataisbeautiful,removed,i stopped reading at you liberals kindly grow the fuck up and realize that the majority of people are neither conservative nor liberal but a smattering across the spectrum on a wide variety of issues not everything is black and white but there are shades of grey and even gasp colors d
dataisbeautiful,removed,but bejewelled has unique shapes for each colour
dataisbeautiful,removed,florida new mexico and arkansas are geographical anomalies
dataisbeautiful,removed,louisiana is filled with black thugs what do you expect the streets are literally unsafe to walk on hell just look at what all the cameras catch mississippi is almost as bad same reason i suppose its the poverty how do you explain all the rapes though lol one of these days people are just going to have to admit black people are just far more criminal
dataisbeautiful,removed,the south is also the black belt it has of americas african american population what i dont get about most liberals is that they shit on the south all the time but they dont realize that theyre unknowingly condemning americas blackest region
dataisbeautiful,removed,blacks are searched at a higher rate because they are arrested for other crimes just for once in your life try to think a little bit there is no such phenomenon of racist police searching peaceful pot smokers just for being black and it is not true that the usage rates are the same
dataisbeautiful,removed,annnnnd what percentage of this map is black males about of the population im going to guess over of incarcerated males fuck black people just because they clog our court system and jails doesnt mean systematic racism exists systematic stupidity is whats rampant in black communities
dataisbeautiful,removed,every major statistic comes from racial difference
dataisbeautiful,removed,now do a sidebyside comparison with a map of states by african american population
dataisbeautiful,removed,man you people really are desperate to avoid reality arent you so much energy you spend on these mental gymnastics
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,i wonder why
dataisbeautiful,removed,id like to see the racially dependent incarceration charts and political alignment of each state alongside this
dataisbeautiful,removed,well at least we can agree on the fact that we are both definitely white d
dataisbeautiful,removed,map of nonhispanic white the real americans
dataisbeautiful,removed,states that underincarcerate like california and washington and the states that overincarcerate like oklahoma and mississippi this is an extremely loaded suggestion you would first have to prove that both states face the same rate and types of crime before being able to claim that x state either over or under incarcerates
dataisbeautiful,removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
dataisbeautiful,removed,put it next to a map that shows black population if you want to see something really interesting
dataisbeautiful,removed,or from drugs coming in from the southern border
dataisbeautiful,removed,love how you immediately dismiss dissenting opinion as white supremacists classic
dataisbeautiful,removed,now compare it to black populations and observe an amazing and unexpected coincidence
dataisbeautiful,removed,actually your statistics are pure bullshit one small sample tx graduation rate far above the national average and light years ahead of chicago ny and well ahead of mot of the leberal enclaves
dataisbeautiful,removed,i respect your point but black has nothing to do with any of this can we not just agree that our criminal justice system is in dire need of reprieve
dataisbeautiful,removed,well would u look at that it seems the closer you get to mexico the more criminals are found
dataisbeautiful,removed,maybe but there is also
dataisbeautiful,removed,they should euthanize instead
dataisbeautiful,removed,i never said anything about clinton what makes you think i support her i supported sanders entirely because im not a fucking retard
dataisbeautiful,removed,african american population by state
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats pretty racist
dataisbeautiful,removed,itt upper class white liberals really fucking hate minorities at least reddit is showing its true colors
dataisbeautiful,removed,this comment is a great example of liberal tolerance
dataisbeautiful,removed,you sound so triggered
dataisbeautiful,removed,someone from texas must have stolen your wife for you to be so salty lmfao
dataisbeautiful,removed,marijuana possession doesnt drive any significant portion of our criminal justice system very few people in prison are there for drug offenses about and its not even clear from those statistics that the people in jail for drugs arent also violent criminals a lot of drug dealers use violence for example even if theyre not convicted for it racial demographics african american are of certain crimes such as homicide than poverty rates
dataisbeautiful,removed,httpfivethirtyeightcomfeaturesarewhiterepublicansmoreracistthanwhitedemocrats democrats are just a tiny bit less racist than republicans like literally its almost too close to call
dataisbeautiful,removed,how how can you not look at what the black people in poverty buy and not say it isnt a little fucking ridiculous im all for the left side view on how we should handle the country but to see some dude that cant even afford to eat wearing brand new shoes and a new watch and replace them every months and not get angry is insane to me i care about people that cant afford to eat ive seen a white kid do the same thing one of the white kids that grows up thinking hes black spent every dime he had on new watches shoes hats and drugs least the kid wasnt on welfare doing it though
dataisbeautiful,removed,locking them for minor drug offenses is the last holdout of prewar southern values guess we hate our own brothers in battle too then because we sure as hell lock them up as well
dataisbeautiful,removed,northern louisiana of course just a bunch of racist whit assholes up there not much better down here tbh just more culturally diverse so you dont encounter them as much
dataisbeautiful,removed,any
dataisbeautiful,removed,sadest part is there wasnt even more than a few paragraphs of shit you had to read to realize this isnt exactly a top priority
dataisbeautiful,removed,black people are very religious
dataisbeautiful,removed,looks identical to this map
dataisbeautiful,removed,yeahive seen him post the same thing times todayand get like upvotes on every single one and doesnt argue with anyone when people call him out on why its a stupid study to copy and paste its likehes a bot or just something not human why is reddit so easy to manipulate
dataisbeautiful,removed,try a map of black population
dataisbeautiful,removed,not its racial composition youre telling me a state run by asians and south africans wiouldnt be the master state
dataisbeautiful,removed,people are talking about the incarceration rates being so high in some states because of strict enforcement of laws and assholes cops i see a pattern that many people on reddit refuse to state political correctness bs
dataisbeautiful,removed,its probably because leftwing people being not racist understand that the success of a region depends on the policies it adopts not its racial composition how come vermont has some of the most lax gun laws in the country yet has the single lowest homicide rate in the country how come new hampshire is generally to the right yet also one of the safest and best to live in states you honestly dont think who lives somewhere affects what the place is like
dataisbeautiful,removed,i bet if you put that side by side with a map of colored population rates they would look exactly the same and i dont mean this in a colored people do more crime i mean it in a the south is more discriminatory than other places sort of way
dataisbeautiful,removed,my comments are ghosting ive noticed it elsewhere too i think we have a glitch ground control
dataisbeautiful,removed,wow its almost as if a higher density of blacks leads to higher incarceration rate surely its racism making criminals commit crimes
dataisbeautiful,removed,similar to what a temperature map would look like with the exception of alaska and hawaii low crime rateincareration rate of hawaii is understandable because the heavy influence asian culture has on hawaii asian culture lower crime rates
dataisbeautiful,removed,i bet if you looked at a racial profile map of percentage blacks it would look similar blm
dataisbeautiful,removed,fuck the literacy rates put that side by side with of blacks in each state
dataisbeautiful,removed,because of eternal summer irrigation and cheap illegal weather

dataisbeautiful,removed,i feel like alabamas is so high because everyone is fucking their sisters
dataisbeautiful,removed,no correlation here
dataisbeautiful,removed,i bet if you put that side by side with percent blacks they would look exactly the same
dataisbeautiful,removed,or a map of black population
dataisbeautiful,removed,now look at a map of black population by state and you can see that it is almost the same map
dataisbeautiful,removed,more black people
dataisbeautiful,removed,do you really fucking believe what is coming out of your mouth
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats because as everyone knows germans are terrible at finishing races

dataisbeautiful,removed,more killed in a month in one city than by the police in the whole country and not a peep from the blm folks
dataisbeautiful,removed,daaaaamn her vaginas gotta look like a wet blanket
dataisbeautiful,removed,no gun control come on now lets not spread lies there are gun control laws in place but they are not as strict as chicagos laws you still need to do a background check to buy a gun in indiana at gun stores and gun shows private sales do not require a background check but its illegal to sell to a criminal or to a person from out of state those are some pretty normal gun control laws for most states
dataisbeautiful,removed,wait wait hold up are you telling me blacks on chicago cant have a sense of responsibility or community once again i am disappointed
dataisbeautiful,removed,chicago alone has more dead due to black on black violence than blacks killed by police through out the nation
dataisbeautiful,removed,they breed faster than they can kill themselves off one gang banger thug probably has about kids be the time he gets smoked
dataisbeautiful,removed,the lower class cant seem to figure out how condoms work
dataisbeautiful,removed,yep and its mostly black people killing other black peoplea fact that has been well proven i dont know its because they see so much killing that they are immune to being affected by it or is it all the drugs and guns a great combination that results in so much violence
dataisbeautiful,removed,if i would have known they would be this much trouble i would have picked my own cotton george washington
dataisbeautiful,removed,the current muslim plan for the west
dataisbeautiful,removed,so youre saying mixing dirty water with clean water would make the dirty water less dirty
dataisbeautiful,removed,summertime is the killing season its hot out this bitch thats a good enough reason much more poetic lol
dataisbeautiful,removed,lots of babies are born every year this is the root of of our problems in america the undesirable elements of society reproduce fast as fuck compared to the rest of society it doesnt help that government is giving them a financial incentive to do so
dataisbeautiful,removed,its interesting that the violence is almost exclusively committed by nonwhites and yet the most births are also from nonwhites us crackers need to step up our game it sounds like
dataisbeautiful,removed,no shit nyc has lower violent crime than other cities they shipped all their criminals to new jersey fucking genius plan really i wish we could take all of our crime and move it literally one mile to the other side of a river and pretend it doesnt exist
dataisbeautiful,removed,and yet you havent even presented one
dataisbeautiful,removed,thank you black liberals for the slaughter its a shame white conservatives have to save you from your own fuck ups once again

dataisbeautiful,removed,my favorites gone maple brown sugar life
dataisbeautiful,removed,lol what a uneducated turd no where do you even mention about european lives in your comment russian was in the war longer than the americans they fought harder than the americans more russians died than american uk germany italy combined you need to read some history books if you think america is the saviour of the planet the only thing america did during was instead of trying to fight the nazis they black mailed the uk into giving them all its gold and forced the uk to buy food and supplies at extortionate rate even tho the uk was already being bombed and barely holding on additionally where do you think the nuclear bombs plans were intitaly developed the uk uk gave america everything in exchange for tanks and food when the war was coming to a end the american came in and stole the victory
dataisbeautiful,removed,what is the government people thats what the government is people the church is also composed of people your attempt to reconcile the contradictions in the bible is pathetic like all other attempts you sick deluded people make i know because i did the same thing for over half my life tell you what asshole youre a member of the church so that instruction to give to him that asks of you applies to you i am asking you to give me all of the money that you own every cent of it now be a good christian and pm me to make arrangements to send me every dollar and penny you own all of it if not then fuck off retard
dataisbeautiful,removed,most stupid poll ive ever seen fuck yourself no doubt has lost most people its tragic how you try to keep it a secret the nordic countries lost a lot of lives because of the nazi invasion stop trying to make them look better fuck you op
dataisbeautiful,removed,jokes about the south can be funny mean insulting comments seeking only to be a dick are not it was funny it wasnt mean ffs it was a joke about tech and aol god damn you are one whiny fucking bitch i notice you have a lot of struggle understanding things and require constant explanation then you get angry at how slow you are and try to cut much smarter people down by yelling that theyre stupid i notice youre quite sensitive and when someone says a joke is funny that you didnt like you insult them by calling them a dick and a knobhead because you thought i wrote the joke because youre an illiterate fucking moron its ok for you to insult people though because youre an incredibly hypocritical piece of shit also when someone has to claim how intelligent they are its almost never true clearly so ive got you beat on both counts i know a joke from an insult and i can grasp simple concepts without a repeated spoonfeeding bumbling simpleton i guess if i was that painfully dense id be pretty mad at everything and ready to insult it jokes are often insulting were you born yesterday my god ive never seen someone get so bent out of shape over a harmless crack you are seriously an obnoxious cunt and your post history proves what an unbelievable hypocrite you are you are the absolute worst kind of human filth that exists you are fucking trash
dataisbeautiful,removed,and andersonville was used to punish the north for winning elsewhere
dataisbeautiful,removed,not to mention the fact that if they dont work in a hospital they have to pay their staff out of their own pocket that eats up a huge portion of their earnings i imagine the uk has a similar system but dont know for certain
dataisbeautiful,removed,holy shit cant tell if this is supposed to be some dark joke or just provoking a reaction because your whole history is spattered with crazy shit wish i could shake hands with the doctor that gave you the full vax schedule maybe it does cause autism afterall
dataisbeautiful,removed,its a novel hypothesis but it makes some assumptions i think word from alqaeda would get out that their leader was dead especially if they saw that the us was puppeteering him plus the political backlash from pakistan after the raid couldnt have been fabricated and it was quite obvious that they had been sheltering him it seems more likely that bin laden was still alive and the us simply used that to their advantage

dataisbeautiful,removed,so i guess this is the perfect instance in which to use the cliche in soviet russia vodka drinks you
dataisbeautiful,removed,also why the fuck so many goats
dataisbeautiful,removed,why former soviet states have less men than women less fewer ftfy
dataisbeautiful,removed,use fewer if youre referring to people or things in the plural eg houses newspapers dogs students children for example fewer students are opting to study sciencerelated subjects use less when youre referring to something that cant be counted or doesnt have a plural eg money air time music rain for example its a better job but they pay you less money or people want to spend less time in traffic jams
dataisbeautiful,removed,i like how the original article has a grammatically correct title and you actually took extra effort to change fewer to less and make it sound like shit
dataisbeautiful,removed,im searching for data on how many times less is misused in the place of fewer can you help me op
dataisbeautiful,removed,a post where data is saddening
dataisbeautiful,removed,why former soviet states have less fewer men than women ftfy
dataisbeautiful,removed,what action am i supposed to take here in the united states to help men in russia better yet tell me when any mens group ever was successful in getting a major issue for men addressed without the use of or threat of armed conflict no man ever got a right without using a gun and if that mens issue conflicts or competes against a womens issue then even guns wont be enough im fine with how the world is its fucked up but i understand it if you understand how things work you can use that to your advantage why would i fix things why would i change how things work so that others can gain an advantage over me if people want to believe they are victims then that works in my favor because the moment you declare yourself a victim is the moment you lose all power to control your destiny the victim is an object to declare oneself a victim is to objectify oneself an object is acted upon by a subject subjects are the ones who do things objects are the ones who have things happen to them are you understanding me women will always be objects and victims so long as they blame everyone else for their problems when women say its sexist that there arent more women in stem they are blaming schools and government and society for somehow not encouraging more girls to go into stem what they should say is hey girls go into stem and youll make more money and have more power over your lives or maybe the feminists could just shut the fuck up and stop trying to tell everyone how to live their lives why cant women choose not to be an engineer whats wrong with doing something they actually enjoy rather than something that takes a lot of time and doesnt allow much time for family or other activities but i digress i am just a man after all sorry if you feel like ive raped you with these comments maybe someday the feminists will get a law passed to prevent men from reading and writing and going to school or even owning computers then all you cunts can have the entire fucking internet as your own personal echo chamber

dataisbeautiful,removed,the car should a act in the defense of its passengers not driving into walls b obey the law when possible no sudden swirving a predictable path is best for everyone including other driverless cars c engage all available safety mechanisms hazard lights horn and possibly engaging safety bags early to brace for impact more than likely if all of these were followed some of those pedestrian deaths could be avoided
dataisbeautiful,removed,id say thats being pretty generous to the usa id think they would be closer to the bottom
dataisbeautiful,removed,if you see a driverless car run run for your life

dataisbeautiful,removed,what i wonder is if they asked both question of all participants i think it would be more interesting to build a square chart like the one on howmuchnet but make it have axis xaxis is the scale for hillary and yaxis is the scale for trump to identify how large the cohort is that really dislikes both
dataisbeautiful,removed,huh the southern us states have the highest black populations per capita you think theres a correlation

dataisbeautiful,removed,a legal framework that holds the denial of climate change people will have to be rescued from their rooftops i agree to think that florida went for trump in turn scott pruitt to lead the epa they voted for their coast to be consumed by the ocean its entirely possible that the difference in climate action resulting from trumps election even if its only years considering the uss share of global emissions will have serious economic impacts on florida it will probably lead to worsened conditions ie hurricanes that kill numerous floridian trump voters or their children or grandchildren etc

dataisbeautiful,removed,people in east germany are sane they see what has happened to west germany and they dont want it who are you to tell those people they must change their way of life and who are you to tell them they must accept foreigners that hate them into their neighbourhoods where their children live western germans are the most insane people ive ever talked to completely removed from the reality of what is happening in germany and europe in general
dataisbeautiful,removed,you know all you need to when the muslim colonists that have flooded into germany and europe are called refugees the vast majority of them as in basically all of them arent even from remotely war torn places let alone directly impacted by war the vast majority of them are men they immediately loose their legal and practical claim that they are refugees when they do not apply for refuge in the first safe place which is no where near europe ask yourself this question why didnt they go to and why didnt places like saudi arabia help the poor refugees you are being conned people the vastly male colonists will call on muslim women to have muslim children to overwhelm european culture and society just they very same way that they said they would so often over the years you are being played a bunch of fools that are throwing open the gates to the very enemies that overtly state that they are going to overtake your land and society yet when they promise you they mean no harm you believe them and let them in to your midst its pathetic and sad and selfdestruction of europe and civilized society
dataisbeautiful,removed,only a handful of people attended the demonstration but their shouting put a painful public spotlight at the continuing divisions within germany many eastern germans feel left behind and excluded from the economic prosperity in the west but some western germans have accused their eastern neighbors of complaining without being willing to embrace change wrong the protestors just hate immigrants the protest had literally nothing to do with the economic situation in eastern germany because even those retards know that western germany pumped ungodly amounts of economic aid and solidaritätszuschläge into the east
dataisbeautiful,removed,wow the only important trinkt i take from this post is that research js harder than it seems please note germany has been reunited almost on the day years ago
dataisbeautiful,removed,looks like there is one smart guy in this thread youre correct this is being forced upon us here and so many people are against it but the media is owned by people that want this to happen to us they tell lies they say well make it we wont we are being replaced slowly even the muslims that dont do any harm dont do any good and will always vote for lefty parties that go against the interests of us native europeans when they get a majority in the country what is stopping them from voting for shariah law other than civil war

dataisbeautiful,removed,it would not be fair if california completely shat on everyone elses vote just because they cant stop fucking like rabbits and inviting immigrants in to pad their numbers
dataisbeautiful,removed,i recall someone stating that if we used the wyoming rule were in effect where house apportionment is proportional to whichever state only gets one house rep such that ca would get an additional house seats and the same number of ec voters that no candidate would have received a majority of the ec and trump would still have won in the house chambers but dont quote me on that upostmodest
dataisbeautiful,removed,hooters check out silken there

dataisbeautiful,removed,its easy to understand you dont even need a map for it check it out ignorantass people voted for trump knowledgable people voted for hillary and undecided people that couldve voted for hillary voted for someone else or voted for trump because they like his hair over hillarys or something
dataisbeautiful,removed,aka the land of the densely populated educated people and the land of sparse morons there are more people in the clinton archipelago than in trumpland

dataisbeautiful,removed,yes i absolutely think we should get rid of the senate okay you are done with reddit for the day that level of stupidity may be contagious

dataisbeautiful,removed,blacks mexicans and liberals they dont even belong here to begin with
dataisbeautiful,removed,of murder part
dataisbeautiful,removed,salt is real
dataisbeautiful,removed,by the way if the tech sector is white how come mexicans arent ruining it as far as i know silicon valley is as liberal as it gets so whats going on maybe the whites in the tech sector simply stopped complaining about race and studied harder to get better jobs maybe maybe theyre racists isnt that an easier solution that should be true of any major city anywhere in the world actually uh no the world did just fine for thousands of years without this problem i spent my time learning english to the highest level of proficiency not spanish which i speak at about a second grade level if anything because a country isnt defined by its language yes it absolutely is a nation is a collection of people based on a shared culture nationstates are states which embody this national culture if a state doesnt reflect its nationhood the state will be dissolved look at the middle east africa former yugoslavia etc to see this in action in no country is diversity a good thing it always leads to conflict and the dissolution of the state youre obviously a globalistcultural marxist not the cause for mexicos poverty either mexicos poverty is caused by the fact its a corrupt failed state which happens to countries with low iq distribution you can see this across the world with africa and middle east having the lowest iqs and thus failed civilizations its happening in the united states too which is seeing a decline in our average iq which is why were seeing a rise in state power and corruption there is a minimum iq necessary for representative democracy and self rule one way to become more competitive is by working harder and learning more stuff including more languages or we could just deport all the illegals and dominate the culture again which do you think is an easier solution to most i should not have to feel like a immigrant in the place where i was born if you say tough shit we say trump you sound exactly like some foreign invader telling the natives that in order to succeed they now have to learn the language of the conqueror complete with a little pat on the head youre in for a big surprise i too live in a place where there are a lot of immigrants try being a white minority for a whole new level of fucked no special treatment no affirmative action i have a degree i have economically viable skills youre telling me unless i assimilate into a culture that isnt mine in the united states that i am not valuable my family has been here for hundreds of years this is my home you think im just going to roll over youre in for a massive fight that will come to bloodshed white people are not giving up this country that we fought for for generations you may believe im uneducated but i spend the majority of my time reading and thinking and im telling you its going to be very bad if the white people in this country believe that they are being replaced by some new multicultural paradise trump the beginning not the end history has not stopped there is much more to write and it will likely be more of the same culture religion and resources why humans go to war you think thats over there is literally no country in human history that has survived cultural ethnic or religious groups living in close proximity within the bounds of statehood without conflict and eventual dissolution america already has one minority the blacks which have been the single largest source of social strife since the founding the other minority the natives have basically been exterminated this is the way of humans and you want to put more minorities here or even more want to make whites the minority read your history
dataisbeautiful,removed,all i know is the statistics that come out going from no rapes to most in europe but thats less the point demographics dont need rape or whatever else there are like ninety million people in sweden im just predicting they will be a major portion of the population in years the saddest thing is they wont vote for more liberal ideas they will vote your country into a hellhole like the one they left because for some reason they keep doing it if they dont ill be pleasantly surprised
dataisbeautiful,removed,scandinavia fuck no were doing great keep the hell away from us belgium yeah i suppose we might as well were barely a real country as it is

dataisbeautiful,removed,he is born blind and lives in a nursery chamber and his mother comes often to nurse him when she isnt there he is fed feces by nonreproductive females he grows strong on shit and within a month is ready for work and solid food he leaves the nursery chamber and navigates with the small hairs of his body and joins the tunnel workers now come days of digging and with his buck teeth and clawed feet he scrapes and kicks dirt to another tunnel worker who does the same and on and on in a chain of workers all the way to the tunnel entrance where the dirt is kicked up and out into the irrevocable beyond he loves his work he loves digging new tunnels extending his eusocial communitys own warrens and he loves the feel of dirt on his buck teeth and feet he loves too the finding of a tuber in the wall for this is the food they live on one goodsized tuber being enough to feed their entire underground community of individuals for a few days and he rips the tuber from the wall and carries it to the feeding chamber and this is the founding principal of their society that all food must be shared but one day in some spasm of selfishness or disregard for his fellows he finds a tuber in the wall and tells no one of it and he hides it and from time to time returns to it and takes a bite he is discovered and shamed and demoted and now he lives in a small chamber with two other rulebreakers they are fed often and fattened and soon their time will come they do not speak to each other finding comfort in silence not wishing to relive their own sins and all three feel a sense of anomie of alienation and they wish for a way back to feel again that sense of belonging of having a purpose beyond this relentless feeding the rainy season arrives and his time has come and he leaves the small room and waddles to the main entrance he can smell the rain and he can feel the wet dirt beneath his feet and he turns around and sticks his fat ass in that hole and seals it up and prevents the flooding of their tunnels if only that were the entirety of his role if only that was all they required of his fat ass for with the rainy season comes the predators snakes and birds and more who scratch and bite his ass and seek a way in but he is a fat naked mole rat and he feels no pain and he holds his ass firm and refuses them entry and when they depart he is hailed as a hero his ass may be covered in bites and scratches but he has redeemed myself

dataisbeautiful,removed,repost from like years ago
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,no hes upper middle at that point but he does what of people in his situation do which is elevate life style choices hes dumping annually into a which kudos but you can live off pretty easy i know a guy supporting a family of off he eats a lot of sack lunches but it can be done at id be retired in years so im not hating on him i just have no sympathy its like saying i make a million but i live in the hamptons so im pretty poor millions live off social security you need food shelter and water beyond that its a want not a need
dataisbeautiful,removed,oh i got ya so its like how my wife and i cant afford the place because we are investing a year so we dont have enough to make the payments you can afford a house im aware housing costs you should have no issue saving up if you want to avoid pmi so its not your lacking financial sense its that your full of crap about not being able to afford a house
dataisbeautiful,removed,i would not see a year as middle class in most parts of the country i said we get by on that isnt what we make earning with three dependents isnt going to put you in lavish excess its nothing like making a million and living in the hamptons he lives in a suburb in the midwest its fairly easy to get a large house there no its exactly the same thats my point there will always be someone with more if he cant get by with hes doing it wrong there are people who make pretty much and have no social assistance whatsoever in so many different countries does that mean you should have no sympathy for those on social security thats exactly what i mean food water shelter there are places in the world where people dont have that anything beyond that is excess and my whole point is the dude making and getting by will think the same if he was making or or million its ludicrous
dataisbeautiful,removed,right he is living the high life though it is lavish thats what im saying like i could never work again at my current savings and spending rates i wouldnt then complain about living on and driving an old car because i willingly dropped out of the work force youd all be pissed and say you need to work ive had people on reddit tell me i couldnt retire on a million im like mother fucker spy is paying i wouldnt even touch principle so is the high life if hes cash strapped its because of personal choices and what im saying is people like him will always be cash strapped if he got a raise hed likely buy a new a car and then be strapped once again like am i not explaining this or do you not understand in the midwest is near if not level hes paying a month for a sq ft house thats income to house whats a sq ft house go for in california
dataisbeautiful,removed,i know this is going to sound awful butone day your motherinlaw will not be around so silverlining to a bad situation i dont mean that you dont want her around just she wont be suffering and then you and your family will be able to worry about other things
dataisbeautiful,removed,you are cute bankrupt my savings lol what savings player nearly all my assets are in creditor claim exempt holdings primary residence and retirement accounts are exempt assets in my state you ever hear of not paying or moving out of the country to one with lower costs anyways nearly all my assets are locked up in creditor claim exempt accounts they have to treat me in the er and with zero income i start to qualify for aid and subsidies anything else ill move back to my parents out of state and sign up for obama care even then if i stop paying that i believe they still cover it so sign up and pay once then stop i only got to make it for ss or for med i can get snap benefits and pick up cash jobs on the side also so dont tell me what i can and cant do but honestly your right i likely wont do it but with im confident in my ability to generate a income a year till i die so while i could get free gibs i likely wont because i can make more money doing other things
dataisbeautiful,removed,i said spy thats assuming no share growth i paid into ss and medicaid if i want to drop out of the workforce at use my retirement savings to get me to thats my choice like you are dumb withdrawal rate on million is a year like do all you people think you are going to live forever its not my last plan im stating i could easily live off a million anyways its my money and im going to spend it how i wish if im eligible for snap and use snap thats fine you are trying to tie morality to money its just numbers to me i trade options and to a lesser extent futures once that income exceeds my day job im going to re evaluate but either way ill likely hit a million liquid net in my early to mid and at that point im pretty sure im done working a day job im just loading up my retirement accounts now so i can trade within them as taxes are killing me like i said i can live off ss easy so i only need my retirement accounts to get me there and quite frankly the way the rest of you all are saving id expect ss to be means tested its a back door way to confiscate the iras old rolliduck has a million he doesnt need it hes not paying his fair share so im not even going to give them that option im going to travel a lot and burn my accounts down at im going on the government dime i paid into ss so i plan on using it not really sure how this is different than living paycheck to paycheck on and then using ss or are you just mad you will be working to and i wont be i dont get you people
dataisbeautiful,removed,want to paypal me a few grand would help out by the way

dataisbeautiful,removed,a household making either single or double earners generally isnt having to worry about money massive debt notwithstanding maybe if they have no kids and drive used cars
dataisbeautiful,removed,it isnt really national healthcareper se why isnt it its one of our three current national healthcare programs
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats a bad way to define class the distribution is not fixed in some countries of people are clearly lower class
dataisbeautiful,removed,guy in the us here just to clarify federal taxes are maybe half of my taxes i pay income and payroll taxes to the us government my state my city the township i work in i pay property taxes to my county my city my school district then with the money i have left over i have can spend it after paying county sales tax state sales tax i cant imagine that many other developed countries have a more complicated tax system that what i have in my current location i have taken a few years of calculus and i still cant calculate my property tax ahead of time
dataisbeautiful,removed,single payer would be one type of national health care on the other end of the spectrum government owned hospitals are also national healthcare

dataisbeautiful,removed,til a new word that im going to be abusing the shit out of
dataisbeautiful,removed,is all that land just useless or something
dataisbeautiful,removed,weird to compare to a massive outlier
dataisbeautiful,removed,not sure what your point is or why you are upset using an outlier as a frame of reference will simply mean of the comparisons will lie to one side which means the comparison is not particularly useful in determining anything
dataisbeautiful,removed,til there is a subreddit for every state
dataisbeautiful,removed,well i suppose it depends how you look at it i imagine of the people on this planet currently live in a country that is more densely populated that the us basically all in china india europe and plenty more fundamentally though the commenter said that madagascar is small it isnt and that this is the reason for its population density it isnt some people find it very easy to imagine african countries as savannahs or deserts and a few tribes here and there is ignorant at best
dataisbeautiful,removed,might be fun but thats also exactly my point the result will usually be the same so its not very useful
dataisbeautiful,removed,we get it we get it fucking dumb fucking dems should have gone with bernie the blame for trump lies squarely on dipshit dems who voted for hrc in the primary

dataisbeautiful,removed,parents income is a poor predictor of sat score
dataisbeautiful,removed,til the item with the least calories at subway is a dessert
dataisbeautiful,removed,one of my favorite blogs has an extremely detailed analysis and takedown of this correlation tldr smart parents make more money iq income and then also have smart kids iq is heritable so parent iq child iq who then get high sat scores iq sat
dataisbeautiful,removed,nice good excuse to kfc more often
dataisbeautiful,removed,holy fuck is like idiocracy live

dataisbeautiful,removed,theres evidence to back up this claim too httpsghrnlmnihgovprimertraitsintelligence other studies say it can be httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiheritabilityofiq and its been well established that the smarter a person is the more theyll earn in their lifetime
dataisbeautiful,removed,your opening statement was no one can blame genetics until and the body of your reply included discussion which seemed to skirt the issue by suggesting that the sat doesnt necessarily require intelligence however everything you suggest would have a relatively strong genetic link if not because the child is more likely to embark upon learning on his or her own then because the parents themselves view education as its own prize something with its own merit worth pursuing at home

dataisbeautiful,removed,ive been hearing more people say things like this in canada lately things like canada has every natural resource we could possibly need why are we importingexporting anything at all realistically what would happen if canada literally just closed the doors id like to see a graph like ops for canadas population
dataisbeautiful,removed,the left arent against free trade theyre against trade that overwhelmingly benefits multinational corporations not just cheaper labor but fewer rights for workers less restrictions on environmental damage avoiding taxes the nationalist right are more isolationist everything possible should be handled internally and we need to use a big stick to force very onesided trade deals on other countries where needed
dataisbeautiful,removed,i think antiglobalists on the left correctly or not believe that things are getting better for one part of the worlds population the developed world at the expense of everyone else no the opposite the working class and poor in developed countries have more trouble now though there are now more higher paying jobs in developed countries than decades ago due to tech theyre aware that moving factories to other countries and outsourcing helps a portion of the population in those countries and if the government handles it right can build momentum to follow a similar path developed countries did to get where they are however multinational corporations are using globalization to play countries off each other to drive down labor costs taxes environmental protections undercut local companies that cant compete creating a global monoculture and use global agreements so they can sell products at very high costs with no competition thats what the left is upset about its possible to be upset about those things while being aware of what is shown in the chart

dataisbeautiful,removed,searches for iphone slow make huge spikes right after every three new iphone releases ftfy
dataisbeautiful,removed,what if its just people mistyping iphone show
dataisbeautiful,removed,why are you plotting this against releases of iphones dont you want releases of ios since youre trying to make the case that there may be a causal relationship between iphone slow down and the release there is no plausible causal mechanism for an actual slowdown of current iphones with the release of a new iphone there is a plausible causal mechanism for an actual slowdown of current iphones with the release of a new ios however unless im mistaken the new ios typically gets released a few days after the new hardware a casual inspection of your chart reveals that iphone slow searches have already peaked by the time the hardware is released the one exception being iphone release where the surge in searches are about of their max by the time the hardware is released days before the new ios is released if anything your chart shows that concerns about slowing are driven by anticipation of new hardware and fall immediately after a new ios is released
dataisbeautiful,removed,we did it reddit
dataisbeautiful,removed,the term is planned obsolescence
dataisbeautiful,removed,totally naive weve known for years that technology is engineered to fail this isnt all the bs that everyone chocks it up to be on the other hand if youre an engineer you have to make trade offs between longevity labormaterials and customer requirements for instance its absolutely possible to build cars that last years without any problems but they would have to be made of very high quality components and materials so they would cost more but people want that right wrong even though youd imagine that people want that on average people trade in their cars after just slightly over years of ownership remember used car buyers are not automakers customers its the same thing when releasing a new version of ios in order to sell a new phone you need to add new features these new features take more processing power than the old ones now maybe if they doubled their development hours they could find some optimizations to add to the os for the older phones but thats simply going to raise the price of the new phone for no benefit consumers who will be buying new phones will probably not be persuaded to buy a new phone based on performance improvements of a phone theyre not buying basically if you dont pay money for software support there is no incentive to provide software support beyond a minimal amount necessary to keep from destroying brand image

dataisbeautiful,removed,formal education does not count for that much all it proves is that you attended an expensive indoctrination center universities do not teach the degree of critical thinking necessary to even understand the basics of the world ive met a lot of retards with a college degree college makes you a good candidate to be a cog in the economy it is no guarantee that you are smart ive debated college students that use logical fallacies then respond with so when the moderator points it out
dataisbeautiful,removed,when you fantasize about donald trump sucking putins cock you know those lonely nights in your mothers basement does donald trump spit or swallow putins hot cum i only ask because i know youve thought about this a lot and if donald trump doesnt swallow putins hot cum does donald trump spit it into your face how often does this fantasy run though your mind are you getting horny yet

dataisbeautiful,removed,wrong stop crying or just leave the country
dataisbeautiful,removed,no one wanted bernie he was weak
dataisbeautiful,removed,yea and how many of those votes were flipped at the machines or were cast by dead people or people bused from booth to booth
dataisbeautiful,removed,start your damn chart at
dataisbeautiful,removed,its some old tradition that had to do with the schedules of pious farmers seriously thats the reason in before florida california and texas were states or slavery had been abolished congress needed to pick a time for americans to vote we were an agrarian society we traveled by horse and buggy farmers needed a day to get to the county seat a day to vote and a day to get back without interfering with the three days of worship so that left tuesday and wednesday but wednesday was market day so tuesday it was

dataisbeautiful,removed,nothing that the left or the right can do about it though unemployability is about to go through the roof and there wont be enough money to give everyone support no matter which side of the aisle youre on
dataisbeautiful,removed,well she told a black radio station she carried hot sauce in her purse thatll get those black votes right
dataisbeautiful,removed,not really its about campaign strategy for example he spent no time in california because he cant win it could he have gotten more popular votes yes but that wouldnt have done anything for him
dataisbeautiful,removed,stupid socialist you lost because hillary is a lying witch thats why good luck finding a real job you fucking welfare collecting morons
dataisbeautiful,removed,obama had an abnormally high voter turnout in his election because blacks came out to vote for him because he was black many didnt even know his policiesagenda they voted simply based on the color of his skin racists fucks
dataisbeautiful,removed,hispanic catholic males and black men didnt want to vote for a woman
dataisbeautiful,removed,is there a breakdown by state looking at the states donald won by the fewest number of votes data from state electoral votes hillary votes donald votes difference michigan wisconsin alaska pensylvania arizona that means at the extreme a change of a mere people in mi wi and pa wouldve resulted in enough electoral college votes for hillary thats a drop in the bucket the turnout in those states ended up being absolutely critical ak was relatively close in number of votes but only due to its low population its margin was of votes for reference state electoral votes hillary donald difference michigan wisconsin pensylvania florida n carolina
dataisbeautiful,removed,she lost because we still have a ridiculous electoral college process
dataisbeautiful,removed,are you saying people of color are too stupid to get an id racist bigot probably homophobic too
dataisbeautiful,removed,youre an idiot and need to stop voting or having a political opinion gerrymandering has absolutely nothing to do with electing the president you must be racist too if you think minorities are too stupid to figure out how to get an id canada has a voter id law are they suppressing the vote too

dataisbeautiful,removed,it takes a lot of privilege to be able to feel that any kind of economic hurt or corruption is more important than that stuff and with this attitude its no wonder that the left is not winning elections they are supposed to be the party of the working class and yet the working class do not feel represented of course people and especially the poorest are going to care more about their livelihood than they do about social issues and why shouldnt they if the middleclass progressives care so much about social issues maybe they should be the ones to put some of their fiscally conservative positions on the backburner to court the working class vote bernie sanders was pretty socially progressive from what i can recall

dataisbeautiful,removed,jesus clinton defines what it means to be a career politician if i ran into her id say get a job you bum
dataisbeautiful,removed,i dont look at a white person and blame them for anything no you look at all of them and blame them all not sure if you realized this but if you blame everyone the individuals are part of everyone what matters is the understanding that a group of people solely based on their skin color still deal with systemic discrimination and to stop this we need to be proactive by proactive you mean telling a more qualified candidate they dont get the job so we can achieve justice yea that sounds just perfect proactive is stopping the bs hiring practices that avoid ethnic names it is stopping police profiling it is stopping higher incarceration rates it is stopping inequality not introducing it simply in a different direction if they dont respect the effects of our forefathers and the issues we face thanks to the actions they took well considering im a second generation american my forefathers werent even here do i still have to feel the burden of history if i am the best candidate for something i better well get it by sexuality gender race etc is irrelevant giving it another in the idea of proactive justice is bullshit giving a person a job isnt going to magically erase jim crow laws it is simply going to foster resentment on unequal treatment
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats an interesting way to think about it a side note quotas in admission are illegal
dataisbeautiful,removed,i can see you are not really interested in discussion
dataisbeautiful,removed,first of all yes i am i am a white skinned american if you saw me walking down the street you would think i was white and you would judge me the same way you judge every other person with white skin but im sure you think that doesnt make you a racist why dont you understand that society owes you nothing and that the sins of the father cannot be paid by the son much the less by people that have nothing to do with it selfish bitch huh have you read your own posts do you think youre not being selfish what is the solution in your utopia of justice you think people should give you something because youve had it bad keep dreaming its never going to happen you want to blame the evil white man for every problem you have in life and it will never get you anywhere no one cares we are all dealing with shit all day every day when did i say you should feel sorry for me because i have white skin you clearly want me to feel sorry for you though you dont know shit about my struggle but you automatically assume just because you have nonwhite skin you are the epitome of suffering in the world but yes lets restructure society to benefit you and only you while demonizing the ethereal evil white man cant see anything wrong with that if you want to play the victim for the rest of your life you will not find what you are looking for reality is cruel you have to deal with it some people are born with silver spoons in their mouths the rest of us have to claw and scratch for every single iota of respect in this world get used to it because its never going to change at least not in your life time learn how to not insult people and maybe they wont check inbox replies disabled and actually give a shit about what you have to say you selfish bitch
dataisbeautiful,removed,no i dont like media spamming american propaganda you cant with a clean conscience totally discredited dozens of nations with extremely high levels of freedom of the press i think i can with a clean conscience discredit most of mainstream media in those countries considering they are all us allies and practically all mainstream englishlanguage media is controlled by only a handful of usled corporations yes there is a high level of free press in these countries that doesnt change the fact that practically all western mainstream media runs the us propaganda narrative on almost anything with minor alibi abberations when you go into nonmainstream media you will see that a lot of journalists and people actually dont agree with that narrative and side with russia and china and are overwhelmingly against the us talk to people in countries like germany and you will quickly see that many if not most are against the us and against the bullshit mainstream press in germany its especially easy to see that and why western press is bullshit as several of their companies literally have things such as support a union with the us and promote transpacific values or recognize and support israel as their corporate principles eg the publisher of germanys most printed newspaper theres a reason why the western world has some of the most respected news sources yes us hegemony and propaganda because theyre unbiased and fair yeah no but the ones that are highly respected are respected because they generally deliver good media they are highly respected in the west by people who agree with the views expressed yes saying oh ya i promise everyone said it was americas fault now i cant find it lol but believe me isnt much of an argument at all you made an outrageous claim now back it up what outrageous claim why do you believe thr ukraine crisis happened and what led to russia annexing crimea why do you believe russia was sanctioned for it you cant say there isnt one single fact or news article out there supporting your claim there is an endless torrent out there simply google us caused ukraine crisis and dont just look at the google front pages

dataisbeautiful,removed,i actually came across this comment from the rshitredditsays thread funny thing is uprettyicecube banned me for explaining this there pretty ironic that they are so antiintellectual there but meh hard to expect anything else from a sub like that the mods even said drr you dont know what youre talking about even when citing the actual dictionary terms httpdictionarycambridgeorgdictionaryenglishpositivediscrimination the act of giving advantage to those groups in society that are often treated unfairly because of their race sex etc that said there is whats called positive and negative racism negative is typically the taking of something from someone based on their skin color positive is giving something to someone based on their skin color we use aa positive racism to try and level the playing field due to the negative racism that was and is still prevalent to this day
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats because white males are better than everybody else

dataisbeautiful,removed,oh thanks thats helpful how did you get into this if you dont mind my asking did you need a quant finance type of degree
dataisbeautiful,removed,the blue is evil the green is savage all other colors should be deported
dataisbeautiful,removed,nah man its like those them blacks sure commit a lot of crimes theres millions who think like this
dataisbeautiful,removed,well we know where all the black people live then
dataisbeautiful,removed,i hate to point this out since facts can be you know racist but data was collected from the us dept of justice from through blacks were of the us population yet still committed of all homicides in the country im not suggesting what you said about slavery and segregation has no factor in this because im sure it does but in reference to people of color being targeted well yeah
dataisbeautiful,removed,young black men constitute roughly of the us population and commit half of the murders
dataisbeautiful,removed,that there is no responsibility anymore latins have been dealing with poor economics and poor educational conditions had their land invaded while people murdered their people to take over but yet the prison system is not completely filled with them when they have a higher percentage of population we have come to the point that black people are now being given the excuse of doing prison time for being black they may see it as good as in protecting them but in the end it will hurt them more telling a group theyre not responsible for their actions will hurt them more
dataisbeautiful,removed,so which way should it be said say it nicely that blacks count for homicides even though they only represent of the population should we present some cupcakes when we say these stats do i present cupcakes also when i say that white people have killed more cops than black people
dataisbeautiful,removed,frist of all how dare y ou acknowledge skin colors
dataisbeautiful,removed,stereotypes do not create themselves you daft cunt
dataisbeautiful,removed,blacks and hispanics bread like rabbits even when they dont have they means to support their children this means that more educated races will become the minority very soon
dataisbeautiful,removed,wow til
dataisbeautiful,removed,its like explained but for the black experience in particular there are historical reasons such as redlining not offering loans prohibiting them from moving into middle class white neighborhoods white flight etc also in chicago we had a mayor that purposely had an expressway built in order to segregateseparate white neighborhoods and black ones and there are other examples all over the city where they literally used physical barriers such as train tracks and viaducts in order to separate communities
dataisbeautiful,removed,mah man just accept that blacks commit more crimes because its in their genes
dataisbeautiful,removed,sounds like mental gymnastics because of white guilt
dataisbeautiful,removed,the context while informative doesnt change that it is a fact or somehow make those crimes not a big deal
dataisbeautiful,removed,i would love to see a map representing violent crime ride next to it and see what conclusions might be drawn from it
dataisbeautiful,removed,because one must confrint how of the population is so fucking utterly violent and criminally minded all while attempting to portray them as vuctims of white oppression hard to do
dataisbeautiful,removed,that crime in engrained in the culture
dataisbeautiful,removed,hey what tools did you use
dataisbeautiful,removed,simply not true theyve done it to themselves they dont want to do better no other race has be given as much help time and time again only to do nothing with it and ask for more at some point they have to take accountability for their actions your post is a prime example of what they believe and whats wrong with them
dataisbeautiful,removed,surrounded by asians whites hear that me neither its nice and quiet
dataisbeautiful,removed,ya thats the reason false imprisonment
dataisbeautiful,removed,yes theyre very upfront about that no facts only feels
dataisbeautiful,removed,this is where the circle jerk of low income and poverty comes in like somehow being poor justifies criminal behavior so they shouldnt be incarcerated nobody is pretending that certain races are disproportionately low income were just saying that certain races have a high rate of crime and unfortunately we cant just let them walk free
dataisbeautiful,removed,how about controlling for family type how many black vs white violent crimes or nonviolent are committed by people from a family with the male and female biological parents
dataisbeautiful,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikinewyorkcityraceandethnicity nonhispanic white hispanic nonhispanic black asian
dataisbeautiful,removed,and yet race has a higher correlation to crimes than poverty please show the evidence that supports this claim also black and latino communities are proportionately more poverty stricken than others in the us so im struggling to see how that claim can be based in any useful statistics
dataisbeautiful,removed,if you dont want to live in those areas its because youre a racist
dataisbeautiful,removed,the absolute best way to pick an apartment in a new city just sayin
dataisbeautiful,removed,habits which come from the decisions we all make as conscious adults before you ask
dataisbeautiful,removed,there you have it folks this thread is officially brigaded by stormfront
dataisbeautiful,removed,of course there is a difference in dna thats why whites blacks and asians all have different identifiable bone structures that are consistent throughout the other people of their race
dataisbeautiful,removed,i zoomed in on my local university purdue and there was so much red asians
dataisbeautiful,removed,a post must include a this post has been removed
dataisbeautiful,removed,for this we would have to look outside the us and get statistics for other countries
dataisbeautiful,removed,no that black people commit the most crimes per capita no matter where they live
dataisbeautiful,removed,is it because they dont call it terrorism anymore though
dataisbeautiful,removed,well i mean if i remember right black people have a higher amount of testosterone on average and im pretty sure more testosterone is a good indicator for higher rates of violence
dataisbeautiful,removed,they arent slaves and neither were there great granddaddys
dataisbeautiful,removed,at least in they did have the demographics changed since then
dataisbeautiful,removed,i thinks big part is culture then you also have politics of the location in terms of policing and and how crime is dealt with
dataisbeautiful,removed,shhh facts are racists
dataisbeautiful,removed,do you have a degree in geneticspsychology or are you just pasting articles that might misrepresent the data
dataisbeautiful,removed,and why dont the nonblack people in the same school districts going to the same schools commit crimes at similar rates to blacks do you have any data to support this
dataisbeautiful,removed,iq is very racially biased to the point where many people think it was specifically developed for the reason to make blacks look dumb look up iq test race bias and some of the stuff is pretty shocking
dataisbeautiful,removed,because its almost entirely rural
dataisbeautiful,removed,it was last week and the week before one day the blacks were all the way up at what a day
dataisbeautiful,removed,lol youre right what people say can in no way be misinterpreted
dataisbeautiful,removed,thanks for the correction
dataisbeautiful,removed,why would you even spend time writing that post when its complete bullshit of course he was talking per capita numbers yet you still spent time writing a complete straw man reply comparing different ethnicities in crime statistics is completely useless if you dont adjust for population and look at the per capita numbers obviously
dataisbeautiful,removed,awful lot of honkeys in here
dataisbeautiful,removed,that data is not true there is a ton of terror attacks happening in europe httpswwwthereligionofpeacecomattackseuropeattacksaspx
dataisbeautiful,removed,huff raid racist fuck
dataisbeautiful,removed,describes my area pretty well httpiimgurcomkazbgbmjpg
dataisbeautiful,removed,hope your grandfather dies before he can vote
dataisbeautiful,removed,theyre unable to manage their own civilizations because the west has been colonizing those countries for the last years at least and eradicating their culture and stymying the natural social development that would occur well thats one theory but it doesnt really cross apply hong kong is one of the wealthiest places on earth and also consistently exhibit the absolute highest iq on earth they were a british colony until ashkenazi jews were literally rounded up and gassed as recently as a few generations ago yet their average iq is still and theyre still gross overachievers in every single meaningful cognitive performance metric the oppression thesis fails utterly as it employs typical raceequality new logic in that we must accept that its somehow unique to africans for it to explain why they have low iqs and primitive civilizations since there are plenty of examples of horrific oppression of peoples who dont suffer from that exact same fate the whole nigeria would be like switzerland were it not for colonialism theis doesnt withstand much unpacking there is a fallacy lets call it the failure fallacy where people with idealogical agendas refuse to accept occams razor and instead explain failures not on the basis of obvious causal factors but by an elaborate entirely academic series of rationales whereby their theory is otherwise valid we just didnt manage something right along the way and that their thesis is otherwise valid were it not for that one thing its pretty standard with for example communists who struggle to reference a realworld example of their theories put into practice that didnt crash and burn same with libertarians who insist that the reason their ideas dont withstand the acid test of reality is because we just didnt take them far enough its not logical thinking its definitely important to look into history to see if we can figure out why something happened but if you start out from the vantage of ideological agenda history then becomes hardly much more than a perverted medium to justify your preexisting beliefs since you can always theorize something
dataisbeautiful,removed,are you a muslin refugee
dataisbeautiful,removed,but muh narrative
dataisbeautiful,removed,there is natural variance in any data set like this the thing that really matters is the long term trend
dataisbeautiful,removed,dont feel that way then statistically theres a other things you should worry about before terrorism
dataisbeautiful,removed,intent is a critical element to crime terrorism in particular
dataisbeautiful,removed,what a nice clean reminder of my mortality
dataisbeautiful,removed,that japanese woman got culturally enriched lets bring in more of these refugees
dataisbeautiful,removed,only too increase rapidly after left wing politicians left in thousands of unregistered unvetted migrants from the middle east and other third world countries none for being hotbeds of violence and religious fanatics nice try op but nobody is falling for your propaganda especially not the people of europe that watch with horror as their countries are being turned into war zones where women get rapped and people either shot stabbed run over or blown up by poor refugees screaming nazi and racists when ever somebody objects to the the left globalists and their false god of poltical correctness only works for so long
dataisbeautiful,removed,you dont have to worry about it no one is forcing you to irrationally interpret the data
dataisbeautiful,removed,gotta push that narrative somehow
dataisbeautiful,removed,challenge accepted
dataisbeautiful,removed,that whole holocaust trifle excepted
dataisbeautiful,removed,while im sorry that your feelings do not match up with reality i somehow dont see that as an excuse to ignore the hard data
dataisbeautiful,removed,because this shithole turned into rpolitics gotta protect the narrative
dataisbeautiful,removed,if you have irrational fears and youre aware that theyre irrational why do you still think that
dataisbeautiful,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiirgunstruggleagainstthebritish
dataisbeautiful,removed,
dataisbeautiful,removed,its telling that it has spiked at and will look similar
dataisbeautiful,removed,quite the narrative shitdmins weve gotten here
dataisbeautiful,removed,so what about gary johnson
dataisbeautiful,removed,if like to see a graph that shows world wide casualties over time
dataisbeautiful,removed,and onward will reverse the trend itoldyouso
dataisbeautiful,removed,is not considered in this
dataisbeautiful,removed,what compels you not to treat this as a problem i couldnt care less about data trends over years public attacks are happening weekly in europe and it needs to be stopped prioritization the things that are more likely to kill you are so common theyre not even publicised
dataisbeautiful,removed,hey its todays obligatory pro muslim terrorism post muslims can get the fuck out of america nothing has ever been developed more sickening and violent than islam
dataisbeautiful,removed,well this doesnt count so well see
dataisbeautiful,removed,ask grandpa about violence in europe before he dies of heart disease he probably remembers it
dataisbeautiful,removed,tldr dont live in los angeles
dataisbeautiful,removed,is only half overwhat are our numbers so far on that
dataisbeautiful,removed,this post clearly illustrates the rise of islamic terrorism not sure if thats the point
dataisbeautiful,removed,academic environments are not prejudice lel have you checked out medical school acceptance rates by race recently double lel at your suggestion that the only reason tech hubs exist is because of muh diversity
dataisbeautiful,removed,im never surprised by the length people will go to trying to convince people islamic terrorism isnt a big problem
dataisbeautiful,removed,perhaps it would be fairer to include eastern europe too since the westerneastern split is vanishing
dataisbeautiful,removed,date country city dead injured event france valence two other people are injured when a muslim deliberately rams french guards outside a mosque france marseille a jewish teacher is attacked with a machete in the name of allah england rochdale a popular imam is beaten to death by muslims with terror ties germany hanover a radicalized teen girl stabs a female police officer belgium brussels fourteen people are murdered when two suicide bombers detonate nailpacked explosives at crowded airline counters belgium brussels a religion of peace suicide blast on a subway train incinerates twentyone commuters germany essen isisinspired teens bomb a sikh wedding germany grafing a man shouting praises to allah stabs four commuters at a train station germany badenwürttemberg a woman is murdered in her home by a young muslim who leaves a religious note at the scene england london a turkish man yelling about lee rigby stabs four women in a parking lot on the third anniversary france saint julien du puy an offduty soldier is stabbed by isis supporters while jogging france magnanville a terrorist stabs a couple to death while shouting praises to allah belgium etterbeek a transgender is stabbed by religious radicals france nice a muslim migrant mows down eightyfour bastille day revelers including ten children with a truck while shouting praises to allah still five months left in the year with this extra information added to the op chart we can logically conclude that after almost a decade of decline in terrorist related deaths in western europe the influx of emigration in the number of terrorism related deaths is on the rise
dataisbeautiful,removed,or our definition of what is defined as terrorism has changed
dataisbeautiful,removed,we cant talk about that

dataisbeautiful,removed,yeah you are right the right term would be massacre
dataisbeautiful,removed,there you go the highest rates of death were not from religion but democide look it up
dataisbeautiful,removed,i remember a rbadhistory post too about how archeologists have in the past assumed that a native settlement that was suddenly abandoned during the time of american colonization suggested being wiped out by european diseases this really just perpetuates the diseasefree paradise myth and while many natives were killed by introduction to european diseases the actual number is likely lower than assumed and many tribes likely just moved west

dataisbeautiful,removed,i wonder how aboritons would change this graph
dataisbeautiful,removed,wow bitter much hows your dating life going you seem like a catch
dataisbeautiful,removed,maybe if someone threw him a bone every once in a while he wouldnt be so bitter and maybe actually get better instead the women of the world just keep denying him with no response or explanation and obviously hes supposed to figure it out on his own
dataisbeautiful,removed,maybe someone needs to explain the difference between being an asshole and being the confident decisive and emotionally strong man that women want you can do the latter but quickly become the former
dataisbeautiful,removed,nah uomnibrad is a bit of a reductive douche but youre just looking for a chance to make yourself out to be a whiny little victim
dataisbeautiful,removed,thats because he made it up
dataisbeautiful,removed,you liked it some guys feel emasculated i organized a dinner with a guy i was hooking up with offered to pick him up and take us he told me he would drive because he prefers that so we met there then i paid he said thanks and went home without me because he was tired it was still a good night but i dont think some guys like being treated that way
dataisbeautiful,removed,warmblooded lizard people need love too
dataisbeautiful,removed,im offering an opinion just like everyone else here so thanks for your shitty input
dataisbeautiful,removed,this made me laugh hey you have some good points and some bad points so i dont know what to say but thanks for the reply its hard to explain when a conversation between him and i conveys a lot more than i can convey to you via a text conversation on the internet maybe he didnt feel emasculated and he was just tired he has never complained what i paid he was stoked to get dinner with me maybe he was hungry or maybe he likes my company who knows so i guess i did jump to conclusions but that was the conclusion i came too based on what i knew about him at the time i would not at all be surprised if he has some selfesteem issues based on other behaviour but in this day and ago who the fuck doesnt it doesnt worry me at all
dataisbeautiful,removed,ill be saving this for when i see people that are bitter that is very nice and well written out umidasstream i see from other posts youre not a dude like i suspected but instead of people just saying your wrong i for details and here they are parent to this comment
dataisbeautiful,removed,you would think
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why do people tweet this stuff in the first place

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nice color choice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so sleeping hours on a regular basis as an adult is ok i dont know what to think about this assuming that for a typical job you have to wake up at approyimately this would need you to be in ped at leaving you no social or other life whatsoever
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks much enhanced from before last round i used from rcolorbrewer should have just used blues
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i like the colors too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i have learned that i need between and hours of sleep to truely feel recharged i also play basketball a week for a few hours at a time everyone is different
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sleep by up at definitely cuts into time outside work but i feel pretty good every day so ill take it

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i collected and supervised the of the data in detroit interesting to see that they have made their tree inventory public
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this interactive chart shows the impact of the mostproduced food items obviously items like rice wheat corn and sugar cane are produced in huge amounts and so have the most impact however if you want to reduce agricultural impact improving the most significant crops would be the most effective i wasnt satisfied with this display so i took the data and scaled it by the caloric content of the food and with and water impact per calories as the axes and production volume weight as the size i did not display tea coffee or cocoa in this chart as their caloric content is too small and placed them significantly higher than the other items they arent exactly food staples either note how tomatoes scores high for both water and impact fortunately we dont grow that much of them compare rice and wheat however and you see rice has quite a bit more impact than wheat and presumably other grains like barley this is probably because of the methane produced when the fields are flooded interestingly palm oil and coconuts have relatively low impact probably because of their high caloric content note also that the only includes farm emissions so transport and processing eg sugar cane are not included edit posted at kind of a stupid time its up to you australia

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks i see it for whatever reason it didnt show up on the mobile app when i posted my question
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats my guy share with me lets keep it funky
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that has to be one of the worst visualizations i have ever seen on this sub pie charts to visualize trends over time really
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i often see stuff on rdataisugly crossposted from here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i personally found it interesting actually something you dont see too often
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the data was interesting i agree with coolserdash that the visualization was shitty theres a pointless effect its hard to see which sectors the labels point to the animation goes too quicky and cant be paused i would have gone with type of visualization also why is cassette single listed separately from cassette

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this was a graph i made back around for college based on data from my class and online library the data specifically came from a long term survey that my professor presented to us i thought the most interesting part about it was that young people arent working nearly as much as they were back in the early also the surge of people doing outside entertainment which ranged from nightclubs to playing baseball around the another thing was the rapid drop of sleep for young people around the and going from to only about meaning the average kid in was only getting on average hour of sleep a night tool used was onlinechartoolorg i just want to say that this is not for sure data and was made by a dumb ass college student in a group project if anyone has data that contradicts this please let me know and i will take it down in an instant
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we all need more floor space
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,where does masturbating fall on this chart it could go into any category
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hi do you have a link to the data source and add the tool used to make the visualization otherwise it will be removed according to rule ill give you a hour grace period
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i bet indoor leisure will have increased by a lot since this graph was made
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably indoor entertainment or for some outside leisure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont have an online link that would be accessible it was from worksheets from a textbook i can probably find those in my old folders but again it wouldnt be an online link the tool is onlinecharttoolcom

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,made it with httpwwwonlinecharttoolcomgraph i made the actual data plots from a series of journals i keep on my life i plot various things in my life every month stuff like average happiness how much money spent on various things
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seriously a pie chart for a monthly budget is perhaps the most boring and common of all data visualizations whats next a bar chart showing how many gallons of gas you used each month or a line chart showing how many hours per day you spent on the internet
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,uncultured swine just kidding there arent any swine in the desert
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dollars of blow isnt that much over a month i was at a party in long island and this guy offered me a line and i did it and it was ridiculously good so when he told me how much i could get for bucks i couldnt refuse that good of a deal i dont do much blow anymore but when it comes around i do it occasionally
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you can smoke a blunt then go up to a cop and say you just smoked a blunt but if they cant find weed on you they cant do anything also i actually go very far out of my way so that this account isnt linked to me i lived as a war orphan and nobody in my real life knows outside of reddit so i make sure that nobody in my real life knows about my reddit acount and vice versa

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,congrats on the promotion bro
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont let your real life know about your reddit life got it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,organized the letter tiles in a bananagrams r set alphabetically edit a lot less s tiles than i expected
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,at first i was like whats special about the r this is what you were going for ® ascii ftw
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this game would be better if the q tiles came with u unnecessarily frustrating
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,does this mean the most commonly played words are eat tea are ate disclaimer ive never played the game im just guessing how it works
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,too few hs also according to this distribution
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cool itd be even cooler if you put percentages next to each bar and compare them to actual english letter frequency
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,words like qi qat niqab can be useful otherwise an easy dump
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,depends on who you play with the more well versed people are the more likely longer words will com from them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,etaoin shrdlu
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah okay so score is based on length of words i presume interesting
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,soooo toenailers d
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,havent played bananagram in forever but im pretty positive its about getting rid of your tiles fastest every time you make a new word everyone gets a tile so its in your best interest to use longer words
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maps louisiana wtf edit if anyone is interested in tech stack i build it with react redux and simple node server
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hows this compare to mapbox or cartodb
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a solid app but on the world map not all countries are included i still like its simplicity
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks looks awesome
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,like david to goliath mapbox and cartodb are robust mapping platforms my app is nowhere close to them i just wanted to create a simple app which allows users to create data maps for their articles blog posts websites in easy and fast way for now svg and png are supported as a download file format
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for you comment you are right that there are missing countries in the world map this supposes to be a simplified version more detailed version is coming soon i want to let a user decide which one to use
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for the response cant wait for any updates
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,beautiful both in the data presented and in the presentation of the data rare to see something which fulfils this sub so beautifully
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is very nice only thing is criticise is the use of the chopped and changed american albums rather than the originals an analysis of the beatles should use albums made by the beatles not albums made by capitol records
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,george wrote songs of those songs ended up being a overall uhhh so which is it or
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,george harrisons top words are love know long like mine there must be a hidden message in there somewhere
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the guy who created this blog spoke to my data analysis class last week teaching tableau his passion for the subject is infectious a lot of the analysis in this blog was done using tableau thus the beautiful presentation of data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont understand the methodology behind the songs presented he says in the comments that he went off of american albums and that is why there is no a hard days night and other glaring omissions but a hard days night was released as an album in america and contained several top hits maybe im missing something
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,taking a trip to carolina is not a beatles song not even a ringo song
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,really smart use of curves to link all the different visualisations into one coherent piece this guy tableaus
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,george wrote songs or of the entire beatles catalog of those songs ended up being a overall hit should that have a top line in there somewhere
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that is a beautiful visualization i couldnt imagine doing that in tableau tutorial please
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the best explanation of the beatles to people who dont get the beatles by my friend mike when the beatles say love what they mean is have sex with
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,green eggs and ham was a challenge to write a story in words or less in its mildly interesting that so many songs can have fewer words without any bet to incentivize it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,everytime i see this viz i get a smile on my face such fantastic analysis and design
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,absolutely brilliant kudos to the creator of this chart for all the time invested in it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ringos typical one song per album was usually the worst song on that album yellow submarine on revolver and octopus garden on abbey road
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what are most of their songs about lennon love mccartney love harrison love ringo octopus lol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,haha ringo is awesome
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe thats the problem he didnt put any love into his songs ill see myself out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wouldve called it lovely
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,think of the made it to top
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,songs are different from stories though a story is supposed to have some kind of narrative even if its a silly one whereas there is no such expectation of a song song lyrics also use repetition usually in the form of a chorus as overwhelmingly common tool notably green eggs and ham was written somewhat lyrically in order to fit it all into only words
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i unabashedly love octopus garden i usually go for the artistic antipop deep cuts too but theres something just so charming about that song
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,little known fact ringo was big into hentai
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats what made him big hits like all you need is octopus lucy in the sky with octopus across the octopus and others
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if so the summary is poorly written its totally unclear
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think that just shows how good those albums are
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they dont teach that in elementary school anymore
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,prompting georges song octopus bother me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow im surprised wrong turn is the most popular in north carolina and not west virginia
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its probably more of an indication that people were taking to twitter to insult and argue with each other and not some sign that society is suddenly homophobic were still the same nation we were before election day majority of americans still support the lgbt community and gay marriage you could argue that closet homophobes lol irony are coming out after trumps election but i think its more likely that the use of the word faggot is being used as an insult and not to disparage gays
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a twitterusing trump supporter who does not use homophobic language i know that i have received hateful language directed at me so dont jump to conclusions about who was having a screaming meltdown on that day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how does this compare to other elections i imagine that any election is going to get everyone bigots the far left the far right all hot and bothered

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,institute for sexual minority studies and services university of alberta is this real life
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same exact thing happened with brexet i knew this would happen as well when people realize how many other people around them were also assholes that didnt want to be public assholes they feel like they can suddenly be assholes in public i agree with the other comment that there are not more homophobic people now than before but now they think they can say whatever they want without reprecuctuons
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont like spiders heights crooked police and biker style gay guys or gay women that act and dress like men so three out of five of my phobias are politically correct they are my phobias i dont see why i have to hide them no one picks their fears we are born with them or they are learned its what has made us successful as a species when someone harms you directly or indirectly its important to recognize the same traits in others biker gay guys always grab my ass or crotch in crowds and butch lesbian women have threatened me when i look at their lipstick girlfriends or straight women they are trying to hook up with get out of here breeder shes mine rational fear should not be politically incorrect
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its probably arguing as far as im concerned theres really no way to accurately discriminate between those used as actual homophobic slurs and years old calling each other faggots
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is disturbing but somehow it was only the word faggot any ideas why
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,could also be people jumping on trends being edgy and funny the year olds of the internetthought it could be any age and as sick as that sounds note also the people who could theoretically use trump as a scapegoat for hate crimes removing themselves from the public eye while the public focuses on the alleged trump supporter label and not maybe this guy or group of people were assholes all along keep in mind too that not all trump supporters are rage fueled gun toting gay hating fanatics either if we want to erase our blinders to homophobia or any other stereotype or hate we gotta also destroy the hate for the other were all people after all i know we like our tribeism and echo chambers reddit kinda fuels that a bit but lets find something as people on gods earth to agree on both sides and be happy about sucks without our help but without our help to lift it out of this grunge its just gonna suck
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and you will find that this data is compromised due to the fact that its known that hillary supporters and the socalled tolerant left created hundreds of thousands of fake accounts just to post said homophobic and racist tweets just like a large majority of socalled hate crimes that were reported were found out to be fake
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,most of the tweets i saw were those fake propaganda stories and had the words in it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think its more likely that the use of the word faggot is being used as an insult and not to disparage gays im pretty sure using homophobic slurs still disparages gay people regardless even if you hurl them onto straight people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but using the word faggot is in itself disparaging gays just like the nword

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,using faggot as an insult disparages gays its sad you dont realize this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it depends on how you define support i would imagine most people dont care with a minority actually supporting the cause
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id argue that most people dont use faggot as derogative term becuse it implies gays its just great word like cunt you can be a faggot and not be gay as well as you can be gay and not a faggot vice versa obviously if you say stupid faggy things like calling yourself so random or similar things you get the gist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,while you are probably right in this case you shouldnt completely dismiss how much of an impact something like an election can have after brexit homophobic hate crimes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well i use retarded and gay alot and i dont care what people think about it when i use those words i dont think or talk about actual mentally disabled or homosexuals nor do i have negative thoughts about them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id argue that most people dont use faggot as derogative term becuse it implies gays its just great word like cunt you can be a faggot and not be gay as well as you can be gay and not a faggot vice versa obviously if you say stupid faggy things like calling yourself so random or similar things you get the gist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i disagree i think the lgbt issue is the single most divisive issue in america and had the greatest influence on the outcome of the election lgbt rights create the most discomfort for average folk who simply cant go there despite how the left leaning media tell them they should feel about the issue this election should have taught everyone that you cant mistake silence for assent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i keep seeing the comments on this thread about how trump used gay hate to win the election but people dont realize trump was the only candidate who waved the gay pride flag and supported the lgbt but somehow people dont know this because cnn didnt tell them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,must be nice playing the victim roleplay is always fun when reality doesnt affect you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is the equivalent of making a word cloud words bundled without context and we get this sort of thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yea thats a forced doctrine then they feel they now have the right to do that even though nothing changed in the ways of law cant u report that to someone i wouldnt want to be blessed by a religious zealot i have no religion but i dont want someone forcing theirs on me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im sorry to mention this but multiple anecdotes is not the same thing as data these are terrible comments but we would really need evidence or lack of evidence that these comments didnt occur as often before the election or rise of popularity of trump to draw anything meaningful if this is just a post pointing out the hate that exists in the world and on news sites social media then i feel like this isnt the sub for that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,plastering this copypasta doesnt constitute data the more you post it especially considering many so called hate crimes have been found to have been faked to give the perception that the world is becoming more racist by the day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a public university with students and a significant endowment has an office that studies a minority which accounts for just shy of of the population how is that so hard to fathom
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the fact that its in alberta makes me proud its there but feels pretty weird to see it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sexual minority studies do you want fries with that sir edit getting downvoted by sexual minority majors getting upvoted by liberal arts majors who for the first time get to laugh at people with a major worse than theirs that delicious controversial cross
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they should be able to say whatever they want on a platform that isnt job related calls for people to be fired for saying something on facebook is insane i think what mayor beverly whaling said was stupid but it had nothing to do with her job
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,biker gays always grab your ass i think someones fear is fuelled by the fact he thinks people want to sleep with him respectfully decline perhaps
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or south park calling a bunch of bikers fags
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i suspect its just because its a more common insult now people tend to use it as a casual insult ignoring the original meaning of the word like motherfucker doesnt necessarily have anything to do with mothers or fucking
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah yes its all just one big conspiracy theory coincidence solid argument
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre dumb and should feel dumb
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people laugh at you and say conspiracy keep up the good fight most conspiracy theories that came out this election were true remember when everyone said the dnc rigged the primaries lol some conspiracy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,language changes though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe but thats a side effect in the mind of the person saying it not their intention its an important distinction when youre trying to draw conclusions a bunch of people calling each other faggots on the internet alone is not indicative of an ideological shift i see the word faggot being thrown around in dota matches that go poorly doesnt mean that losing a tower makes anyone hate gays
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if youve ever said something or someone sucks then its exactly the same youre not accusing them of sucking on lolipops
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just like the word homophobic is used to disparage traditionalist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is a distinction that people make that they dont realise they are making some people primarily right leaning reckon racismsexismhomophobiawhatever by intent that is to say the thing that makes a person racist is intending to disparage black people when he says nigger they do not feel that it is objectively correct to feel offended when no offense is intended nor fair to assign to them a label based on things they cannot control eg all white people are racist other people primarily left leaning reckon racismwhatever by outcome the thing that makes a person racist is that he did something that disproportionately or only has consequences for a minority that is to say they focus on the fact that they do feel offended regardless of whether offense is intended or that whether white people know itintend it or not they are part of a system that oppresses certain minority groups the former group puts its emphasis on the objective and the latter on the subjective and then they both yell at each other for being wrong
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,depends on which gay you ask not exactly the majority but there are gay people that are fine with it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not even close the word wasnt invented to describe them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its almost like on a platform with millions of users there are a very small few that can be misinterpreted as a large group
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,almost every one of those is obvious false flag bullshit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,many of these have been proven false and there have been many cases where people made it up to prove a point or cause they werent happy with the election results
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well thats because the only true supporters of anything are going to be those involved a lot of people say thats great but would rather not protest and get involved haha supposedly the majority wanted it to be legal and thats what matters i doubt those people would say lets make it legal and then use slurs data is beautiful but testing methods matter how many instances did they use of the the word being used against people in the lgbt community and how many were simply used while it may be a slur thats like taking the word nigger or nigga and doing a search there are going to be those using it in a derogatory way and those using who are not or at least not in a truly racist way you can see that so gay spiked that could be this election is so gay and you might see the word faggot use as asshole while it still had a negative connotation and is a slur it may be have been used toward people who were not gay this means that the point of the article which was to prove that homophobia increased because of trump may be mute because the data doesnt truly back it up imo no homo could be used to state that you arent meaning something to be gay and i dont really see that being a slur likewise as a younger kid faggot meant asshole and so gay meant that sucks people equated those two things not necessarily because people thought that being gay was crappy or that gay people were all assholes or something but because of how it was used by others
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,intention does not affect impact simply using gay or retarded as insults even if you dont have negative thoughts about homosexuals or disabled people still spreads an obvious negative connotation about being gay or mentally retarded in your community this is not only insulting but inherently derogatory to people who seriously identify themselves as gay or mentally retarded think twice before you communicate your thoughts there are several more sophisticated words to replace however youve been using gay or retarded not to mention that you risk coming off as an ignorant and insensitive individual even if you arent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do you use those words in front of gays and disabled have you ever
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,most of us do but according to reddit twitter and huffington posts were all just a bunch of white supremacist sexist evil poo poo brains
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,on top of that you spell a lot alot so in conjunction with the rest of your comment im not sure you have many thoughts at all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,mmmmm yeahnot really healthcare and immigration are really where people want to see action and have differences
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people give a shit about themselves more than any lgbt issues
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the rights of people in the lgbt community were likely not even on the minds of the vast majority of voters average people are worried about whether theyre going to be able to pay their bills and put food on the table not about gendered pronouns or something equally ridiculous
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the most divisive issue youre delusional gay marriage is the law of the land most gay people who dont live in a bubble dont even care about lgbt issues
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think that a lot of people are weirded out by gay interactions in public because its not a regular thing you see every day its a relatively new community i use to be weirded out by gay people doesnt mean i dont think they should have rights i have gotten use to it now but i was kinda homophobic there for a bit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but his cabinet is filled with homophobes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the only candidate who waved the gay pride flag and supported the lgbt it doesnt help that it was a completely empty platitude as evidenced by trumps vp pick and the rnc platform last summer and further confirmed by trumps cabinet picks this month
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,isnt this article all about people playing the victim im not upset about it im just telling people that their assumptions those evil trump supporters might not be accurate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,tolerant left
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a private business i doubt there is anything you could do a significant portion of society says she should just get a new job if she doesnt like it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you for this a topic in subreddit devoted to data shouldnt devolve into a handful of anecdotes presented as support for a specific claim
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,because humanities are useless hurr durr education is stupid hurr durr
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that delicious controversial cross a cross is worth more than reddit gold these days
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if i was a boss and i saw an employee say homophobic or racist things anywhere including facebook he would no longer be my employee
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,crowded bar or concert you have no choice gay biker types get drunk and feel like they can act out in public by groping when everyone is packed in my wife tries to intercept them and found it funny until i said no i dont take it as a compliment i take it as sexual assault
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the election was rigged from the start
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow really childish insults you must be a hillary lover
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes but we live in a point in time where the word faggot is used as an insult because of its association with gay men by perpetuating its use people are normalizing homophobia
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well gay people have existed throughout time and were openly accepted in ancient cultures so i guess it isnt used to disparage a traditionalist but instead to refer to someone who doesnt support true human equality and finds themselves better or superior to someone else not accepting full equality for another human is the problem so maybe a less disparaging term like individual with a superiority complex should be used
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are they fine with it when some stranger calls them a faggot are they fine with it when people on twitter use that word to insult each other
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,etymology and usage are different things besides there is no one word with one meaning and faggot can indeed refer to a twig or food or cells so you need to look at the context and then its clear what is meant by faggot more specifically in the context of this thread were obviously not talking about a bundle of twigs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pretty weird how those stories almost came a complete halt when they were starting to be investigated by local law enforcement im really looking forward to the next election to see what these people write about next
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sounds like an excuse for you to ignore those that you disagree with and i know how you feel about excuses
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which ones
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how do you identify as mentally retarded oo isnt that something you either are or arent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,guess youll have to not be friends with him or bring it up at your next interpretive dance therapy session
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well i´ve seen the word straight as an insult towards gay people and gay to insult straight people same thing for white towards blacks and black towards white language has evolve and maybe the original cognotations are not valid if put into context
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he used them in front of you didnt he
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as someone who uses said words alot yes about a quarter of my friends have either some kind of mental handicap or are gay ive asked them about it they either dont care or particularly with my disabled friends would rather you not code switch with them because they see it as patronizing and othering theyre people too people youre supposed to see as equals last i checked and nothing confirms you see someone differently or lesser than changing the way you talk around them by intentionally switching words that have been in common vernacular for decades now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you showed him
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,healthcare was a big deal but lgbt was divisive state wise look at nc for example lgbt is as big of a deal as those two when choosing party lines and who you vote for
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but thats the point those issues do affect others because it changes society which people are a part of otherwise if it literally did not affect anyone nobody would oppose it you know guys im not picking a side here im saying what if youre religious then that affects you or what if you just want to be able to do whatever you want then it affects you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when the vast majority of voters arent even sure what bathroom theyll be able to piss in next week the lgbt issue becomes top of mind real quick
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the same people who called trump a homophobe are calling his cabinet homophobic seems fishy to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they arent assumptions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the assumptions are accurate just because you arent a racist piece of shit doesnt mean everyone else is going to forget the fact that the republican party courted racist conspiracy theorists for years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont know how canadian universities work but i seemed surprised they have an institute dedicated to the subject i am assuming assuming it is akin to a college within an university
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what if he said you just made my day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i just liked your supposition that every one of them wants you there are a lot of gay biker types that are not damaging your virtue but they are surely eyeing you up so phobia totally justified
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you arent wrong necessarily but the irony in your statement is dont use gay to mean lame but lame was a derogatory word towards those whom are crippled but no one remembers it as such
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or just ignore people whom are being insulting someone calls me a fucking mick a potato eater a cracker or anything else i usually just turn it around on them and assist them in their insults that shuts them up quick dont be so weak that you let a word get under your skin of i had a nickel for every time i was called a fat white homophobic piece of shit by these sjws id be able to swim in them like scrooge mcduck
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the word gay didnt even originally mean homosexual when someone tells you they dont mean homosexual when they use gay you should stop trying to force meaning on it and accept what they say also you should really give up on trying to police langugsge
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lmao thats not the reason south park is doing that but okay
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,alot has been accepted through out time and openly accepted in ancient times like stoning wife killing gay people enslaving others i am not advocating those things its just should not be the basis of the argument traditionalist is a term used to describe was is considered traditional american values nowhere in the basis of traditional values does it state that any one person is better than another traditional values are planted firmly in rugged individualism and that all men were created equal by their creator do you feel labeling someone a having a superiority complex is not disparaging
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,explanations arent excuses
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why would he be in pancakes parents basement
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,interesting i think its pretty sad still theres plenty of words that can be used to mean shit which dont associate with a particular group shit being one of them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,death to pancakes thinks youre a bad person now youre fucked
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no the point was that nobody gives a shit about it they voted for other reasons the only people that voted solely on lgbt issues are gay people who have an extreme interest in the outcome and really really homophobic people who have an extreme interest in the outcome both are minorities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if thats the case the vast majority are a hell of a lot stupider than i gave them credit for honestly who the fuck has the mental energy to waste on worrying about such insignificant and irrelevant crap as that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are you saying the vast majority of voters are transgender
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,his vp voted against making gay people a minority which has legal effects that is a fact you can and most find it logical to interpret this as antigay not tolerant or simply intollerant but literally anti gay
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what am i supposed to do get aversion therapy so i dont have a phobia about biker gays or should i just deny they make me feel uncomfortable because what has been done to me by their kind before maybe we just need to sit the abused kids down with the priesthood and tell them its wrong to fear them too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also worth remembering that we use black and dark as negative descriptors all the time blackhearted dark humor etc and the usage equates darker colors with evil
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats a really bad comparison and i think you are negating the relative power of words i dont get offended by expletives throw at me due to your irish white background may not be comparable to the nword and faggot be thrown at black and gay people since those words have real power in modern western civilization i dont think its weak for a black person to be offended by the nword or for a gay person to be offended by faggot in certain situations its a warning that they may be in danger of physical harm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre a closet homophobe i mean that as a compliment
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as you mention traditional values change over time so what would be a better term for someone who does not accept what you mention which is that everyone is created equal if superiority complex is disparaging and stubborn traditionalist is disparaging what is an accurate nondisparaging term to clearly define someone unwilling to accept everyone as equal if traditionalist includes the belief that all folks are equal we cant use that term what do we use antitraditionalist traditionalist sans equality for all by your definitition a traditionalist would be all about equality and acceptance therefore homophobe is not used to disparage a traditionalist rather it is used to expose the hypocrisy of a traditionalist who believes that everyone is equal except for some if there are exceptions to equality it is not equality
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can you give me a time stamp i dont see where my questions are addressed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so wait when you use something that sounds like an excuse to me thats an explanation but when others try to explain things in context theyre excuses this is the definition of hypocrisy you sound like those dirty liberals you hate so much
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it sucks that the state of discussion has gotten so poor that you have to worry about whether im trolling or not the point is taken for some of them it probably really sucks to hear retard as an insult even if not directed at them directly but i think there are some confusing things here that use of identify is at the very least nonstandard im fine with technical jargon but its a bit confusing especially when aware that they are x is a lot clearer and really helps the crossculture divide when not talking to people who share this worldview for a lot of people identity is conceived of as something that we have control over we choose to identify this way or that rather than identity being the acceptance of our state for me for example its not a big part of my identity that i am for example extremely tall though i am in fact that way and aware of it in the culture that surrounds me it would sound incredibly peculiar for me to say i identify as tall i think it would sound so odd that people would think i am parodying the left i also think its an error to conceive of groups of people as a monolith and act as though general rules apply to everyone equally i know people who have disabilities who appreciate the use of these terms around them as they feel that other people walk on eggshells and that it is a sign of relaxation and honesty to use them also i think youre focusing on this person or that person feels offended and i think thats very compassionate but there also is another element that we should consider which is that our feelings are very subjective in the sense that they are shaped by a lot of things our worldviews shape our feelings our experiences shape them our temperaments we can all think of examples of people who get upset about things that we believe to be objectively unworthy of being upset over that the offense exists in the mind rather than in reality the right might say that someone like zarna joshi is an example and the left might say that someone like alex jones is this way i think we need to look for a balance and objectivity in this and not let one viewpoint outweigh the other but i also think the current climate is more polarizing than ever
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nothing nowadays is ever in the middle anymore everything is always to the max anymore especially on the internet and in the media even our politics are no different nowadays youre either a tax stealing america hating commie or racist fascist hitlerite if you dont share someone elses opinion our news spins everything to be the next armageddon and everything is constantly blasting the most ridiculous claims to get peoples attention because all that matters nowadays is views rather than any adherence to decency or fact its no surprise that we as a society turn to the absolute extremes almost casually in modern vernacular it isnt enough that we call someone or something effeminate flamboyant or unmanlynot cool it has to be taken to not just an extreme but with a comparison to a stereotype if someonesomething is stupid it isnt enough to call it dumb or absolutely moronic you gotta compare it to a mentally handicapped person its the natural evolution when cuss words stop losing their value older people freak out at the freeness younger people use curse words because they werent used as often and thus carried more weight nowadays you can barely hold a conversation without these sentence enhancers as spongebob puts it and then theres the elephant in the room the nword people get up in arms about how non poc use it but its so pervasive in popular music and in pop culture that its lost a lot of the umph that it made when someone actually said it and people use it because it gets validated by popular music lyrics therefore it must be okay right add onto that the fact that its the only racial slur used positively within its own racial group and you have an awkward situation indeed seriously you ever heard a white person say sup cracker or my cracker or an japanese guy say sup jap it doesnt happen but we never talk about how that affects our perception of that word or the people who it represents language is constantly evolving and while i might not agree with the wateringdown of the meaning of the offensive words we use i can only see it getting worse until new even more offensive extreme statements can be the new standard
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nobody voted solely on lgbt issues im saying that is just as important as the other issues for many people i dont know why you guys are getting upset i never said solely i said it was an issue to not admit that is utterly stupid take a look at nc the governor wouldnt have switched out if that wasnt an issue people looked forward society affects you a bathroom law might not but gay marriage or something might its not that hard to get or maybe you just support a cause so in that way it affects you geez i dont care what the original poster said the comments i replied to stated that the issues essentially didnt matter no they werent the issue but that doesnt mean it was a big one
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this the reason a misogynist racist bigot like trump got into the white house is because of dismissive attitudes like yours if you think that the average american welcomes the idea of sharing the public washroom used by themselves and their children with a transvestite then youre the one whos delusional you think this kind of change can just be foisted on the general public and theyll be ok with it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you know trump supported the lgbt community right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hes falsely saying the vast majority of americans voted based on the fear of having a transgender person use the same bathroom as them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you think sucking dick should give you minority status the fuck
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the fact that you just compared yourself to a child abused by the clergy is astounding to me please enlighten me how many times and how many separate gay biker types have copped a feel
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the usage of those words dont come from racist attitudes they come from a time things like street lights and torches didnt exist darkness and blackness in the exposed you have refer to darkness in the literal sense the night is a lot more dangerous and scaryevil when there are no good sources of light its also the reason most cultures monsters and demons come out at night
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how about we just use words in a non disparaging context and grow up about it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are you triggered or something this comment is drenched in sjw tears and irony
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so my opinion is negated because im of european descent trust me i understand racial discrimination try being the only redneck in a neighborhood of strictly hispanic families you grow thick skin really quick or you learn kungfu and fight the whole neighborhood i went with the former and suggest the rest of my beloved generation of millennial americans do the same prejudism is alive and well in the world it isnt going to stop just because you need a safe space because that bad mans words hurt your feelings because lets be honest your grandparents fought to end the segregation of the races in america no more white only water fountains no more stepping off the side walk so that piece of shit bigot can feel better than you stop trying to reintegrate that shit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can you show me any evidence that this is a cultural phenomenon of the phrase closet homophobe meant as a compliment because i can show you endless testimonies of people who say the word gay means something different to them you can claim it to mean whatever you like it just seems extremely disingenuous especially since there is no evidence of it being a cultural meme like the word gay but again you have no real argument you position is essentially i know you are but what am i i wouldnt expect anything different from someone who is attempting to police what others say on the grounds of fee fees
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,language is fluid just because a term is a pejorative doesnt automatically mean its directed at a certain group many many people in this thread have been trying to explain that they dont mean it like people take it the fact is you dont get to decide what i mean when i say a word stop trying to police language
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would recommend asking them what they want to be called i feel this is the best course of action when defining a human would you not agree i am not sure who you are trying to define is the sole parameter someone who believes not all are equal no other defining points thats a rather broad brush traditional values are about equality not acceptance traditional american values are based in rugged individualism it is about proving yourself to be self reliant acceptance only comes once you have proven yourself as an addition to the team in other words you have earned your respect homophobe loosely means fearing the lgbtq community that is not the case a strong percentage of the community can careless what they are doing or fucking as long as you aint fucking with them this is a shiny attribute of rugged individualism the word homophobic is in fact used as a marketing tool america prides itself on having massive balls and not backing down this again comes fromrugged individualism saying to an american they are afraid is a provocation to prove they are not if they do not prove they are not scared of that community then they only prove it its called a double bind the term itself is created to be divisive and cause division this is an attempt to create what we have now a series of people trying to showcase how not scared of the lgbtq community they are by offering them unfounded acceptance based solely on their sexual preference this then creates tension in the nations community since it disrupts rugged individualism here proving ones worth before acceptance is given there is a history of people of oppressed communities being accepted in the oppressing community in our history this is for one reason they did something to earn that acceptance into the other communities that is how it works this works both ways this is why people having pissing contest to show how accepting the can be to the lgbtq community it is to gain acceptance into that community and not feel ostracized
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it came seconds after the time i linked it all comes down to the type of society we want i want a society where strength and courage are valued not weakness id rather try and foster people who are thick skinned than tight lipped people like this guy are the ones i think we should look up to not perpetual victims
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not upset solely is the wrong word i guess you said it had the greatest influence on the election which i was disagreeing with i was not saying it didnt have impact but that is was not as big as a decider on voting than other topics i personally want gays to have equal rights but when i cast my vote it is not even a thought
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is just silly i know people who voted for trump and i followed the election pretty closely and i dont remember keeping trans people out of certain bathrooms being a major issue
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no trump got into the whitehouse because people like you who calls anyone who doesnt agree with them a racist misogynist or a bigot america is tired of you snowflakes we needed real change and to stop catering to angry liberals who constantly have something to protest because theyre not getting their way public restrooms are the least of our worries we need to fix this culture of hand holding and safe spaces first
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wah that person is differeeeeeent grow the fuck up and find something that actually matters to concern yourself with
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you do realize trump openly supported the lgbt community he is the only presidential candidate who has he held up the gay pride flag and openly supported them so learn what youre talking about before you start throwing out those buzzwords you love so much
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,being born with a different sexual orientation is no different from having a different skin color
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you tell me mr slave
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not suggesting that they were borne directly out of racist attitudes obviously the english recognized the color black before actually meeting black people but what they imply is pretty plainly racist or more accurately colorist the color black bad dark bad black people are dark im not suggesting that we should pcify our language just pointing out the doublethink
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats a savage misunderstanding of my point this is not about having thick skin its about the very real and actionable power of words and if you only rely on your own narrow experience to draw conclusions about bigotry and hate and ignore the larger context and impact then this is a pointless discussion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,really when someone tells you they dont mean homosexual when they use gay you should stop trying to force meaning on it and accept what they say youre saying people cant force meaning on your words but wont allow me the same privilege whos extremely disingenuous
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there was person and he didnt say anything about twitter why is it that this single person is relevant and not all the others who have a different opinion like myself whose comment you already saw above it all comes down to the type of society we want i want a society where strength and courage are valued not weakness id rather try and foster people who are thick skinned than tight lipped people like this guy are the ones i think we should look up to not perpetual victims telling people that theyre thin skinned perpetual victims has never turned anyone courageous and strong its naive at best that this will create a better society the society you want is one where personal problems are not addressed or rather only the ones you care about are important but instead are mocked and dismissed you want a society where people who speak about issues they care about and you dont are being treated like they dont matter plus how is not strong and courageous to voice an opinion in public and stand up for what you believe is right your group does the same thing ps words are inherently powerless if he truly believed that then he wouldnt use the words like whiny piss baby to insult others
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think i did im not the op that got down votes they said that maybe i said something similar idk
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he held a flag upside down that read lgbt for trump if he truly supported lgbt rights he wouldnt have mike electrocute gay youths pence for a vp or jeff sessions who repeatedly voted against lgbt rights
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont keep a count on your pecker victim
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i went to home
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well i honestly think itd be pretty gay to start acting all butthurt about our language as long as a word isnt used to offend people should be more gay about the usage of words
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre calling for the entire world to be a safe space from the big bad f word how exactly is that any different
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,words only have the power you give them its a simple mind over matter issue you shouldnt mind because the opinion of sheep doesnt matter i am not ignoring anything but rather seeing the larger picture that is this narrow minded individual whom is slinging insults in your general direction does not affect you physically so ignore it unless it is causing you some kind of actual issue besides a strong case of the qqs it doesnt matter what it is they are saying tell me until youre blue in the face but it wont change the truth
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre not being honest if you had felt this way you wouldnt be arguing against me from the beginning magically you now are in a very obvious gotcha attempt i think you can say whatever you want but dont try to tell me youre being genuine with homophobe being a compliment anyway this will be the last reply ill let you have the last word since you seem to need it so much
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im sorry but thats not something i buy into it was used negatively by kids and young adults for the three most recent decades to refer to traditionally feminine behaviour coming from a man considering how youre arguing with me now about its usage i would bet that it meant a range of things then as it does now the fact is youre trying to police language and use it as a shaming tool or cudgel to further your obvious agenda look we are under no obligation to be nice to you we all have to deal with shit i deal with being mixed race and not really belonging in either i deal with being female and while enjoying sports im simply not up on the same level as my male friends this is a fact im tired of people trying to force their shit on other people we all go through adversity the only way through it is to deal with it and rise above complaining and forcing others to change themselves through shame will never work it will simply drive the wedge further between us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there were many other camp guys echoing the same in the video my point was people are individuals not monolithic groups that person was referred to because according to you a word that he uses to describe himself was disparaging to him maybe most that share his orientation sure the voices of the minority matter no group agrees on everything hence i pointed his out telling people that theyre thin skinned perpetual victims has never turned anyone courageous and strong false premise that thats the methodology im suggesting that im actually suggesting that as some panacea how is not strong and courageous to voice an opinion in public and stand up for what you believe is right if its that other people need to use less mean words doesnt strike me as courage maybe im wrong or he uses the words whiny piss baby because they are harmless not going to maim or kill anyone hes right though words have no inherent a very key word power they are sounds made by vocal cords oscillating its how people react that gives them power what does a mentality of perpetual victim have to do with inner strength the entire mentality of the ctrl left is to bubble wrap everything thats not bravery here in lies the problem they are suggesting problems which as you stated are personal problems are to be solved by everyone else these people have a dramatically unhealthy world view many of them literally suffer because of it because the ideology places them as a permanent victim of some phantom oppressor it tells them their personal problems are societies go to srs the place aught to have a suicide hotline blaming all of your troubles on a hated other is not a healthy mindset what these people need is to get away from these groups to not focus on their suffering endlessly allow themselves to heal sure there are more moderate groups than that but the mindset is endemic i want peoples personal problems addressed personally if its bad enough to warrant it therapeutically you seem to imply a lot about what i want despite supposedly not being able to infer that a man that says you can call him a name to his face might not care if you do it on twitter its about more than words to me its about pushing against an ideology that can only bring harm suffering and division my friend is under going treatment for actual ptsd and everything suggested by these groups such as identifying ones self as the victim making that an identifying part of who you are tells me thats the exact opposite way therapists instruct to deal with the issue of victimhood
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh shit sorry thought your comment was a continuation of op
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,some people can pass as white though jews italians and irish immigrants were at one point not considered white but they eventually were a big part of that is that they can look the part
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,at least you admit that your are a perpetrator
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,please stop trying to force meaning on my words
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just to be sure im not calling you a homophobe closet or otherwise
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you should really listen to your own advice you said he was shaming you who said he was shaming he did not say he was shaming you youre deciding what he means when he says words the fact is youre trying to police his language and use it as a shaming tool to further your obvious agenda
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think a lot of people did haha
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no no you seem confused in more respects than just misinterpreting my last comment i have committed no crime i dont touch up random people but you seem to be obsessed with painting yourself as the victim to these evil insidious gay bikers and i think it is funny and cute in equal measure poor little wallflower
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not trying to police language but nice try im pointing out that your effort to stop other from doing something is a futile you can continue if youd like but you will never get the result you want i dont have control over others language and you dont either in fact you shouldnt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he is trying to police language but you dont because you say so thats a great argument also please stop trying to shame me its your right to shame me but i would prefer not to be shamed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive clearly explained what i mean that fact that you take it differently is why we are here in the first place im saying you do or say whatever you like as long as it doesnt infringe on my rights saying gay doesnt infringe on your rights im pointing out to you that your effort is futile
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,saying closet homophobe doesnt infringe on your rights either or is homophobe better by the way when i use those terms i totally mean them as a compliment
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes and you are totally welcome to say it do you see the difference in what im saying what youre saying its just clear that its you trying to have a gotcha moment but whatever ive said about all there is to say on this topic and you seem to disagree and rather than make cogent arguments you have devolved into nananananbooboo at this point ill be tapping out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when someone argues using the same logic as you you bail gotcha i agree with your point about my arguments thats exactly how i feel about yours have a nice day no sarcasm this time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,good concept and execution but minus points to for the flagrant clickbait a hunger games pic for the most extreme cases of the book was better than the movie when it doesnt actually make the list any list come on
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i have only found the movie better than the book once forrest gump was a terrible book
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,david brins the postman was a great novel its one of my all time favorites the movie even if it not being compared to the novel comes up short kevin costner didnt understand the main character
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am legend i think is a good example when book is a way better than movie
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not every movie can be watchmen odd to see watchmen being held up as the perfect adaption considering how much most fans hate it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the giver was a great book i read it over years ago when i heard about the movie coming out i was beyond excited but after watching it i was so disappointed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres a bias against movie versions no matter how well theyre done simply because theyre forced to omit some material not to mention its tough to beat the experience of following the story for the first time so the book wins for those who read the book first
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lord of the rings
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,star wars
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,james bond
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i did enjoy will pattons performance as general bethlehem though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am legend is the classic example of the movie having basically one or two things in common with the book and nothing else one of the things it had in common was the name of the moviebook
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dunno yeah the book has that phenomenal twist ending where the doctor realizes hes the monster but aside from that its just pulp and not particularly well written i found the movie much more entertaining overall but they just let that test audience change the ending and hence the entire point of the story
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it has plenty of shots taken directly from panels the problem was that it was adapted at all every bit of nuance is lost as a movie because its a story of how gray morality is and the big screen just isnt the best place for it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but the book is pretty great
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,movies and comics have different ways of telling stories by over relying on comic book he adds nothing and it actually hurts the film zach snyder simply does not understand storytelling or mediums
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i found it very plodding and heavy on mostly irrelevant details not that theres anything wrong with that but it can be boring for someone used to more modern books with much less world building and more focus on plot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its pretty much based in the style of old norseanglosaxon epics so of youre not used to the style it can get pretty heavy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,tolkien didnt really find his pace until the two towers i absolutely love that story war of the ring but his literary autism in fellowship was almost unforgivably bad and is the reason why a lot of folks give up on the series before it gets good
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cool i didnt actually know that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so the series does get better after the first book also i think i love that term literary autism what exactly did you mean by that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,late reply sorry basically tolkien forgot about the audience this is fine sometimes artists can achieve some pretty strange and wonderful things when they get lost in their art but in this case i think he was just metaphorically rocking back and forth writing hundreds of lines about party favors and horse markings while we are left trudging through it all wondering when hell get back on track
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i built this viz by downloading data from the united states department of labor and the united states department of agriculture i scrap the online tables using excel power query after cleaning the data i created the viz in tableau which is composed of sheets
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nice set the visual shows that obese and non obese do the same things
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would recommend changing the year in the source the most recently available data was collected in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes i really found that interesting no much differences in behavior obese dudes watch a bit more tv i have to say im jealous of that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it kinda makes me wonder whether the data the participants provided was accurate nevertheless nice job op very interesting
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,valid question with this much data i would think that the inaccuracies should be minimal my conclusion would be the volume intensity is the differentiating factor between obese and nonobese just walking minutes a day is different than intense exercise similarly binge eating for an hour is different than eating in moderation wonder if there is any dataset on that it would have to be same unit of measure so probably calories
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would assume the differences are the type of activities they engage in and type of foods they consume a known contributing factor to obesity is cheap high calorie foods it seems that obese people are eating more but what theyre eating is higher is calories also the exercising differences did seem somewhat significant to me the difference between the amount an obese person exercised and a normal weight person exercised was roughly half normal weight men obese men normal weight women obese women they looked like small slivers on the chart but when you actually examine the numbers you see how signally different they are
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly what came to mind the obese seem to spend slightly less time eating than the normal weight group which would be a fair foundation for a study about slow smallportion eating hmmm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,data from parsing w python then visualization in r interruptions coding manual but based on video from cnn
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but wasnt it found that he interrupted around times why are there only lines
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe there some interruptions are overlapping each other as there is no timescale
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thinks true i didnt take that into account but i was gathering i would see a hell of a lot more lines but all things considered
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive seen a handful of different numbers quoted on the interruption count all depends on what you include the coding here is admittedly rough since i had to do it by hand though based on video and probably on the low side mostly was trying to figure out if the trough in response length earlier on in debate was driven by higher interruption rate which seems to be the case edit also i think theres a fine line between crosstalk and interruption
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and yeah to chims point sometimes things that could be considered distinct interruptions get bucketed together in the transcript i can throw up the full data im using on google sheets if folks want to check it out

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,posts regarding american politics and contentious topics in american media are only permissible on thursdays edt please repost your link on thursday this post has been removed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for a much more complete answer than you will get in a typical reddit reply check out this very high quality piece on this very topic for a tldr textbook companies market to the professor and dont discuss price the professor isnt spending her own money so she doesnt ask she only asks for cool features online markets make reselling much easier so publishers make basically no revenue the year following a new release they respond by making new releases every year the publisher still sells fewer books so they try to make up the difference by increasing the price students dont want to spend more so they are more likely to pirate for the publishers response see and
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,at least these two factors textbook publishers getting smart about changing editions rapidly to undermine the used market and enable themselves to more effectively use their monopoly to get away with absurdly high pricing drop in the broader discretionary textbook marketfewer people buy textbooks to learn something outside of a class and instead use the internet that means that the demand for textbooks is inelastic and it also means that publishers have a smaller market and have a harder time covering their fixed costs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,student loans subsidized loans cause rise in prices to meet the size of the loans want more people to have higher education build more community colleges dont subsidize loans
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,captive audience you must buy this book i had to buy a little book that cost a fortune guess who wrote it my professor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is my guess supply side the items above the line are not mass produced or scaled except for textbooks the ones at the bottom are mass produced and scalable thus are going to be cheaper over time demand side as another redditor pointed out heavily inflated items are mostly necessities or otherwise perceived to be people are not as price sensitive to the changes and are more willing to pay more for them seeing how textbook is an odd one out i guess its very likely textbooks prices are set as a portion of tuition fees to market and match what people are willing to pay for education does the relatively more expensive nessesities leave less disposable income for individuals to spend on tvs or does cheaper luxury give the individual more reverse disposable income to be spent on housingeducation healthcare
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whatever other factors may be driving it the foremost is the failure of students to perceive and trust their collective power to say no if there was a organized movement to resist rising textbook prices by simply refusing to buy them the educational publishing industry would be shaken to its core overnight i promise
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it looks like textbooks are purposefully set as a percentage of the tuition costs the other thing is that textbook arent exactly supply and demand the required textbooks are set by the courses if you want to pas the course you need the book they have a captive market also from that graph looks like the bottom is dropping out of the software market anyone know where the source data set for this comes from
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i believe that its probably explained by the fact that college and healthcare are seen as necessities we cant not go to hospital if we want to go somewhere in life college is still seen as a necessity we see the prices rise heavily on these therefore because they know they can get away with rising prices both of these are unchecked by the state and that means that even though people cannot avoid going to college for a large number of professions and they cannot avoid going to hospital if they are ill these places can set their own prices and because theyre able to set their own prices they do and colleges can trade on their name harvard can rip people off and people will still fight over the right to be ripped off by harvard because its harvard and they expect a return on it by the same token textbooks often have captive audiences often courses require that textbooks are bought and then people are forced to buy them this means that whatever price that textbook is is the price they must pay
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just one thought to build off of a few other comments the rate of inflation seems somewhat correlated to the principalagent problem that is consumers picking which textbooks to use or colleges to attend generally dont pay for them the opposite is true for goods like tvs or software i anticipate that if you solve the principalagent problem the increase in the cost of textbooks will even out somewhat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,service industry costs have increased manufacturing has decreased big exception is textbooks
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your submission was removed for violating the following rules directly link to the httpwwwredditcomrdataisbeautifulwikiindexwikioriginalsources of the visualization or tag the post as if you made the visualization this post has been removed please once you believe the post is ready to be reinstated for information regarding this and similar issues please see the httpswwwredditcomrdataisbeautifulwikiindex if you have any questions please feel free to httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetordataisbeautifulsubjectquestion regarding the removal of this submission by have a question regarding the removal of this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,anything essential to our survival is becoming overly inflated due to our lack progress action no wonder the middle class in america is falling we dont have enough disposable income because of these high inflation rates our incomes arent increasing at this same rate hope we go bankrupt again and all these student loan firms go broke and new regulations are made seems like the only way shit gets fixed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this as the exwife of a college textbook rep for a major publisher the usedpirated market for textbooks virtually ensures the costs will go up every year imagine you have spent years establishing your reputation in your field you then spend years more researching and writing your book you hire grad students usually out of your own pocket but sometimes with limited grant funds to do some of the grunt work aka running your formulas and equations to make sure they make sense seriously writing a textbook is not like writing fiction you cant just make shit up the average textbook takes years from conception to completion assuming youve had to take at least some unpaid sabbatical time to write the damn thing you finally are ready for editingpublishingthen a colleague from another university has a breakthrough in your field then more revisions more delays you get published finally then adopted by however many colleagues at other universities are not writing their own books then the student pirating startsand the underground sales youre lucky if half of the publishers projections come true now there are how many thousand copies of your book out there why would anyone need to buy it for next semester
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a death spiral that will not stop until finally professors wise up and stop using textbooks written by others colleges should just write and maintain their own libraries from their own staff and make it available to students
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,beat me to it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,only one reason that matters the person who chooses the textbook is not the person who has to pay for it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also worth noting the digitalization of textbooks means fewer or no printing costs so changing editions couldnt be simpler the integration of automatically graded assignments means professors are encouraged to force their students to by the most uptodate version ie the digital version with the graded assignments integrated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the shitty thing is though a lot of professors are using a required digital version of the textbook that is integrated into a webbased program you know log in read the content in your browser take the quiz at the end the integrated quizzes and the homework are the key components imagine youre a professor and a publisher comes to you and says hey if you use our textbook all homework and quizzes are integrated online and graded automatically so you can focus on xyz hard to say no and impossible to do without purchasing for the entire package in other words not only are the publishing companies able to claim you need to buy the most uptodate book they can now a force you to with the graded work element and b do so without even having to print new books
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont really accept the used pirated excuse for making textbook prices so high theres analogues for both in the existing economy that show theyre manageable for used textbooks think about the car industry it costs over billion to develop a new car years of work thousands of manhours hundreds of physical tests to make sure its ready for sale as regulations get tighter around the world development costs are only going up yet despite the prevalence of a massive used car market of which car companies dont see a cent they are still making money why because people like new things more than old things broadly speaking and rfrugal notwithstanding the same would absolutely apply with textbooks many students who can afford clean untampered textbooks would prefer them over used ones the pirate argument is even simpler because its a solved problem in other market segments music movies and ebooks have all realised that increasing prices makes piracy worse cheaper prices and subscription models have massively reduced the piracy problem in music and tv and you the publisher are still making bank out of them used and pirated textbooks are a market response to increasing prices not a cause of them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,right now if a good student goes to a crummy school but reads the same textbooks they use everywhere else they can still learn the material as well as a student at a great university you are suggesting that we deliberately move away from that system
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so you are suggesting that the author get no monitory gain for the fruits of their labor should somewhat like slavery
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they offer the digital only version but since the digital only version also comes with a digital copy of the textbook its pretty much bucks off the physical copy with digital code
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,completely different thing though and its scope is far smaller than student loans
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah the high prices probably do make it pirated more and a subscription model seems nice for this however im not sure you can compare textbooks to the media you mentioned since the demand is different you have to have access to a textbook which is not really true for the others
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you are comparing two very different economies here when we set out to purchase a car we have a multitude of options make model style year etc we get to choose how much to spend and what to spend it on competition in the marketplace results in companies coming up with newer better designs based upon what the consumer wants a college student does not get to choose which textbook heshe chooses to buy for a particular class even though heshe is the consumer the adoption of a text is the choice of the professor and with good reason which i wont go into in much detail however imagine a computer science class where each student uses whatever text they choose some may be current and relevant to the curriculum but some may be outdated irrelevant and even simply wrong my point is because of the nature of education curricula and subject matter texts are not designed to appeal to the final consumer the student they are designed to serve a purpose determined by the professor andor the curriculum basically the student has only one choice in making the purchase of the text new usually more expensive or used usually cheaper
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe this is a sign the market is saturated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah without even mentioning the downfalls of unique textbooks that idea requires that every professor who teaches a course actually write a book on it their time is already mostly outside the lab begging for grants as it is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if the class is required for your major you have no choice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the captive market is probably the only reason the textbook racket has survived as long as it has for sure the fundamentals of supply and demand still hold true though the demand for textbooks in total is pretty inelastic but the demand for legitimate new textbooks the ones that make publishers money is much more elastic because the people priced out of that market will go to used or pirated books instead lower the price more people buy your stuff
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and when a prof writes their own book theyre extra motivated to price it highly because they can force their own classes to buy it at whatever price they set the most egregiously overpriced books i ever had to buy were all the ones written by the prof of the course
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sometimes they give their own book to the class for free it would seem that they should at least be able to negotiate a discount
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well theres two sides to that though if a professor spends a month writing a book thats at minimum over they must recoup for the university selling it to students and you can see the book is damn cheap at what they sell it for and most professors make more than you need at least a little bit of an economy of scale to justify high quality materials
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they may be permitted but thats the exact opposite of my experience when i had profs write their own books were terrible textbooks that i guarantee you no prof anywhere else ever chose to use and were spectacularly overpriced compared to comparable options it was an easy way for the prof to guarantee themselves income because they could set any price and force students in their class to pay it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the point is that usually you need to make it a book that is sufficiently worthwhile that lots of people will choose to use it if no prof besides the author uses it to teach its not much of a textbook and perhaps should have never been written leaving the students to buy a book used by many other classes rather than a vanitybook written and used solely for an individual prof and sold at whatever price they wish
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i kept getting refreshed to the top of this fucker several times im on mobile wtf is up with that shit also i liked this thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is absolutely beautiful thorough and amazingly well done
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,very informative and pleasing to look at thanks for introducing me to the show
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is amazing i dont even like dbz and this is one of the nicest visualizations ive come across in this sub so far if you ever feel like touching the gundam universes let me know lol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for the love of god do not click this if youre on firefox caused a massive black screen and needed a computer restart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cant even see it because it refreshes whenever i try to scroll down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same issue here does anyone have a solution
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,adds loading sometimes does that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did the same thing to me i even tried to open in the app and my browser
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sorry added a window refresh thing in the last instant when a friend suggested it removed it so i hope its better now im more of a data analyst visualizer than a frontender hehe just trying my best
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id say join us at rdbz but thats filled with dragon ball super content which is the next series in the dragon ball chronology so feel free to join us after you make it through dragon ball z in order to avoid the inevitable spoilers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you although i have to admit i never truly watched gundam so those chances are slim s i actually dove into shojo manga after that so im afraid it would sooner be cardcaptor sakura haha
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yup sorry about that too if somebody can tell me how to improve performance in nonchrome browsers without saying remove the whole visual id love to learn as i said in another comment im more of a data analystvisualizer than frontender so still have lots to learn just trying my best
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same thing happened to me also using firefox
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,firefox here was fine for me adblockghosterysharemenot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah its about time to watch another good anime will do
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if youre going to torrent it id suggest downloading dbz kai it cuts out on the episodeslong power ups
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for the recommendation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,was the gdp percentage due to decline or due to the rapid growth of other countries this type of visualization doesnt answer such an important question it would be helpful to show a line of gdp growth over time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,till about years ago india accounted for more than a quarter of the worlds gdp this share began falling following the advent of british power over the subcontinent statements like this irritate me because they insinuate that this decline in share was because of some nefarious domineering activity carried out by the british to take away indian wealth when it really was just the industrial revolution creating new wealth in britain meaning that the british gdp grew faster than the indian gdp eventually overtaking it i mean what could the british possibly of taken anyway to cause such a change in wealth indias cattle also while india seems to be moving in the right direction i certainly would not go as far to say that theyll eventually raise to having a gdp equal to their proportion of the worlds population after all china has had incredible growth for decades and theyre still below the global gdp per capita average unless you think that india is gearing up to enter a growth phase that exceeds what china has accomplished in the last years india will never achieve such an incredible rise in economic clout
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,saying india was usually the biggest or second biggest economy is rubbish india is a massive region with so many people its simply not fair comparing india to eg uk this shit is so irritating i see it all the time its like when people compare norway to the us norway that has million people is not by any means comparable to the us with million people the us is like the entire european continent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this might as well be called indias share of global gdp since year to theres no data for any period between and thats a longer periode than between and for all we know it may have dropped substantially and then recovered before
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or maybe other technology advanced so fast that india essentially got left behind colonialism wouldnt destroy the largest economy in the world if that were in fact the case at the time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont know much about history but im pretty sure india didnt exists in the way it does today thats around before the british got there right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is wrong and uwisemanwiseguy and uhoudvast are right europes economy did not grow because it stole from asia or the americas until about gdp was almost entirely a function of population until the past few centuries agriculture was until the century almost entirely driven by human and animal power httpsenwikipediaorgwikiworldpopulationestimatesbyworldregion for example africa and the americas had of world population compared to for europe alone and for asia in africa and the americas had compared to for asia and for europe since east asia and india historically has had the bulk of the worlds population they had the bulk of the worlds economy in the century the industrial revolution began in europe which presaged httpiimgurcomapegfmapng for the first time their economies grew much faster than population did in the second half of the century east asia and india also industrialized europe and america lost their relative advantage this really means however that the global economy is reverting to the historical norm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,obviously total gdp has grown tremendously around india america russia and africa were producing hardly anything back in the pie got a whole lot bigger if their intention was to show the damage done by colonialism perhaps they should use china our persia as a control
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes it can when the europians mainly the british go to lengths to extract as much money as they coud in the form heavy increment in taxes closing down kingdoms and taking over their wealth and taking over the trade as well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dunno complete forced destruction of the local textile and steel industry using the rajs legislationnot to mention forcing locals to import products made from the raw materials purchased from them at a discount does kinda kill a local economy doesnt it also forcing farmers to produce cash crops instead of rice without having a mechanism to distribute food and causing one of the biggest famines in known history didnt help either i am sure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its interesting how insidious the notion is that economics is a zero sum function i constantly talk with people who think someone has to lose money for another to make it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not taking any sides but this video is quite insightful
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but in the end we do make comparisons wthin countries dont we how else do we do it you suggest
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the europians did make advances in technology during the industrialization era that helped them come up with better weapons and ships which did help them defeat empires in india and takeover the region and extract as much money out of its economy as they coud colonization in asia and africa is how europian countries like briton france germany holland etc got so rich so yeah india did get left behind in technology but the effect was different than what you think
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,tell that to the kohinoor sitting in tower of london there was no united india before so from a social and economic suppressive colonial rule india took around years to attain some level of economic stability to accept and develop the technology as you mentioned
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,technological advancement require money and resourcesbritain was popular for its lootingraping and murderingunethical ways which historians acknowledge but never discuss
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is there any country that exists today the way it did in ad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yet no one has a problem when comparing say education or healthcare between the us and norway people in the us constantly have to hear about how great some small homogeneous european country with a strict immigration policy is doing in terms of education or crime yet as soon as someone makes a comparison that makes the us look better oh its not a fair comparison wtf i said the same shit above its not fair to compare a country the size of a continent with a proportional population to some smallass place
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,per capita is a thing for a reason you cannot just say the us produces x trillions india has a gdp per capita usd in case youre not aware this is extremely fucking low the us has a gdp per capita above india has a longass way to get still and this garbage about being a top gdp country is exactly that garbage if you lump the entire fucking region together with billion people obviously they will be producing a lot the indian subcontinent is a massive region with a lot of communities languages and subcultures
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is such bullshit colonization is how germany got rich come on is it also how finland got rich or how portugal became poor most of the wealth built with colonization was spend years ago the only wealth left after was human capital ideas and education
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,england vatican city japan korea not too many at all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont know maybe
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sure u coud say indias per capita income is very low no one will dispute that i actually think it is lower than what you have said but just like per capita income gdp is also considered an imp term in economics and you cannot just brush it off just because you do not like it i think that a countrys gdp is used to measure the size or power of its economy on a global scale whereas population and per capita income are more internal matters in china too per capita income is not that high but it does not change the fact that it is still the second largest and powerfull economy in the world
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,colonization took place before century didnt it so yes many countries did get rich due to it and then squandered it during the world wars some countires bounced back and some did not but that does not change the fact that countries profitted from colonization if that was not the case then why woud people from different countries try so hard to find new colonies and expand those colonies from africa to asia to america hell america was discovered because columbus was trying to get to india why do you think these people undertook such long and dangerous journeys to come to indian subcontinent because they knew there was a lot money in india even after getting to india the british french and portugese regularly fought with each other and indian empires for control over land people and trade why do think that was did they just like to fight just for fun i dont think so they also did not give up the control over indian region easily and had to be fought off for a long time same thing happened in america and many other colonys no colonial nation received freedom without a fight why do you think that is because every rulling country was making money from each of their colonies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,some of the oldest sovereign states i could find oman al said dynasty comes to power sweden independence from the kalmar union san marino formation of republican government of course the age of sovereign states will depend on the definition you use for example these three states adopted a new constitution since the dates indicated of course in any case no existing sovereign states existed in ad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my point wasnt about the viability gdp per capita i was asked how else do we do it you suggest so i answered my point was to take into consideration the population of the country and i used gdp per capita as an example since the article does in fact talk about gdp overall
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the physical wealth obtained from the colonies did make some rich and others poor but it seems of little consequence today so what causes the difference in success between india and say germany dare i say its education and even culture these may be results of colonialism but fixing them is not and can not be the responsibility of the colonizing nations
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you exactly my point so what does india mean i appreciate the downvotes but when things like this say india they mean something totally different years ago india wasnt country and was run seperatly by hindus christians and muslims different leaders philosophies economies and religions how do you contextualise that in todays india and economy the article mentions the mugals but at what point after all they lost the hindus ran india thereafter with british support so the mugal economy is worth shit right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i never said colonizing nations have a responsibilty to fix anything my point was that colonization resulted in decline in indian economy culture and way of thinking did prevent india from progressing socially and financially and it still does but like the article says financial reforms in india started in whereas they started in germany a lot sooner so germany and other europian countries definitely got a headstart while india has a lot to catch up too but it was a rich country once and it will be so again
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think what is important is rather how do you delimit india before the existence of india as a country especially when you consider that india included what we today know as pakistan and bangladesh and sri lanka as well if im not mistaken

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,bill nelson tom cotton cory gardner and jeff sessions all have no friendsfollowers in the senate they should all friend each other and form their own club
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i found this httpwwwsocialseercomresourcesussenatortwitteraccounts and used the twitter api to query the friends list for each handle then i plugged it all into to produce this chord diagram im happy to answer any questions i would really like to do the same thing for the house so any ideas are welcome too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,very cool dataviz i am a little confused at this though i would think you would just follow everyone like them or not but i guess that isnt the case
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,very cool i really like the functionality makes the chord diagram much more digestible did you start with a block or build from scratch
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is a really neat idea some time down the line would you be able to stratify these senators by color into different parties
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i saw only team rand which was rand pauls during the election however he has his own twitter handle randpaul
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no its not and i was just as surprised to see this as well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not super good with datasets whats a block i took an example from the page and then just created my own json source that matched the one in the example
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id love to improve this thanks for the suggestion how would be a good way to do this do you have any examples
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe indicate it with line color friend same party friend not same party follows same party follows not same party im just saying not same party so rd or i would match the rule
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh yea blocks are just examples if you wouldnt mind linking to it id appreciate it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe making the senator names themselves a different color based on parties eg red for republican blue for democrat etc

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,since much of the video does not contain the data analysis you may want to consider posting the actual visualization discussed in the video next time which can be found
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this visualization was made by important a csv file into tableau the viz sheets were made and placed into a dashboard the data sources are vgchartz and meta critic
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when i worked for a call center for a bank i saw several people cry in the bathroom and a couple left in ambulances from anxiety it was a good shift if i only got cussed out and personally insulted times i literally felt like i was trapped in an abusive relationship people are unbelievably awful to customer service reps
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when i used to work in sales i hated myself and everyone else after about months
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not the interaction with lots of people thats the problem per se its that the more people you interact with the higher your chances of interaction with some of those bottom of the barrel creatures that we shouldnt call human anyone whos ever worked retail or service knows
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,makes sense imo the first step in living a happy life is being absolutely scrupulous in choosing who you choose to spend time with these jobs prevent you from doing this instead routinely exposing you to a random sampling of all the horrible people who exist in the world its also why high school is such a miserable experience
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its the paradox of being teacher the students are amazing and creating a space for them to grow is incredibly rewarding but if i dont balance things right i get so emotionally drained
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is obvious to anyone whos ever worked retail those jobs would be fine without the fuckin customers people are pretty shitty when they feel you owe them something by virtue of which side of the counter you happen to be standing behind
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably depressing because of all the pretending to be happy stuff i get asked a billion times a day how i am after my pet died and my breakup i just soullessly say good how are you doing it sucks
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,shocka not this is why i have been working night audit at a hotel for the past years and enjoy every freaking day of it i deal with about people a night and enjoy solitude for the rest of it best job ever yeah it pays but i wont trade it for any high paying job where i have to interact with tons of assholes nope
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as someone who has experienced both customerfacing jobs and solitary warehouse agony id like to chime in here i worked in a chronically busy chain pub in glasgow we were expected to provide excellent service to everyone and would serve a new face every few minutes it is unnatural to interact with someone in such an artificial manner and as the servant you feel like the customer owns you often as soon as something goes wrong customers are arrogant and rude when this happens constantly you begin to resent the customer and also yourself for feeling like you fail at a very simple job but its because youre not producing anything theres no fulfilment second i worked in an amazon warehouse in fife i was a picker i walked miles a day for hours and rarely saw anyone else when i did they were zooming past me most didnt acknowledge me thanks to the angel of efficiency encouraging them to beat their targets the warehouse is a metal place it is grey and yellow it is a prison the psychological impact of constant repetition and feeling like a rat in a maze was huge again i was producing nothing it was completely dehumanising with the weight of consumerism laid bare before me i was a tiny part of this megalith of capitalism i produced nothing it is time that dehumanising work is acknowledged for the psychological dent it makes in our lives it is serious my friends have recently recorded a song about work that destroys selfesteem if anyone would like to hear it send me a message sorry for my awful grammar phone hangover edit the bottle have asked me to remind all who have listened to this song that it is an unfinished work in progress despite being a belter of a tune
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,part of the reason i became a pipe welder i interact with my foreman and my coworkers at a bare minimum and spend my working hours staring through a window by myself its perfect
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this explains why i am really quite happy working in a lab where i rarely have to talk to anybody either that or im just really antisocial
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wonder if it has to do with the fact that you can never ever be yourself you have to remain positive not because you genuinely like someone but for money and customer relations you cant get angry even if anger would be justifiable because money and customer relations faking emotion is very difficult for most people it requires enormous selfcontrol even when done for personal reasons doing it professionally all day requires a kind of selfimposed deadening of the psyche and emotions which in itself exhausting
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think the most depressing jobs are the ones where you interact but dont connect its like smelling food all the time but never getting to eat any
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,one of my favourite parts of the series finale of parks and recreation was when leslie gave ron the senior park ranger job assuring that hed have as few coworkers as possible for the rest of his career brought a tear to my eye
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can be proven just by going to the motor vehicles department think of those poor souls working there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,statpedia and highcharts were used to make the figures the data were gleaned from this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,come to the er there people hit you spit on you piss on the floor defecate on the floor puke on you bleed all over you while you pray they dont have hep bc or hiv and cuss you a blue streak all while they rack up thousands of dollars in tax payercovered medical treatment that usually has no hope of being recovered and then often leave on their own volition because you wont provide them with an opiate high while over in room three the functioning member of society is suffering from a flare of a horrible chronic disease and makes absolutely no demands and apologizes to you and your nursing staff when they make a request for tylenol when their pain is so severe you know they need something like dilaudid to not feel like they are imminently dying the hospital will attempt to overbill them andor their insurance to recoup the losses on the leaches of society
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i completely agree i worked retail for years and coming in contact with hundreds of people daily is emotionally draining now i work in a cubicle where some days i dont even talk to anybody which is so much more liberating and relaxing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,boyfriend is a nurse finishing off years in the profession the shit he sees on a daily basis i dont ask about i love him until the sun dies but on the mornings he comes home and he just wants to sleep i leave him alone bringing up a bad night is like asking an amputated war vet to reenact how he lost his leg the best i can do is just hug him and make him something for breakfast my mom was a high school chemistry teacher working in a low socioeconomic district she is korean teaching mainly black and latino and year olds her face at the end of the day for twenty seven years was beyond broken she never cried but she was always very tense very angry she woke up at am and be home or absolutely done with the world teenagers are horrible creatures and the racist epithets she dealt with every day showed on her face nevermind her going to the administration theyre just as useful as the students were to her i need to go call my mom and say hi to her now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive been a server for about years bartending for another year can confirm is draining
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i work in home health mostly with the elderly i can tell you this chart is accurate the patience and compassion it takes to do this job well is exhausting the pay is not close to what you should be earning the hardest part is becoming attached to a patient and then watching them slip away into dementia or deteriorate physically
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,worked as a nursing assistant for a year and a half and it broke me as a person years later it still has changed me as a personand not in a positive way
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can confirm worked foodcustomer service for over fifteen years of you are horrible human beings with no regard for others the other make sure my faith in humanity retains a shard of itself
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,social worker here specializing in suicide and crisis as you can imagine i have a million stories some would find depressing but honestly worst ones involve the elderly i cant believe how some people are forgotten cant afford medications your kids treat you like a burden many are depressed lonely sick limited mobility and ability once a vibrant productive member of society now struggling limited options cant work need help if theyre lucky enough for a nursing home they take everything they have and well all end up there some day every last one of us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ha so people are horrible and beyond any saving this is a weird kind of comfort
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when i was a server i used to see so much ugliness in people but it also taught me a lot about myself and others
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id have to fully agree with this one of my first jobs was retail and dealing with people daily wore me out when i got home from work id seriously have to decompress not talk just do my own thing for about a half hour people are so fucking stupid and intolerant it really taught me that anyone helping me in a store to be kind and gentle to not act as if im the customer im right they arent experts like the commercial says they work at the store to pay the fucking bills now i work construction before i was military until i got injured i deal with people olcccassionally but not often and when i do its the old white ladies that are a fucking pain in my ass i hate dealing with them they are the absolute worst anyways wawnted to throw in my cents
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lawyer here everyone of the factors except pay lend themselves to litigation attorney the hours constant conflict stress etc also after doctors lawyers have the highest suicide rate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a legitimate interaction from people at my restaurant that just walked in from outside when they arrive and speak to my hostess this happens at least times a week guest hi table for hostess would you like to sit inside or out guest whats it like outside face palm most of you wont make it when the zombies come
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can confirm work in mental health teaching people to help cope with depression anxiety and etc ironically depressed myself although some days are great i love when you can visibly see someone feel better
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,right out of college i started working a customer service job and i think it ruined me i was in charge of customers returning items which mostly consists of scam artists or people pissed that there gear was broken when you hear that you are a piece of shit everyday for years you start to believe it also our bonuses were based on our customer reviews so i would just get slaughtered by people upset by company policy i eventually had enough and put in my two weeks now im afraid to go back to work since the only job experience i have is in customer service and i just cant go back to that life any suggestions for jobs that dont require taking to people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i work at mcdonalds for years the stress and emotions from dealing with asshole customers and stupid ass employees nearly pushed me to my death a death by binge eating and soda drinking dealing with people is the god damn worst been in my warehouse job for over years now even though the work is hard it pays well and work with really cool people i also finally have benefits and all of the stress in drama in my life isnt even of what i dealt with in fast food
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its nice to finally see a study into this i thought it was sort of obvious at this point but the reason depression and other mental illnesses are so prevalent today is because our society breeds it the lives were all expected to live of working for days a week for years take a huge toll on our mental health there are very few people who are lucky enough to make a living doing something they actually enjoy most people just have to grin and bear working a job they either hate or dont care for which is such a damaging way to live but even then having a job doing something youre passionate about doesnt mean its going to be fun or easy either its made worse that this mentality of just toughing it out is seen as acceptable you wouldnt work a job that physically injures you every day why work one that is going to mentally injure you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im paraprofessional works with special needs students in an elementary school and i do afterschool programming for atrisk youth and my whole day is human interaction itisexhausting when you work with people day in day out you see the worst in them and in yourself its hard to handle sometimes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i once had a man threaten to personally sue me because our online store did not carry matching pink boots for him and his daughter wait for it wait for it you know whats coming wait for it one day before christmas fun times
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i can attest to this been a realtor for years there are highs and lows the highs are really high but the lows are really depressing i sometimes imagine myself not working in sales
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,even though i work in the service industry and yes encounter my fair sure of bottom of the barrel type individuals ive found that interacting with people is about the only thing that makes me less depressed and actually gets me out of bed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think that the title doesnt quite get it right looking at this table amusement and recreation services are the ones with least depression and they deal with a lot of customers from the study while none of the industries with the highest prevalence for depression in the highmrk data were ranked in the top ten nationally for dealing with unpleasant angry or discourteous people the average rank of the top nine industries on this measure was as compared to the average rank of among the nine industries with the lowest rate of depression the nationallevel difference in level of physical activity between high and low rate industries in the highmark data was larger two of the highest rate industries were ranked in the bottom ten in physical activity and the average rank of these industries was none of the nine lowest rate industries ranked in the bottom ten in physical activity while three of them ranked in the top ten with an average rank for the group of

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i used to work in direct social services it sucked because many people were lovely and the work could be very gratifying but just enough people were so awful that it ruined everything i had headaches all the time and so much stress every morning id have a knot in my stomach fearing that id have an awful person that day ive worked retail which sucks obviously but social work in my experience was even worse in terms of being shat on by the clients
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would conjecture an alternative explanation you spend all day interacting with people just waiting to go home to relax and then you go home to an empty house where you live alone and realize how few people you actually have in your life and you desperately cant wait to get back around people im not even depressed and now im depressed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i loved working retail for or so years having everyone ask your advice is empowering it was the varying hours every single day that killed me on it so i started working factory again and never saw a female face now that is depressing

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i work at an olive garden its always very busy there i used to like people before i was employed there and now anyone that even walks in there i already do not like until they prove they arent filthy pigs who treat pasta like jesus is coming that day and if everything isnt exactly how they want it usually they want everything to be free then everyone who works there is the devil needless to say human interaction has made me a scrooge
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,while being a special tradecontractor can be seen as less depressing since you are your own boss and can many times make your own hours this job can also be a sink hole that can never be dug out of my dad is and has been a drywall contractor for the majority of his adult life and the mental and physical exhaustion is very high

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive done customer service and healthcare for about a decade its ugly and dehumanising there might be one patient you want to bend over backwards for but the before them were so verbally abusive that youre too emotionally exhausted to try and weary their kindness might be a ten minute front before they let you have it every time ive had to encounter someone who didnt want to see me as a person but an emotional punching bag i would have to mentally remind myself of what my mother said about treating all people with kindness patience and understanding those who deserve it the least need it the most i had one patient who was absolutely nasty to multiple staff members calling everyone an idiot i just thought of what my mom said and applied it not too long after our first encounter she was very friendly towards me and apologised profusely for her behaviour she said thank you for being patient with her will we always get those people who say sorry and thanks nah but i still like to try kindness and cruelty are cyclical you can perpetuate the hatred or put a small crack in the cycle with some kindness easier said than done i know
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,see there nothing wrong with me its all of you fuckers that made me like this

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,been working as a building permit coordinator for the municipalityregion where i live here in sweden the region i live in is growing significantly thus a lot of active and pending building projects worst part about this is that during the past two years ive worked here i have had different bosses for various reasons main reason being pressure from politicians and angry construction companies i started two years ago with good health right now im struggling with panic attacks and severe anxiety i never wanted to blame my work or workplace but im slowly starting to understand this is what triggered it i deal with a lot of angry customers and politicans every day all the time nbsp im not yet depressed though so ive got that going for me

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,years in retail for a major wireless carrier and i can say that you have to have armor thick skin to work with the public sad thing is those people dont know the impact they have and even when they come in for help they act like you owe them the world and need to snap to attend their needs because they dont have time to wait my response always is kindness and even though kindness rarely works it allows me to maintain my humanity so i dont lash out at others like my spouse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive always thought it would be nice to have a national database available to all customerfacing occupations where you could log problematic interactions with customers if youre engaged in an interaction with someone that is giving you trouble you can look them up on the database and have legitimate grounds to say sir youve got over one hundred entries in the global asshole database we are no longer doing business with you and no the customer is not always right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,food service for years here i dont think im depressed but i do hope everyone dies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,subway employee here only been on the job a little while but dealing with the general public reminds you of how many shitheads exist within the universe especially when they have phones to shout abuse at you over
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,humans are probably the most interesting of all beings we can be so evil but at the same time we can do things that make the world a better place for everything on it its up to us as a collective to choose which one id like to think there is a lot good out there but some stuff makes you question it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pharmacist here can confirm there are jerks i am happy to never see again but there are so many good patients i work hard to care for who slowly and inevitably have their health slide away from them super depressing lots of people who pass away also look and seem to feel quite well a couple of weeks or so before theyre gone
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it would be interesting to see an analysis over a very long line of time im talking centuries when we were selfsufficient farmers without any landlord i would presume our mental health as a lot better seems we got used to feeling like shit and taking it no one is really bringing this issue on the table but hey people dont realize they are slaves so until that occurs to the majority nothing will happen we are nothing more than a livestock to the rich
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i got into accounting to get away from people my boss has started giving us collection calls to do im looking for a new job people suck i know im one of them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that does not surprise me in the least people can be so unreasonable snotty and demanding but then again you get that one person who is so nice it just makes your day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im an rnall i do is interact a lot of it is depressing on its own seeing people chronically ill and seeing people die and those are generally the kindest people then theres the other side people that are in the hospital for relatively uncomplicated and routine issues ie appendicitis which im sure this will piss a bunch of you off youll say things like but it isnt routine for me these are the people who treat us the worst i guess they feel that since theyre having a hard time for a few days they can treat those who care for them like garbage i feel like thats how they really are as a person and are just waiting for the chance to justify it i saw a whole new side to humanity when i got into healthcare i often wonder how i would see the world if i could put my rose colored shades back on
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this supports my theory that about of people are terrible and i should avoid them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,working for customer service for a cellphone giant for a decade and now in healthcare i can confirm i dream of being a truck driver several times a day

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont doubt this working on a golf course is fantastic because i really get to keep to myself and handle my work plus being outside is nice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,operator i used to think i hated people looking back i had a mild dislike now i hate them or so calls per shift and more than are the people you see on judge judy jerry springer or cops i dont even like speaking anymore let alone holding a conversation of more than words to a stranger
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this makes me think of an ex girlfriend she told me she wanted to be in the medical field but didnt want to deal with people so she became a veterinarian now she hates cat people with a burning passion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the issue is you have to care about everyone but nobody is caring for you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my work as a emt had increased my relationship anxiety i spend so much time around the elderly dying demented and alone in nursing homes i realized recently that im so stressed out about being single because im assuming thats my fate as well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im glad ive only worked in retail in a very small community a town of people its way harder to be an asshole to someone you recognize
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the amount of bullshit i have to deal with working as a waitress for years is unimaginable you really lose your faith in humanity and your sanity when you have to deal with people in the service industry
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is the reason i left my cushy office job to become a truck driver i dont make as much but i also dont have to pretend to give a flying fuck about your problems
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,work retail can confirm was woken up by a phone call from my boss this morning telling me that the person who was supposed to work today wasnt and there was literally nobody else to cover but me i was supposed to work the second half of today and them the first this meant that the shop had been closed for hours after it was supposed to open get dressed and rush down there try to sort out getting the paperboys to come in to do their rounds late they turned up when it was supposed to open to find the shop shut also spent most of the morning and part of the afternoon trying to sort out the mess caused by opening very late and so not doing any of the opening tasks the phone rang constantly from people complaining mostly about their paper not being delivered or asking why the shop was opened late of course since i was the person they got through too they decided i was the obvious person at fault i was literally woken up came in several hours early not even having a chance to grab breakfast to clear up my colleges mess just to be told what a shitty job i was doing by customers who knew nothing of my role in that days events this was just fucking todays events fuck other humans
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,man this post couldnt be any more true for me at least i went from retail to being a union electrician and my quality of life has increased by at least tenfold use to have to make you fuckers happy now i only have the wires to please much much more electrifying if you ask me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,anyone who ever pizza manager maned for hrs a week knows what i mean at some point the worst part is just wondering what the fuck the next thing to blow your mind with stupidity or malice was the customer is always lowering my opinion of the human race that and the thoughts at like am close when someone called were just rage until the world went red spoodle spoodle spoodle i made you out of clayyyy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there is nothing harder to fix in this world than humans but there is also nothing as powerful or rewarding if you manage to help them we have to assume most of our efforts to help others will fail its not really about them its about us wanting to do good even if good cant always be done the problem is when it becomes your job to help people instead of your option you become forced to take peoples shit like its your job to take shit and nobody should take shit as their job other than a little bit from kids who also need to be put in their place and not babied give people goal oriented work and they will be happier and healthier give them a wage based gulag of endless work and they will hate the world
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i drive for lyft parttime and have picked up over passengers the most typical thing i hear is how people loathe their jobs if of folks dislike their job why dont we demand a better system seems to me we already know that people have more wealth then half the world population why dont we demand change the system is built to exploit labor and for us to feel powerless
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people are scum you interact with scum you realize how much you hate everything
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i install satellite tv its a pretty good job overall but one thing i did not anticipate is the anxiety i get before rolling up to your house im pretty good with angry customers because im good at articulating the situation so you can understand but its the ones who refuse to understand im trying to help you as best i can i hate the company i work for too and you arent special youre the third one today who was sold something you didnt want it genuinely messes up my day when youre angry and i cant help please can we just relate in how terrible this company is and trust me when i say im doing everything i can if i can work my connections and make something good happen for you it makes my day and it is my goal every time i come to your house when i can do that throughout an entire workday i go home happy other days i have panic attacks also keep in mind i can easily sacrifice my service numbers to make sure you have a long lasting headache for months to come dont be a dick
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i did telemarketing for a few weeks idk if that counts as customer service per se but yeah man the job was soul sucking seriously me my roommate and my girlfriend all quit well within a month because it was such an awful job and work environment
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its because someone said the customer is always right and someone took it as gospel then a series of events turn that into a solid business foundation the customer isnt always right and the fact that they are the main cause of revenue doesnt justify their righteousness you know right the person who goes there everyday from open to close the person who knows the layout of the business like the back of their hand not the person who saw the commericial about the wednesday deal the customer is rarely right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,retail i dont think is rated accurately i dont know a single person who worked more than years in the industry and enjoyed it as a whole
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hours a week in retail by the end of the week i literally want to become a hermit and go live in the woods
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the data here looks really interesting but boy the presentation is ugly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i work in retail stocking shelves i earn ok money given its unskilled but even though most of our shift the store is closed just the few hours it is open is enough to make you wish the death star would visit earth customers are so stupid and seem to think they are at home rather than in public customers will literally steal chicken drunsticks from the meat aisle eat a few bites and then leave the bones and packaging on a biscuit aisle shelf i never had much faith in humanity but after working in retail albeit nightshift i have lost whatever hope i ever had lol people can go to hell lol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,anyone else smile and say please and thank you as well as have a nice day to customer reps after years in retail it amazes me how little people use basic day to day manners and how much you can make someones day better by genuinely saying thanks for your help
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its because people are selfish and will treat anyone who they deem as lower than them like trash this just happened to me guy calls in sick so im alone in the morning for an hour helping customers i work in a hardware store a woman comes into to my store and asks if i had this thing that her gf told her about which was on a piece of paper she left at home then she just stares what does it do maam it makes light like a flashlight yes but no its different than a flashlight its bigger turns out she wants an led lantern but she insisted it wasnt the thing on the paper but she takes it anyway and gets the batteries for it again im alone and now there are people behind her im ringing her up oh you can put those batteries in if you want ok maam im alonelike i said so i can do that once i help everyone else upset so if this isnt the thing on the paper can i bring it back yes but id say dont put in the batteries yet make sure its right when you get home and youre sure this is it the thing on your paper no maam im not sure about that shes upset but takes everything i tell her again ill put in the batteries after i help the other customers no it seems like you are no mood to help me im surprised this place is even in business with people like you working here shes walks out i just sigh ive helped so many fuckin people who have praised me to the high heavens but i never remember those its all these people who youve helped a hundred times who still see you as a subhuman and treat you as such i hate my life
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,great data cant really make much correlation between occupation and depression just using this since youd have to make a comparison between the recorded occupations by ranking it via human interaction which this doesnt have but its a great addition to researching depression saving it for inspiration in the future thanks op
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i can confirm i have a job as a security gate guard at a condominium im angry and saddened that i have to go to work everyday and i definitely want to punch some people who i meet everyday in the face
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,isnt this title contradicted by the data the most depressing job is transportation but that job doesnt really require much social interaction
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how come software engineer isnt in there you just missed of reddits demographic
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,worked for comcast and most of my calls were exactly what youd expect unhappy people calling about billing issues cable problems internet problems and so on what surprised me was the other kinds of calls lots of lonely elderly people who really only called so they could talk to someone one man who called because he thought the government was trying to control him through radio waves one horny pornhound who was still getting his porn from on demand and explained in graphic detail exactly how upskirts let him down i had callers keep me on the phone while they were clearly masturbating tell me what other new movies will be on hbo this month yeah thats it callers who would spend a good minutes ranting about a variety of topics including comcasts unholy monopoly on cable and internet service the president capitalism callers who told me about abusive boyfriends cheating girlfriends near death experiences first dates callers who told me about how hard it is to get old when you cant eat much more than oatmeal because its too hard to open other food packages callers who asked me out including one guy who said he was going on a cruise the following week and wanted me to join him that callers account records showed he was under house arrest it was the strangest job i ever had just in terms of how many calls transitioned so easily from a real problem or question into something raw and personal there was a very real and constant need for people to connect to something more than their cable
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and healthcare services is basically the last growth industry left in the country wonderful my generation will be underpaid depressed and juiced to the gills on antidepressants while we spend our days changing sheets when decrepit baby boomers soil them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i used to do certified nursing assistant work with alzheimers patients and the prevalence of depression was not as high as i expected possibly because people were frequently moving on from that job and this lack of feeling trapped in a job that was often deemed temporary helped keep that prevalence low if anyone were confined to helping alzheimers patients for years i imagine depression would set in on many
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wonder what these statistics would look like if you took out medicalrelated professions is for example a waitstaff member more likely to be depressed than a professional blogger
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ones personality can play a role in this as well people who dont inherently enjoy interacting with other people are probably more prone to depression working in that capacity of course i could easily see somebody who starts out liking people to grow to hate people their jobs and even themselves given enough time in some cases there are a lot of people who are civil or better out there but it only takes a few idiots to ruin ones day or perception of people in general
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i work in management within the food retail industry and getting to interact with coworkers and customers is the best part of the job i enjoy having my hands on the product and getting to move around i respect anyone who can sit behind a desk for hours every week i would just clock watch the whole time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,these are common sense results as are most of these government funded studies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seems about right working first line technical support in a call centre made me want to murder everyone
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cant get the webpage to load so ill ask if this is just physical interaction or does it include something like a call center where you have to deal with the joy of the general populace
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont women and men have significantly different rates of depression as well as making up different percentages of employees if you separated then out you might find completely different results
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit • footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is very important information i would like to see another similar chart with a comparison including very low stress jobs and then a column for the average i used to have a job where my group was severely micromanaged and anxiety was high everywhere basically it was verbal tirades on a near daily basis some from people who had no business being in their position due to lack of the technical knowledge that is anxiety though not depression
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is absolutely accurate i want to do something else but nothing pays as well without some kind of technical experience source am waiter with drinking problem
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive always been a super social person you know the type of person who can strike up conversations with complete strangers and to get to know them while having a cup of coffee then i volunteered in in retail for a day i can honestly say that i wanted to die in a ditch by the end of the day there were just too many assholes for me to deal with
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i read that being a climate scientist these days is a prescription for depression
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,industries that experience more interpersonal conflict and encounters with difficult people have higher depression prevalence really you dont say
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i work with a small team of three other people in their doing a pretty awesome job it keeps me fit both physically and mentally so fucking happy i dont have to deal with officegeneral public bullshit everyday
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you mean people are unbelievably awful
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its why i make a special point to be nice and calm with any representative i cant say ive ever been with an awful rep the worst experience ive had is where i cant understand them because of the accent they are just doing their jobs and its the good reps who care about giving good service that it hurts the most when people are mean ive worked as a cashier for a water park before and have had to deal as a front for immediate customer service there is so much pressure to do things i got into the knack of things but still i was working hard trying to provide good foods and snacks for people it was the best when people understood that things were not going well such as the fryer not working or out of stock and those people made my day at times so please people remember these are humans on the other side trying to be helpful and following procedures you may be irritated because a product sucks or is broken and they are taking some time to diagnose issues but dont take it out on the reps
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and corporations are unbelievably awful to customers takes two to tango
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the problem is if you are nice you just get taken for a ride you have to fight and argue and complain just to get what you are owed if you spend your time being nice to the guy on the other end of the phone you end up getting screwed over not saying its the other guys fault its the directives coming down from above and the companies can change it prime example for me is an isp in the uk called plusnet their entire selling point is good customer service if you phone or email them they will find out why your problem is and either fix it or immediately forward you on to who can fix it rather than what you get with most companies which is endless bureaucracy and if you dont keep moaning you dont get what you want in that situation you can be nice get what you need everyone is happy and the company keeps its customers manners cost nothing until they do at which point most people will drop the manners o get what they want
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its all about being on the phone ive worked facetoface customer service and ive also worked on the phones and the difference in the amount of shit people give you is very surprising when you removes a persons face from the interaction you take a step towards dehumanization and it gets a lot easier to treat them like shit the worst treatment i ever got working with people facetoface was a lady flipping me off the worst treatment i ever got on the phone was a guy threatening to wait for me by my car as i left work so he could beat me to death and what did i say or do to deserve this i wouldnt commit insurance fraud on his behalf in the months i spent working the phones there were less than ten people i genuinely enjoyed speaking with
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same mine was a credit card company though that ended in the word bank when i decided to quit it lifted my mood up so much i didnt even realise how much it was getting me down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,doesnt help it is designed to be so unhelpful that people just give up
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cussed out a guy on the phone just the other day i told him his mother would be ashamed of him and the work he is doing he called me he told me my pc was sending him errors that he could fix its a scam cussing out was better than he deserved
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i try so hard to be polite i had a credit card company that i never paid late on time every time regardless without fail i would be called a few days before my bill was due to warn me and encourage me to set up automatic payments i tried to be polite i intend to make my payment manually as i have successfully done the last months they would read the same line from the script to me i literally wondered if i was going crazy the worst id ever do is dude i fucking said no get off the fucking script then boom the same fucking line
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can confirm used to be in user support doctors lawyers and engineers are the worst users
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my experience in a call center was great and my coworkers also enjoyed it and were happy to help their teammates and customers im still with the company but in a different role some of the factors i think contributed to this it is a small software company with the call center inhouse support is nearly the only entry point into the company so almost everyone in the company understands the job stresses also this means promotions from support are nearly constant the company is willing to fire customers that are abusive to our support staff and also to get rid of deadweight support staff good management technically challenging problems were possible to tackle even at the entry level support position anyhow just wanted to let people know some things they might want to look for in a company if theyre thinking about a role in a call center
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im nice to all you guys i may get upset with you but i dont call you names and i know that its not your rules to begin with
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,especially on the phone ive talked to angry people in person and they will be reasonable and understanding but on the phone im a piece of shit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i worked a huge telemarketing company for a year when i was it was the first of a long string of horrible customer service jobs that place was at the very top of a skyscraper in san francisco the windows were flanked with offices of the higher ups so there were effectively no windows just the horrible flourescent lighting they would hire people by the dozen in group interviews and then fire all of them by the end of the next week one day you might be calling for fema the next you might be calling for state farm you never knew and it didnt matter because you had to read of a teleprompter anyways and the phone automatically dialed you didnt even need to use your hands you werent allowed to talk to the person next to you and since i made some friends they began moving me to a new desk every day to avoid people stopping by my desk to chat so unlike everyone else i wasnt even allowed to have my own desk to make it even worse because we were in the top of this skyscraper and we only got a minute lunch you couldnt leave for lunch it took minutes just to get out of the building which meant out in to get to some place with food to get the food which is unrealistically fast and then going back thats more than minutes and you havent even had a bite so you had to bring your lunch in the winter time id get there just as the sun was getting up and leave just as it was going down so i virtually never saw the sun during the week and this is on top of the constant verbal assaults i kept waiting for them to fire me but they never did eventually i quit after telling them i wanted to go back to school i just couldnt take another day of it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i work in an international call center for a hotel website and boy are americans difficult cunts them and the british to some degree east europeans are chill germans and austriand are chill in fact most euroeans are ok to deal with but the sense of entitlement many americans have and the way they talk over you is astonishing i usually avoid calls from the us and uk altogether
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you had to deal with yourself on the phone youd probably give the same grief from my experience i have been on the receiving end a lot and also been on the giving endthe person receiving is not in a position where they can make a decision based upon what the customer is demanding the customer is always right and you pretty much cant give them what they dont want to hear especially after theyve been queueing to talk to a human for the automated services usually pisses them off before they speak with you the whole system is shit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i literally felt like i was trapped in an abusive relationship you summed up years of my life in a single sentence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my soul will forever carry the scars of my sales career rip my old innocent self
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sales in what i have friends in sales at yelp and other tech companies and their experiences seems to vary from bad to amazing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my current job helps support sales peoplenot in person but im in a local very chill office thank god and it is made super clear to us the only career path is through sales in our company i definitely have my career sights set outside the company eventually sales is like cocaine to me i give it a hard pass and both probably lead to heroin eventually
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this reinforces the fact that sales is a top profession for psychos
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can confirm sales got me closer to suicide than bulying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,imagine being bipolar and having to work as a customer service rep straight out of college because you couldnt find a job
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,currently in healthcare used to be in sales im definitely more jaded now than before
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,teacher at lowsocioeconomic school poorest of the poorgetting some of them to show up for a parent confernce is step not screwing up your face with a wtf lookwhen a lady tells you shes had kids since highschool so she cant be expected to remember the correct order of the alphabetto help her child learn the abc songbecause we are already asking so much by reminding her that her childs school begins at half day not but she just cant believe the bus only waits min and she is sleeping damn it and now i see a teacher post below this one
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,operator checking inyou describe my life
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when i worked in the service industry it was the realization that it wasnt rare no it was a ton of people are assholes and they all go about being unpunished for their asshole behavior hell most of them are reinforced to go forward being assholes and spreading their asshole gospel
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nurse herein an outpatient surgical setting never commented before 🙊 i think its totally dependent on every situationlike some days i will take care of patients who all totally have their shit together and dont need me for every little single thing and they have great family members ready to take them homethen the next day i will only have like patients but they are all train wrecks needing home health set up and a million appointments called and prescriptions called in and horrible family members who think that i am a glorified waitress whose sole purpose is to answer their call and bring them soup and juice every time they want it and why cant their auntie get a sandwich too and can their cousins friend get a work excuse while i am trying to transfer someone to the floor who the doctor wants to keep overnight then my shitty manager comes out from his rock he lives under badgering me about some bullshit forgetting to clockout one day while the phones are ringing and admits are walking in and recovery nurses are bringing back patients and i only want to put in a diet order so my damn patient will get some damn food and leave me alone all the while the other two sorry ass nurses i work with are no where to be foundbut im used to this by nowand then then let us factor in that i have been up since getting my year old and year old ready for school then after work come home and have to do all the fun house work and laundry and cooking dinner and waiting on my kids hand and foot if there were a nice workhome balanceit would be easier i always know its going to be bonkers at homei never know how a day at work will be working with the publicits exhausting
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also some professions are heavily slanted toward interaction with other peoples problems or problem people in specific health and social workers for instance other high human interaction jobs like personal trainers for instance probably dont get this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i work at an olive garden its always very busy there i used to like people before i was employed there and now anyone that even walks in there i already do not like until they prove they arent filthy pigs who treat pasta like jesus is coming that day and if everything isnt exactly how they want it usually they want everything to be free then everyone who works there is the devil needless to say human interaction has made me a scrooge
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,while i agree i think its more the feeling of satisfaction of a job finished service industry and social services youre doing things for other people but you dont always know how well youre doing and you certainly dont always care about people as much as you feel like you should in order to do your job if im a mechanic and i fix a car hey great send it out job well done at a restaurant its mostly the lady at table is a condescending asshole always wants a special order is publicly kind of racist and always tips shes getting older though maybe shell die soon new bartenders hot though and the guy at table laughed at my dumb spiel i give everyone if im a social worker its i wonder what ever happened to that illiterate year old that liked to jerk off on his stuffed animals and punched girls when they didnt want to date him i guess they probably didnt fix that at his next facility either
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,physician here i concur but surprisingly ive noticed that its poor people who are generally more appreciative to receive care homeless immigrants who dont speak a a word of english thugs i can handle its the entitledsuburban pateint irrespective of raceorigin whose family seems to be composed entirely of lawyersnursesaccountants that make me nervous its like walking on a minefield every time i interact with these kinds of patients and their families im constantly second guessing myself and wondering if i missed telling them some random and rare factoid associated with their disease treatment that might come back to bite me in the ass thats why i stuck to a inner city hospital might not pay as much but i fell more content and less stressed out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think its because all of the interactions are professional the client doesnt care about you he just wants the service he came for so theyre less likely to put an effort to be nice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exretail worker its really sad how people will nickel and dime steal bitch and complain over clothes i sell the clothes i dont choose prices
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its also that american culture has very little respect for people in these positions even though in the new economy they make up a very significant proportion of the workforce
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,healthcare here can confirm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,clerk here fuck the human species
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pretty much i work in a crappy town called anderson for a phone company and i realized some days when you have dumb people coming in and yelling at you for something you didnt do or cant help at the end of the day i end up a little grouchy and im not the type of person that gets mad at all unless its something serious so im quitting at the end of the year
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was eating at this mexican place once and overheard this black lady with her date arguing for minutes with the waiter trying to convince him that she should pay the veggie fajita price but she wanted to switch out a vegetable for chicken he gave her an exhausted look like are you fucking kidding me and said wellthat would make it a chicken fajita and we would have to charge you a higher price the black lady looked at him like he was the idiot for not understanding a simple request her date also black kept rubbing his forehead like its ok ill pay the extra dollars ffs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,med student here somebody spat in my face and called me a cunt monkey the other day my crime introducing myself
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its interacting with lots of people that is the problem customers who seem to be in the mind set of knowing they are walking into a retail store combine that thought with low expectations yet feeling entitled to the best product available out there from a low to mid level sales place make me feel so bad i cant give them better and yet they get mad as though i could i really wanted to see them get what they wanted retail in the mid income range sucks for this reason
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ex comcast and hp tech support here yeah thats pretty much it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also when you have little human interaction you can get an inflated sense of self worth because no one is there to put you down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,longtime service industry worker here and yes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh you mean trump supporters
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,former retail manager checking in true ive been out of the field for years i probably helped thousands of people in the ten years i was there and most were douche canoes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can confirm i work in the un when they say must be able to work in a multicultural environment it means you need to be able to deal with random assholes from all over the world
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the first step in living a happy life is being absolutely scrupulous in choosing who you choose to spend time with this cannot be emphasized enough dont learn this the hard way
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my officemate is a complete asshole she had been unwell and had blood tests done when she got the results she complained she didnt understand them she has to see a doctor to interpret the results when she called the clinique she accused them of wasting her time why couldnt they just tell her over the phone what was wrong with her anyway i have to listen to her everyday whining and being an asshole to everyone and when i call her out to her shit attitude she says she is not asking for my opinion she just wants me to listen
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont forget pharmacists
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i find its management in hospitals that are terrible its seem that theres a percent split between genuine caring people and miserable and hateful ones that should not have any human interaction at all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,new doctor in residency here i absolutely agree with you im only a few months in but ive cried more times than i can count in the nurses station in the middle of the day theres just so much verbal abuse from both the patients and the attendings consultants and we are just stuck in the middle people tell me to just hold it together but its hard and holding it together just means im supposed to suck it up and not care anymore no wonder sometimes doctors are so cold its a horrible coping mechanism i dont know if i look forward to the day that i stop caring i feel like im losing my own humanity sometimes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just today at work a patient threatened to rape a nurse for telling him to stop laughing at another patient when another male nurse confronted him he told him to get his cracker ass out so i can watch tv when security showed up he gave them hell too typical day in emergency medicine
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i had a patient the other day who cussed me out because im young im she kept yelling at me because she just knew i was going to vote for hillary keep in mind that this was all totally unprovoked she also said i was killing babies day on the job
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,repostingteacher at lowsocioeconomic school poorest of the poorgetting some of them to show up for a parent confernce is step not screwing up your face with a wtf lookwhen a lady tells you shes had kids since highschool so she cant be expected to remember the correct order of the alphabetto help her child learn the abc songbecause we are already asking so much by reminding her that her childs school begins at half day not but she just cant believe the bus only waits min and she is sleeping damn it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah in my experiences most student interactions are solid and interactions with parents are trying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,any pointers for this my gf just started her first year of teaching and i can tell its getting to her a little bit already id love to know things i could do to help with the stress
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ugh nail on the head the students make it worth it but also dealing with the different scenarios that crop up in one day is overwhelming at times top with all the politics and administration demanding that we be more rigorous can suck the joy out of it but that balance is hard to achieve but so worth it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,any advice for a firstyear middle school scienceenglish teacher im working until every night and im just getting extremely depressed even though teaching is what ive always wanted to do im didnt go to school for science so im not even qualified to do it and im having to teach myself science as i go weekbyweek
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,tech support is the bottom im going back into it and escaping covert geek squad being treated like shit by unemployable housewives who cant get on facebook to sell jamberry crap was too much for me i dont even want to be female anymore im embarrassed by my people my anxiety maxed out and i started drinking through my shift put on lbs and realized i hit alcoholism because i was isolated at home and due to my nightweekendholiday shift my only human interaction was asshole clients telling me im stupid
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i hear some of the workers around me call tech support some times and i just cant believe how poorly they treat the tech support people the callers never understand that the real issue here is their own ineptitude not tech supports cindy you misplacing an email isnt tech supports fault stop getting fucking mad at the poor guy on the phone trying to explain to you that he cant find it if it was there theyd find it it isnt there you fucked up somehow cindy the fact that you accidentally saved over an important excel sheet and lost all the data you had isnt tech supports fault you saved it on your hard drive which they have said over and over and over that you shouldnt do because they only back up files on the server cindy the fact that the computers go to a screen saver after mins of activity and require you to log back in isnt something to get mad about it helps protect the company against hackers who might try to walk in and find a computer that someone has already logged into maybe if you actually did some work instead of talking to a coworker about your weekend then your computer wouldnt keep going to screen saver
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can confirm work in tech support so many entitled assholes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why is it that we do that you know
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i should respond completely seriously from now on whenever anyone asks me how i am
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean thats not a bad wage for that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ill listen to your song pal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i read an article a while back about banking that seems a bit related the part that stuck out to me was about the early banking system money counters were required and as you could imagine it was a pretty dull job that also had the opportunity to draw in thieves their solution was an iq test to find people who would find the task doable but mentally stimulating enough to enjoy it these people stuck around where others left due to dullness and the same people tended not to have grand ideas about what they could do with money to think to steal it point is while jobs can be bad for some others might thrive in it ultimately its up to the individual to find work that makes them happy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive heard the idea that everyone falls on the introvertextrovert spectrum extroverts get energy and happiness from social interaction and get drained while being alone introverts are the opposite as an introvert every time the phone rings at work i die a little inside during the weekend i can spend hours straight at home avoiding my roommates and i feel happy as can be
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i went through a similar experience too many people from retail and then a warehouse job i wasnt producing anything that really made sense for me and i completely agree im making art and i started a business too i have never been so happy working on these things it feels so much more rewarding because im making things that have value
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can you send the song ive worked so many jobs on both ends of the spectrum extreme social and isolation i used to work hours at a starbucks and at a warehouse a week and every week i had nightmares about the endless tasks i had to do with no real end goal nothing made just more work to grind through two years later and a much better job and it still has hooks in my brain
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i work with sewers ive never had sewers insult me or yell manholes are shitty and stink but they aint rude or stupid
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i work solo all day too and i love it i suspect really antisocial jobs attract introverts and extroverts have to just keep trying to find a noncrappy job with people in it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that sounds nice both the alone part and the lab what are you working on
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my job is fairly nice for that work in a somewhat quiet office but it gets a bit annoying at times with the lack of meaningful interaction my hobby has become podcasting to satisfy my need to talk to new people about interesting things
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes exactly that is what is meant by emotional labor in the explanation at the post emotional labor is all the work of being pleasant kind cheerful with selfcontrol and professionalism when its not coming from a natural place forced cheer and forced professionalism and hiding the truth such as allowing boundaries to be violated when you cant tell off people who are being dicks this is all emotional labor and it can be incredibly exhausting we used to be a production economy where people produced goods were now a service economy where people produce experiences and feelings for other people the toll it takes is different than producing goods
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i worked with kids for two years i hated it for just this reason it felt like you could never be angry and some of the kids knew it and acted worse just to fuck with you but like i said you could never get mad like some of this were actually abusive and cruel and you still couldnt get mad at them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not necessarily i work in mental health and lemme tell you it can be really depressing some days
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dunno watching my clients slowly decay mentally and physically because their loved ones would rather stuff them full of pills than let them die peacefully is pretty depressing you can pretend grandpas just tired because he had an exhausting day rather than because of the drug cocktail that keeps his heart beating long enough for you to visit for ten minutes every few months but that doesnt change the fact that im the one who sees that moment of lucid shame and embarrassment when he wakes up after accidentally defecating in his sleep the poor man gets to be awake from to before the drugs bring him back under
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which goes against a lot of what realtors go through it takes a long time to build trust with clients connecting with them on deep levels etc you go through a roller coaster during the buying process and in the end of it you are practically friends
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fuck this thread and then this comment makes me realize i shouldve gone hard on my original aspirations of being a park ranger
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they are all just a red stapler away from burning this place down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the nastiest people i have ever encountered were at the dmv i exclude the workers as they are doing a necessary but unforgiving job so the rest of us can live seminormal lives i recently moved to a new state and had to change my plates i had a homeless woman cuss me out for sitting in her chair at the dmv she spent the whole time insulting anyone with a certain trait who walked in on her way out she leans from the door in front of other people and tells me shes going to send me to hell and curbstomp the baby of the pregnant woman sitting next to me given this dmv was in a courthouse i spoke to the marshal sitting with security on the way out all walks of life pass through the dmv it is a great equalizer take your number wait your turn with the rest of the public there is no express lane and the people behind the counter dont care about your excuses your sob story or why you dont have your paperworkthey tell you what to come back with and call the next number
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you should note that the data only collected a population from western pennsylvania
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im really sorry to the random docnurse that took a metal tray of instruments to the face it was a poor choice to wield the cart so the tray was hanging over my feet very poor timing as another nurse screwed up andtore something i didnt mean to kick it didnt even know it was there i never saw that guy again but thanks for the help sorry about your face
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,knowing that ill be financially ruined for life just because i crossed the threshhold of the er will do that to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i admire your patience and maturity it can be hard when your loved ones are robbed by a poor work environment not everyone can do it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre a fucking awesome girlfriend honestly i cant stress enough just how important it can be for a guy to have a girlfriend who cares but can give you space without going all fine if you dont want me to care i wont talk to yoube around you at all and make it about her youre one in a billion and you should know it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive been a server and cocktail waitress for years as well they way some people talk to treat service staff can be dehumanizing most of the time i laugh to myself when someone gets mad that the welldone steak they ordered is taking longer than minutes to cook but once in a while theres that one customer that just gets to me i try and tell myself its no big deal and that some times people just want a reason to bitch and its not my fault but i let it get to me and it can ruin my entire shift its exhausting im in a richer part of town too so theres also that entitlement i get to deal with
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i worked in a home for about three months and that was all i could take it was hard to leave my residents because the next person might not care for them in the same way but i just couldnt keep going through that wringer i have huge respect for everyone that does
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and this is why i cant do thateither your fellow coworkers are shit or the patients or their familiesyep just not doing it i get some people have no better option but still
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ditto cna for years some of the old folks at the nursing home were great then i switched to a really bad nursing home and home care and went through hell my corworkers were worse than any patient though like literally would not acknowledge my presence because i was new at the bad place once in awhile id get yelled at for not being fast enough good times
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a year and a half as a nurse assistant here as well i wanted to go to nursing school but god its so exhausting i miss my family
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also a social worker i work with adults with chronic mental illness for me its the management thats so depressing though theres a whole group of people who seemingly got into the field to control other people its the reason i want to change careers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,old white ladies can be fairly obnoxious but if youre in retail i wouldnt put them anywhere near the top of the shit pole
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,work said i was the only person there who would live through a zombie apocalypse i was very touched
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when the zombies come i thought they were already here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i worked as a janitor over last summer while waiting for grad school to start and quite liked it pay was shit and i couldnt do more than pay bills and rent with it but my day consisted of getting up super early smoking a bowl cleaning the crap out of a barrestaurantdance hall and then going home super simple zero interaction with other people except the gm who came in said hi and went to the office just rocked out to metal and got some physical activity in mopping is a decent workout if it paid normal job wages id be happy doing it forever probably
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is jim lahey your employee
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre right in the good ol times when everyone had to do the job their parents did in order to survive everything was better when you wanted to slack off you could only risking that your crops will die off and you arent going to have enough food to last the winter
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i did the whole para thing for a few years too what i learned is that quite a lot of the special needs kids learn how how to manipulate people i learned that human beings will strive to be as lazy as people allow them to be and that disabled children figure out ways to be quite lazy by abusing the fact that everyone pities them i learned that the schools will do just about anything to push these kids through even if they are many grade levels behind in their knowledge there are so many special needs children who have just as much potential as a normal child but they manage to graduate high school having the education level of a middle schooler it isnt their disability causing that it is just that they figured out how to play their cards in such a way that they never have to do any work there are also a lot of kids with ieps that simply have no business having ieps the amount of kids who are diagnosed with adhd but who actually are just lazy shits spoiled by bad parents is staggeringly high id say like of the kids with ieps didnt really have a single thing wrong with them other than laziness it was pretty much just that the parents had to tell themselves that there must be something wrong with their child for them to be exhibiting the type of behavior they were seeing news flash parents it was just because didnt discipline them well and so they go to get the kid diagnosed and the doctor just slaps on an adhd diagnosis because that is what the parents want to hear that way they can tell everyone that their kid is a lazy shit because they have a disorder not because theyre just poorly raised and thats the harsh truth right there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,everyone is different some people really end up loving it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i want this too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but people are seeking contact and advice not coming at you because they feel wronged like a customer service job
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,customer service really depends on the customers youre dealing with ive worked at a small liquor store in a quiet middleclass neighborhood and at a mall with a high volume of traffic one job was amazing and the other drained all of the good mental energy out of me it should be pretty obvious which one did what
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,social services is included in that category and social worker is the highest in the prevalence list
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,someone once said that doctors had a high depressionsuicidal rate however when you plotted the data with high salary it was negligible doctors with high salaries met the same level of depressionsuicidal rate as others in the same income bracket keep in mind this study that the op used is only by employees in western pennsylvania also the data uses icd which means only those who came into the hospital and were diagnosed with depression get included this is underrepresented
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,actually the irony is the workers who deal with the worst in society and the associated stress are paid the worst and that goes across all strata of society for instance a server at a highend restaurant will be better compensated than a night cashier at mcds or an er doc who gets paid less than a surgeon or other specialtists who dont deal with the crazy and violent on the regular
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think both lower paying jobs you listed require far less social interaction than being a politician as far as being a surgeon goes i think there is some variation but a politician needs to engage with more people than basically any other job plus a taxi driver doesnt have to talk to their clients besides being instructed where to go its why many in the united states dont have great english
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,usually the most prestigioushighest paying jobs are also the most specialized and least necessary for a functioning society surgeon that specializes in a very particular heart procedure for example compared to the crap jobs that pay little and are actually far more vital factory worker produce picker janitorial work etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id say its really important whether you meet or more shitty people in a day because that makes it a shitty day might be higher or lower depending on the person coming into contact with compared to people on a daily basis makes a really big difference whether you hit your shitty people cap or not
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,unless if you are transporting people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,transportation driver public bus driver
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a broader reading of social psych would tell you pretty quickly that too little or too much social interaction is bad for people so yeah being a trucker is rough but so is fast food ideal for most people is probably working with a small group there are also a million other factors to depression and to job satisfaction
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im going into software engineering maybe its because ive worked nothing but actual shit jobs my entire life but software engineering is my happy place
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is what ive done for around two years different places and every coworker whos over tells me to get my degree and get out currently still at the stage where the residents are the highlight of my day but the pay is so unfair that i cant even think about it for too long or it will make me lose my mind also the fact that you are often doing many peoples jobs besides your own with little to no appreciation and have to deal with difficult residents and even more difficult family members makes it so stressful at times that i have anxious dreams about work oh and then everyone you get attached to dies this job makes sense for me now but if im still doing it in years consider me a hollow shell
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your mum is probably introverted i do that too its to avoid the whole hay how ya doing lolol bullshit conversation shit gets annoying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but one can often lead to the other and then they start to feed off each other in a spiral
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,work in retail can confirm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people are awful but banks are awfuller
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its why i make a special point to be nice and calm with any representative aside from just being a decent thing to do this just make so much practical sense im always super nice when i have to talk to a customer service rep they get treated like shit every day and theyre probably so happy to talk to someone whos not an asshole i always get whatever problem im calling about taken care of without too much of a hassle meanwhile i have an ex who was just a bitch to customer service people and she almost never had her issues resolved when she had to call in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im with i go out of my way to be direct and nice to customer service and if they fix everything im extra thankful
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well and one thing to remember is that people will generally be more willing to help if they dont hate you so dont piss off the people youre asking to fix something for you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,customer service employees feel the wrath from both though people yell at them as if they are the ceos
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for real maybe if i hadnt spent minutes already on hold trying to navigate through automated systems that never fucking work and only offer to let you talk to a real person after youve ran the charge out of your phone then you talk to someone in india who can do nothing but babble from a script and put you on hold after every single question you answer or take down your number saying they will call you back yeah right and if the call is somewhat tricky youll just get magically disconnected so you can start the process all over again with some new incompetent employee who clearly just learned your language after you argue with a computerized system first again of course
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly i try to keep this in mind when talking to customer service sometimes i have to flat out say this isnt against you but your company policy is awful and i need to talk to someone who can help
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but youre not talking to people who can actually change that youre talking to some rep who gets just a bit over minimum wage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,found the person whos never worked customer service
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,factor in the human element though in my time as a pet store drone our unofficial policy was to do as little as possible to help obnoxiousangry customers even if their problem was legitimate in contrast i had many customers come in with problems that genuinely had nothing to do with our service quality my puppy is sick after eating an entire costco pack of lunch meat or my hamster sleeps all day or this catnip toy makes my cat act insane yet if they were super nice about their complaints id bend the rules to help them out any way i could so sure being nice might get you taken for a ride but it also might be the key to getting that employee to pull a bunch of strings for you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,boom cancelled credit card
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you realise that they are just sitting in front of a system that tells them who to call and what script to go through and that is their job the only way they are not going to go through with that is if someone alters the system to take into account the fact that youve been through the process multiple times but that person is not one of the people that gives you the call
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,small company
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,years retail i worked there until they unceremoniously closed the company a couple of years ago do you remember the scene from waterworld when kevin costner throws the flare into the ships oil pit the poor frail man in the fuel tank sees that hes going to be engulfed in flames and says oh thank god that was me i had grown comfortable being uncomfortable and i remember sleeping for like days straight after colour returned to my face and i remembered what it felt like to be human again hahaha
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,year career checking in left last august and havent looked back
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,veterinarian here i become more misanthropic by the day i hate everyone really no different than you we are basically forced to be sales people except every failed sale means the animal will get sicker wish more people had pet insurance
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,high rise window cleaner here i deliberately look menacing so people wont ask me stupid questions when we get on the same elevator im a really nice guy and i really dont fucking want to talk to you commission only sales years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is the shiteating just one of the jobs perks
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dude quit eating where we shit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think sales in general is just toxic yet some people might relish in it i did online sales and direct sales of trucks to corporate customers both sucked
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes definitely agree
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,good godso much truth once you start to do that youre nearing your breaking point at which you move on to do bigger and better at least from what ive seen and experienced
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i like to think of myself as the best bakery in town but with no doors
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fellow teacher here my school should be title but isnt i know exactly what you mean but i dont get those parents to come to conferences only the good kids with good parents come not that i dont want to see them but the ones that need it the most arent there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is why teachers should only be fired for poor performance if there is evidence that their students arethe community is trying the schools should be grading their communities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,work as a dentist in a low ses area there are some days where i want to pull my hair out by the level of stupid that comes through my door
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sorry to assume but for you i would imagine you may be speaking with many people during highly stressful situations having to call i mean if somes house is on fire and they take it out on me sure but working tech support in a callcenter and having some guy tell me to die cause his tv died during a ufc fightmakes me feel fuckin worthless
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,correctional officer here all i see are the shit dwellers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,uh i just got a job at a electronic retailer in the service desk and i have exp depression should i run really need a job tho
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,many years ago a operator stayed on the line with me when a stalker was trying to break down my front door with an axe the police got there in two minutes i could have ptsd from the experience but instead remember the operators voice as she kept me calm thanks for what you do
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly you realize theres way too many assholes and each one thinks theyre better than you pretty depressing and it makes it hard to keep the compassion up
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we had a womans bank account shut down because she said to a manager who took over the call for me i wish you ill of cancer just because we couldnt provide her with a debit card as she was considered a high risk customer and she was stuck with an electron card instead
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they all go about being unpunished for their asshole behavior hell most of them are reinforced to go forward being assholes see all the people who drive past all the traffic waiting in the turn lane and cut in at the very last second
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly thats why i make it my goal to correct any asshole behavior i see outside of work
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,most people are afraid to be assholes to people they know for fear of reprisal they have no qualms being a dick to a server or cashier because there is no fear of any real consequences if you have a legitimate issue with a service or whatever being friendly but stern will get you a lot further than being a dick
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this also if you think the fast food industry is rough when it comes to dealing with customers try being a nursing assistant everything gets amplified by a combination of emotional family members and flat out crazy ass patients it is a damn nightmare and after having done and a half years of cna work i am just so damn happy to be done with that crap it is sad because you do meet some great people but the shitty people just ruin everything oh and if you want to test your sanity just try dealing with a crazy old person who thinks they need to go to the bathroom every minutes literally and need your help or they might fall it doesnt matter that they are not actually doing anything in the toilet and that you have or other people to deal with oh no it us their problem so thats the only thing that matters
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i feel you i am an er nurse one day i will have pleasant people who have their shit together and are just sick im cool with that the next day i have a handful of entitled cunts who cant be bothered to take their insulin treat me like i owe them something bitch about everything and slow me down with everylittlefuckingstupidthingtheycantbebotheredtofuckingdothemselves i will never forget pumping a chest in a code on a child and the homeless regular next door yellows for someone to get a fucking pillow some times i think i should work on icu so i can just stick all my patients on a vent kick their families out and keep them on a propofol drip thats the life except then i would be an icu nurse and that would probably be so much worse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think its probably worse for people that spend all their day with customers but speak with each of them for only a short amount of time going through the same little snippets of small talk hours a day everyday would leave me starving for mental stimulation when i worked at a callcenter for a bank i ended up leaving because it was having such a big impact on my mental health
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh yeah definitely in my job people generally only call us if theyve got something to be pissed off about if the service we are providing is working out for them then they wont call us of the customers you will hear from once a year just to update their address or something its that other that cant accept the terms of the service or have received poor service from us they are the ones who call and give us verbal abuse sometimes i wish i could give it back but i dont want to get fired
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,olive garden is the worst i just quit my job there because of all the rude asshole customers who feel entitled to their endless soup and salad and complain if you dont have their refills instantaneously and then tip you after running you around like a maniac or the people who go in just to complain and try to get their meal comped i work at a higher end restaurant now and while we do still get assholes and cheapskates though not quite as much i at least dont have to run endless soup and salad or sometimes pasta to people all day i dont know what it is about olive garden but the clientele seems especially terrible imo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think your view of hands on technical work is a little too rosey ive done my fair share and its not job well done its why the fuck is it taking so long because the last mechanic did a half ass job and stripped half the bolts theres a little more freedom to be yourself but doing the same thing over and over again day in day out is really just a different kind of hell if you actually look at the data breakdown mechanic is pretty high up there in rates of depression
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,mechanic here and i agree that the satisfaction of a job well done is very rewarding however as the other commenter said it can be stressful when you hit multiple snags and a somewhat routine job begins to take a lot longer than anticipated luckily im not flat rate and work on customrace cars so these situations are to be expected and dont eat into my pay i love my job
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as some who works with physicians i dread dealing with them im sure youre nice but man
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ruraldisadvantaged patient medicine is the best you are right the worst patients are the entitled shits who are uppermiddle class and are used to getting what they want by being an asshole the i want to see your manager people they see healthcare as another big department store and feel like its their right to get whatever test or treatment that they have decided is correct from webmd or their nextdoor neighbor or a relative who is also a doctor nurse medical assistant etc those people eat up the most time time i need to spend on poorer people who have only recently gotten insurance and have all kinds of undiagnosed problems with obamacare i dont have the luxury of time i have to see at least patients a day just to break even its the health care situation along with the patient interactions that make me want to change professions completely
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i had the opposite experience but im a nurse when i was working in the inner city the patient population was respectful of the doctors but very abusive and entitled when it came to the nurses now i work in suburbia where there are still issues with entitlement but they center more around the diagnostic and care requests instead of threats of physical violence if i dont get them a snack before hanging blood on another patient
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and when a client comes to you hes already stressed by the unsatisfactory service hes getting from your company if you work in customer service everyone who comes to you is someone who already has a motive to hate the company and you are the company for him
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont need nice id settle for not cussing me out telling me you hope i die or calling me stupid for asking how to spell your name
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no no theyre a curated blend of complete assholes a carefully constructed selection of them really nothing random about it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hello to all of you jumping cows can i ask im legit curious here how is it working in the un what kinds of jobs people do over there what are some requirements that you need to get in seems like an interresting place that i never hear any info about o
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well stop enabling that then if you cant tell her to fuck off at least tell her to stop talking
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,noise cancelling headphonesperhaps a taser
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just got back from my shift at the pharmacy and can confirm that i want to die
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hospitals are often a chaotic place the staff operates with a lot of stress and those difficult patients can make it very very hard it can also be a very heartening and humanizing experience but there definitely is a high burnout rate working in healthcare
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all before the shift even starts none of my friends work in medicine and none of them believe me that working in the er changed me as a person for good and bad but man it is worth it most days
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nah working in a low income school as a special education teacher is tough its compassion fatigue really poverty is a brick wall i hit everyday cant imagine the weight they carry
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i once had a mother tell me that she wasnt surprised that her highschool aged son talked throughout every single class period because he was very sexy and he cant help it if everyone is attracted to him
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i went to an elementary school where every first grade class would have kids who could barely communicate and werent fully potty trained people who havent seen these kinds of schools will never understand
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they can be tricky just had parent teacher conferences and they went great though relationships are the key to everything but selfcare comes before everything else as a middle school teacher
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,everyone cries i broke down on my second day she shouldnt feel bad about it being overwhelmingly difficult just try to avoid letting the kids see tears it kinda freaks them out this feeling does get better with time my supervisors told me that the first two years of teaching are mostly about surviving it on my third year now feels pretty accurate take your breaks having a constant open door policy is a recipe for burnout establish some office hours if you still want to be available just dont make it all the time nobody knows everything even if other teachers look like they have it all figured out be willing to ask for help find the good members of your department who are kind and helpful or at least are willing to admit they dont have it all figured out and collaborate with them on lessons you dont have to reinvent the wheel take advantage of their experience everyone remembers how hard it was starting out if they say it wasnt theyre either lying or they dont care about teaching try not to grade at home bringing it home with you only ensures that youll never stop thinking about it find a park or a coffee shop or the like where you can just focus on getting whatever task you need done some teachers can do this in their classrooms but frankly i need to get out of there as soon as the day is over get as much sleep as you can the world will seem overwhelming and hopeless at a pretty low threshold with too little sleep come up with a relaxation routine to wind down i drink tea and read books get an electric tea kettle im pretty sure that drinking some hot tea serves much the same psychological function as smoking because it forces you to take some time for yourself and focus on your breath blowing on the tea to cool it down ive become a total tea fiend and its done wonders for my stress level youre not required to know everything the more you keep up that veneer the more pressure it puts on you admit when you dont know things and tell the kids lets find out together its an important lesson for them too when they see the connection between knowledge and curiosity and humility rather than simply being a function of natural intelligence growth versus fixed mindset a huge portion of how kids interact with you is more about their attitudes toward authority than it is about you try not to take it personally when you have behavior issues ask kids to explain why they did what they did it short circuits the desire to react reflexively ive avoided making myself look dumb a few times this way and forces kids to reflect on their motivations and causation for behavior then you can have a conversation about whether that action was inappropriate or not and why the goal is to get them to selfregulate behavior through their own thoughtfulness i dont have a lot of behavior management issues partially because of this and it makes less work and stress for me consider having students switch papers and grade work themselves less work for you and it gives them the chance to ask clarifying questions that they wont otherwise ask if you just hand back a paper with a number on it similarly not everything has to be graded in detail reserve your focus for formative and summarize assessments practice should be less about getting it right than an opportunity for the kids to realize that they dont understand something lastly you cant make any particular kid learn anything good teachers think about how to make the content relevant and interesting but some kids just wont be into it they may have some more fundamental issues going on in their lives do your best and think about what you might do differently in the future but try to let go of the impulse to beat yourself up because you just couldnt reach thatthose kids their problems may be much bigger than you and you are not in control of everything i had kids in my class my first year who got shot at outside of school because of gang activity the best thing i could do for them sometimes was to give them a space where they felt respected and that someone was looking out for them cant think of anything else at the moment hope that helps
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,like any job stress you just need to do things to get her mind off work a weekend spent having adventures is usually more beneficial to being effective in the classroom than a weekend of planninggrading
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no rword on a saturday totally agree
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the first couple years are so hard part of it is expectations you put on yourself lower them if you get overwhelmed sometimes you have to do whats best for you and not your kids and thats okay youll grow into the teacher you want to be but it takes time and experience be kind to yourself and you dont have to grade everything the first year is about survival hang in there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ill second that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,am i misinterpreting this or they purposefully chose lowiq people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in regards to your last line in theory its rue but that ignores the economic reality for many people where they dont have options and face socioeconomic barriers to obtaining the education and dkills that old give them options
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im finishing up my phd in molecular genetics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats how i feel about call center work youre in a subservient role because you have to be obnoxiously polite and willing to be helpful it definitely lowers your self esteem
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think thats the problem with hospital nursing ever since medicare reimbursement started going by patient satisfaction instead actual outcome nurses used to do what they needed to do to take care of you we used to focus on detailed assessments patient education about their disease process and make sure orders were carried out safely now the focus has shifted towards customer service these days of a patient refuses to wear his heart monitor i spend thirty minutes talking to him trying to convince him to wear it i spend thirty minutes apologizing for the incorrect lunch tray order and making phone calls to try to correct it so the guy can have his chocolate cake instead of vanilla patient doesnt want to let us reposition her sure lets do what she says and let her get a pressure injury
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,of all the jobs you can miss your chance to do this is not one of them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,perhaps it could still be done
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am ok with my local dmv burning down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sounds like somebody failed to make an appointment
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people who really need to be in the er often express this attitude someone comes in after complaining of feeling light headed and dizzy for two weeks and their hemoglobin is normal for reference but they didnt want to risk financial apocalypse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no definitely not im talking about the line of work i do now i encounter a ton of them the worst were asians they act as if they cant understand you then expect you to do everything for them i would walk away from them in the store when i saw them come in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i will see your completely reasonable response and raise you at this particular place they have to literally walk through our patio area to get to the host stand
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,was a janitor at a school kids are fucking disgusting definitely the worst job ive ever had one day i just walked out of there with no fucks left to give
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah ok i was thinking long haul trucker edit im still going to contest the title nowhere in the article does it correlate time spent with people and depression you have several independent jobs and the problems they face thats it the statement depression is correlated by time spent with people is strictly not supported by the data in the article provided if you want to convince me of that you need a metric for time spent with people and you need to quantify it by profession leaving it up to the reader to decide if a job is social or not isnt sound science
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,am person can confirm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,deleted
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,banks expect people to be notmad when they take money out of their account sorry sir or mam the money is just gone and theres nothing i can do it is what it is but well gladly refund that overdraft charge im sorry you missed your mortgage because of this have a nice day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if your have lots of money they give you more money if your have less then no money they take more money
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i never understood how people think that being threatening and bitchy is a good tactic to pressure a representative to help them out i only go out of my way to help people if they are polite and friendly i provide minimal help if theyre demanding and rude
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how someone treats customer service repswait staffanyone in a subservient role should be a huge marker for whether theyre someone you want to be with in general
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,unsolicited dating advice watch how your date treats people in the service industry the way they treat people is an unbiased look at their character
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also when you get aggressive and demanding with a rep they fear what kind of trouble you are willing to cause them potentially even getting then fired when they are just getting by you panic them seasoned customer service representatives are indifferent to you and what ever you do because theyve gone through the panic so many times they no longer care sure get me fired at least that way i can collect unemployment and i wont have to stand here and listen to you complain about something we cant fix or have you threaten me ect
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly the ceo is shopping for the vacation home letting wage slaves absorb all the abuse they deserve it is a beautiful system from a certain perspective horrible from all others
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the best was when i tried to cancel my service with verizon got hung up on three times after being on hold for a good amount of time ended up having to go to a physical store
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,unfortunately part of their job description is to keep you away from anyone with authority to help
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its people who say this isnt against you who i always found the worst at my callcenter at least the people who dont preface their yelling and screaming at us can be attempted to be written off as ignorant but you oh you fuckers that have to say hey this isnt against you because i know you are just doing your job but then regardless of the fact that you just acknowledged you know we are in no way responsible for what you are mad about you verbally demolish us anyway fuck you people for thinking that can be an excuse to turn someome into your punching bag
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive worked customer service but i still totally understand his point corporations take advantage of their customers and screw them over all the time many angry customers are just entitled assholes but some people have a legitimate grievance with a company it sucks that call center workers are the ones who get the brunt of the anger in this context but that anger has to go somewhere ive had very frustrating experiences with my cable company for example and while i know its not the call center reps fault they still interact with me in a way that is purposefully designed not to help me but to help the company its maddening and the people who are actually at fault are completely shielded from the backlash
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,agreed i would never advocate starting out argumentative being nice can get you far at times
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can i ask why its so bad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in retail now work as graphic designer life is great and i have way more money for a less tiring job
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its been years for me burn baby burn
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,still work in retail had jobs all involved dealing with customers its been years already words cannot express how much ive grown to dislike people and thats putting it mildly good thing i have collage and a masters degree they sure came in handy not theres still a small spark inside of me that hopes for a job that doesnt involve direct customer contact still hoping hope dies last hope right fellas
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,year in rehab left last novemeber lifes been good ever since
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sorry im late this where the sales anonymous meeting is but can confirm op years and im liking people less
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hows the pay up there proportionate to how much you climb
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,spot on luckily its just part time for me and iv recently got some autonomy running my own bar i defnitly couldent do bartending only for more than a couple years without loosing it luckily i still have a pretty clear mental break between work and the rest of my life i put on my uniform and mask and play my role its like you hear about soldiers joking in the trenches just to a lesser extent you have to vent somehow everyone drinks or lots smoke weed i remind myself its just a thing i do right now and not who i am im still studying honestly though getting muscled up and being blunt makes the work go smoother but itd be a rough way to live my favourite manager who left gave me some parting advice dont stay here too long
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i tapped out early lol i starting waiting tables last may and then broke in september not sure what it means but i fucking hated it got super bitter
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its okay ive got a grapnel and enough rope to reach your sweet bready heart d
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats sad the ones who need it the most arent there i feel for those kids
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cant begin to address every single category of call i get man my job is fulfilling and i love it that was probably lost in the tone here but yespeople are absolutely dealing with stress someone yelling because their house is on fire is cool i didnt bring it up because its cool i understand but even some of those can go like get the fucking policefireems here nowok maam at what address fuck you the police dont ever do shit anyway click but i feel you i came to this from customer service call centers it was a much more soul crushing experience i get to tell people to stfu and listen to me and answer my questions now its nice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is why i quit geek squad and i wasnt even in the store i was work from home and people are miserable in chat i was told i was ruining somebodys life more than once and it was usually because they waited until the last minute to do something on their computer and it wasnt working and they went full panic mode and targeted me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,shit dweller is my new favorite
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cable technician here shit dwellers live in shit and are joyous from throwing shit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if theyre dwelling in shit and youre there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fishing guide here believe it not theyre everywhere
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a physician well depending on the patient population you deal with your experience may be anywhere from excellent to straight up i need to fucking shoot myself
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not to disregard your situation i doubt i wouldnt want you job but at least you dont have to be nice to prisoners those of us who have to stand there and take personal insults and threats and reply with a smile and give them free stuff were dead inside
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i work in corrections as well if you are truly only cynical you really should seek out different employment it will only get worse for you if you dont
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people getting shiny new electronics are probably the happiest of retail customers the ones with broken ones that need servicing range from tolerable to annoyed but at least theyre not hungry theyre the worst
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you sincerely its my job but yea we dont hear that much glad youre ok
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ill always remember working as a valet and one woman valets this piece of shit minivan takes her kid by the hand points to me and says see honey go to school so you dont end up like him man if i didnt need that job to help pay for my ms in thermofluids i would have said something the worst part is that even if i wasnt in school at that time you shouldnt look down on people because they work as a valet or a fast food worker or a waiter or anything this bitch was teaching her kid right out of the gate that service industry workers are to be pitied and looked down on
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i work in a rich area in the service industry they are very nice and treat you with respect just how youre brought up i guess
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,was stuck with an electron card instead a what the difference between visa electron and visa debit is that payments with visa electron require that all the funds be available at the time of transfer ie visa electron card accounts may not be overdrawn visa debit cards on the other hand allow transfers exceeding available funds up to a certain limit i didnt even know that was a thing can can you choose to get an electron card instead of receiving the service of accidental overdrafts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i never let them in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or block the box fuck those people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i will happily endanger traffic and my own safety to block them from entering my lane
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ed nurse here who tried a year in icu it is still the floor and you have to kiss even more ass in the ed at least i can tell my patient my job is to manage their emergency not their existence and my goal is to make sure they dont die
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,after like hours of work i start getting the bits of the script mixed or duplicate them especially when folks have their shit together and i dont have to ask for their rewards card etc or i ask how youre doing three times because i feel braindead
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i havent been to a olive garden in a while but i bet the endless x is a pretty big factor the restaurant i work at is smaller and it seems like the asshole level is a bit lower than average though thats not saying much people are some entitled motherfuckers and the tip system certainly doesnt help that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think its validation from others but the ability to see the concrete result of your labor thats what karl marx was talking about when he spoke of alienated labor were getting more efficient but it is increasingly hard for people to see why their job is necessary and matters
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the irony is how many of our colleagues are themselves the annoyingentitledarrogant type
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im at the opposite end a lot of doctors treat us like cattle come in dont even seem to care what your history other problems or any other factors might be at play give pilllotiontreatment prescription and out the revolving door its infuriating because you are treating my well being for which on top of it all i have to pay like its no big deal i mean for fucks sake this psychistarist came in hours late to his office had never seen me before in less than mins i walked out of there with antidepressant prescription which had the side effects i told him i didnt want to have again its even more infuriating for me when dealing with my mom who has parkinsons she had to get surgery for her hand since she couldnt move it and then doctors in charge have her the same type of cast for any other person when we told them that due to her diskinesia it was not gona work they discarded this shit and now because of that bullshit cast she had to wear her shoulder is all fucked true patients can be dicks but doctors can be full of themselves and not listen when they should or even worse tell bullshit to go around an issue instead of admitting lack of knowledge and referring to someone more capable
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,brian reagan about what the guy who works the lost baggage desk at the airport says to every customer who walks in the door let me guess your super pissed off
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,have you had objects thrown at you yet thats always a fun time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,retail pharmacy for years i hate all people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,compassion fatigue is something that i didnt understand until i was in that exact situation at a normal school you can leave at the end of the day and you might be thinking about lesson plans or annoying admin but you can compartmentalize those things i cant drop my students issues at the door when i leave i worry about them constantly because i know the insanity theyre going home to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont totally understand your point how is poverty a brick wall you hit not part of adminpoliticsculture its the societal structure that restricts the amount of resources teachers and schools have to provide to all students particularly students from low income families
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,vaguely reminds me of that john mulaney bit about how middle schoolers are the worst because theyre smart enough to pick out your flaws but still too stupid to keep it to themselvesmiddle schoolers are my least favorite age of kid
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,taught for years here all highpoverty title and i agree with every goddamn syllable of this down to the electric tea kettle
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is the best list ive read thank you for sharing your insight and being vulnerable on a tough topic this is really going to help
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,go for it i picked up something where i have little to no supervision and drive around to business clients that are well established with my company already being so sedative didnt help with weight i went from being very athletic to a weak chubby drunk and not all human interaction is bad positive people can make a day great avoid working with the general public and its pretty ok i feel like old me already again
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they didnt outright say low iq but their reasoning hinted at it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yep not to mention that you essentially have to let people walk all over you all the time someone calls in and yells at you its not your job to hang up on them so you have to let them yell at you your boss mad at you because you stuck up for yourself on the phone and got in trouble for it you have to let your boss walk all over you because again your job is not to stick up for yourself i genuinely wonder how anyone could work at a call center for more than a year ive never felt more disillusioned and depressed than when i worked at a call center its genuinely dehumanizing to be treated like trash by the vast majority of people that you interact with in a day and i know that after id been yelled at by people over an hour shift i basically stopped talking to other people even people i liked because the simple act of interacting with other people had become anxietyinducing couple that with bosses who would point out to people that they could be replaced tomorrow because we were in a lowincome area and the job was a nightmare
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats how i feel in all jobs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,aint as easy as you think
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,currently trying to become a park ranger anyone working outdoors in nature would fit the bill and am at university its not that easy there are quite a few qualifications you have to gain such as chainsaw usage pesticide application and a variety of tool usage there are many more optional ones which would be beneficial on a cv whilst not particularly hard to achieve they are a lot of money and are time consuming as hell struggling with the money some courses are £ or more also experience is essential and often volunteering is the only option in getting experience luckily ive been volunteering for a few years at a nature reserve nearby so have some it is very beneficial to have a relevant degree but not essential im studying agriculture where i chose to do ecology forestry etc employers often want to see that youve attended species identification courses such as butterflies birds and flowers you need to be quite good at identifying certain species these are so interesting if youve got an interest in it joining a wildlifenature organisation is also useful there are so many benefits such as freediscounted courses and events you can donate as much as you can afford monthly you get updates on whats happening on the reserve too people working in this sector tend to be nice people too so are always willing to help so yeah bottom line its not that easy to get into but so worth it if you enjoy going to work everyday i dont really know if i should be more specific with what i want to do but i dont think you can at this point in time this is in the uk so might be different elsewhere hope this helps some people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i figure my masters im working towards in geochemistry has a bit of application in that direction so all is not lost
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its people like you that deny the conclusions made in this thread keep giving people hope bro
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i concur
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just means youll have to drive out next time you need to renew something that cant be done online and now that dmv will have twice as many people going to it so youre greeted by a long ass line after driving for an hour to get there source local dmv got shut down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,either that homeless woman was done putting up with shit or shes homeless because she cant put up with shit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,where is this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah there were bad points too i have learned that womens bathrooms are the most disgusting places on the planet seriously ladies manage your fucking tampons the wall is not where you put a used tampon ever dont do that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,perhaps the most salient pattern in the results is that among those industries with the greatest statistically significant elevations of rate over the population rate service industries which require frequent or complex interactions with the public or clients are disproportionately represented while among industries with the lowest rates that are statistically different from the population manufacturing industries are disproportionately represented although many service industries have low rates and some manufacturing industries have relatively high rates this supports the theory that the stress of emotional labor could contribute to depression
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and patientwheel chair transportation drivers delivery drivers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not a person cant confirm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just dealt with a lady today that was screaming at one of my employees calling her a stupid bitch because she didnt make her food item correctly the first time i tried explaining that we try our best and people make mistakes and i will comp your drink and fix it right away didnt help i think its not just the pressure of customers being complete asshole because they can but also you dont get to be you at all youre constantly pasting on a fake smile and some chipper attitude you work fast get yelled at and lie all day about how amazing your day is and that youre happy i hate my job
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the customer is always right is the single worst thing to happen to human civility and good service
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,came here to back up something like this good point i worked in a produce section for a large and lucrative chain for six years i guess i should start this off by saying that of the time maintaining a positive and welcoming attitude led to other people reciprocating my cheerful nature most of the people i dealt with during the swing shift were coming into our store after work and before finally making it home after sitting in traffic after a long day at the office i give people the benefit of the doubt if they come in with a less that chipper attitude but the reality is that a lot of people see others wearing a uniform and a name badge and see it as an opportunity to unload on them because they arent allowed to perpetuate hostile interactions and whats fucked up is that people arent even being rude to you they are being rude to your name tag because you are just the guy filling the bananas if people hated me because i was a dick who didnt know the difference between a fuji and a gala apple that would be understandable but for fucks sake lady i didnt write the thanksgiving order the new manager who couldnt give four fucks about people complaining because they are always hiding out in the back office did so im sorry we ran out of yams an hour before you realized you needed to run to the store
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im so glad that in my country im legally entitled to tell such customers to fuck off
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there is also a selection bias especially with customer service the people seeking them out have a problem that needs rectifying and often have already tried to mediate it in other ways
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is true its probably the closest thing people have to hiding behind the internet irl
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah its not just retail though i manage a front desk at a hotel for a major chain and the way people treat people in this industry blows my damn mind congrats on your platinum status still doesnt change the fact that were sold out a ton of hotels have implemented the satisfaction or money back guarantee which is terrible because it just invites conflict
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yet people will go nuts on the minimum wage worker as if its personally their fault and berate them even though theres not a damn thing they can do
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if someones a bitch im only giving you the help i have to so i dont get fired but if youre nice im gonna bend over backwards to make your slightly excited coupon work or tell you that we price match and if you pull this up on your phone real fast its less than half the price online
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im married now so my wife probably wouldnt take kindly to me dating but thats good advice also relevant watch how your partner treats their parents
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,b b but muh capitalism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is why we need basic income make wage slavery optional and see how much more support you receive from the company
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well its not particularly effective to yell because if you turn the rep against you they arent going to be very helpful dont yell be firm and if a rep cant do something for you ask to get directed to someone who has that authority sometimes these matters are very important a bank can make a mistake a fuck your credit and you better not just accept that because their customer service is designed to be garbage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the person you just replied to wasnt saying that though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people are assholes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people are stupid assholes and know that complaints free shit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sales is a profession where you must knowingly alter your natural behavior in order to convince someone that they need to spend money on something that they probably do not need it will change you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,glad you found something you enjoy i did a stint in retail and sadly while most people are pretty good its the assholes that stand out and do their thing more often
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what is your masters in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh it kills me too but unfortunately we have to focus to the middle keep those who are trying and succeeding going while trying to get the others caught up along the way
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i get to tell people to stfu and listen to me and answer my questions now i never realized this that would make a massive difference just in itself
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cant you get see their number though i called because i feared my neighbor was murdering his wife i told the operator every time he asked for my number that i wanted to be anonymous and his response is your number and address blah blah blah yeah never gave it out and he still found me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hey ex geek best buy credit card rep here of my calls are folks complaining that they didnt authorize geek squad to charge them and i have to explain that a lot of plans auto renew i especially like when they tell me that its illegal to do that good fun i apologize for any grumps i had to send your way to have those plans canceled
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,unfortunately those people in the staff room are the really jaded ones who have been there too long and its really is the same shit everyday but every now and then you get the one co worker thats just knows we dont have to be there i had a supervisor that used to tell the inmates that the correctional officers were the crazy ones because they decided to come back to prison everyday hours at a time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seems like a loselose if the inmates are nice or you grow to like and empathize with them you can be depressed about being the literal goaler and the bottom tier of cogs in a system that destroys peoples lives as you bear witness to it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yep thats what stuck
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,weve had sewer back ups before so yes for a time i too dwelled in shit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i could charge just under a grand a day for guided fly and top water sport fishing trips and prob get bookings a year with out trying and use fuck all fuel as we would be fishing the harbour and near shore spots i love to fish i love to teach people to think like a fish i love the look on their face when they get slammed by big kingy the look when i net or gaff a nice fish however i love it so much i think i would ruin it for my self i know what it takes to be a good guide however i just dont wnt to deal with the people i love people but hours on a meter boat with a fuck wit would prob leave me in jail and my client gutted and wrapped in the anchor chain and net and fed to the crabs i teach people i like for free and i walk dogs instead dogs are a mans best friend pretty girls love to pat dogs as much as they like to hang out on boats with their tops off
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i used to work as a nurse aide in a rehabltc facility and it was pretty hellish while i was never personally mad at the patients i understood that theyd rather not be here they dont come to us if they feel well etc theres only so many times i could deal with a rude patient getting pissed over something i cant control even after i explained im sorry i cant make the nurse give you youre acetaminophen faster shes got literally all of the hall to pass meds to first before i became jaded as hell hence why i quit rant over edit not to mention the work was just disgusting no one ever tells you in school just how disgusting it will get gags
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ill second that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i can believe that i was talking to a forensic psychologist who comes to our jail for the court system and this person was saying how they are really close to quitting because it just isnt what they signed up for
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a jobs a job not everyone can be the ceo of a fortune company a celebrity a doctor etc someones gotta do it and they gotta make money somehow and you dont know their life situation or what they are trying to do with their life no reason to talkdown on someone who you know nothing about the main thing i would think about is how would you want to be treated if you were in their position
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i used to work stocking shelves helping people and i saw the shit cashiers and people behind counters had to deal with and i always make sure to be polite quick and forgiving if something goes wrong kind of a lets work together to get through this mentality
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,always found it funny how stay at home moms would do stuff like this not that theres anything wrong with being a stay at home mom but why should you look down on others that do honest work
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just switch to a cooperative credit union that doesnt have overdraft fees theyre everywhere and your money tends to actually stay in your community
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,electron is very popular in the nordics if you get it verified by visa you can shop with it online like you would with a credit card that said i think electrons have had a lot of reliability issues for the last decade and are now kind of being slowly phased out maybe
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why should we let those people in i get in the right lane as early as i possibly can and i wait in those unbearably long lines so hell if im gonna let your ass in at the last moment ive been cussed at honked at almost hit so many times i guess im causing more trouble than i would be if i just let them cut but i just cant do it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i do retail long hour shift work as a shift manager i have this exact problem all the time usually its stuff like asking if they want a receipt when theyve already told me they want one the worst one was when i was serving and desperately trying to remember to ask one of the team members to go on their break afterwards but instead of asking the customer if they wanted a receipt i asked them if they wanted to go for their break luckily they found it pretty funny i fucking hate this line of work i get up at on my opening shifts and go to bed at on my closing shifts and as a result my sleep patterns are fucked physically i seem to be able to cope with the work but mentally im so drained looking at stepping back down to a team member role as my stress levels are through the roof
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when i worked at dairy queen in high school i literally had just gotten on shift and had a middle aged lady throw a chocolate milkshake at me and tell me to go fuck myself ruining my uniform for the whole shift so i had to got home and change clothes this for a milkshake i had obviously didnt have anything to do with because i wasnt even there when it was made and she didnt even explain what made her so angry im assuming she got the wrong order or something which we would have gladly fixed in a polite manner but she just threw the milkshake and left people just treat customer service people like dirt and you start to realize its not just a few rare people literally like almost of customers treated employees like they werent even human beings even though we were a very fast efficient restaurant that made good foodthis was one of the full service dqs with a full grill menu theres only so much being treated like subhuman trash you can take before you start to believe that all humans are just fucking pieces of shit who dont even care about basic manners they literally go around looking for excuses to make another humans day worse and i will never understand them now that job just taught me to just hate people and avoid them as much as possible and to be extra nice to anyone in customer service i always tip fast food workers bucks because they deserve it for the shit they have to put up with for minimum wage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive done time in retail pharmacy its like any other retail experience except there are drugs involved with obvious outcomes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the people that do it for decades and remain enthusiastic are super human
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i whole heartedly feel this comment to my core years in special needs field and i feel the same especially when you see the huge gap between poor schoolscommunities and the rich schools all within the same city
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is my life right now theres this idealistic version of reality where we want teachers to form close mentormentee type relationships with their kids but the reality is that this close relationshipgetting to know your kids experience their problems fight to advocate for their helpis exhausting this has been my experience at my school for the past couple of years and it seriously feels like im drowning
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the group im with is really good too im lucky im not in a good state for education so its the people that make it because the system is pretty much in shambles
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i worked with high school students and middle school students for years and the middle school students are waaaaaaay easier to work with than high school students middle school students actually listen because they have some sense of authority and want to learn more about the world high school students already have everything figured out and hate listening to any directions because of it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,personally i would have thought the low iq people would be more prone to theft purely because forward thinking may not be their strong point on the other hand maybe theyre more likely to not do a good job of not getting caught
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i worked years of customer service and tech support for home theater equipment i was depressed all years i had nightmares about having to go to work even a year after i quit now i work at my schools library and its incredibly fulfilling to help nice people with their tasks definitely the best job ive ever had and i dont dread going to work plus its quiet and peaceful and i get to listen to music most of the time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive been cold calling people to do political opinion polls on and off since years of that fucking septic trainwreck has broken me i hate people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,any place america
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont forget the door locking sound that comes from behind them when i go in p
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what im contesting is premise that certain jobs constitute more social interaction than others you say bus drivers are depressed because they deal with the public all day i disagree where im from the bus drivers never talk to anyone you need to prove certain jobs have more social interaction before you can say that because these jobs are more depressed its because of social interaction youve only proven that depression is more prevalent in some jobs over others and then come to a conclusion that the data does not directly support
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i do the wheelchair transportation thing for my local transit agency and its honestly not too bad i always go home feeling fulfilled that i was able to help people who otherwise wouldnt be able to go around live their life its not just wheelchairs though we also take ambulatory passengers who cant drive or take the regular bus for one reason or another
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,am person who is firm ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,deleted
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yup im a manager at a restaurant and had basically the same shit go down today i go from being in a great mood at the start of my day to hating everyone i see by the end of the shift
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that and this whole customer is always right bullshit that they believe yes the customer is always right but not in the sense you are thinking that shits for marketing nothing else i just wonder when people will get this memo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and the easy and obvious solution if youre being a douche get the fuck out and never come back boom problem solved but everyone cares more about money than basic humanity
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,worked in retail for years started a job in manufacturing and have never been happier pays a helluva lot more and i dont get chewed out over some pickles or the fact that no i cant give you free shit because you dont like i come home and not completely hate everyone and want to just go to sleep until the next shift
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yet the funny thing it only meant that the market dictates what you have to sell it has zero to do with individual people and everything to do with sales trends if anything it should be called the market is always right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,without getting fired and what country is that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its legal in most countries but would be fired for doing it legal is waaaay different than company guidelines
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,deleted
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its about power when people are powerless for example when the banks mess with their accounts they try and gain it in any way they can even if that means harassing a helpless call center worker instead of the real crooks it sucks but thats people for ya
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,each time a minimum wage employee is driven away by a horrible customer it costs the company more than by the time you factor in the hiring process and training this will be even more expensive if an experienced employee is driven off being awful to the poor schlub at the front desk doesnt help the offensive customer but it does hurt the company
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i only got one pickle on my double cheeseburger you fucking slackjawed waste of space how goddamn dare you cheat me out of my extra pickle i want to talk to a manager and i want you fired also a free large fries
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a slightly excited coupon dude you gotta get me one of those
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you guys kinda suck and sound like lazy shitty customer service reps i worked customer service call centers and still work in customer service in a different capacity now but at the point when we are involved usually your customers are getting fucked over by your shitty company and being forced to spend their time and money just to get the service they already paid for and clearly deserve of course being an asshole or a bitch does not helpor trying to scam services etc but dont act like of these people dont have legitimate gripes and have been forced to sit on hold or in line for minutes to then be told that they should change their attitude so many times i have called customer service lines comcast cox and with minutes of thought and a little bit of logic i would solve the problem faster than the rep i just feel like the industry sucks and people dont care about shitty jobs and that translates over into people who already have legitimate issues getting treated with indifference by someone making which in turn makes them crazy understandably so and on and on it goes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yep they throw adult temper tantrums and get their way every time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they leave a stain on your soul
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,collage and scrapbooking of course
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not in so many words obviouslybut i can speak to adults like my child if they cant get out of their own way or want to fight me for some reason it means everything we literally aint got time fo dat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,depends dont know what your jurisdiction is running software wise herea land line shows everything actual address and number a cell will just give a number and a broad location that may be accurate or miles off when we trace a live call we may get a triangulated location which will be close enough for a response when that doesnt happen and we need to respond open line aaaaggggghhhh clickgotta call your provider you are anonymous if you ask to be we only ask so we know where to go you have to ask us to come see you if you want that and we dont go tell the other people they called
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well dont leave us hanging was he
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no big deal we just send them to since online support cant cancel plans we just fix stuff within our scope of work its the sales guys that never tell them about auto renew or even that the plan doesnt cover everything anyway from what i heard the communication between departments was so awfulnonexistent i doubt i was even doing my full job from day one since our training was so bad and nobody monitored anything but client surveys and numbers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hours
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,arent prison shifts like hours thats what my brother in law works
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pretty girls love to pat dogs as much as they like to hang out on boats with their tops off i like the way you think
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this and also not everyone wants to be a ceo or something glamorous or amazing im a waiter and i consider hospitality to be my career im great at it and i hope to open my own establishment one day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dude you can opt out of overdraft protection this isnt exactly true they passed a law requiring the opt out choice but of course built in enough loopholes to effectively nullify the assumed purpose of the law so in the end it only works in the banks favor you can opt out of overdraft protection but only for point of sale purchases any monthly recurring charges such as netflix or your power bill are exempt and will overdraft you just as they did before which makes up the vast majority of overdrafts so forgetting which day of the month an automatic charge debits from your account and buying a soda and then lunch on that same day will still result in you overdrafting and getting charged fees the only thing it stops you from doing is essentially knowingly going to the store and spending a bunch of money you dont have andor dont intend to repay to the bank so they still collect just as many overdraft fees as ever they just dont let poor people screw them back by purposely shopping in an overdraft situation i maintain a healthy bank balance so it isnt actually a problem for me i just get really irritated by these laws that are advertised as helping people but get subverted along the way
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i used ing direct now capitalone and i have a overdraft line of credit no fees charged just around interest for the amount i use with that line of credit its really great
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,around here were constantly being educated that getting in the right lane early is what causes the long lines and we shouldnt do that but instead at the point where both come together everyone on the right needs to let in one car from the left it actually works
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and youre doing the right thing id be glad if they honk id show them the middle finger its the equivalent of fucktards who cut in line
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i had this exact thing happen to me with a big mac clocked in walked up to the counter customer walks in throws big mac at me leaves well ok then
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i had a redneck throw his gravy on me through the drivethru window he was mad because i wouldnt give him a free sausage biscuit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,similar thing happened me a couple weeks ago dude comes into work with a bag of food never a good sign and starts pulling stuff out while shouting at me about different things that are wrong with it he takes the lid off of a curry and pushes it towards me and it falls off the counter and over my lap burned like fuck he tried to half heatedly appologise by saying i didnt mean that and then continued on with his rant fuck that cunt i had his surname and mobile number from his original order told him i would be passing this on to the police and he couldnt believe it like did you think this was just an ok thing to do motherfucker
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the people that make an effort to improve kids live are pretty damn awesome too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is it really the rich poor thing or the kids i live in a small town with only one high school so they are all together i couldnt do it without our special ed teacher thank you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i dunno could be mental illness either way im certain it is somehow connected to her being homeless
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yup medical bankruptcy is a thing in the us part of the problem is that americans are too idealistic not enough mental health facilities just put them in jail hard to get your next fix of illegal drugs just go to the er and claim that you have lots of pain if we just addressed the real issues and nipped things in the bud wed be far better off and the burden on tax payers would be far lower why cant we have nice things ignorant people with strong convictions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just being around people is a form of social interaction you dont need to speak with them to hear them or have them complain about you andor your work or your people or something you like being around people especially strangers is itself a social stressor to the point many people develop anxiety about that most fundamental part of human interaction
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah and at least you get tips compared to bus or patient transportation drivers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,call me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,makes for a special kind of experience when it doesnt work though people like that have absolutely no idea wtf to do when someone possibly for the first time in their life tells them no and it is glorious
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this makes me feel lucky that at my job customers rarely get away with abuse this bad if they start raising their voice to any of us they are either asked by a manager to discuss the issue outside away from other customers or just asked to leave in my almost ten years with the company i have never seen anyone berated by a customer for more than seconds the managers are pretty quick to back us up and its nice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no you have it wrong the money is always right i worked customer service retail for years i can only think of a handful times that any customer was actually right and not just complaining causing a scene to get special treatment or something sorry sir the land in which i sow my fucks is barren i have no more fucks to give was always what was on the tip of my tongue while giving that placating smile
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes thats modern life we are all slaves to the rich and powerful with the illusions of freedom and free will we all have to kiss ass to make it in life how dare anyone question the corporate masters
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the thing is humanity is whatever humans do them treating these people this way is them demonstrating humanity and there are power relationships people need jobs jobs have specifications some of them like the ones people are talking about in this thread require that they put on a particular mask there is no obvious solution to life
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably the most misunderstood words in history and responsible for more human suffering and mental anguish than any other credo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i do it in canada well family owned business not my family i have told a few people to get the fuck out of the store before and im sure it will happen again
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,brazil where if the customer starts to get too pissy i can say that legally im not obligated to hear his cussing and insults and transfer his call to my supervisor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i bouncebartend in a bar i get to tell people to fuck off all the time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,let me know when the ceo is willing to field a couple of hours of calls per day to get in touch with the customer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you do this please try to remember that you are literally fucking with actual peoples lives not some company face
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i mean i knew operators need to be able to have some control over the interaction but i hadnt made the connection that having that little bit of control can make a shit job into a decent one btw i have a deep respect for emergency workers i cant even pick up the phone to order a pizza because of my anxiety so i have so much respect for people who can handle highstress jobs like that thank you for what you do
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for some values of
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,at my facility we have three shifts of hours for the most part they are and and there are several specialize posts that are like and and i believe its the same though out my state with each facility setting certain posts to work for their facility as they see fit the only staff that works a hour shift is our medical staff since they are a contractor and their is a lot less of them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the people i know have hours shifts but if the person that is supposed to relieve you calls in sick then you cant leave and end up working double shifts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats such an awesome attitude
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hospitality business major here good to see others that actually like it too being good at it is important because you are able to squash complaints before it has even happened i have waited tables and worked front desk at hotels and eventually actually became good at handling angry people so then it gets to the point where you dont handle many angry people and the amount of appreciative people makes everything worthwhile
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,depends on your bank at mine they wont allow any charge to go through if the funds arent available
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my comment was extremely simplified there are absolutely many factors that can cause frustration as a teacher or any service provider the desparity between a poorly funded program school and community vs a school thats in the burbs with a much higher income bracket is just one on a long list dont get me wrong i love the kids i work with every day sometimes i cannot even believe i am being paid for what i do on certain days because it doesnt feel like work but that doesnt mean that on other days it isnt stressful or that i dont take home my work mentally there is a reason why turnover rate is high among certain fields people can simply burn out whether it be fatigue or realizing this isnt the field for you a lot of it has to do with maintaining that worklife balance selfcare is essential also i just want to say this is my personal experience and can only speak for myself each particular job entails certain types of stress and everyone deals with it differently i just happen to relate to what she mentioned above and finally just to be clear i worked in behavioral intervention for children in many different roles but am not specifically a special education myself different credentialscertifications
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was at a grocery store not too long ago and some alcoholic looking motherfucker started screaming at another customer standing in line saying ill fucking stab you in the neck it truly sounded like he meant it and everyone was visibly afraid of this man it was surreal a nice grocery store and a homely looking gentleman buying some food getting borderline assaulted at knifepoint in front of witnesses for no reason
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yup i said once that jail is the way we deal with mental illness in america it sucks try to help somebody get off drugs they need long term housing food clothing medical care psychological care education job training in jobs that have a future that is just for one person but there are probably out there i dont know what the answer to these seeming overwhelming needs is but the answer shouldnt more jails and more coffins planted in potters fields for young addicts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,name checks out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can confirm i used to work phones at the call center for a bank too i had pleasure from telling some rich snobby bossy types who are used to pushing people around and getting their way no it wasnt something i had control over over much of the time so the bank had my back but just seeing how childish some of them responded was quite comical and gratifying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that sure as hell is not the case for any major store in canada you have to bend over backwards its degrading and dehumanizing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i work for a silicon valley based tech company our ceo does take phone calls hes got a monthly requirement and during our busiest time of the year he visits the centers getting hit the hardest and helps us with calls also during this time our entire company like ppl that dont normally take calls are paid to travel to the nearest center that does they are trained and get on the phones themselves i know we are the exception but this is the type of behavior needed to tell us phone agents that everyone that can help is helping and makes our lives easier for it having that peace of mind
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hey i agree with you most ceos are aholes i was just explaining why people verbally abuse the folks at the call center who had literally nothing to do with their troubles
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that would be a waste of their time and company money even if they werr great at it they have better things to do
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah if something in a store pisses you off just stop shopping there the retail people wont give a shit and itll have an effect on the companys profit so theyll actually care
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hours is standard for a lot of hospitals the one my friend worked at only had a few eight hour shifts and it was for some nurses but mostly janitorial
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,indeed i was a sales guy at a small retail store was there for years and the owners trusted me completely they knew i wasnt screwing around wouldnt ever be rude without a damn good reason or not do a service i was allowed to do it was always really gratifying when someone demanded to complain to my superior expected me to freak out and was sorely disappointed when i didnt care in the slightest the best was when the answer was just no you can leave now if theres one thing ill miss about retail its firing a customer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre missing the point it isnt to service customers its to understand what customers are saying you know how ceos pay consultants marketing companies and statisticians millions of dollars to receive studies on what their customers are saying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you are in a rare of retail workers if most other people said that they would be fired almost immediately even if they werent screwing around and had a damn good reason
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,outbound telemarketing is soul crushing the script makes its way into your dreams
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i love it when data is displayed like this not only does it make it easy to understand but its pleasing to the eyes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id be nice if the website banner wasnt fixing itself along the parrallel
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,patterns seem pretty random only the middle states seem to do somewhat better on average what is the reason big difference between urban and rural
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why are the colors flipped between the thumbnail and the full sized map
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lots of growth in southern maryland and northern virginia region must be all the valuable goods and services that come out of that area
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,slightly misleading to use new york city as an example wage growth in those counties within the political jurisdiction of new york city have grown slowly but in manhattan theyve risen quite a bit also all the exurbs outside new york city have seen tremendous wage growth but that says something about new york city all the same since the people in those areas probably commute to the city for work as is the standard pattern i would assume that this is based on census figures in which case theyre counting people based on their home versus their work address
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that website is awful it puts a banner across the middle of the visualization
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,any chance anyone would have data for average american personal income for by state im doing a research project and would really appreciate a link edit im also not a bot i just picked a strange username when drunk
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,weird that they threw buffalo into the same boat as rochester when erie county had average wage growth compared to monroe county the good news is that the unemployment rate is fairly low for upstate which should mean an increase in wages as long as the economy doesnt tank
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow interesting compare this with the precinct map of the election a few posts down and you have your answer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we should have a subreddit for this sort of thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,farm country has done pretty well over the last years manufacturing areas especially smaller mill townscoal townsetc have suffered enormously
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,urban areas saw most of the post recovery
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are you on mobile it appears normal to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hey there journalist here there was a bug with the scale on the mobile version ive just deployed a fix the desktop scale is correct thanks for flagging
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the data are based on what people earn working in a county they do not necessarily live there too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,make it ill join ya and help you moderate it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,most of farm country have lost population for almost a century so they were going up from being bottom their also the areas thats arent as dependent on manufacturing because of their lower populations then in texas because of oil and gas rigs rural areas have seen increased income growth because oil prices going up since years ago
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was im on desktop now and it matches in the mobile version of the map texas and north dakota are purple
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,real funny shitbell
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wonder how much this has to do with espns subscription numbers dropping off
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah its been rough for those of us who bet on games more difficult but not impossible but this is self correcting it will change as the season moves on the problem has been teams like arizona and carolina underperformed while denver dallas and atlanta are performing better than expected
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,urickyvee your submission was removed for violating the following rules a post must include a this post has been removed for information regarding this and similar issues please see the httpswwwredditcomrdataisbeautifulwikiindex if you have any questions please feel free to httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetordataisbeautifulsubjectquestion regarding the removal of this submission by urickyveemessagei have a question regarding the removal of this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean if you told me that one of the superbowl teams was and the other id assume denver took the loss of its two main qbs pretty hard and carolina picked up where they left off never would have guessed it was opposite probably by week a clearer picture will form and some of these lines will even out by then we will know if the teams who started hot are really good or just a fluke
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ironically nepal which is shown as not killing themselves was in the news about a decade ago when their crowned prince went berserk and gunned down half the royal family including the king at the time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what about sudan
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,istanbul constantinople is shown as being part of greece edit corrected the name
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,woah thats crazy was he paranoid about something
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,paraguay mozambique guyana and a bunch of caribbbeancentral american countries are missing too edit thanks for the clarification i feel like the guy who comments on news articles only reading the clickbait title
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it happened during a one of the monthly royal dinners according to the wiki article the prince dipendra was heavily drunk as well as stoned on hashish he was also told off by his dad king birendra for having misbehaved with one of the guests he was asked to leave the party he returned back an hour later armed with multiple firearms and first took a shot at his dad before it turned into a full fledged massacre he ultimately shot himself though the article doesnt say whether by accident or not he ended up in a coma and died a few days later in hospital after first having unknowingly become king upon his dads death httpsenwikipediaorgwikinepaleseroyalmassacre the wiki article on the incident
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i will never understand the use or spaces tabs are designed for exactly that purpose
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,interesting data would have been nice if darker shades of green more spaces i dont know why one would choose shades of green otherwise i had to continuously refer back to the legend
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres a big debate but the only quality ive ever found to space indenting is that there is no ambiguity whether the end of the line falls over limit or not the columns otherwise its all the same and editors are smart enough to handle both of them in exactly the same way i must be one of the who use tabs for python
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nope check go
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,apply directly to the forehead
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks to the internet at least we know now what is going on in elections before democracy was murdered and people acted like they have chosen their representative sanders and trump owe whatever they have in this race to the internet and awareness had there not been the internet it would have been clinton vs rubio now and clinton would win

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the title appears twice you moron
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is true the media played right into trumps hands by plastering bis face all over websites and trying to down talk him all they did was give him free publicity trumps team has played this election cycle like geniuses so far
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what are the numbers the bar represents total edits edits per week
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just hopping in here to rep the internet archive which is the data source for this as mentioned by op we used audio fingerprinting to generate the data by analyzing the hours of postdebate programming on those three networks compared to the debates the system we built uses an open source fingerprinting tool called audfprint and the system itself is also open source httpsgithubcomsliftytvarchiveduplitron happy to explain more about that process for anybody interested this blog post also goes into a little bit about the technology edit also worth noting we are completely happy to give out our data to anybody who wants to play with it check out httppoliticaladarchiveorgdebateproject also if folks want me to run an analysis for them comparing tv content id be glad to do so
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we were curious how different channels covered the debate pundits are at their most influential post debate strongly shaping how the public views the debate starting with a list of replayed clips and their start times durations i tried bucketing clips by their it wasnt quite granular enough to see the interesting movements i also played with a sort of to show both the start and duration of clips while a little strange i really liked this approach and think it could have worked we were running short on time the data was only ready yesterday around pm and theres another debate coming up soon we ended up going with a simpler form that doesnt try to show each individual clip but still incorporates the duration data charts are were made with data from the httppoliticaladarchiveorgdebateproject
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did you ever see that one that demonstrates all the money debt derivatives etc in the world or maybe the one on radiation i dont have the name for it that mightve been cool but instead of the solid background for the graph you couldve used transcribed gifs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do you have links not familiar with what youre asking about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes it is httpmoneyvisualcapitalistcomalloftheworldsmoneyandmarketsinonevisualization
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is it safe to say that political connections and resource related is mostly attributed to corruption i know that is drastically simplifying the issue but can anyone shed some light on the various categories shown here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,looks like if you want to be politician russia is the best place to live at
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i love how financial sector for the uk covers the south somebody did that on purpose
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,possibly speeches and the like a la bill clinton
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,russian do not live very long
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,knowing my grandparents most that that socialisingrecreation time is staring at the fire
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,data from the bureau of labor statistics chart made in excel feedback appreciated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think breaking up the overall chart into individual area charts below is a great idea the most likely complaint of the multiitem area chart would be its difficult to see and compare individual trends this was mitigated because of how the content was setup below the main data visualization great job
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how does volunteering count id hope this would be somewhat high given how much they complain about society id like to see them doing something about it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what type of graph is this and how might i go about creating it in excel
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,does the gif loop i think the geezer broke it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i second this the graph is pretty cool
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah if only op would reply
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you for your original content op ive added to your user flair as gratitude if you didnt already have official subreddit flair for the readers the poster has provided you with information regarding where or how they got the data source and the tool used to generate the visual tools for this post to ensure this information isnt buried i have stickied this link below for your convenience i hope this sticky assists you in having an informed discussion in this thread or inspires you to remix this data for more information please httpswwwredditcomrdataisbeautifulwikiflairwikiocflair
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,data source analysis excel us representatives are elected by district within each state i calculated the difference between the expected number of representatives in each state given the total votes for each party in each state and the actual representatives in each party this calculation allows you to see which states have the most biased representation in the us house of representatives i calculated overrepresentation o as o r – ptr where r the number of actual representatives for a party in a given state p number of votes for that party and t the total votes in the state i calculated overrepresentation as ou where u is the total number of representatives in a state for example arizona had democrats republicans and independents vote in the election those votes elected democrats and republicans the expected number of republican representatives was of the representatives or the actual number of republican representatives was of the total for a total of overrepresentation by republicans in arizonas representatives not bad arizona a couple of notes states featured overrepresentation by the minority party maine wisconsin and virginia maines election was almost perfect but wisconsin and virginia are both two of the most severely gerrymandered states in the nation to the point that in virginia of the vote won of the representatives vermont had an interesting scenario in that its lone representative was nominated by the democrats and by writein the republicans there are states included in this analysis that only have representative delaware montana wyoming south dakota north dakota and vermont by default those states are going to have overrepresentation no matter how districts are drawn in total across the country overrepresentation favored republicans republicans had more representatives than expected given vote totals democrats had fewer representatives than expected and independents had fewer representatives than expected however the only state that obtained enough independent voters to warrant full representation was california independents should have representatives given statewide numbers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it can hardly be called surprising how every single distortion of us representative democracy turns out to the net favor of the republican party given its incessant and unbounded attacks on the ability of large sectors of the american population to vote
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the speeches are available everywhere via google here is the code httppastebincomarnbanap and here is trumps speech
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hi ecredd this posts violates rule which states that political posts can only be posted on thursdays this is exactly the type of oc we are looking for here so i hope you will post it again on thursday thanks
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sure thing will post thursday agreed about rule
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the colours represent which party formed government with solid colours meaning majority government and multi colours meaning minority with the largest party colour at the bottom and the junior coalition partners at the top to make this i used microsoft excel information taken from httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofaustralianfederalelections as you can see early australian political history is fairly messy

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that in transition is a lie too theres a federal universal health plan for the aged medicare but the incoming administration is more likely to privatize or cut that than to transition towards universal health
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you know everyone is welcomed to leave and move to mexico they will love to have you perhaps an exchange program
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,actually being in arizona i do know quite a few people who have gone to mexico for health coverage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i hope your ignorance isnt contagious
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,four i count fourteen with full universal healthcare
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you dont have the money all of these countries will be better than the us cause they will let you die without caring even a little bit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank god for that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im just saying to look at mexico and say see they do something we dont do it must be better if we just copy them it will be great do you want to be like mexico if thats your goal ok but if not stop this nonsense of comparing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im guessing the downvotes come from the insuation that all universal healthcare countries have poor healthcare eighter that or the insulting tone
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all of those countries have pretty decent healthcare
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to be fair mexico doesnt score all that bad compared to the us when it comes to healthcare according to the who
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i made this the results are visible to anyone the hope of the people doing this is that these victims will remain nameless and these crimes will go unreported this is a simple way to prevent that from happening please share and distribute to everyone you know httpssitesgooglecomviewreportadetaineehome

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just from the top of my head the ohio state knife attacker was a somali on a student visa so theres at least one rquityourbullshit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,was that considered a terrorist attack
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,bin laden this dude i dont know if you have heard of him was from this country nobody really knows about called saudi arabia
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,additionally op should specify if hes only counting terrorism in the us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,anything is considered a terrorist attack if it supports naziman
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,more because hes taking ideas from hitler directly releasing a list of crimes committed by immigrants is something that hitler did filtering out people based on where they come from and their religion is something that hitler did
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is actually a small multiples view of energy flow charts useful to see the states that use lots of coal those that are industry heavy click on a chart to see the detailed flow of energy sources to usage sector
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,source education at a glance section tool used was excel
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,am i stupid or do ppl with a masters earn times as much as someone without any college education
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so what am i looking at for denmark i index over no college education i feel this lacks some explaination or im just an idiot who doesnt understand the graph
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,base is an upper secondary education or a high school education – definitions vary from country to country and essentially it means someone who did not go to college
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,bases is a premium
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so with a college degree i earn points more than someone without
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes as compared to someone has a high school education

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think he will even try it would devastate big parts of the economy i dont think anyone wants to pay for a head of lettuce
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so im guessing under the hood you have a natural langue dictionary that is associated to the user inputted query and you are using regex to pattern match the sql verbs and nouns needed to return a result set using regex
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the included sample dataset is gdp and life expectancies by country from from httpdatabankworldbankorgdatahomeaspx the natural language recognition is made using pattern analysis i have created a list of a couple dozen frequently asked data questions and users questions are dissected to match one of these patterns charting made using highchartsjs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,data from httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofwarsinvolvingaustralia i didnt include wars with no fatalities such as the war on isil the gulf war and the emu war
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a post must include a this post has been removed post titles must describe the data plainly without using sensationalized headlines clickbait posts will be removed this post has been removed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the datas comes from openstreetmap created with photoshop
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,directly link to the httpwwwredditcomrdataisbeautifulwikiindexwikioriginalsources of the visualization the original source is httpwwwopteorg this post has been removed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i didnt know this thank you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they had been making steady progress time to increase cheetah population there sprinting to extinction
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for just a cent id only jump max whoever is paying these tigers is a cheapskate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i saw an interview with a tiger conservationist once who was talking about how traveling around india really opened his eyes to the tiger population problem he said he rarely met anyone who wanted to increase the population of tigers who actually had to live in the same habitat as them and lose children and loved ones to them he said he was scolded as an arrogant foreigner who sits in his safe house and tells people to increase the population of extremely dangerous animals while completely isolated from the dangerous they bring he said he was ran out of more than one village by angry mobs that wanted to kill him for even bringing up the idea of saving tigers it was really interesting to think about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so for just ¢ i can get it to jump people if so i better get started on a list
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is there a problem with their legs now why arent they jumping all the way
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this article is a year old i cant find the link but tiger canyons in south africa wrote a response saying that it wasnt actually a good thing and the data is misleading
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,damn i thought i was clicking on a link to a video of all the tigers in india doing a little synchronized jump my new years is ruined fuck you and
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if there are too many tigers in the future they can always introduce velociraptors to reduce the population
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we need someone from httpsredditcomrdataisbeautiful to clean up that infographic i cant figure out what theyre trying to say
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,good news for tigers bad news for folks living in the sunderbans conservationist good news there will be more maneating tigers here soon sunderban person wtf why conservationist because its their home and because they are endangered sunderban person well yeah theyre endangered we did that in purpose those fuckers eat us conservationist buck up sissypants
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im thankful for an increase now if we could do that for polar bears and a bunch of other beautiful endangered species
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how accurate is this data its not like you can send every tiger a census form to fill out the higher numbers in the last few years could simply be better counting and reporting of a smaller population look at number of tigers reported poached vs the decline in population there is no correlation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so for every cent theres more tigers damn hope india isnt a rich country
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,flooding the jungles with barry white music is having the desired effect
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,after the jump theyre still at of their population according to the article they have a long way to go we have to realize that approaching the human carrying capacity of the earth means fewer large animals which means more extinctions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yayyy i love animals now make the whole world go vegan force us if you have to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i read the title as indias tiger problem jumps per cent honestly both titles could be equally valid
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i appreciate what theyve been doing for animals in general and specifically for tigers but cheetahs dont exist in india if it did i think they wouldve done a far better job then the rest of the world is doing right now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theyre edit sorry
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,africa is gonna have to do something there wont be anything left there to shoot or poach
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,paythetigers livingwagesforlivingtigers whentheysayjumpyousayraise
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my hero
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are you in any way related to kenm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats true even now lots of place were suddenly wildlife sancturies without moving the villages and people out of it now reserve forests have big ass tribal populations in it and conservationists wonder what to do about it answer nothing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this seems so unbelievable hmm maybe he travelled only to the bengal region maneating tigers are a problem there but other regions of india tigers are the pride and soul of many forests in india my native village would love them india is pretty huge and the cultures are diverse its tempting to believe in narratives like that i know
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just like the wolves in spain just that they eat people and not animals
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,inbreeding fuckin incestous tigers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,velociraptors vs tigers would be dope
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,where was this tiger sightings are rare even in most tiger reserves because they are extremely elusive animals thats why photographers stay for weeks before getting a decent photo are you sure you werent scammed its very common in india
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont think thats true most indian rural communities have selfmade rules to protect wildlife many communities lead their lives next to monkeys and tigers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think the indian government probably sees more value in the ecotourism that tigers bring than the farmers theyre going to eat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,get em to india
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,polar bears will just be miserable in the warmed up ice caps as they become tiny little islands
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they track them probably
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i always wonder when i read these articles what the maximum number will be that people aim for seems high and a very big danger to humans to be kept in the wild if you talk reserves and captivity i doubt it will ever be allowed to becomes this high again but i could be wrong
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there is no typo percent is only used in america its per cent elsewhere
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,haha whats the typo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think its gonna be ever possible to bring population back to those levels we have to make sure the big cats population doesnt fall below critical levels
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i agree at some point your going to have inbreeding say round
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cheetahs existed in india but they were wiped out by hunting madhya pradesh is trying to reintroduce cheetahs back
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,tiger conservation programme project tiger was launched in by the government of india during prime ministerindira gandhis tenure but it is only in past few years the tiger count has started to increase that means theyre finally doing something right other countries with cheetahs can learn from india and follow
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cheetas definitely used to live in india in fact the etymology of the word cheetah traces back to hindi
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont know where you get the idea but cheetahs are native and plenty in india cheetahs coming to human habitat and harming people and livestock is very prevalent in south and west karnataka even more so than tigers which often prefer to stay in forests
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but cheetahs dont exist in india lmao indians need to do something about polar bears penguins too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not really fair to compare a country to a continent though a bunch of countries are really trying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dunno if africa has the resources that india and china can employ back when i worked as an elephant conservation researcher in india tons of government money flowed into protection efforts there has to be a will and enough money im not sure if sub saharan africas small economies can manage it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nope but this is terrible right its not like the tigers can stand up for their rights
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre thinking of cheetahs theyre the ones getting wiped out partially due to the fact that there is no genetic diversity inbreeding being one of the many factors
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,until a tiger rates your kid
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you are ignorant
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,indian govt isnt the chinese govt it cant really act with that much autonomy and foresight
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if anything killing off the poor peasant people will benefit the countrys crazy overpopulation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that wouldnt surprise me at all ecotourism and world opinion counting for more than your people is an age old story
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cheetah bhi peeta hai
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lol wut my native is karnataka and theres no cheetah there youre probably thinking of leapords
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there was a native cheetah population in india but they only live in iran now iirc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this particular situation is complicated by the fact that india is a subcontinent still not fair but a little more fair
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,some would if they werent corrupt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah okay if youre going specifically for tigers sightings choose karnataka next time both bandipur and nagarhole are extremity beautiful and clean and tiger sightings are far more common
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i rate that kid an out of ten he was pretty tasty
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ok do you have a source that says otherwise
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,africa is obviously way bigger than india but not all of africa has cheetahs im going to still lean towards no india has a national government the closest thing africa has is the au and thats not at all the same thing if the entire subcontinent needed to cooperate on something how well would it go
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its on a sub continent but not the only country on the subcontinent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for the downvotes have these facts as repayment🙂 httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiindiansubcontinent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hey rdataisbeautiful rtruthiness is taking over
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would say that the title is potentially misleading for a couple of reasons when discussing the body ideals of the distant past we have to keep in mind that artistic depictions do not necessarily equal an ideal body shape you conflate artistic depictions with playboy and miss america when playboy is meant to titillate whereas paintings and sculptures are not always meant to miss america winners are also determined by other factors such as speaking and talents as well as appearance so a miss america winner is not a straight representation of an ideal body also in short whr is a reliable and quick measure of fat deposits in women that is related to youthfulness ability to produce offspring and longterm health is not fully accurate waist to hip ratio is not only about fat the shape and size of the pelvic bones are a significant factor in whr in historic specimens we occasionally see women who had rickets as adolescents whose hips bent under their body weight resulting in a very narrow appearance and an extremely narrowsometimes closedbirth canal these women would have a high whr regardless of the amount of fat present edit you also seem to skip over the obsession with tiny waists of the centuries
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you watch the miss america gif it appears that not much has changed according to the article i didnt read it words were tiny
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so youre saying they figured it out in god job girls less pasta more crunches
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so men have always like women with smaller waist than hips weve always wanted the hourglass nothing has changed nothing will
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you are completely right about this we just dont have the data to analyze certain things as is true of any science bias and speculation tends to fill in the gaps that we do not have data for
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,their previous study that this is based off is a little problematic too it claims that there has been no change in preferred cup size in the last halfcentury as measured with playboy models but it didnt even include the band size which meant they were treating a and a as the same size and the charted data showed that the models average a c cup which means a bust measurement more than the band measurement which seems very unlikely considering some of the playboy models especially those with breast implants have an extremely large bust measurement and a very small band measurement i really have to question where they got these cup sizes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,any short title is going to have opportunity to be read in a way that a person would find misleading the title is just to give you an idea about what this is about which it does successfully and the actual content in the link answers the questions that a word title cant answer just take it for what it is the person explains their methodology analysis and conclusions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my gripe is that the title would be much more accurate if it made fewer assumptions such as waisttohip ratios in depictions of women ce
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oops edited
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it is physically possible have you never seen men with potbellies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,using the different shades of blue for windows is pretty but totally impractical for example the big section in the middle that im pretty sure corresponds with windows xp my only choice is to basically count over from windows or windows also i dont know what to do with chrome os its not even visible on the graph im assuming its the area between mobile and linux that has slightly higher line weight
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i like the shades of blue i see right off the bat the entirety of microsofts shrinking market share if i wanted to get really detailed and take a deeper look the blues might throw me off but its good the way it is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,source tools code inspired by as well as observing httpscommonswikimediaorgwikifileoperatingsystemmarketsharesvg on i wanted to make the following improvements group os families by color force an area plot expanding the data set to most recent available since the data included browser information as well i decided to plot browser market share in addition
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,would it be better with labels pasted on the particular shade what would you do differently grouping osfamily by color is something pretty obvious which ive never seen done and wanted to try it out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think grouping by color is appropriate what if all the linuxen were different colors or each macos version by grouping windows into blue you can see at a glance the gradually decreasing share of microsoft products over time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i see your point but comparing different versions of windows is really difficult which feels as important to me as comparing market share of the different platforms a compromise might be to add patterns of some kind to the different windows versions so theyre still distinguishable but easily identified as a group or if they were labeled on the graph that might work too both of those might make the graph a little uglier but i dont think aesthetics should get in the way of readability
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think the next time around ill position some labels inside the areas perhaps i was thinking last week that most people were more familiar with ms products and wouldnt need labels but i see thats different now the whole thing was done in r and explained in the code itself is opensource in case youd like to generate or modify it yourself
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think i might include labels on my next iteration
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ggplot is a bit more fun and once you get the hang of it its a lot easier to control than rs basic plot or the lattice package i think httpswirlstatscomstudentshtml has a good tutorial on it as well as hadleys
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a simple chart made with r data from the atp world tour was scraped with r the code used is on
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i had a question about whether or not this was a trend for older players in the game earlier today 😄 i put your graph as an answer on a site im launching soon
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,reagan cost of living inflation new economic problems clinton fixing of economic problems new economic problems obama fixing of economic problems trump to be continued i might be wrong here but im seeing a pattern ps a wasnt alive for most of this could anybody explain what exactly is meant by cost of living inflation in the pre presidents

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are the moving dots representative of time spent during transit for example would dots moving across the great plains of the united states correlate with time spent crossing the plains what does each dot represent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can you explain what you mean by part of a family tree do you mean one specific family line
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,some different styling white background colored by origin an example of another dataset that will be added to the mix with a data slider the transatlantic slave trade in minutes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how this is from randomly selected people so the sampling could just be randomly biased away from italian and german migrants to southern brazil
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this map shows population density as well as the malaria plasmodium falciparum incidence rate per people in africa in areas of high population density are represented by vertical rises in the lines and malaria incidence is represented by the color of the lines the lines are grey where there was no data for malaria incidence data sources nasas socioeconomic data and applications center malaria atlas project httpwwwmapoxacuk tools r methods use the raster package to combine a shape file of countries in africa with a raster of population density and a raster of malaria incidence then use this same package to turn the combined raster into a data frame group latitude lines together so ggplot knows to draw each line connecting longitude points that are on the same line of latitude more details can be found here httpdataspikedcom

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i categorized death coverage in the first pages of the new york times compared to actuality over a month period ive been intrigued about why so many make threat assessments based on news coverage and wanted to see if the sampling of news was close to representative i manually categorized articles in google docs graphs were made in tableau or the new york times data only represents the first few pages not the entire paper which is how many people may read it but includes obituaries of the famous and yes i went through each individually to record how they died most actual death stats come from the cdc or who and you can find original source data on deaths
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,really interesting read and interesting perspective how the news are picturing a the world that we dont really live in i feel the reason for the different coverage is of course obvious nobody wants to read about whos grandma died of old age deaths for natural causes are not that interesting because they follow the norm so it would have made sense to remove them from the picture and just include deaths for non natural causes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont understand why you are using bs in this chart if the current venezuelan currency is bsf so many zeroes and its a bit crude to summarize the causes of venezuelas economic crisis as simply socialism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,socialism effects in venezuelas economy the bolivar revolution happened in yet your graph only covers also a log plot would be a lot better for your data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i need context to start to appreciate the subtitle did venezuela announce theyd go socialist at the end of
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,socialism venezuela is a corrupted social democracy at best it has nothing to do with socialism

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,shout out to the dude in who used the word before it had been invented
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,looks like racism didnt exist before what was that martin luther king guy complaining about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i added xenophobia and sexist seems that all three mirror each other there seems to be peaks between and maybe the presidential campaigns
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats really cool i added these key terms
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,at this rate the new york times will consist entirely of the word racism repeated over and over by around
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people are rushing to infer all kinds of crazy from this which i dont think is very valid you can enter love and see a similar rise
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,personally im delighted to see tacos making a resurgence not seen in a century httpchroniclenytlabscomkeywordracismtacostacos
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also interesting is the crazy use of the word millennial this last couple years it occurs in more nyt articles now than it did during httpchroniclenytlabscomkeywordmillennial
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wish to point out that there is a similar spike within the last few years with african black and lives all of which are increase more than the about in the indicated graph httpchroniclenytlabscomkeywordracismblackafricanlives
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive noticed since the many bad things that happen to people of color that were unrelated to racism were called racism i think its unfortunate because its watering down the term and causing people to take racism less seriously when real racism occurs we need to speak out forcefully against it however when a student of color is suspended for beating up another kid we need to not give a voice to his parents and friends who blame his consequences on racism it is a disservice to those who suffer real racism and it causes whites to view claims of racism with suspicion thus becoming less prone to being receptive to recognizing actual racism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nobody has mentioned that the very highest point on the graph is just of articles does that seem like too high to yall
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so many ignorant explanations in this thread whatever the reason for the increase in use its not the writers at the new york times the same trend line would be true for fox news as well if one was made racism is more of a cultural topic today than it was years ago you can blame the media all you want but more actual people want to talk about it today than they did years ago my guess is the trayvon martin case started it and then black people decided to start filming what they perceived as unfair treatment by law enforcement on their phones and voila you have engaging media content that fosters debate believe racism is a problem in todays world or dont just dont be ignorant and blame the liberal writers at the new york times for manufacturing the issue
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id love to see this compared with another statistic showing the actual extent of racist incidents
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpchroniclenytlabscomkeywordracistracismsexistsexismxenophobexenophobia lol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,demagogue is presents a far more interesting chart httpchroniclenytlabscomkeyworddemagogue demagogue n a political leader who seeks support by appealing to popular desires and prejudices rather than by using rational argument
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i bet they said racist a lot more back when slaves were around what of course they wouldnt slaves were around because racism wasnt an issue to anyone and because it wasnt an issue it wouldnt have been talked about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,interesting i searched for the word shooting using the tool and it roughly follows the same trend as racism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpchroniclenytlabscomkeywordracismracistnazifascist interesting graphs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,peaked right after the race riots which makes sense since they did have to report on the race riots
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what is the significance of of articles i feel like that is negligible much less something to laud as an alltime high this statistic if anything is a good sign that the mainstream is becoming more intune with the police brutality employment discrimination and implicit bias that has been swept under the rug one out of every nyt articles mentions the word racism for the first time in its history as one of the lefts forefront newspapers and that is supposed to be a lot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,alright so three words hitler communism and global keyword for globalism fall of hitler coincides with the rise of communism as communism eases out globalism eases in fucking conspiracy theorists were right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,makes sense click bait journalism is way easier and more profitable than the real kind i actually place most of the blame on the consumer they wouldnt publish mountains of click bait if we consumers didnt eat that stuff up like mcdonalds
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the left has made race and identity politics their mainstay these past two years its one of the reasons they lost i also think well see less of it since they now realize its backfired its no surprise the race baiting when it comes to the police has fallen to pretty much nil now months ago any police shooting would have been front page on cnn and havent seen anything in months
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,perhaps if msm politicos werent working together in some weird selfserving symbiosis to keep things like racism misogyny homoislamohoplowhatever phobias alive kicking the human animal would by now have moved past all that bullshit fuck the propagandized and agendized media
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in the declaring people communists was used to instantly discredit someone and ruin their professional life dont talk to theyre a communist dont do business with its run by communists yet at the time there were amongst the sea of people falling for the red scare voices of reason who said the whole thing was overblown and was being used to attack people first and bring light to some sort of actual problem as a distant second now the people who once praised those voices of reason are lining up to try to argue why branding everyone who has ever disagreed with them as a racist is now completely sane and makes total sense theyre already swarming all over this thread because acting like were living in the dark ages of race relations because you read something nasty someone anonymously wrote on the internet isnt a massive fucking insult to people who literally had to use negroonly bathrooms or anything racism is the lefts mccarthyism and theyre so brainwashed and clueless that they are falling for it just like people did back in the funny how farts dont stink quite as bad when theyre coming out of your own ass isnt it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the nyt and the washington post have been race baiting for many many years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my curiosity and immaturity got the best of me and now im stuck wondering why the word penis was so heavily used in httpchroniclenytlabscomkeywordpenis edit upon actually reading the comments i am proud of the fact that i was not the only one curious about penises
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just look at who writes for them now all the career journalists who spent years in the field covering everything have been replaced with people whos resume reads like a whos who over alternative media just know that todays buzzfeedhuffpost bloggers will be the next generation of journalists
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it looks like german was more popular during than is there a reason for this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,evidence that discussion has devolved into a witch hunt where anything can be racism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that tool form the ny times lab seems pretty cool but i am trying to choose another word crisis and does not work anyways pretty sad the spike on racism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its actually quite interesting if you look at it year by year the use of the word nearly didnt exist until about at least thats when you see a noticeable increase in the frequency of its use in news publications there is a noticeable increase to coincide with the civil rights movement and the years following but whats most amazing is the use of the word in current day publication has nearly doubled since even its highest use before today i find it fascinating that the word is used more today than it was at the height of the civil rights movement which centered around exactly that racism and equality for african americans
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpchroniclenytlabscomkeywordaidshiv was going to say this is interesting correlation but i dont think its case sensitive
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the usage of the word cancer dipped pretty steeply during each world war
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and there goes one hour entering keywords and finding that internet was mentioned in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this should be easy op she was dumb enough to put her address on file so it shouldnt be difficult for you to prove to cc company that this is fraud
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this could almost be a separate post but i firmly believe the new york times is the worlds finest news source except for its leftwingbiased but still generally strong political coverage i remember once telling a friend if you read the new york times front page headlines every day print or online you are more informed than of the worlds population and i stand by that statement
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i actually did this with google searches and its come down in frequency searched
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the less of a problem it became the harder it was for the times to push the racist narrative hence the overkill
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how many more articles is the times writing now as compared to the number written in the
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so which is more likely that the news is talking about race at an unprecedented and uncalled for rate or everyone became twice as racist over the course of years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i put the word corruption in and you can see a ton of political scandals that way
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its impossible to prove that someone isnt a racist and its extremely easy to accuse someone of it criticism of someone that fits any particular group profile is now tantamount to racism sexism homophobia or whatever accusations of racism sexism bigotry etc are now the easiest way to end legitimate conversation and smear an opponent in any debate or public dialogue i think it will get increasingly used to discredit people groups and concepts since its much easier to do that than to assemble a rational and wellgrounded argument this is not to say that racism sexism bigotry arent very real problems only saying that these problems are being exploited by the intellectually lazy and the politically ambitious
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im going to throw out everything i know about statistics and journalism and just say that this proves there was no racism prior to the american civil war
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id like to point out that if you search actual racist terms like the n word or its equivalent they are used at a much higher percent through much of the graph but fall of somewhat when the more socially inoffensive term racist begins its rise
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,current day usage has surpassed the penis spike we are truly in a penis renaissance
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,poop seems to have had its heyday in the as well then suddenly dropping at
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,circumcision was being debated as a way to prevent masturbation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,click on the graph for any year and it will bring up the articles heres the penis spike

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fuck spikes at the same time coincidence i think not
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whats with the flatlining of cunt in recent decades this is my new favourite website op is my hero
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all the penises fit to print
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i searched penis too then the site just stopped responding we must be related or something
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,funny i would have thought penis and spike would have peaked in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i searched for pussy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so do bondage x
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there was also a porn spike around the same time currently we havent surpassed it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your comment made my day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you might also ask yourself why you chose that term to search for
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hah that was the first word i searched and wondered the exact same thing then i scrolled down and saw this was the first comment
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,really an interesting decade just look at the numbers for anus at an allt time high
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it was in where the phrase the pen is mightier than the sword became popular it was a common joketypo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,anus also spikes in the
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,add fuck to the graph were wild for news apparently
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,due in large part to the efforts of selfavowed communists enjoying tenure at western universities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i like that httpchroniclenytlabscomkeywordclinton gives a plateau during the bill clinton years followed by a w
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it also looks like racism wasnt really much of an issue before obama was elected president
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no presidential campaigns are shortlived when you consider how long those increases last two things to keep in mind in recent history the role of print media has evolved from reporting news to distilling crafting and advocating opinions the times is chief among this trend it is only natural for abstract terms to be used more frequently now than in the days of headsdown reporting i would bet youd see similar recent trends for elite and liberal edit liberal is almost a perfect match and elite has exploded since the trend is more towards increased use of abstract terms than a particular bias in a world where the exchange of ideas is free and often anonymous its simply not possible to argue that there is less hatefilled messaging being communicated today than there was or years ago the action potential threshold for spewing hatred has plummeted so again its only natural for the print media to discuss and share ideas about a development like this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,strawmen all three you can divert any argument and shut down your opponent by calling them any of those three things
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpchroniclenytlabscomkeywordracismjustice a screenshot in case the site is getting crushed again today
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nah click bait attempts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what about terroristterrorism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you add inequality the fact that one percent is never used becomes pretty interesting
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i added hate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wonder what happened in the for it to be used so much italian fascism debating joining the league of nations
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so itll be slatecom without the lgbt coverage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the magic of extrapolation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so basically a modern sociology paper
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is how the great penis spike of started
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is a increase over the past years it seems like a lot but add another word for comparison
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no theyve switched to white supremacy now with a varying number of exclamation marks the hyperbole treadmill never stops marching on
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that is what i have been saying about the word noodle for years now but no one seems to care
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that must mean love is used too much love is going to lose all meaning
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they could also take seconds to read those numbers on the y axis scale
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,makes sense to me because i feel like we were termed generation y for the first half of my life
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,eh in only the first year of the millennial generation was even old enough enough to vote much less be functional members of society that influence the direction the social values the youngest millennials are now almost all which means the majority of us are present in the world and shaping it for better or worse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but millenials only existed since this last generation while racism has always existed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but that doesnt fit my narrative that racism is the new buzzword that doesnt mean anything and therefore i can be racist what am i to believe now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the phase people of color is equally as silly to lump in everyone whos not white as a single group is lunacy a chinese person has zero in common physically socially and culturally with a black person it probably is the most striking example of identity politics and the most desperate other than the usual suspects you see on reddit or twitter i dont see anyone other than white liberals or black people use the term if i called my vietnamese friend a person of color hed probably hit me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,real racism i think what happened in the and a little earlier was very confusing for a lot of people and lead to this dialogue problem before there was just individual racism kkk members going around and lynching people because they were black slavery black people moving to a white neighborhood and getting harassed these things are examples of individual racism as time went on it became less cool to do that old racist people wisened up and instead decided to create systematic structures that specifically disadvantaged people of color the benefit of this system was that carefully enacted it wasnt overt and didnt offend more liberal white people because it was harder to see this institutional racism took the form of things like increasing loan rates for blacks redlining neighborhoods to deny loans things i can attest to personally moving toxic waste to people of color neighborhoods when white people didnt want it funding hiv treatment and support programs in manhattan and staten island but not in the bronx or east brooklyn despite the latter two being the hardest hit areas in nyc things like the majority of crack users in the being white and hispanic people yet of all people sentenced to prison were black males drug laws that specifically put black weed smokers in jail while excusing white weed smokers studies that found that jobs would prefer a white felon in many cases to a black person with a college degree or would not call back black people based on only their names these things became the preferred way and they are particularly insidious as they arent as obvious to someone who is unaffected lynchings were obvious not getting a call back because youre a black male requires a rigorous and replicated sociological study to be done most current cries of racism are cries of institutional racism of the modern era not individual racism of the past but we call it racism as if it was the same thing and so it causes unnecessary confusion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and it causes whites to view claims of racism with suspicion thus becoming less prone to being receptive to recognizing actual racism i agree with the intention of your post but ohh boy is this one sentence on the end all kinds of wrong racism by nature is not a racially prejudiced term its not something that only happens to certain races to even think that is racist by definition it can happen to any race from any other race therefore its not for whites to view claims and recognise racism everyone needs to recognise what is and isnt racism now as i said at the start i am aware that thats the point youre actually making already its just that you fucked it up at the end with the insinuation that whites are in some kind of elevated position whether you intended to or not it should have read and it causes everyone to view claims of racism with suspicion which it does and is spot on it also causes a victim mentality in minorities which actually gets them no where because of reason one all of this shit does nothing but divide us more good post glad someone else is seeing through the bulshit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,however when a student of color is suspended for beating up another kid we need to not give a voice to his parents and friends who blame his consequences on racism such a strawman is there any story in the new york times that fits this profile
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,however when a student of color is suspended for beating up another kid we need to not give a voice to his parents and friends who blame his consequences on racism what are exactly are you referring to when you say this do you mean an instance in where two children of different races with the same offense in similar situations are given different levels of severity in punishment if one child is punished more harshly than another due to their race its perfectly acceptable to call that out because that is racism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you for putting this more eloquently than i could its a boy who cried wolf scenario
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,absolutely agree honestly when someone says racist or racism it doesnt even register anymore apparently anything you do that someone disagrees with is either racist or misogynist these days so now whenever i hear either of those terms i immediately tune them out and ignore the person speaking because the worlds have lost all meaning to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,however when a student of color is suspended for beating up another kid we need to not give a voice to his parents and friends who blame his consequences on racism if hes being treated differently than a kid of another color in a similar situation yes they should give voice to the truth im not sure what specific incident you are referring to here but an overall issue that mimics this is our nations incarceration problem and so many peoples flippant response of just dont commit crime but reviews of sentencing have shown that punishments are not at all equal among races
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah the black kid should get in trouble but should there be an entire school to prison pipeline that perpetuates the issue should black kids be suspended more than white kids for the same shit bc that is what institutional racism looks like
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think weve forgotten what racism means and then selectively apply it still joke about black people eating fried chicken racist joke about chinese people eating dogs funny when in reality neither are likely explicitly racist although they might be pejorative
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,might be because the tool also counts weather forecast news from the stock markets etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also the threshold is once in an article
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the importance of reading the axis labels this needs to be higher
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its the positive feedback loop of social media infrastructure that didnt exist years ago nowadays when an instance of actual or perceived racial abuse occurs the news has the ability to spread like wildfire among millions of people literally within minutes which in itself creates its own exponential explosion of discussion hashtags etc which then gets up by media and thus completes the selffulfilling prophecy of ops datagraph there is some social good that comes from this of course for example it forces society to focus attention on certain issues that disproportionately affect poc which might not have gotten the spotlight just a decade ago but in my opinion it also has its negative consequences most notably in presenting what could easily be classified as a false narrative in which the reality of what race relations are actually like in america get skewed and distorted for example httphumanprogressorgblogusracerelationsgettingbetter a majority of americans now believe that race relations in the us are getting worse the problem with this of course is that its objectively wrong when you httphumanprogressorgblogusracerelationsgettingbetter it shows on every metric the us is getting less racist and more tolerant over time this entire phenomenon of social media and traditional media feeding off each other could possibly explain why america is such a polarized nation today
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you its not that racism is more prevalent now than then its that its become more culturally acceptable to talk about it and that is a good thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah looks like martin is the trigger when i clicked the link i was expecting a huge spike in but that spike was nothing in comparison obama may actually have really been helping ease the tensions before the martin case happened and we havent stopped talking about shootings since i think a big part of the problem is the cases that are getting the most attention like martin and mike brown really arent actually all that clear cut when you look at the evidence it gives people an excuse to look away from the statistics and individual cases that are impossible to excuse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my guess is the trayvon martin case started it and then black people decided to start filming what they perceived as unfair treatment by law enforcement on their phones and voila you have engaging media content that fosters debate you think its mostly on current event discussion as opposed to political discussion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its by percentage of articles
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah people also never note the quality of some of their online stories is not equivalent to the stuff they actually print in their paper
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you should read about irish slaves some time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what about privilege or problematic or the all stupid people of color
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as long as the conspiracy theorists are making fun of anyone who uses the word globalist unironically sign me up
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,who can forget the pulitzer prize winning things only victims of racism will understand article
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean i wouldnt call the new york times a clickbaity website furthermore its only an increase of about percent compared to the total number of articles which i dont think is enough to draw conclusions trying to take a relatively isolated piece of information like this and apply it to a preconceived notion is somewhat defeating the purpose of statistics anyway
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,clickbait is why i didnt click the link just these comments i just recently understood the difference between racist superiority racial stereotypes the difficult part for me is how many stereotypes added together constitute racism if at all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the left has made race and identity politics their mainstay these past two years as opposed to trump who didnt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think they will double down thats all ive seen from the left after the election everything and everyone is racist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,caucasian hates jews he is not called a racist he definitely could be theres also the term antisemitic although most antisemites are also racist against many groups
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the word racist isnt used often for people who hate jews because we have the more specific but still common word antisemitic
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah we do call people who hate jews racist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,race is a social construct and there is not really much point trying to figure out if groups a and b belong in the same race for many people just a different shade of skin colour can mean a different race and syrians and mexicans tend to be darker than people of north or west european origin so by that logic people who dislike everything having to do with people of different shade of skin colour are racists a safer and more pc term would be xenophobia but honestly why does it matter what you call it racism is bad for the same reasons xenophobia is bad and they both come from the same place the differences are minor and connotational
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,found the edgy white kid who thinks the white man is being oppressed in america
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nazi was used as a synonym in wwii
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the flat part of the graph had no civil rights for black people and it was totally cool to kill brown people in the third world or to hate the jews people talking about racism is a cause of the lack of racism not a symptom of it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is that was the data says or what you want the data to say
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,funny how two people can see completely different things from the same data seems to me that the conversation has positively evolved as we can now talk about racial issues as problematic instead of having racism as the undiscussed norm like it was before the first big spike was during the civil rights movement which first confronted racism as a large problem second peak happens during the la race riots where there was a lot of tension the inital part of the most recent spike coincides with ongoing discussion on race and police brutality which has been seen as a problem by minorities for ages but only now is acknowledged by white people and the latter part coincides with the rise of trump who is backed by every prominent racist group in america and has said more openly racist things than any other presidential candidate in recent history so obviously theres going to be more reporting on that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we literally just voted in a rightwing president whose competitor in the election was a centrist what marxism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im curious exactly what you mean by that shouldnt media discuss aspects of the culture
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this could almost be a separate post but i firmly believe the new york times is the worlds finest news source except for its leftwingbiased but still generally strong political coverage i used to think so too but about few years back it started to deteriorate it got really bad about year or so ago now i have hard time taking it seriously
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a percentage not a total number

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats a little misleading if you sort the graph by number of articles rather than by percent poop stays pretty relevant over the years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well that didnt fucking stop me at all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nosy fuckers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hahaha nothing can stop it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was thinking their might be a correlation between penises and racism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is the article that supposedly has the word used but i dont see it the article is about horse and foot races so likely theres some sort of error with the image text conversion perhaps with the word racing or with race for
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a cursory google search says the word was invented in im assuming that the guy that used the term in was referring to something else entirely not sure what it could be though i dont think someone would have used a term correctly years before it was given its modern meaning however it looks like the word racialism was in use since meaning essentially the same thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it was just a typo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cant tell if you think thats a good thing bad thing or youre just trolling
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so hows the cold war going pal those crazy ruskies really are wily bastards eh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is this referring to the whole cultural marxism conspiracy theory or is it simply calling liberals communists or what
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,corelation between marxists and high levels of education gotta be a conspiracy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,da media sais he racist so me agree
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well race relations to a lot of people seem to be i like black people i just want them to know theyre place its overt in the south but even in the open minded north you see this type of crap expressed and the person is completely unwanted of their own bias just look at how offended people got over obamas speech after the trayvon martin murder
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,obama has been the most racially divisive president in at least years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the action potential what what does that mean
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats not a straw man thats an ad hominem
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,clearly the corollary is that electing democratic presidents means a rise in racsicm xenophobia and sexism no wonder the us voted trump
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and that rose over time because the better explanation is that we became more sensitive to and better at recognizing what was always there its like how there was a spike in the incidence of breast cancer from that leveled off why because people rapidly became more prone to breast cancer no we just got better at seeing it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,used to be able it seems those terms have lost any bite as they are bantered about too frequently
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it appears not anymore trump was branded a sexist and racist and xenophobe and is now our president very few understand what a moral victory that was
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it goes from in to in and then from in to its current those are some pretty big spikes the first one was obviously caused by and im assuming the second spike was caused by benghazi
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was going to thank you for adding another word that shows that the buzzword hunting going on here is silly but im not sure now—maybe something more interesting is going on hate looks like it correlates pretty hard with racism in recent years but also sees spikes that might give us clues as to previous american rhetoric on race and prejudice would have to dive deeper into the dataset to find out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh i have a joke about sociologists why doesnt the sociologist look out their window in the morning because then theyd have nothing to do in the afternoon
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why use exclamation marks check this shit out white supremacy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would say the same for the overuse of hero
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how every generation has been viewed since ever in a couple decades the millenials will have simmered down and the next generation will be rocking the boat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was thinking the mentions back then would be more in reference to things about the new millenium millennial can be used as an adjective as well as a noun
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the correlation between racism and millennials is that the generation before whats considered millennials struck the perfect balance where they didnt care about racegenderreligion and wanted to move on and get to work then the generation after came and were absolute vaginas and felt like going back to obsessing about oppression and culture and feelings was the right move now we have a nation divided people who want to get on with their lives and further the human race vs people who would rather focus on petty shit and social media posts to their friend skylar or brooklyn or fucking madison
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,surely not the nyt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe they want to avoid the term minorities for some reason poc refers much more explicitly to ethnicity i guess
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whenever the topic of diversity comes up at work i always feel a little bad for the chinese and indian guys because its pretty much implied that diversity isnt really about them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a black person who describes herself as a person of color i disagree my black father died when i was young soon after that my white mom moved us to a very white part of the country as a result i never really grew up in the black community and i dont have much in common culturally with other black americans because i lack that shared culture ive always been hesitant to put too much emphasis on my identity as a black woman but regardless of my upbringing when people first meet me the first thing they see is the color of my skin whether i like it or not my brown skin affects the way i move through the world for me the term person of color is useful precisely because it describes my experience of being racially other in america without carrying any further connotations about my cultural background person of color might not be the right label for everybody but it works for me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the term has an interesting httpsenwikipediaorgwikigensdecouleur
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,old racist people wisened up and instead decided to create systematic structures that specifically disadvantaged people of color lee atwater key political adviser to ronald reagan and george hw bush orcherstrator of the willie horton and former rnc chairman speaking on the southern strategy in you start out in by saying nigger nigger nigger by you cant say nigger—that hurts you backfires so you say stuff like uh forced busing states rights and all that stuff and youre getting so abstract now youre talking about cutting taxes and all these things youre talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is blacks get hurt worse than whites we want to cut this is much more abstract than even the busing thing uh and a hell of a lot more abstract than nigger nigger
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the problem is people claim institutional racism all the time without pointing to anything specific or just saying that because its institutional it cant be seen but if anyone should expect things to be done about these alleged problems they need more advanced proof not just claims of mostly black neighborhoods getting screwed show me that a white neighborhood with similar amounts of money and crime rates will fare better legally in an objective sense also legalized slavery not punishing lynch mobs jim crow etc are actual examples of institutions that hurt black people because they were racist institutional racism is at an all time low in the west by an enormous margin
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you think that has only occurred since the i would recommend doing more research it was particularly blatant in the and especially the leading up to the riots
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i actually really liked your example about the toxic waste in monitory neighborhoods i was required to take a natural resources based diversity class in my college program that focused on environmental issues and their effects on certain groups i remember being surprised about that because it had never really occurred to me that institutional racism could be found in environmental issues as well as economic and societal ones
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,old racist people wisened up and instead decided to create systematic structures that specifically disadvantaged people of color this idea i think is the weak connection many people question do you really honestly think white people got together to create a system of racism would it not make more sense that perhaps true systematic racism is a result of peoples individual bias affecting their decision making and in some cases the attributes of certain ethnicities creating systematic disadvantages for themselves
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it can happen to any race from any other race exactly i hate reverse racisim like wtf you mean regular racism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as the majority whites are in a different position than minorities i dont understand why you interpreted it as an elevated position no disrespect intended but its almost as though youre searching for a slight in a comment that had absolutely no racist undertones you may not be from the us but here typically its whites that are accused of racism theres a reason white people were mentioned specifically by the commenter and it had absolutely nothing to do with an elevated racial position edit or feel free to argue the majority race by default is an elevated race in the us its referred to as white privilege but really theres no reason to attack ops argument as essentially having racist undertones
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,likely many party use the term for the purpose of driving groups apart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pretty much anything involving the police the last years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the post you are responding to lays out an entirely different hypo than the situation in your post the original situation is not racism but the situation you made up is racism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think hes speaking generally about minorities who first defer to racism as being the root cause of any given instance of injustice towards them hes warning that the general public is seeing this happen with growing frequency and is beginning to lose empathy for selfproclaimed victims of racism to add my own thoughts on this matter we all experience injustice and unfairness in one way or another and minorities undoubtedly experience this at a higher rate that being said you are doing yourself a disservice if you continually associate the misfortune in your life to the color of your skin without regard to any of the other possible causes of misfortune
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,really seems more like a wegaveeveryonecamerasontheirphonesandwowtheywerereallyrightthereswaymoreracismrecordedonvideothanpeoplecanprocess scenario
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when you actually take a look at the data it shows on every metric the us is getting less racist and more tolerant over time it looks like percentage of people opposed to racially different neighborhoods is mostly constant also nonlethal hate crimes look like they plateau around to last year included but more importantly most of that data doesnt show the last years except the percentage of people opposed to racially different neighborhoods which was on a tiny small upswing it is quite possible that race relations are worse now then they were years ago and that is what certainly they are better than when there were lynchings but that is a pretty low bar for race relations
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,agree with your points here another problem is that the media is desperate for a new big story to focus on the news cycle has been devoid of anything big for a very long time talking sudden war mega natural disaster type stories notice how every media outlet was covering police shootingsriots nonstop until the election season got into full swing and then the coverage completely disappeared the media sees very little in this world that will generate viewer excitementinterest so journalists are resorting to focusing on minutia in order to have something to print
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i remember in the being racist was the worst thing you could be but that just meant cognitive dissonance set in and no one was racist now theres a lot more recognition for the fact that pretty much everybody carries varying degrees of prejudice and that systems can disproportionately impact folks of color while not being designed specifically to target race or were just historical carry overs of raced based policy the term racist is still mostly reacted to as a binary construct with one end being not racist at all and the other being hitler since no one wants to be hitler or sees themselves tat way they must be not racist at all so now we see a lot more talk about the shades of grey or implicit racism but the term itself hasnt lost its toxicity thats how ive read the last couple decades amyway
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rthedonald is that way
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would they literally had two freshman nyu students write opeds about the election excellent point about statistics though and making them fit preconceived notions id judge for myself if the link wasnt down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not as bad as vice fusion aj huffpost or slate but they have really fallen down hard specifically when you people like charles blow writing for them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wouldnt have months ago they seem to be going down hill fast though failing you could say and their dislike for trump has thrown their prior journalistic integrity to the winds
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive noticed that their are countless different definitions for each of these buzzwords writers redefine them at will to suit their current need or narrative
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there was an article for the atlantic that came out a couple weeks ago that addressed the topic of identity politics with the recent election in which they interviewed a trump supporter for his opinions found this takeaway interesting emphasis mine when everything is about identity politics is the left really surprised that on tuesday millions of white americans for the first time ever voted as white if you want identity politics identity politics is what you will get suffice it to say i tend to agree that the left partially had a hand in the rise of trump it seems weve reached an era where weve just replaced black and brown identity politics with white identity politics a race to the bottom perhaps
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he made nationalism his not the same thing even if he did it was in response
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am sure they read all of those articles as well many other sources for historical context to reach that conclusion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,could you please expand on that i do think they sensationalized coverage of trump in that there is essentially an article about every single tweet he publishes and i think the upshot predictor which suggested clinton had an chance at winning the presidency may have dissuaded people to vote because she was seemingly all but guaranteed to win but i do think most of their political coverage is insightful comprehensive and wellwritten if liberal

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that was really lame i guess theres no grown ups around anymore
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,on the contrary raw counts are more misleading than percentages thats why statistics exists

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a suffix of nouns often corresponding to verbs ending in ize or nouns ending in ism that denote a person who practices or is concerned with something or holds certain principles raceist clearly is someone very concerned with races ie michael phelps the great aquatic racist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,given the time period his use of the word racism was probably very racist it couldve been used to describe the study of the savage races
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think hea just stating that its a thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can it be a sly world weary cynical view its not likely a deliberate worldwide conspiracy but definitely a cause effect thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well according to the democrats the russians are coming to hack us all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whats your point
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why not both gotta demonise the opposition somehow
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,obama has an incredible track record for speaking out before he knows all the facts in the martinzimmerman case he participated in the medias defamation of a private citizen using the platform of the highest elected office in the country while cnn was filtering footage to make zimmerman look white and msnbc was using their logo to block zimmermans head wound from view when they showed the tape of his arrival at the police station obama was inserting himself into the situation to call for anger not calm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people were offended that when a man had been cleared of wrongdoing by numerous governmental agencies and by a jury we had a president coming out and making such statements the media was editing source material in that case to paint zimmerman as a cold blooded it was absurd look at the section on how the media treated the case please httpsenwikipediaorgwikishootingoftrayvonmartin
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats how you assume other peoples thought processes work which is the heart of the whole problem prejudice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think because in the north we like to pretend race isnt basically although not fundamentally bound up in class so all the racist shit people say in the south is repackaged as bad shit about the poor which up here is basically blacks in the ghetto its just as racist but not in a directly obvious way
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in that his election sent racists into a frothing frenzy sure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ronald reagan made it his main goal to lock up and ruin as many black lives as he possibly could but yeah obama is the racially divisive one
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiactionpotential heshe is saying the threshold for being able to espouse your views has lowered because of easy access to the internet
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ad hominem is not a fallacy in a political campaign character is central
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in the context of reddit its a strawman when youre circlejerking why do all republicans get angry when they see black people not in chains
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you are a straw man and that is in an ad hominem
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people react with skepticism to terms like racism and sexism because theyre so overused and misused that they dont hold much weight by themselves anymore language loses its potency if you use it too often i would be shocked if there was a character in a harry potter film that said fuck but in a tarantino movie its practically white noise
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how would you define racism are any of these views racist i think we should hire the best person for the job our borders should be enforced is guaranteeing certain admissions slots for lessqualified students due to their skin color really the best way to fight racism maybe its not the tech industrys fault that its mostly white and asian males can you see how racism sexism is often claimed in opposition of these and how that might be a straw man argument
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont understand why there are so many people that think racism is so prevalent on reddit have you been to other sites on the internet ever been to youtube reddit is one of the most left politically correct social media sites i frequent aside from maybe tumblr
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the better another possible explanation is that we became more sensitive to and better at recognizing what was always there i think the degree of the spike over the last five years indicates something unusual is going on we can see the first big spike in which can pretty easily be explained by the nationwide riots and then after a cooling period a spike in that lasts throughout the decade throughout the civil rights era theres a few other spikes that seem to be explained by a more diverse set of factors and a downward trend and then a massive jump in the last five years that totally dwarfs the others if you click on the years you can read the articles too theres a definite tone shift to me anyway i think that it would be a mistake to draw conclusions about reality from this graph aside from this one nytimes writers and editors and to some extent readers care about race a lot more than they ever have in the past that will probably mean different things to different folks some will feel that it will make things better because attention is finally being given to some serious problems and a rational person has to admit too many frivolous ones others will feel the increasing focus on race creates an easy scapegoat and encourages a victim mentality both are probably right one thing ive learnt in life is that if a large number of people in the mainstream bring a problem to attention they almost certainly have legitimate complaints and we need to listen to both sides if were to have any hope of addressing them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why not both we start recognizing it more we start calling it out more we start calling it out more we start using it more freely where its not necessarily applicable and preemptively im not making any assertions about which one is more common just pointing out that youre both probably correct
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,right just like we got better at seeing communism during the mccarthy era
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sjw but people use that when theyre actually being racist and dont want it having pointed out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,too black
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,depends on the economy the millennial generation started with the echo of the baby boom and entered the work force during the worst recession since the great depression its a statistically large group of people who have had to drastically adjust their expectations from what they were taught throughout their childhoods the transition in technology has also been drastic even within the millennial generation a few year age gap is the difference between learning how to use a paper catalogue to search a library and using google or not having a cellphone at all and having a smart phone or learning to type on a typewriter to having a computer in every home internet being a luxury to being a common utility there is a large disconnect between generations as a result and this is not always the case if the economy improves in any significant way millenials will always be remembered at once as being both innovative and completely lost
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or maybe they just decided that you shouldnt move on from a problem you havent fixed yet i dont think tackling the unequal treatment under the law and within society of disenfranchised groups would count as petty shit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how about refer to them by their ethnic religious or social group i have more color than a japanese person
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i remember watching the dnc and they brought up some program about helping inner city minority kids all black and hispanic oh so theres literally no immigrants in the city ok
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this might be the most concise statement regarding the term yet
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,white people in kentucky are culturally nothing like white people in massachusetts its not about culture its about a physical description
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so its well known that black people are arrested for higher rates for crimes that are committed by all races at a similar rate and they they receive harsher sentencing on average these higher rates of arrest affect their communities much harder because theyre a minority group the government never actually helped the black community after the actual institutions of racism severely impacted their communities this isnt a plight for reparations its just like think about how messed up it is that the government thats supposed to serve you actively made legislation to oppress you this left vital things needed for community stability in disrepair schools local economies government project housing they could never build wealth on theres so much more to this not to mention the fact that its not like racism and prejudice went away with the civil rights act my legitimate question is is it possible that you are overlooking something that would help you empathize with them or is it more likely that large groups of people across a massive country just want to avoid responsibility by calling racism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,two examples until the fair housing act was passed in and long after it was enforced redlining allowed for banks to deny loans for anyone regardless of qualification black people of equal background were denied loans because they were deemed too risky though they had a similar background and financial to white people who were approved for those loans but happened to link with in white neighborhoods this was the basis for the fair housing act i actually just finished work on a bank remediation that was raising the interest rate on consumers of color compared to white consumers with similar backgrounds its not as evil as denying loans but its still a problem they had to pay the government a couple million dollars and undergo a monitoring program after they were caught it should be out in the news and papers in the next months or so if you live in the us after the monitoring program is approved additionally i gave the example of the study done that found that there was more work opportunity in many parts of the country for a white felon than there was a black person with a college degree resume being otherwise equal there was a larger study that showed that with a completely equal resume a white person got more callbacks to interview for a job than a black person those were particularly fascinating finally there is quite a bit of counter evidence that suggests sentencing rates were higher for people of color that controlled for prior behavior given the same conviction i agree one cant go shouting it out at every hardship one encounters but there also shouldnt be a quota on bringing it up i can tell you from the work i did on the bank that the first person to shout it out is going to be ignored as an anomaly and told that theyre blaming everything on race the only reason the bank was caught in my case was that the community started talking after enough people realized it happened to them if everyone keeps it to themselves and is afraid of calling it out it would have continued
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,show me that a white neighborhood with similar amounts of money and crime rates will fare better legally in an objective sense in a similar geographic area i doubt that you cant go off income alone rural vs urban is a big factor i hear a lot of people cite hillbillies as being lawful but thats just part of having plenty of space between you and your neighbor and having less neighbors around you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is there any advanced proof that crime rates are higher for black people when all other factors have actually been adjusted for as you mention just because institutional racism may be at an all time low doesnt mean its gone saying it effectively doesnt exist is exactly why and id say just as bad as falsely claiming it as the reason behind a problem ill add that stop and frisk for example was studied and determined to unfairly target minorities it absolutely is a form of institutional racism and the president elect would like to bring it back you can argue that racism like that is needed to fight crime or whatever but call it what it is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think i said the as more of a turning point where individual racism really fell to the wayside i think it was the in particular that was an inflection point but im open to moving that date back or forward
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh its absolutely the latter it was kinda just me starting off kinda jokey i dont really believe in the white illumanati well maybe nixon i kid i cant help it but youre right its probably not the best part to joke about when people may take it seriously point well taken
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that total includes a sharp racial imbalance poor black students are suspended at three times the rate of whites a disparity not fully explained by differences in income or behavior this sounds like an example of what ustayonthelows reply was addressing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ctrlf racis matches k
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,link an article
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,haha yes oh wow coverage on freddie gray and philando castillo and michael brown and eric garner were all biased garbage yes edit hahah jesus i guess i found out that most of reddit agrees that black lives do not matter
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,good thing the only article someones posted to this thread to back up that top comment has stats about suspension rates for white and black students
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there are those who associate the misfortune to racism without regard to any of the other possible causes of misfortune but the more and more i read and watch news about the criminal justice system the harder it becomes to not feel oppressed off the top of my head some depressing information can be gleaned from john olivers series on the criminal justice system and the new documentary on netflix
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh absolutely but plenty of people are reading this graph to mean the nyt is complaining about racism more and more why dont they just get to the real news since racism isnt a big deal anymore
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whats wrong with charles blow i usually love his column
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think washington post has fallen harder
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well there is a difference between clickbait and poor or biased journalism what you appear to describe though i disagree would be more of a symptom of biased journalism rather than attempts to gain advertiser revenue through exaggerated or low effort articles that are designed to get as many page views as possible additionally the fact that they have a soft paywall makes it rather unlikely for them to be a clickbait site
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,their dislike for trump has thrown their prior journalistic integrity im not quite sure you know what journalistic integrity means an news outlet being entirely neutral on every topic no matter how objectively wrong one side of the discussion is is just wrong that isnt how it should work at some point an idea or topic is just so horrendously onesided that it needs to stop being looked at in a neutral light is some dumbfuck saying the sky is purple fuck neutrality that shit is wrong is some guy that has been convicted of different murders crying about how his sentence was too harsh fuck neutrality then too neutrality has its place but it also should be kept in check that was one of the major faults of most of the media early on in this election cycle they tried to be neutral towards trump and this gave him significantly more credibility than he deserved this changed later on when they started to realize that their attempts at neutrality was doing nothing but creating a false equivalence situation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,racism is not a buzzword
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think you are most likely just eating up the alt right narrative like a good little tool
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,could you please expand on that i do think they sensationalized coverage of trump in that there is essentially an article about every single tweet he publishes and i think the upshot predictor which suggested clinton had an chance at winning the presidency may have dissuaded people to vote because she was seemingly all but guaranteed to win but i do think most of their political coverage is insightful comprehensive and wellwritten if liberal there is no balance any more and this is the tricky part in writing most journalist if you can even call them that any more have started to miss news have become opinion pieces to cover their collective ass bullshit is spread as a question you can basically print anything if you add a mark to it this used to be tabloid only trick now its nyt etc nyt is hillary clinton a sodomite lizard form outer space blaa blaa blaa probaly not blaa blaa blaa but sources tell she is blaa blaa blaa

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,michael phelps the great aquatic racist not sure if hes gonna like this description
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,because rhillaryclinton and rshitredditsays are so much more moral and justified
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people saying that theres a colossal marxist conspiracy attempting to dominate the west through education are still stuck in the they think that by having leftist professors universities are going to stifle free thought and expression despite the fact that they themselves would love nothing more than to stifle discussion of communism and socialism how dare they have tenure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think the most damning thing in that section is how nbc strung different parts of the call together to paint zimmerman as a racial profiler between march and the nbc nightly news nbcs today show and nbcs networkowned miami affiliate wtvj ran segments which misleadingly merged parts of zimmermans call on one version of the recording played by nbc zimmerman was heard saying this guy looks like hes up to no good or hes on drugs or something hes got his hand in his waistband and hes a black male in another what was played was this guy looks like hes up to no good he looks black in the original recording zimmerman said this guy looks like hes up to no good or hes on drugs or something its raining and hes just walking around looking about the operator then asked ok and this guy is he black white or hispanic and zimmerman answered he looks black the phrase hes got his hand in his waistband and hes a black male came several exchanges after that point in the conversation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,paint zimmerman as a killer it was absurd hes literally a killer regardless of whether or not you believe it was in self defense or if it was murder
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,more white people voted for obama than hillary clinton but yeah its all about racism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i keep hearing about this outburst of hatred but the only frothing frenzy ive actually seen is on the left edit he says he hasnt seen the racism he must be in league with big racism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah thank you interesting i wonder how all this hate filled online spewing is reflected offline maybe its the video game effecteveryone gets worked up online but when they leave their cozy couch into the real world everyone behaves better because the stakes are higher in person
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how does debras argument use a straw man cathy is sort of implicitly calling for women to continue to be paid less since she says the wages gap is due to differences in productivity right women have equal aptitude for coding as men therefore they should always earn the same salary does not necessarily follow and youre a sexist does not follow from just disagreeing with cathy but thats not the same as a straw man which requires a misrepresentation of the other persons argument
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not a sure of what youre trying to say here a fallacy is faulty logic used in the construction of an argument irrespective of context
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,character is objective and centralization is dynamic based on perspective while youre not necessarily wrong its not quantifiable to the recognizable extent that a new peace president bombs the fuck out of the world without any congressional approval but he speaks nicely about it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,now this is a straw man
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean ive seen racism and sexism used a whole lot sure but i still dont know if i would say its overused or misused ive seen way more racism and sexism in my life than ive seen false accusations thereof i think for a lot of people that could still make it white noise but just because you hear it a lot doesnt mean its being overused and isnt actually a problem
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also because most people here are young white dudes lol no being a white male doesnt give you sup e powers and alleviate your life of hardship but if forces you face less discrimination im sorry white people but this is just a fact in america stop taking it so personal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if i may white men react with skepticism to terms like racism and sexism because they dont experience them the way other americans do
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not that often that someone says something outright racist but things are usually more complicated in context if i say hey ive noticed our board of directors is all white men who went to mit in the and you say i think we should hire the best person for the job its implied that for some reason the company is best run by an oddly specific group of people if you say our borders should be enforced id be curious as to why you think they arent enforced and who you want to keep out theres a global refugee crisis right now are you talking about that if youre asking about how affirmative action works good but then id ask what your other suggestions were how do you want to fight racial inequality in education maybe its not the tech industrys fault but also a lot of women seem to feel like the tech industry is hostile to them and we probably dont have good enough comp sci education across the country to make that decision yet so no none of those things are outright racist or sexist but theyve all been used to back up racist or sexist positions before and theyre all just vague enough to leave space for that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,uyeartwo gave a really comprehensive response about how these statements arent overtly racist but theyre often coded statements for underlying racism often even subconscious underlying racism the only thing i want to add is to their point about affirmative action saying affirmative action opens up spots to lessqualified students because of their skin color is racist to make it simply lets talk simply black people black people make up roughly of the us population and white people make up i went to a top university with affirmative action admission policies where about of the student body was black and was white thats pretty close to the national percentage if you actually think that race doesnt influence intelligence then thats about what the makeup of the student body should look like to say that those kids are lessqualified applicants who got in due to skin color means you think that the top black students are less qualified than the white students who were in line so to speak after the white kids who did get in the important caveat to this argument is that due to schools being funded by property taxes and to the fact that black kids are more likely to grow up in underfunded school districts black students are more likely to be underprepared for a top college education however that doesnt make them less smart or mean they have less potential until we have equality when it comes to educational opportunity affirmative action is a way to work to even the playing field
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think people holding those views are often ignorant but not necessarily racist at the very least unless the reality of discrimination is addressed its completely selfserving after all its people who determine who is best for the job there have been several experiments that show that people with names differing from that of the status quo are less likely to get hired examples just to name a few
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sjw was originally a term used by activists on the left too to refer to the wackos every issue gets that just yell online and never really contribute to the hard work in making a difference out there now its just orctongue for liberal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or learning to type on a typewriter to having a computer in every home in the late i was that kid in high school who would turn in homework assignments typed on a typewriter
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats like saying how about refer to them by their name sometimes them being a minority is relevant while being specifically japanese is not you cant always be specific and sometimes have to be more general unless youre including the term minorities in social group and are okay with its use if so your comment seems weirdly aggressive and i dont quite understand what youre getting at
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think immigrants are still very insular and family centric this seems to be the biggest difference
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but as op pointed out there isnt a shared minority experience apart from not being the majority so there isnt a large group just a bunch of small groups when it comes to american whites ethnicity doesnt seem to be a big differentiating factor anymore as it did a few decades back
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is still missing the point
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there are tons of studies done with resumes based around race you can do one yourself its so easy take two identical resumes put matthew connor smith on one and tyrone malik washington on the other and see who gets more call backs this kind of bias is hard to hide because its so easy to prove better yet make tyrones resume stacked and give matthew an average one see what happens
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people really do think that way though easier to blame a boogieman than it is to think about a complex situation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not disagreeing he asked for a new york times article that states that the consequences meted out to black students as a result of school violence have a racial bias according to those involved this article fulfills that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats a statement with a ton of academic research to support it its not in the same ballpark as blaming criminal behavior on a racist system
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what world do you live in where you think this is a slam dunk argument there was tons of backlash about coverage of these events being biased especially with michael brown
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes they very much were lets look at the first one of the eras big black man was murdered case httpsenwikipediaorgwikishootingoftrayvonmartin now scroll down to the part about the media and read about how they clearly manipulated the public image
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for the most part yes they were
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe really print journalism everywhere is failing fast
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,an news outlet being entirely neutral on every topic no matter how objectively wrong one side of the discussion is is just wrong wait what that was one of the major faults of most of the media early on in this election cycle they tried to be neutral towards trump and this gave him significantly more credibility than he deserved wait whaaaaaat i think youre being satirical
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,an news outlet being entirely neutral on every topic no matter how objectively wrong one side of the discussion is is just wrong opinions are not objectively wrong and reporting them as wrong or objectively immoral when theres much more of a grey area is exactly what people are complaining about for example global warming yeah thats a fact the rightwing outlets shouldnt pretend that its some conspiracy by the left to weaken america or something we should invest money into fixing that shit trumps election the leftleaning media acts like its a fact that the only reason anyone in the world would support trump is that theyre a hillbilly racist from somewhere in the appalachian mountains and the rightleaning media did the same thing to clinton where they painted her as a corrupt warmonger and made her election a moral case not being neutral on political topics is exactly how weve gotten to this point biased journalism masquerading opinion as fact is what has caused people to cling so hard to both sides it used to be that really only fox and msnbc were sucking off their respective parties but now the media is significantly more divided into a circlejerk on either side the right pretends the left is a bunch of communists and the left pretends the right is a bunch of fascists in reality both sides are closer to the center than they realize
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i guess it depends on on whether want to wear a dildo or if you were born with one and dont want to double down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,heroes in a halfshell still works ill see myself out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i did acknowledge his greatness whats not to like s
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hes the best in the field of aquatic racism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wheres rnocontext when you need it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its in the internets hands now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,false equivalency only works when your five if you cant debate the merits of your own platform then you might want to take a second look at it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes yes they are those subs are leagues better than dark enlightenment and altright there is not even a comparison here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes neonazis are worse than democrats and feminists
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well i dont disagree that its a bit conspiracy minded but its hard to argue that leftist professors arent stifling free speech at universities at the moment all this safe spaces and halloween costume outrage and whatnot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre right ive edited my post to reflect such
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what youre saying doesnt contradict anything he said racists went in a frenzy more white people voted for obama than clinton okay two facts that seem pretty unrelated you gotta learn to talk to people and explain to them how you reach your conclusions because we cant read your mind
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that doesnt really say all that much when clintons opponent was openly dealing in racist rhetoric to build his brand besides it should hopefully go without saying that the explicit and aversive racists who flew into a tizzy over obama were in all likelihood not the same white people who voted for him
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did you see any of the tea party protests and rallies i would classify that as a frothing frenzy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,then you werent paying attention for years or now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if youre so afraid to have your world view challenged that you wont even google it then thats on you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,at least shes not kevin
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,uscombinators point is that mike calling jeff a racist for example is not always a rejoinder to some argument from jeff in that case whether jeff is actually a racist or not the accusation is not an ad hominem because it is not a fallacy mikes words would however be included in this count if he published them in the new york times
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a white kid growing up in detroit in the and i would have loved to educate about how ridiculous this sentence is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he supports by using an openly racist statement about white people with absolutely no sense of irony
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if i may racists and sexists are skeptical because theyre advancing an agenda not all white men are free of discrimination and not all people free of discrimination are incapable of empathy however some folks dismiss sexism or racism because their own issues are dismissed by others despite being equally valid experiences when championing social issues that affect groups on average we forget that individual experiences may strongly differ from the norm for instance man gets abused or raped nobody cares so he may feel less inclined to support claims that rape is a patriarchal phenomenon another example a poor white person growing up in primarily black area might be more focused on his own struggle than worrying about the systemic issues that led the poor neighborhood to be predominantly black in the first place white privilege means nothing to a disadvantaged white individual while the struggles of a wealthy black individual may seem petty to most white people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not that often that someone says something outright racist but things are usually more complicated in context of course it is but even here youre implying racism where there isnt anyeven in your fabricated examples if i say hey ive noticed our board of directors is all white men who went to mit in the and you say i think we should hire the best person for the job its implied that for some reason the company is best run by an oddly specific group of people no it just doesnt imply racism is the cause or that the best way to fix it is to add arbitrary quotas incentives to hire more black people if you say our borders should be enforced id be curious as to why you think they arent enforced and who you want to keep out theres a global refugee crisis right now are you talking about that the large number of undocumented immigrants suggest its not being enforced to effectiveness suggesting it should be enforced more doesnt imply racism if youre asking about how affirmative action works good but then id ask what your other suggestions were how do you want to fight racial inequality in education it wouldnt be racist at all to suggest colleges shouldnt take race into account at all when enrolling students it also wouldnt be racist at all to suggest legislation isnt a good idea for fighting racial inequality in education so no none of those things are outright racist or sexist but theyve all been used to back up racist or sexist positions before and theyre all just vague enough to leave space for that yep and during the mccarthy era opponents positions were used to back up communist positions before and as a result its totally valid to turn any discussion about those positions into an indepth qa session about whether or not the position is communist it stifles discussion theyre valid views nobody wants to be labeled a racist by someone whos expanded the definition to include anyone who doesnt support forcing others to correct every perceived racial injustice against nonwhite people at every opportunity edit also curious what your definition of racism is if you dont mind defining it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,heres the thing some people dont actually give a shit about race or anything else that was determined by nature at birth some people care about action what people do with their lives your company is run by people who went to mit not that strange i would expect mit grads to do well i would have guessed harvard or yale but it sounds like a really tech heavy company the borders should be enforced because while those who immigrate legally tend to do well in our society a much higher ratio of illegal immigrants tend to cause spikes in crime rates no matter where they are from or what they look like my personal recommendations for affirmative action mirror those of thomas sowell who has done extensive research in these areas stop incentivizing single motherhood of any race or creed and focus on the ladder to help people of any race or creed out of the pit theres much more to it than that but its a start oh and not that it matters but youll likely be interested to learn that thomas sowell was born with really dark skin and curly hair maybe the tech industry is hostile to women i wouldnt know but i definitely dont care how anyone feels about it especially for such a scientific community i would expect tech to show some sort of data and not really on something as subjective as feels or as irrelevant as gender or race to get anything done not everyone is sexist not everyone is racist in fact its probably a lot less common than you think you want to start making a difference stop seeing everyone as racegender
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the only thing i want to add is to their point about affirmative action saying affirmative action opens up spots to lessqualified students because of their skin color is racist youre just totally wrong here it does this by definition its its sole reason for existence its valid to say its righting a wrong its valid to say its better for society its valid to say it brings the racial makeup of college admissions to match that of society which is a good thing its not valid to say its not opening up spots to less academically qualified students of course it is even proponents acknowledge it isthey just think its not as important as righting ingrained multigenerational effects of racism you saying its racist proves my point
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,great ill be happy to be disagreed with or even called wrong all day then at least were having a discussion i think people holding those views are often ignorant but not necessarily racist ill take issue with this slightly saying things like this implies there isnt a valid alternative view if i said people who think abortion is wrong are often ignorant that doesnt bolster my prochoice argument at allit just dismisses others unfairly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cant think of any reason other than being nonwhite you would put lump together japanese people with black people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we have those in the usa they are called cities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no shit in places where minority communities live there are more of them than in other places same can be said about pretty much any major city in north america
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fun fact whites are no longer being born as a majority in the us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you should read when find irish became white
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,true i agree i think its just the result of a very mistrusting black community which is fair because the government hasnt been trustworthy for them for a long time as an aside someone just posted a counterpoint that i think requires fair examination specifically proof that there was at times a boogeyman he links to the specific audio interview so its not like there was never a boogeyman or that it wasnt there even in recent history the kind of dog whistle politics that he talks about there still kind of continues into today anyway maybe something for both of us to examine and modify into our worldviews
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a sidenote i would really like to get your opinion on the netflix documentary i though it was quite enlightening also john olivers series on the criminal justice system i dont think john olivers goes into much on racism but more injustice in general
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you mean double up
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,those damn sharks should go back where they came from
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you just linked to it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not disagreeing with what you said but if people on srs are representative of feminism it doesnt look too appealing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wrong reddit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,srs is down the hall to the left you need to go back
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in the same way that anarchists and communists infiltrate liberal antiglobalization and social justice movements the right has problems with fascists and racists delegitimizing issues or world views of large groups of people due to the outlying behavior of a few is one of the reasons why the us is so polarized politically
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are they though i mean have you seen it in person i mean sure ive seen a bunch of probablybogus internet stories about it but i live in a super leftist college town and man i have yet to see any legitimate costume outrage or obnoxious overuse of safe spaces and ive been here years i think its really easy for people to say that theres a bunch of liberal oppression of conservative discourse but ive never seen it if anything i feel like conservative discourse gets away with saying a surprising amount of shit without any liberals actually standing against it in a significant way at least thats what ive seen in my own personal experience
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,safe spaces and policing of halloween costumes have nothing to do with communism not even a little bit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hes saying that these two data if accepted would imply that racists are rare enough as to not impact the general vote of white people that seems to be in accord with my experience but i think people use different meanings for racist the right leaning people generally think about intention that is a racist is someone who actively hates minorities and intends to harm them whereas the left people think about consequences and outcomes that is to say a racist is someone whose actions intended or not harm minorities power oppression i think each side will reckon the numbers of racists in their midst by their own definitions and come to radically different conclusions and then yell at each other for being wrong
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the vast majority of people who were upset with obamas election were not racist they simply didnt like his policies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i did not see anything like the reaction from this election cycle in the tea party protests care to enlighten me with some videophoto evidence after all this is the internet and pics or it didnt happen is the rule btw im not a tea party supporter im genuinely curious
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did you even look at the link you sent its all people protesting trump youre so confident your world view is correct you dont even bother checking
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,doesnt your reply presuppose that the only objection one could have to obama is racism edit also amusingly on my search most of the results to that query are antitrump and only a handful are antiobama including one gay one opposing him for not supporting gay stuff enough and one liberal one protesting him for not having implemented immigration reform hard enough
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hey as a kevin i am offended you racist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lol please do im a mixed half white half black single parent home public school private school seen it all not to mention im literally mentoring a white kid right now in an all black hs on his way to college while its shitty you had to experience that and im sure its fucked up and those kids were jerks but i would hope your experience would leave u with empathy rather than bitterness as someone who has seen and received racism from both ends here is the thing about whiteness at the end of the day you can move on with your life to another part of the country and you can start over and just be a normal white dude in society yeah black kids can be jerks and it sucks to be isolated like that and while i dont doubt you faced racism but is your argument that there is not a history and foundation of antiblack racism in this country that is black people can finally talk about openly would you want to trade places with those kids who i presume bullied you not to mention did you ever pause and think why the environments you were in were so substandard in the first place why was poverty lack of jobs schools so concentrated in black areas is this all a coincidence to you i dont wont to judge but i hope part of you would try to at least think about it from that angle especially as someone i presume got out if you are posting on reddit the intention of this post was not to dismiss your claim but to address why it can come across as problematic if not taken in context it seems that you seem to think your admittinly rare situation can and should be applied across board and that because you as a white person that experience racism means you are now the defaxto judge of what racism looks like on an individualsubconscious institutional and structural level edit post im on phone work plz excuse typos
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,while were on the topic of overusing the term how do you consider what he said prejudiced against white people all he said was that whites dont experience racism the same way other americans do that seems pretty banal to me heres an example if a white person and a black person visit the same gas stations on a drive through ms and al the black person will get a very different experience of racism than the white person thats not prejudiced against the white traveller thats just stating a fact
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so were complaining about racism being an overused word but its totally applicable when i describe how someones experience and not their character is influenced by their race
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rad comment thanks i would add though that while racists and sexists is true few folks would identify with or admit to that those are usually unconscious thought patterns or behaviors which makes them harder to find and root out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we are not in a racismmccarthy era and the idea would be fucking laughable if it werent apparently pervasive no one is or will be imprisoned for racism dont worry cutting back to my fabricated examples im trying to demonstrate that the original statements provide plenty of space for interpretation and explanation if folks who hold your same policy positions will back it up with racist arguments unfortunately its on you to suggest alternatives no but it sure is a weird coincidence worth investigating okay i think a better solution is a path to citizenship and im against ices brutality and splitting up working families if legislation isnt a good solution what is a good solution you cant just look at racial inequality and a bad structure for fixing it go lets get rid of that structure and im not racist and all of your responses were its not racist to xyz am i really stifling discussion i basically said say more on this and you said no its not racist take my word for it racism is the massive structure of inequality that leads to significant differences in wealth and income incarceration rates education rates and life expectancy individual prejudices and perfectly wellmeaning people who happen to know mostly people who look like them help drive this structure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a lot of the people that dont care about racism because it doesnt affect them and while not everything is sexist or racist the actual sexist and racists are getting better at hiding it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,great ill be happy to be disagreed with or even called wrong all day then at least were having a discussion agreed saying things like this implies there isnt a valid alternative view i shouldve clarified what i meant by that because that definitely wasnt my intention first i dont think anyone can say anything like the above without qualification and a recognition of the complex interactions that take place within society from my experiences directly and indirectly from observing the rhetoric of those who do make such statements the vast majority of the time its an absolutist statement devoid of context which belies their knowledge on the subject
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,being nonwhite frequently others you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,toronto is markedly different than most na cities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,please do remember john oliver is a comedian first hes done a lot of misleading broadcasts that are funny and provocative but are not entirely accurate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you dont say
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,meh they arent my cup of tea but in comparison to alt right and dark enlightenment srs is like a hug from your grandma
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how is srs still the boogyman of the reddit right wingers the sub is pretty much dead and irrelevant and has been for years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,regardless if what you think of hillary it isnt equivalent to supporting alt right trash
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not a fan a bit too much irony
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not calling conservatives neonazis or dismissing conservative thought the altright movement is the outlying group
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i didnt say it did in fact i said that sounded like a crazy conspiracy theory i do believe however if you subscribe to that particular theory its easy to find evidence of it in a lot of the major universities around the country it seems like free speech and expression on college campuses is a bit under attack
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,apparently that makes you racist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we must be in different regions or you must have some pretty biased vision then this is what i got are you still going to deny historical events or acknowledge that the right protested heavily when obama was elected and reelected
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but thats only one anecdote no thats the experience of literally every white kid who didnt grow up in a safe suburb like you step out of your fucking bubble
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to address why it can come across as problematic if not taken in context speaking of empathy dont you see how problematic it is to assume all or even most white people grew up in some safe suburban bubble and therefore have no idea what it feels like to be on the receiving end of bigotry
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all he said was that whites dont experience racism the same way other americans do that seems pretty banal to me ask a white kid growing up in detroit how he feels about that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all he said was that whites dont experience racism the same way other americans do that seems pretty banal to me which is racist hes being prejudiced against white people hes categorizing their lives experience and sentiments based on race alone in a degrading manner heres an example if a white person and a black person visit the same gas stations on a drive through ms and al the black person will get a very different experience of racism than the white person since were playing that game a white person visiting a gas station or really any area in the inner part of almost any american city will get a very different experience of racism than the black person maybe you just dont spend time in these areas but its a basic aspect of reality for myself and people who live near them it is flat out dangerous and life threatening for white people to go in entire sections of my local city and this is not a unique experience unless you live and only spend time in a middle to upper class bubble they yell whitey at you cracka whiteboy etc aside from actual physical attacks and mugging i know what youre going to argue about society as a whole so ill nip that in the bud right now i see far more open racism against white people on tv and on the internet than i see with any other race our most powerful positions in our nation are held by black people its even celebrated and encouraged by major websites like buzzfeed huffington post cracked etc businesses and universities literally discriminate for admissions and hiring against white people and it is supported by the state with incentives by definition institutional racism and arguing against it as a white person actually makes people very angry racism against white people exists on all levels racism against all races exists on all levels in some manner dont single out white people and say they dont experience it thats ridiculous and outright racist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you are not in the wrong the other people downvoting are justdumb seriously there was no harm in your statement and anybody who takes offense is not only part of the problem but just plaindumb i would love to hear a story about how people automatically thought white people were going to stab or shoot them just because of their skin color but they dont exist denying the stereotypes and the way the stereotypes cause the ignorant to treat others is a veryconservative for lack of more appropriate word way of thinking
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not complaining about the overuse of the word racism im calling you out for your openly racist comment your comment is prejudice against white people youre characterizing people writing off their experiences and explaining their behavior by citing their race i will never cease to be amazed at how people like you just do not even acknowledge that theyre being racist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think umodospol was saying those statements are racist if youre looking for it and youre saying those statements are vague enough and have been used to further racist agenda nobody is incorrect here for the purpose of discussion and collaboration its just important to acknowledge perception your inherent bias their bias etc i thought this was a nice chain with a good exchange of ideas but the responses are becoming more aggressive near the end edit cc upalacesofparagraphs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,from my experiences directly and indirectly from observing the rhetoric of those who do make such statements the vast majority of the time its an absolutist statement devoid of context which belies their knowledge on the subject i understand but for many of us even in plain context its still considered to be racist we go to hire a programmer we interview ten candidates none of whom are black we pick one managers above us tell us we need to keep searching to find a more diverse candidate we think we should hire the best person for the job thats not racist at all maybe you can think of a better way to phrase this view and maybe thats the problem if the only way i can compress a view down to a soundbite means it sounds like code for something racist thats problematic id still argue the problem is that its dismissed because to some it looks like its code for actual racist stuff
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yishan did say they were straight up stalking and threatening admins family members extremist loonies are extremist loonies doesnt change because they hate white people instead of black
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre right hillary is far worse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i checked your link and yes i saw the images you linked but they were less than of the images displayed the rest were antitrump rallies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,absolutely i disapproved of it at the time and i still do now and it still doesnt justify rape melania signs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you said yourself that you were in an extreme minority in the fact ur at an all black school which maybe means a majority of white people dont have your experience maybe you should step out of you bubble
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,step out of your fucking bubble i have im not white hence my views on racism and if by safe suburb you mean majority white arent there logically more of those then there are neighborhoods that are majorityblack or majoritylatino and thats even if almost every white kid who went to a not majoritywhite neighborhood was discriminated against which i doubt but i wont question for now since i obviously havent had that experience
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes it is but i also have situational awareness and am basing this on the context of reddits general demographic and general groupthink misunderstandings that are so frequent on any issue that involves race minorities etc like my father is literally a white alcoholic who lives off the government trust me i understand not all white people are the same it doesnt change the black experience however i also notice how you didnt address any of the multiple valid points in my thread and jumped to a personal atteck
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i take it the point youre trying to make is that white people arent completely immune to prejudice but no one here is claiming that they are i think the heart of the argument is that whites are generally skeptical of or indifferent to the claims about racism that people of color make because the prejudice they experience is pretty dilute on average compared to what your average poc experiences i think the discrepancy between most whites daily experience with prejudice and the relatively lurid accounts of racism from pocs accounts for a lot of the skepticism that uyeartwo is talking about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,white men react with skepticism to terms like racism and sexism because they dont experience them the way other americans do im going to guess that you and i might have interpreted this differently i read it more as white men do not have a total understanding of the nonwhite experience of racism or of womens experience of sexism i wouldnt call that prejudiced against whites you could just as easily say blacks do not have a total understanding of the white experience of racism and i would still agree you can also reasonably read it to say white americans do not experience racism and nonwhite americans do which is highly dismissive of whites who do experience racism as you point out and something that i would call prejudiced i assume by your responses that your interpretation is closer to the second way am i correct
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly uyeartwo just blatantly used racist speech and theyre wondering why people dont take them seriously youre being a prejudiced piece of shit for christs sake
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lets discuss your view a bit i get that youre saying that you want to hire the best person for the job are you sure that your process right now allows that how are you sourcing the people you are interviewing the fact that none of the ten people you interviewed were black suggests to me that there may be areas youre overlooking are you offering relocation packages for candidates who dont live in your area its one thing to say that youve exhausted all of your options and couldnt find a candidate who would increase the diversity of your company its quite another to say that you interviewed people and that should be good enough one indicates that you have hired the best person the other shows that youve just hired the best person available so in that regard i personally agree with your managers however if theyre just saying keep searching without providing solid leads thats a different problem
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,prejudice is fine cause other places have it too i have to say i really dislike it when people seem to think there are lesser stakes at play than there truly are the people who are so wrapped up in themselves so egotistical that when they see someone speaking out against bigotry or even coming close they assume that person must be acting in as much selfinterest as me and thus this person is just signalling virtue it really says a lot about how different everyones mindsets are even just approaching the topic of prejudice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no its really just a pc way of saying white supremacist but i think many people dont realize that so they throw it around willy nilly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there has been a push recently to conflate the term altright and therefore all of the nonmainstream conservative views with all of the evil on earth its a weak play by the left to control your opinion frankly i sit on the left as far as policy goes but hate their disinformation and manipulation of people so much that i can no longer support them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they were talking about the subreddit raltright who are explicitly racist and mostly neonazis rather than the general use of the term which is kind of vague
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it is an umbrella term but it is not simply conservatism outside the mainstream the term was coined to mean something more specific and has been used as such white nationalism is a strong theme within the movement as is antimulticulturalism theres a bit of antisemitism too they all may not be neonazis but i dont feel the need to be politically correct
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it sort of was if you had called anyone under that description alt right a few weeks ago they would have said what the fuck does that even mean nobody knew who the hell richard spencer was before that video went viral but man he became the leader of the altright overnight without the altright even knowing about it somehow they were like woah who is this guy why is he supposedly our leader and oh fucking christ hes doing a nazi salute
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the first time i heard the term it meant republicans who disagree with the party on at least one social issue for example all the guys who are ok with gay marriage or weed being legalized but who still supported conservative economic policies an alternative right if you will now i guess it just means racistspeople who didnt vote for clinton
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sort of in principle it could mean a socially conservative alternative to republicanstyle judeochristian values in practice that means populist antiimmigrationn and protectionist and
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,think raltright but somehow more discriminatory
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that was kinda the intended meaning but its morphed into an easiertoswallow term for white nationalist conservatism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it is but the left has painted it as as unified movement which is chiefly concerned about racism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not really it refers to white nationalism mostly i mean read the stuff on raltright op was saying that visiting clinton subs is equivalent to that it really isnt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,because thats whats currently in the news are you seriously so willing to gaslight the past years away and pretend this shit didnt happen daily
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,detroit is black which mans there are tens of thousands of white people living there and thats just one majorityblack city
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i have im not white hence my views on racism and yet you dont see the irony in this statement white people just dont understand because theyre white yet nonwhite people somehow magically understand what its like to be white cute
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,basing this on the context of reddits general demographic and general groupthink well theres your problem
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think the heart of the argument is that whites are generally skeptical all whites what an interesting postilion to take im going to guess the whites who seem a little less receptive to your concerns are those that live this shit in real life while the sheltered whites who think white rich black poor are the ones who see things the way you think they should its almost like life experiences shape your perception of things
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no im arguing against the former dont know where you got the idea that i was arguing against the latter
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how is he being prejudiced he just said that white men dont experience racism and sexism the way other americans do race and sex respectively are pretty central to the concepts so i dont see how saying one group experiences it differently is racist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so in that regard i personally agree with your managers it doesnt matter if you agree with the managers it matters if you think im racist just for disagreeing maybe my area doesnt have many black people maybe the costs of a relocation package arent justifiable to the company financially maybe the hiring pool itself has fewer black people and the candidates are an accurate reflection of that maybe black culture doesnt promote tech as much as white and asian cultures do its implied that unless one is willing to ignore these factors completely cover their eyes and say only positive things about diversity quotas they might be racist thats my point
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a parallel setssankey diagram made with r the data source is httpappssoeurostateceuropaeunuishowdodatasetmigrasyappctzalangen the htmlwidget httpsgithubcomtimelyportfolioparsetr was used to create the interactive graphic the code from that r widget was tweaked for the graphic to be horizontal rather than vertical
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you ranked by true sarah palin would still be in the top thats strange
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,looks like sanders is the only one without anything rated pants on fire
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my question is who got to pick the statements from each candidate did they have any agenda
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politifact is not independent in any way shape or form theyve a pretty strong left leaning bias
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,only reason hillary gets such good marks is cuz she just straight up wont answer like homer leaving for the bar marge im not going to lie to you walks out door and drives away
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this data is neither collected nor analyzed scientifically it does not comment on how honest different people are it comments on how honest politifact rates people to be in the statements of those people which they choose to examine there is a very large difference politifacts methodology doesnt even claim to be attempting to do what this visualization of their data claims to be able to do
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont buy this at all hillary clinton is that far down lol who wrote this survey her
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,polutifact isnt independant or reliable in any way nobody should use it it is owned by the tbt which donated to and support clinton
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we should be really concerned about this trend to use data to push a false narrative so blatant and would have such a bad impact on society if places like politifact arent called out on these things this is how you get people that think all science research is just made up bs by the government or whatever refusing to take their kids to the doc the impact of data is getting less less which is sad imo since it could be something that can really help solve a lot of issues
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,itt no one cares that even the supposedly most truthful politicians are still not even speaking true or mostly true more than half the time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,jeb hanging out between clinton and sanders with the dems in the honest pile nice job jeb i knew you were alright obama nice job being mostly false to pantsonfire only of the time a true miracle amongst politicians for the winning spot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think what this chart fails to consider and why it should be taken cautiously is what halftruths should really be considered full out lies andthe importance of the lies in question for example most americans consider clinton more dishonest than trump but would probably not be surprised to see trump has the most lies in this graph im not atleast i think one reason for this is because trump does not appear to be calculated in his lies he just says whatever is on his mind and regardless of whether it is true or not that comes off as authentic compare this to someone such as hillary clinton who i think most people would admit is extremely competent and smart who is cognizant of every word she says where she says it and how she says it yet still lies or presents halftruths and always in a way that is meant to serve her to the detriment of the people to demonstrate this here are two statements given by each candidate and you can decide which one you believe to be more dishonest donald trump barack obama founded isis hillary clinton cofounded it hillary clinton i never received nor sent any material that was marked classified now of course not everyone is going to agree but to me the statement that appears to be the most dishonest is actually the one that would be graded better on this scale of course what donald trump is saying is completely ridiculously untrue but i think most people would interpret it as hyperbolic rather than intentionally deceiving and that may come off as dishonest but not maliciously so clinton has the opposite problem nothing she says is exaggerated everything is planned and calculated beforehand so when she makes the statement that she has never sent nor received any material marked classified which is to say that she very well may have received classified material but it just might not have been marked which was later found to be a complete lie but at the time just a misleading truth that is a statement intentionally made to deceive a statement she considered beforehand that she knew was misleading yet said it anyway knowing full well how it would be perceived when donald trump lies it often does not appear to be thought out carefully and precisely and it does not appear like he does it in a way that is intended to deceive he lies so much and about things that dont really seem important enough for him to have considered beforehand that people do not have to worry about finding the truth in his words because they dont really expect there to be any truth in the first place this makes it so his lies no matter how brazen they may be will always appear less dishonest then clintons halftruths since she seems aware of the fact that she is lying or being misleading yet does it anyway
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all the blatant lies hilary has been caught in and shes one of the most truthful mmm ok sure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if this has anything to do with that politifact pants on fire rating system then its a joke they constantly have the exact same bullshit ranked true if hillary said it mostly true if bernie said it and pants on fire if trump said it dont care what side of the fence youre on if the exact same fact is rated differently depending on who said it the rating system is bullshit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politifact independent well thats pants on fire theyve been busted over and over saying x liberal candidate statement was true same exact statements by x republican candidate false like carlin says the politicians and media are one big party and you aint invited people need to wake the hell up but its far too late for that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would prefer an algorithm that random selects statements from each of the republicans on here is totally accurate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for anyone that thinks politifact is in any way independent or reliable in any way and
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,randy bachman lies so much he must be taking care of business oh wait do they mean that american woman from what ive seen of her husband shell get no sugar tonight
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,bernie sanders is the only candidate to never receive the pants on fire option
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpwwwpolitifactbiascom saying its from politifacts is like saying you got it from wiki it means fuck all without sources and actual facts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the fact that hillary clinton and obama are the lowest ranked is enough to tell you this grading is full of shit lol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politifact is far from an independent fact checking site heres just one heres some it is massively partisan
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dumbest thing ive ever seen on this sub how do you quantify the truth of something on a sliding scale who picked the statements
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am so sick of having to fact check fact checkers the npr fact checking of the debate was heavily and obviously biased as well madness is infecting the world and people have abandoned truth for the moral high ground amongst their closest peers in the zeitgeist i feel like the echo chambers that individuals of each side have isolated themselves inside have been turned on everyone outside and all you hear is people parroting facts that are contradictory i am at the point of abandoning holding beliefs because of the torrent of propaganda i am forced to deal with on a constant basis now know how those in felt when the facts change from day to day and moment to moment it is weakening my resolve and edging me closer to abandoning faith in humanity
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its easy to cherrypick which statements verifications support your own biases its even easier to subjectively decide the truth of any given statement again according to your own slant on things as kyle from south park would say i call shenanigans
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why does it go from republican to independent to democrat was that just an accident or also something is up with hillary being the second least pants on fire lol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well if they are against trump and for clinton they can just easily pick or so statements from trump that they already know are false and use those how did they choose which statements they were going to fact check thats pretty important to know
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what a horrible study statements those results would be hard to manipulate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i can pick at least completely false statements that hrc made about her email scandal alone thats not counting benghazi the clinton foundation tpp nafta gun control stats whitewater bills sex scandal cover ups travelgate arriving under sniper fire etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hillary with truth this seems as trustworthy as she is people are going to believe this garbage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hillary is so obviously crooked whether these metrics are true or not hillary constantly avoids topics to get caught in lies about i hate these type of surveys she hates most of the constitution if not all of it most terrifyingly her obama and most of the left seem to avoid the true issues of a muslim caliphate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so do the dozens of instances of you can keep your doctor all count as one lie
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am very against those at the top of this chart but this data is just ridiculous which statements were taken who chose the statements to be reviewed what is your definition of pants on fire stuff like this discredits a point that can be legitimately made in a fairer fashion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sort of a red flag to see them claim that obama and hilldog are the most truthful real clear bias there for damn sure im not saying they are the worst but hilldog is well known for being full of shit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so they didnt include hillarys statements to the fbi in these statistics im assuming
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lol this website massively skews polls in favour of crooked hillary what a complete pile of bullshit until i see a list of every statement used i will not believe a fucking thing they release funny how they didnt use any of hillarys lies from when she was being questioned by the authorities or the hundreds of times she has lied on audio
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im a little confused does this only represent statements made by each person over nine years if thats the case and im not trying to crap on the work here this comes across as very minuscule each person on this has to at least make statements weekly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,only statements over the past years i am sure i could cherrypick to make this graph look any way i wante it to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this sub should be renamed rdatacanbemanipulated this is well known is business you can make data say whatever you want it to say case in point who picked the statements from each person over a yr period that was used for this graph
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,except this source is literally run by the most biased organization in the world and theyre pretty damned blatant about it too black youth unemploynment rises trump pants on fire its african american youth nig black youth black youth unemploynment rises clinton true btw your donation will arrive in a few days
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not a trump supporter but i can tell that this is pretty biased hillary has definitely told more lies than trump
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,except politifcat is incredibly biased and the tampa bay times which owns politifact publicly endorsed clinton but i guess people dont dig further when something validates their own thoughts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as many others have pointed out politifact is hardly a reliable source they abuse their own rating system show clear bias and have been caught doing both multiple times this isnt meant for rdataisbeautiful this is meant for rdataiseasilymanipulated i mean seriously statements from as far back as it doesnt take a degree in data science for you to understand how shitty this data is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nice bias obviously all the statements hillary made about benghazi and her voteing record were conveniently omitted
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,conducted by robert mann a known democrat this kinda makes it seem sketchy as hell he used more than statements from all of these people which isnt much of a sample size at all i alone make hundreds if not thousands of statements a day not only this but humans are natural born liers and as far as the information is given the lies bachmann say could just be as simple as when asked what day it was and was mistaken taking all of these into account and the fact they dont even say random statements you can conclude that this is probably biased for his beliefs if someone else did a similar analysis following the guidelines laid out in this image you could prove that trump is true of the time and hillary is pants on fire of the time also i have no political affiliation here i honestly couldnt care less about the politics here i just want to remind people that stats usually have a motive behind them and you cant believe everything you see like this too quickly without thinking about what it really means and how the numbers could have been twisted to represent what the author wanted tldr stats arent always what they seem to be
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,clinton lied to the fbi and congress and destroyed evidence that she was served a subpoena for thats far worse than lying in a stupid political interview
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politifact is not an independent fact checking website the paper that created it has endorsed hillary and endorsed democrats in every recent election
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,clinton is at the bottom thats how you this is bullshit politifact is anything but facts folks
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when you take a close look at the snopes article regarding the child rapist case of hillary clinton youll find out how useless these so called factchecking sites are let me explain what they did on the snopes site with that case your claim is that im a murderer and i actually am therefore your claim would be true according to snopes how did they end up with mostly false you ask very simple i tell everyone that you claimed that i murdered someone pissed on the corpse bathed in victims blood cleaned myself with the american flag and took the lords name in vain in actuality i only did the murdering therefore your story is false because of the claims arent true result the claim against hillary is mostly false despite the fact that she totally did defend the child rapist thats how factchecking works guys and gals
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,let me state this simply fucking bullshit if obama and clinton are deemed more truthful than anyone else on the planet than we have a statistical analysis problem
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hillary not being all dark red is your elephant in the wrong room politico is so far up hillarys ass theyve rented a room
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ill just leave this here for the people to decide about the credibility of the source
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes guess hilary clinton didnt lie about benghazi using a personal private server and deleting emails my god shes the most honest one
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the fact that hilary and obama are at the bottom you know this is not a reputable source 😂😂😂😂
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,haha this is absolute bullroar just another biased unrelenting attempt by some leftist wing nut to make their side of the political spectrum look like its more truthful and noble than the other gary lloyd once said when the governments boot is on your throat whether it is a left boot or a right boot is of no consequence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if i look at httpwwwpolitifactcompersonalitiesberniesstatementsbyrulingfalse i would have to point out that politifact needs a new category for bernie sanders called technically false where they could box all his attack against the establishment saying that when youre white you dont know what its like to be poor is false when their own evaluation of that statement says that whites are the smallest percentage of poor people vs for blacks is either dishonest or harsh and dumb
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i stopped reading at polifact independant lmao this has no business being on this sub
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is absolute trash so only republicans lie eh have you even heard hillary talk she lies constantly literally once a week she says some completely false shit this graph belongs in the pants on fire column
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they should have one that says who has more blood on their hands hillary would be at the top of the list see libya syria honduras etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id like politifact to be included in the chart as well for comparison
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,where all the email server lies fact checked it lookt like basically all of it were lies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,statements from the past near decade what kind of graph is this i could choose any statements for the past nine years to make a biased graph of my choosing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,independent fact checker bullshit this is pure biased drivel produced and manipulated with an obvious agenda i hope your pretty graph makes you feel smug and self righteous though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the problem with this data did you murder that person no i didnt pants on fire versus are you sure you completed high school in we have records stating you finished in yes i finished in also pants on fire one of those lies concerns me more than the other not say the chart wouldnt look the same i just dont see how we can make any inferences of honesty from the above i think trump does not practice any selfrestraint and says many things off the cuff likely inaccurately where as hillary is better is more calculating and rehearsed with her lies shes better at misleading while still technically not lying thats what makes her more fit to be president imo you really need a well practiced liar and trump sucks at it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,robert mann jr democrat that ran for the volusia county seat robert mann independent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is the most biased thing ive ever seen and ive seen an episode of the nightly show with larry wilmore
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,according to politifact is a huge caveat dont assume this is free of political bias
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not an american so id say i can be a bit more impartial on this the first thing that makes me think this is utter bullshit is the fact that with a very few exceptions it basically depicts republicans as huge liarsat the top while democrats are depicted as very honestat the very bottom which is obviously not true there are liars in both parties politicians lie for a living sell dreamsillusions etc so this is almost certainly made by a democrat supporter that lacks any intention of being objective or correct putting trump at the very top so calling him the biggest liar while you put hillary clinton at the very bottomonly obama is lower than her and that way calling her very honest is also a clear sign of just how subjective you are yes trump obviously does lie and keeps on adjusting his past statements but hillary clinton often lies too i mean lets get serious this woman obviously lied each and every single time that she was asked about those damn emails the benghazi affair the huge lie about being under enemy fire when she visited bosnia in a conflict free area during peace time taking loads of pics with a kid in her arms all smilling etc etc etc the gap between these is obviously not that big this graphic only takes into account the number of different lies allegedly it doesnt take into account all the instances in which they lied cause you can repeat the same lies over and over and over again so the total number of instances in which you lied can differ greatly from the number of different lies i wonder how can they be sure that the count was indeed correct spotting a lie is not always a sure thing and when the truth is doubtful how do you correctly establish what is half true mostly false etc again those are highly subjective ways of interpreting a statement and lack any scientificobjective support so what sources were used to create this graphic
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politifact is extremely biased theyre owned by the tampa bay times which has openly endorsed clinton
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rdataisbeautiful is using politifact as a source im not sure if this sub is throwing away its reputation by doing this or is it showing us proof of how biased politifact is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah yes the independent fact checkers at politifactcom independently owned by the tampa bay times who independently endorsed hillary clinton all the way back in february truly a bastion of neutrality
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this complete bs hillarys email scandal automatically puts her higher she lied about coming down under sniper pire her granny panies are on fire
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if youre getting this information from politifact you should know they have a huge bias against trump they give him false and pants on fire for saying the exact same thing as bernie or any other candidate that receives true or mostly true not to mention theyll mark him false for being like number off here are few proof i could dig up httpiimgurcompvurgnapng
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politifact an independent factchecking websiteliar liar pants on fire
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,funfact we have a new word in germany postfact world it is like in the tv duell afterwords everyone is the winner it is not longer about facts but about interpretation therefore all trumppfans wont believe the facts and will tell you these data where biased
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,obviously made by a liberal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so even the most honest politicians are still lying about half the time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when theres a candidate that has a full blue bar well have someone worth voting for finally
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,however true and relevant rarely occur in the same palinism because she spouts so many adages the difference between a pitbull and a hockey mom is lipstick politifact thats true i guess
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sarah says many simple things
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,guess she lacks nuance
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i rank this comment as mostly true because while the statement is true it disregards mostlytrue as an option as it should since measuring a persons attempts at telling true statements should include the goodfaith inherent in mostly true statements if you include true and mostly true statements she performs pretty pitifully
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what the actual
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a broken clock is correct two times a day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,isnt it plants for hire
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i feel like that should carry more weight than the graph lets on
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and yet we didnt even get him into the electionthis is why we cant have nice things
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think it is supposed to mean that they all have been graded by politifact on at least statements not that they only chose statements for each candidate for this graph
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,statements werent chosen for each candidate its a graph made up from those that had more than statements from the creator of the graph robert mann at nbsp when was this graph created i created this graph in march which makes it a couple months old hillary clinton and donald trump had and rated statements respectively when this chart was made its now around months old and clearly thered be many more statements that could be included nbsp how did i choose which candidates to show basically i used politifacts search function to look at every candidates scorecard and compiled the data into a spreadsheet i then sorted the data based on the percentage of statements that are mostly false or worse and generated the chart to compare i only recorded candidates who have more than graded statements so that the results carry more weight there simply isnt enough data on politicians like martin omalley who has only scored statements to make any meaningful inference on their truthfulness nbsp did i cherrypick statements no i tallied the rulings for all graded statements for each listed candidate perhaps the next question is does politifact itself cherrypick statements the short answer here is also no but it requires more consideration
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,idk yes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably and theres always been talk that poltifact is much more harsher when rating right winged lies too like both sides will put out a similar lie but politifact might rate one pants on fire and the other mostly false even though both of them have a degree of truth to them ive seen a few where politifact essentially said well if you look at it in this perspective it makes sense and if youre referring to this it does work like that but as a whole it doesnt therefore pants on fire as far as im concerned pretty much anything mostly true or lower on politifact you should be weary of because of the bias the true ones you can actually get verifiable evidence for them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did they have any agenda everyone has bias its up to you to find the truth check out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my question is who got to pick the statements from each candidate politifact which is owned by the tampa bay times did they have any agenda
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politifact picks what statements they rate and theyre independent theres some demonstrable issues like when they gave bernie sanders a halftrue for giving the problematic hours worked out of hours available statistic for unemployment and trump a pants on fire for using it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why would you think theres an agenda seems obvious that hillary and obama are the two most honest people in the world
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they have a very blatant agenda
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably notice how the repubs are generally higher on the list
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did they have any agenda dont be coy of course they had an agenda its pretty easy to see how biased politifact is when you compare their ratings across multiple statements for different politicians of either party other commenters have given examples below
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my question is why is bernie sanders the only one with zero pants on fire statements
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes the source of this graph is incredibly biased how credible is a website which uses pants on fire as data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i read an article the other day i think on reddit about how politifact endorses hillary they rated a trump claim as false then cited an article that supported the claim i think it was over lost jobs in ohio
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not just that whats being graded in the graph is the severity of how untrue the statement was which is quasipossible to grade objectively but not how important each statement was which is pretty subjective put it this way one candidate can pantsonfire lie that he went to west point then have a series of slightly less severe militaryrelated lies how long they served which unit they were in what rank they were did they ever shoot anyone at the end of the day none of that really mattered to me to begin with its a pack of lies but eh but if a candidate lies about maintaining a private email server well im a security professional so that really irks me doesnt matter to me if its a pants on fire lie mostly lie half truth i dont care im pissed off that it happened that one lie makes all the difference to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the people that picked hilarys didnt want to commit suicide
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,of course politifact has an agenda people who regard them as the gold standard for fact checking are just looking for a liberal echo chamber
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that was my first thought before even looking at who ranked where some odd statements over a year period isnt a good sample size and could very easily be manipulated to push an agenda id be more interested in seeing the truth behind every public statement for each of the people on this chart i know thatd be next to impossible but would be a much better representation of a persons truthfulness and that would have to only consider the statements that have clearly defined truefalse sides this is absofuckinlutely not worth the ram its taking up on my phone to look at it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly this isnt really the most scientific of methods to judge candidate honesty
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,plus we already know that politifact is biased and rates clintons lies as half truths
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politifact is about as neutral as the dnc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and politifact while independent is hardly free of bias in their selection of what facts to rate and the methodology they use to rate them they lean left hard and democrats very much get the benefit of the doubt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the fact that it shows hillary as remotely honest is all you need to look at to find out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im glad that youre asking this question but i hate that we need to ask the question
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,unquestionably this is biased
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no of course not hillary the notorious lying witch that eats childrens souls for no other reason than for a laugh barely lies at all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre crazy if you trust any of these clowns and im talking about the media outlets obviously politicians lie but it wasnt too long ago that the media strived for some semblance of objectivity that day is long gone
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it also matters what they are lying about trump could claim to have slept with over women and that be a huge lie but it doesnt matter clinton could claim to have not intentionally put confidential information at risk which isnt a huge lie but its still a bigger one in the sense of what its in regards to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,their owning company tampa bay times in fact just endorsed hillary far from neutral and their claims are often quite disputable for the record im not a fan of many of either trumps policies or hillarys actions just saying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politifact is not independent in any way shape or form theyve a pretty strong left leaning bias pants on fire source politifact
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,proof
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably true but thats also what the right says about any media source that questions their bullshit edit heres the real question can you imagine any version of this list prepared by any credible organization left or right that doesnt have trump at the top you can argue all day about the rest of the list but if bullshit were music donald would be a brass band 😂
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would love to live in a world where people know that just because someone somewhere on the internet claimed to have factchecked or debunked something does not mean that that is what they did
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was wondering i have a hard time believing one side of the aisle has such a monopoly on propaganda and lying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not left left corporatist maybe
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is there a less biased version of this out there id love to see some fact checked statements from candidates but i want the truth not some candy ass painted up thing to make one of them look better than the other
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,after reading through this thread ive become convinced that this is the case i still believe that factchecking politicians has great value though so are there any factchecking outlets that have a better reputation for nonpartisanship
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which is a reason to question the data or to refuse all information from the source if you want to attack the data prove that it is false dont attack the source
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i lean left as well but i cant take this data seriously
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,facts have a well known liberal bias
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but why is this front page astroturf op made a biased graph and ctr is brigading it to the front page for political propaganda in other words another day on reddit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,still counts someone asks me what the capital of zaire is im better off not answering than making a fool of myself
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and because politifact openly supports and donates to hillary
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people that support her
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it also has no difference in weight for pants on fire statements as though bernie sanders saying we now work the longest hours of any people around the world and being technically incorrect has the same weight as hillary clinton saying comey said my answers were truthful and what ive said is consistent with what i have told the american people or i remember landing under sniper fire
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to be fair you can go to their site and look at the statements they are judging they break it down pretty well can you find an example of an egregiously incorrect assessment httpwwwpolitifactcompersonalitieshillaryclinton
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and which completely unbiased fact checker do you use edit im getting downvotes but nobody has proposed a solution yet i dont understand am i supposed to just vote uneducated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for the record i am anti clinton but hey maybe its possible that they are endorsing hillary because she rates so highly with them not because they are biased just a theory if you were a fact checking agency wouldnt you want the most truthful candidate to win
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,trump says of refugees are men actually are men and are boys pants on fire
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,could you provide an example of this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no source is completely unbiased
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats because its only taking statements the politifact evaluated these were controversial statements in the first place
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats an excellent point
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can you give an example
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which statement did they rate as false when said by a republican but true when said by a democrat and is trump gonna let you into one of his parties
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,every piece of evidence that they are as bias as people think has been quite lame i replied to them in detail already
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that image is a complete lie why dont you just link to the actual politifact page oh because politifact didnt actually say that shit thats why trumps claim that blacks kill of white homicide victims is a total lie according to the fbi its actually and here is what politifact actually says in the article trump tweeted an image that made various statistical claims including that blacks kill percent of white homicide victims almost every number in the image is wrong the statistics on white victims are exaggerated fivefold the policerelated deaths are off as well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did you did you just post a meme as evidence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your image is photoshopped from didnt check the others but i expect theyre wrong
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lol they proved that politifact is biased by photoshopping politifact statements to appear biased nothing is real anymore
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i sadly only discovered very recently how unbelievably biased politifact was in favor of the dnc its painful
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you think she was lying a lot now you aint seen nothing yet bbbbaby you just aint seen nothin yet
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you have to lie while fact checking you are not working from the moral high ground
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,visit the site literally all the answers are there the statements they used were all the ones they ever ranked usually ones that were debated popular or controversial pants on fire basically means its not just technically wrong its is or nearly the complete opposite of the truth saying all stop lights in the us are purple would be pants on fire while something like most stop lights in the us dont work would be false
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we call her the hilderbeast where im from
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politifact isnt saying theyre not shitbags a person could make true but misleading statements or equivocations or lies by omission and politifact wouldnt ding them all politifact does is track how many demonstrably false statements a politician makes as in statements that directly contradict established facts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,even so it looks like a majority of voters in wisconsin support him
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean if you read the articles accompanying those ratings youll see that data is from the economic policy institute and isnt actually referring to unemployment but rather labor underutilization and is referring to a pretty specific demographic yo whove graduated high school but not enrolled in further schooling the article says his terminology was off but the data was real and the intended point was accurate so mostly true campaign didnt respond as to where their numbers came from and politifact assumed it comes from a computation of all to blacks who arent working and may not even want a job including high school and college students and as students arent included in what is defined as unemployment mostly false it is i feel like most people dont realize politifact doesnt just look at the statement toss a truefalse on it and move on there is some work put in to it im not saying there are no cases of bias but there is an explanation at least that can be looked at
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably because they are talking about two different things in two different contexts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wait why do you think its dishonest poor and white arent mutually exclusive i think thats their point which group has more poor people doesnt seem overly relevant i think rating that claim at all is kind of dumb its not really a statement of fact making it in the first place is dumber than rating it though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or you can see russia from alaska technically true also totally irrelevant
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politifact
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sometimes dogs are brown palin
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a counter point mostly true is the most dangerous one on the board if we change your assumption of good faith attempt to an assumption of willful decite masked as truth we arrive at the best kind of lie one that fact checks true enough but advances an agenda or muddles an issue
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think ill eat it now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think it is my life for aiur
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its pants on fire patrick
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,isnt it plants on fire
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean he also has more false statements than a few others
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youd think the more than in more than statements would have made this clear edit fixed typo am on phone sorry
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes but equally important is what statements fact checkers choose to rate in the first place if you want an example of what im talking about poltifact to this day insists that trump was and rates it a pants on fire statement anyone whos not pants on fire on head retarded knows that trump calling them the founders of the islamic state is obvious hyperbole his claim is that of all the people worldwide with the ability to influence the events which took place in iraqsyria obama and then secretary clinton hold the primary responsibility as their policies saw the islamic state transform from virtually nothing into a growing threat which obama famously described as a jv team and has since grown into a global caliphate with territory on continents and the capacity to carry out terrorist attacks in over countries i mean if they rated it as halftrue to reflect the patisan divide and political debate over how the obama administrations policies influenced the rise of the islamic state that would be legitimate fact checking on the other hand theyll pad clintons true statements with talking points like this according to independent experts donald trumps tax plan would blow up the debt by over trillion and would in some instances disadvantage middleclass families compared to the wealthy turns out that the independent expert who published that study for of the last years to i guarantee you that seconds of google searching would find independant conservative think tanks and economists that will say the opposite about trumps plan but you wont see his statement at the rally touting those analysts show up on politifact
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politifact is owned by the very liberal tampa bay times so it is no surprise to see obama and hillary lie the least according to them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hasnt politifact been shown to have a lot of biases too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,with a statement being in politicfact it inherently has the potential of being false how many times has some one said they are hungry and that got added the data source seems a little bias
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for that it would be nice to have an update its six month old and we know that a lot happened in those six months for example the first debate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im pretty sure their agenda was grade all the statements i dont think they just stopped when they got to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i find it useful and interesting to read their articles but i pretty much ignore the ratings they apply as ive noticed the pretty clear bias in those
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or more often arbitrarily decide what it is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why is it impossible to have any sort of objectivity in political matters hire some fucking canadian who doesnt give a shit about american politics and let him do the research and share the results im so tired of being fed bullshit from every direction
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,granted bernie sanders campaign sent politifact the study they were citing it turns out he should have been more clear trumps campaign never responded and the facts they looked at didnt add up to percent so they were not sure if trump was citing a specific study or just pulling numbers from thin air with sanders they knew what study he was looking at edit updated spelling
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats because bernie had a qualifier of the real unemployment rate as opposed to the official one trump just said unemployment rate which by default means the not employed but looking metric
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no gun data to support hillary clintons statements half true sorry what jesus its so easy to see the bias
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,every newspaper in the country has endorsed clinton the only newspaper to endorse trump is the national inquirer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theyve actually rated most of hillarys statements about her emails as mostly true or higher let that sink in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wheres the sarcasm tag
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think that its interesting that as a percentage of total statements hilary and obama are about on par with jeb and palin its also sort of telling when you look at the percentages of red to orange and then consider eachs temperament and predisposition from sh ooting from the hip i see that theyre all wrong a lot of the time but those with hotter heads and shooting from the hip are prone to make the pants on fire rating
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,most honest presidential candidate most honest person in the world
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,unfortunately for republicans they often make the most absurd not based anywhere in reality claims so yeah youd expect them to rate poorer in a truthfulness measure too much of the republican base is opinion based rather than fact based these days
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they didnt just endorse her they endorsed her way back in february before the primaries were over every rating theyve made since of clinton sanders trump anybody else for that matter should have carried a conflict of interest disclosure none of them have had any disclosure whatsoever
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for the record im not a fan of many of either trumps policies or hillarys actions im not sure if this was intentional but i love how you made sure to mention her actions since her rhetoric has drifted substantially left i dont think theres a person in this country that doubts that she would sign the tpp were it to hit her desk regardless of what shes saying now for example
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,actually this alone is not a good argument almost all newspapers including conservative ones have endorsed hillary over trump in fact arizona republic recently tapped a democratic candidate for the first time ever in its existence or since the late century not sure which
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they could have added all the statements theyve evaluated so we could fact check their data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,proof what the fuck lolol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why do you mislead people with misleading quotes politifact literally quotes a third party and goes on to explain how that number is false funny how instead of letting people read stuff for themselves you mislead them to making misleading assumptions also nice bold fonting to compensate for lack of reading comprehension
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also here is the actual article you know not parsed or selective cut the number refers to potential jobs lost not actual jobs lost this is an important point that would not be obvious from the way trump phrased his statement by leaving the impression that these were actual jobs lost trumps statistic invites a degree of outrage that isnt warranted read the entire article since thats the way it was meant to be read
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,potential jobs hes not quoting actual losses did you read past the first paragraph
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you read the rest of the article not just the part cut off conviently before the explanation youd see why they said it was false while the number matches one projection of how many potential jobs could be lost from the blockage of coalfired plants theres a difference between actual jobs lost and potential future jobs lost and the number cited an impossibletoconfirm projection based on broadly construed calculations released by a procoal group should be taken with a big grain of salt trump also ignores that market forces not just environmental regulations have driven many of the job losses in the coal sector and he also ignores that michigan republican officials and utilities themselves not just the obama administration have pushed the switch away from coal we rate the claim false trump says obama caused it thats why they say it was false in the future please refrain from taking photos sent by grandma in an email at face value
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you know i used to agree with that i was fairly left leaning growing up but as i got older i drifted more to the middle its not the calling republicans out on bullshit that pisses me off its the not calling out the democrats on theirs thats really the bias
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wapo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpmimgurcomgalleryezyri they are extremely biased toward the left my personal favorite on there is when ted cruz said they were trying to let boys shower with girls they listed it as false saying transgender girls arent boys biologically they are so how the fuck can they list that as false
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,although seeing trump and bachmann at the top shouldnt be surprising
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yea theyre all liars but politifact is worthless everything a right leaning politician says is false if even the smallest thing is incorrect for the left leaning politicians if theres a kernel of truth they will get a true the bias has been there for well over a decade i use npr fact checker but who knows they could be biased too everyone has an agenda
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,journalists selfidentify as liberal about as much as conservatives people make policy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which side rejects evolution and climate change science is really the only way to know anything so if you reject that youre in trouble with everything else
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,professional psychologists would say gender is a social construct and thats who politifact would cite so of course theyd say that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what is ctr
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,especially since zaire doesnt exist under that name anymore
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not about making a fool of yourself for not knowing something its about dodging questions when you know the answer and it is incriminating
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it also makes them far from honest
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no youre better off saying you dont know than not answer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,private email server zaire tomato tomahto
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no just people who are paid to act like it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and when the data that is chosen might possibly not include all possible data points there is no methodology to what they do so it cannot be treated as being as unbiased as possible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can you find an example of an egregiously incorrect assessment theres already an example in this thread
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im also interested in any alternatives or having multiple fact checkers to compare datasources
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,his own time and efforts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,none it might not be easy but you can just look up what these people your self and create your own opinion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the state department shows about half the refugees are women and are mes under the age of so ya hed be pretty wrong there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpsislimgeuwgjfpng
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but they can at least find a source that hasnt been supporting one candidate for the last year
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the black unemployment rate bernie said percent and got mostly true trump said percent and got mostly false
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,trumps estimate of wherever he got it from is off by according to the fbi i dont know where op got his little screencap from but before you let your mind be blown by random images you should dig a little deeper in the future trumps pants were absolutely on fire in that statement e hees the other ones too the meme said that american families work hard to earn a month obama is spending a month on each illegal immigrant child the numbers cited by the meme are rooted in reality but the comparison is framed in a misleading way the sum of money cited has been allotted to a small fraction of all undocumented immigrant children in the united states and it isnt going into their pockets as family earnings are its also unclear whether this high rate of spending has continued to today the statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression so we rate it mostly false cruz said the federal government is going after school districts trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls cruzs vision of schoolboys everywhere showering with girls grossly distorts the issue the fact is the obama administration has sided with transgender students seeking access to school facilities including locker rooms holding that anything less would violate federal antidiscrimination requirements such conflicts — few and far between — havent had to do with the government wanting boys to shower with girls we rate the claim false anyone picking these ratings by politifact out and claiming that they demonstrate liberal bias clearly has some pretty huge conservative biases of their own and they managed to convince you that they were biased rulings by distilling entire articles down to single sentences that dont tell the whole story of how the statement was judged its almost as if when you strip an analysis down to a single sentence you can make it seem as absurd as you want to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its photoshopped from
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats a meme bro dont just blindly listen to people on the internet
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre an idiot look up the data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that picture is photoshopped for example his first statement was completely wrong it says so in the real article of white homicide victims are killed by black people not he got that fake statistic from a white supremacist twitter page edit does anyone downvoting want to refute my argument
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont believe that image op is full of shit read the actual article here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,heres something something youre never gonna forget
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think rating that claim at all is kind of dumb its not really a statement of fact its as much as a statement of fact as most of the other claims politifact rates
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the best kind of true
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh good it will be easy to build a bridge to gulag when we have overthrown the bourgeoisie
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also not said by sarah palin but by tina fey on saturday night live
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well you would know liar
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think ill eat it now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but his total of pants on fire false mostly false is third least behind obama and hillary though we shouldnt take politifacts verdicts as gospel truth i would be surprised if they didnt have a proestablishment bias like nearly all mainstream media and hence may have favored hillary in the primaries over bernie edit ah politifact parent company tampa bay times months before the democratic national convention
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,being the cynical type when someone claims more than n i assume they mean
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ok but this discussion is a prime example of where politics goes wrong original question was who got to pick the statements and did they have an agenda yet here we are arguing over how many statements there were
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this data is not beautiful
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you want an example of what im talking about poltifact to this day insists that trump was literally accusing obama and clinton of founding the islamic state and rates it a pants on fire statement he was given the option to walk back the statement on hugh hewitts show and reaffirmed that he literally stood by that its absolutely valid to take him by his word on that he only walked it back later
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,tbh the statement remains bullshit because neither clinton nor obama actually started the iraq war and it was bush who negotiated the exit agreement that took the troops out of iraq
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that is a mere accusation of bias not evidence of bias you cant just dismiss a source by mere accusation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well id say most of the entries on politifact are claims which they then check to see if those claims are true or false trump certainly makes a lot of claims is all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah true statement but i think they are more likely to grade a statement they know is false when they dont like a person who made a false statement i dont care when the politician i like says a false statement as much as i care when one i dont like does its true for everyone thats the bias
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes please this graphic makes me actively angry
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cant trust canadians to be unbiased in american affairs theyre too close get some poor asshole from the falklands to do it like literally just grab some dude off the falklands and go youre going to read everything and determine how true it is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think its granted not grant it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in other words the factcheckers are only honest if others do their factchecking for them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so now every time a politician says something that happens to get rated by these impure sources that hide typical media editorializing by implying purity by using this hip term fact checking the politician has to send over a source why is it incumbent on the target of fact checking to show the fact checker where to look it seems capricious to hold them to such a low standard that a lack of provided sources to them by their specimen will excuse a completely inconsistent and arbitrary rating
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the very fact that the ratings are changed by replying to politifact should send up red flags for everyone
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont you mean granted
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which is why these statements are rated in the subjectively true and subjectively false ranges and not rated as true of falsepants on fire
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,most newspapers dont endorse any candidate because they at least pretend to be nonpartisan
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no its clinton vs johnson in endorsements
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the tampa bay times hasnt endorsed a gop candidate since
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and the newspaper that trumps son in law works at
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which one would expect to be reflected in their reporting
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theyve also endorsed democrats almost exclusively over the last years i think only one in ten was an independent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for the correction and just wow
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes the distinction was intentional because politicians will say a lot during campaigning obama was for strong whistleblower protection for instance and hillarys action paint a very different picture so she wants to do campaign finance reform yet cant see how speech fees cause a conflict of interest reversely i cannot yet judge trump on his political actions because as far as i understand he never held a political office so far but some of his words like calling climate change a chinese hoax are deeply worrying if they resulted in action
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes and almost all newspapers show a strong contrump prohillary bias many organizations doing it does not mean its any more neutral its simply a more widescale nonneutrality
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hear ya there rpolitics is a fucking cesspool
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i agree and im about as democratic as they come the numbers for the republicans on here is totally accurate but there are democrats we have liars and cheats too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this im a very liberalminded person on just about every issue but guns and its terrifying how little the democrats get called out on their shit i get that the republicans are pretty damn crazy a lot of the time but democrats act as if they can do no wrong its infuriating and why i identify as an independent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i hear ya both parties have corrupt cores and are both dominated by money people that think their party is the one true and sane choice often dont look at their own party which that same critical light i wish we could make some other political parties that have a chance i personally would love for a progressive party which would be way more populist and way less corportist then the democratic party
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you for this interesting link ive recently been wondering if maybe the very ideal of journalism or the mass distribution of facts to educate and inform the populace isnt a rather liberal idea to begin with and this accounts for the much debated liberal media bias but this seems to counter that argument perhaps the economic pressures of a changing media environment are driving out those with more selfinterested motivations versus those who would take a pay cut to serve their ideal of a common good as has been evident for years in teaching
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hillary since we last debated in las vegas nearly people have been killed by guns mostly true no data from last month lol wtf is it mostly true that people were killed if there was no data from last month is it mostly true that were killed is it mostly true that and were killed last month if there was no data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,personally i dont think anyone should be showering at school but its late and i have to say that the statement that the federal government was in any way going after school districts trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls is false for a few reasons first the federal government never used force or took any legal actions against schools or districts whos policies dont allow for a student who identifies as transgender to use their preferred gendered facilities the executive office provided a framework for public schools to better accommodate transgenderidentified students but to insinuate any use of force is definitely less than true then however you look at it school districts arent just letting boys shower with little girls period and thats completely ignoring how you personally feel about whether or not a transgenderidentified student is actually a boy or a girl or whatever you think those words mean its also ignoring the social legal academic etc consequence of a student pretending or deciding to one day claim to be transgender just to get their jimmies off its also ignoring the possibility that a transgenderidentified students peers accept that students identity and decisions to use their preferred gendered facilities its just the logistics of it maybe its not like this everywhere in the us but i have never heard of a school where students shower together before about middle school so to insinuate that an older predatory male student could somehow lie his way into a shower full of little girls just by claiming to identify as transgender might not be an outright lie but its a very passionate telling of an untruth for sure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if someone advertised the lottery as one in wins prize is its a flat out lie if someone advertised the lottery as one in wins grand prize is its a truth small words change the meanings of claims significantly the unemployment rate is not the unemployment rate of africanamerican youth referring to the unemployment rate of africanamerican youth as the broader unemployment is deceit lying about motive is lying it doesnt matter if the claim about the action is correct there is no leniency when you have an either or scenario claiming the vast majority is male while the vast majority is female is wrong it is not a minor detail it is almost as wrong as it can get unemployment is a specific term with a specific meaning and a specific number using it as an umbrella term is like calling all four sided shapes squares the same is true of terms like anyone and everyone especially when they neglect of the total population quoting studies conducted outside of the as american opinions is unarguably dishonest im not saying politifact is unbiased but these are terrible examples
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes trump is a steaming pile of lies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,playing devils advocate how often do npr and politifact differ then
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i have listened to a lot of npr and the people there are very liberal but they make the best effort they can to be as unbiased as possible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,jeb bush christie romney and mccain all seem to dispel your notion from this graph
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,bernie and trump saying almost the same thing guess who gets a mostly false
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,see this is why youre a presidential candidate and im not
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i coulda swore it was by the aleppo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what do you mean there is no methodology here is their methodology i suppose it is possible they could voluntarily choose to exclude lies by democrats and exclude truths by republicans would be great if somebody could prove theyve done that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i googled the actual politifact article because i dont really trust trump supporters on reddit this is legitimately the most misleading screencap you can pull from this the next or so paragraphs is the author thoroughly debunking the quoted claim including the fact that michigan never even that many people working with coal in the first place meanwhile according to the bureau of labor statistics the number of workers engaged in any type of mining in michigan over the last decade has varied between and making it essentially impossible to have lost existing jobs in that sector and as the washington examiner has noted michigan has fewer than people working in the electricity generation sector today
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also here is the actual article you know not parsed or selective cut the number refers to potential jobs lost not actual jobs lost this is an important point that would not be obvious from the way trump phrased his statement by leaving the impression that these were actual jobs lost trumps statistic invites a degree of outrage that isnt warranted
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just because michigan didnt go through with projects that could have led to jobs doesnt mean its due to clinton and obamas war on coal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,doc about the pot calling the kettle black the section of the article you picked was written by the national mining association published on sept and in no way actual statistics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you realize that would be a lot more biased right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in that first example trump is still lying trump says the unemployment rate for black youths is percent in may the unemployment rate for blacks ages to was percent or less than onethird of trumps claim in the second example the number refers to potential jobs losses not actual jobs losses and the third quote doesnt even come from politifact its not anywhere on their page the author of that image just made it up here is what politifact really said many would understand it as calendar year and by this metric trump is wrong however customs and border protection reports apprehension data by fiscal year and by that measure he has a point on balance we rate this claim half true why dont you just link to the actual articles instead of posting memes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,half true lmao
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well for the first sanders is only slightly off with a mostly true while trump is way off so he got pants on fire makes perfect sense its not a passfail binary rating system obviously second one only part of the article if you read the whole thing like you are supposed to pants on fire because it was potential jobs not actual jobs that had people currently employed third again read the article there are two ways to interpret the data — by calendar year january to december and by fiscal year october to september and that makes all the difference by calendar year the way most people would interpret trumps comment hes wrong but by fiscal year hes right cbps has apprehended family members from january to june records show in all of cbp apprehended more family members if hes reading by fiscal year as cbp reports it then the numbers support his statement in fiscal year oct there were apprehensions so far from oct through june there have been a total of apprehensions hence the half true all the evidence i have seen that politifact is bias is flimsy at best if whats in this reddit thread are the strongest since i have seen them elsewhere your stance is extremely weak
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah that would be better
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,woo just got done with some digging to find these but theres actually a reason the difference maker here is in the lack of communication and the differing terminology bernie sanders was not speaking to statistical unemployment but instead a term he used call real unemployment i would say mostly true might be a bit of a stretch but given his use of different terminology he was trying to discuss the issue in a different context the trump campaign did not respond to request for additional information at that point politifact was left to analyze based on literal translation its possible trump meant something similar to bernie but he did not provide a reference when requested in that case he might have earned a similar rating as bernie but the difference is important by saying unemployment instead of the bureaus he vastly overstates the amount of african americans seeking employment his statement was weighed against what was said i dont really see a bias in this situation unless you weigh it without context do you have something else
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the numbers cited by the meme are rooted in reality but the comparison is framed in a misleading way that sounds suspiciously like beating around the bush their numbers are right but we dont like how theyre presenting them pants on fire
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,both of those are true they just didnt like the tone neither lied you may not like thier world view but when they are factually describing a situation you dont get to call them liars because you disagree with how they frame true statements you can call them misleading though i would disagree but misleading isnt the same thing as lying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its become true in our mass consciousness because tina fey is fucking amazing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it was said by palin it is also true what a surprise a governor of a state knows a little known fun fact about the state fey changed it to i can see russia from my house which palin never said and also isnt true palin wasnt exactly the sharpest tool in the shed but the whole media ridicule about russia was just sad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,edit ah politifact parent company tampa bay times endorsed hillary in february months before the democratic national convention editorial board choices in endorsements are separate from reporters work
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the etc of the math world
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politifact did its the first word in the graphs description
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah zerohedge what a wonderful source
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,was about to say this too when asked to clarify trump doubled down and said they literally founded isis
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,trump certainly makes a lot of claims is all clinton had however statements while trump had
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politifact will try and grade all statements made during debates press conferences and ones people request to be graded
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but i think they are more likely to grade a statement they know is false when they dont like a person who made a false statement and on what are based your thought did you been in touch with them here we want data we want chart we want fact we want dots and pies s
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i thought it was granite rock solid
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean freshmen in college are expected to cite their sources so yes sanders said young people who have graduated high school or dropped out of high school between the ages of and and then when asked for his source provided it and it looks like trump said only unemployment rate and then when asked provided no source for his number whereas the only source for the broadly defined unemployment rate politifact could find contradicted him perhaps trump earlier in this particular speech gave a more specific definition of unemployment perhaps the definition sanders gave is deceptively narrow perhaps politifact should have tried harder to find a study which corroborated the number trump gave and perhaps politifact is biased for not making these particular nuances abundantly clear is that what youre arguing or are you arguing that politicians should be able to speak broadly in vaguely defined terms and cite a very specific statistical number without saying where they got that number like im not gonna fact check any of this i have things to do beds to sleep in etc im mostly speaking hypothetically here id love it if politicians were held to rigorous standards whenever they make claims but most people in their country are like me and are hoping someone else will hold them to those standards cest la vie i guess
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i disagree citing a reliable source gives credibility even if that source had unintentionally faltered on accuracy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this should be way higher up
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im in agreement with you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a shame there isnt a place on reddit anymore to openly discuss politics every political sub is now modabused to favor one candidate and of course the admins are too lazy and inept to do anything about it let alone do anything about massive massive vote manipulation by various forces i still cant believe that even talking about ctr will get you a ban in rpolitics it blows my mind hey yeah there was a huge news story about vote and opinion manipulation in this sub but not only are we going to pretend like it doesnt exist anyone that talks about it is banned thatll solve it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there are democrats because there were many more gop candidates than democratic candidates this year and the democrats other than hillary and bernie all dropped out early enough that i doubt they even got to statements adding biden and obama was actually to increase the number of democrats in the chart even though theyre not running
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,issue is not just that theres only four dem politicians on the list its that they receive basically anything said by a democratic politician in good faith there are very very different levels of scrutiny
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so youre telling me that hillary doesnt lie
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im sure that is part of it but it is probably reinforced by the culture surrounding the job idk much about journalism but i know teachers are exposed to far left for america ideas in college and are basically told that it is part of their job to be promote progressive ideals
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i can say its mostly true albeit entirely misleading that people have died from firearms since the vegas rally last month theres roughly deaths a year so that would be a month theres no data for last month because fbi crime statistics are always a year or two behind what is left out are the causes of those deaths twothirds of firearm deaths are suicides the rest is a mix of homicides accidents and lawful killings by leos in the line of duty or people in self defense
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no they rated it halftrue they found that was only an extrapolation from last years gun violence stats from the cdc averaged over time we found a few problems with her statement first we dont actually know how many people have died in the last month clintons statement is based on data from the cdc which tallied nearly gun deaths per month that year theres not more recent data available experts say the number of gun deaths this year is likely to be similar to or higher than so clintons claim is probably not too far off but we cant know for sure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres a thing called sample size people really need to get their heads around the smaller the sample size the more likely there will be any significant deviation from the mean for example it is relativity likely you will flip heads or tails out of however it is extremely rare to flip heads or tails and astronomically rare to flip heads or tails you can apply this logic in reverse too if you have an extremely large sample size and you know the approximate odds you can make an extremely accurate prediction because of this if clinton knows that statistically speaking there would be people killed there almost certainly was killed in fact unless something drastic changed like pearl harbor sized event these numbers will hold true and by all means you can go and verify them now if we have another pulse shooting the worst in a century it goes up it would take pulsesized events to even change her prediction
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,doesnt matter the question is was the statement factual or not his statement was factual even if they view it differently if i said drinking too much water can kill you you cant claim thats a false statement water poisoning does exist is it highly unlikely to ever happen to you yes does it misrepresent water as dangerous yes but it was a factual statement whether or not youre for or against trans rights is your decision whether or not his statement was factual should not reflect someone elses opinion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,unfortunately npr did a terrible fact checking of the debate heck in some places it is blatant opinion by the writers with no facts at all kinda dispelled the notion that they are able to be unbiased
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when it came to the democratic primaries they were biased for hillary i recall how little air time they gave to sanders despite sanders polling well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,their npr politics podcast is a little biased it sucks because they used to run its all politics and it was super balanced sometimes i wonder if thats why it went away
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im a bit of a right winger and i listen to npr all the time they do some really good reporting and they always seem to cover stuff that wouldnt be covered else wise
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,bernie said unemployed and underemployed trump just said unemployed thats where the difference is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if by almost the same thing you mean two different things sanders was talking about real unemployment rate which is different from trumps unemployment rate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,brilliant username
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but it isnt even a screencap they literally edited the image to only include those sections put together whoever made that picture definitely knew what they were doing it literally says that the press release was the one who made that claim that literally means the person who made that screengrab was literally using another press release to verify that press release that is a level of mindfuck i cant even comprehend
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah those jobs are about as real as someone coming out and saying theyd employ a million hookers if prostitution was only legal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i cant help but notice a bunch of trump supporters on here sharing these images out of context its almost like they have an agenda or something
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre arguing the intricate details that nobody cares about they just look at the meter everything is reduced to one dimensions so why did you give bernie the benefit of the doubt let me ask you does any of the detail matter when its aggregated into the graphic in the top data when presented like that is designed to erase any discussion nobody outside of this sub would drill down and look at each individual point
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not a trump supporter here the most egregious error for me is their claim that trump mocked person for his disability is their article on this to their credit just lays out the details and lets you think about it since you probably think this is true let me make the case against it go watch the speech asking yourself if you didnt know who the reporter was at the time would you think at any moment trump was insulting a persons disability its fairly obvious you would think this is just gestures of panic so at the least youd have to admit it wasnt a handicap joke for the benefit of the audience the argument on trump insulting kirks disability depends on whether trump knew the reporter politifact just points out that theyve met at some point in the past and then assumes trump is lying here what are the actual details of their meeting kirk had met with trump about twice a year from to mind you trump hasnt seen him since trump talks with of new people a year honestly you would have to believe trump has a razor sharp memory to claim that trump remembers this guy in particular which doesnt sound like trump id like to emphasize up to this point trump hasnt seen kirk for years even though in the speech trump says you should have seen this guy and then does the hand motions all these discussions calling kirk out were done in text by reporters covering the issues it wasnt a direct inperson conversation trump is a kind of bad reporter of these details simply put you have to assume trump is both inwardly malicious at heart rather than merely egotistical and has a powerful memory to believe he made fun of kirks disability but one of the main reasons people claim trump is malicious is this claim about mocking a disability which is begging the question this false claim irks me considerably because almost everyone believes it in spite of the immense skepticism of the media politifact dropped the ball here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think you missed the point here itd be more fair to consider all the ways the federal government pays for children of us citizens such as education food stamps etc as it stands these numbers really arent related so the comparison is incoherent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think its more like the numbers are right but they arent really relevant to each other so theres really no argument to be made by comparing them so a mostly false rating seems fair to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yea you cant justify validity of a fact by your own interpretation on data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a month on each illegal immigrant child if what politifact claims is true that its a small fraction of undocumented children then the number is not correct i personally dont know if it is all children or just some but my personal opinion is that it would be unlikely that they are spending per year per child i suggest you read the article and form your opinion from there rather than the one paragraph the redditor summed it up in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but she said that in response to the question about what foreign policy experience she has
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,totally agree if they were writing unsourced articles with twisted logic to make one candidate look good then you could make the case for undue influence but what im seeing in this thread is people using a quick way for people to dismiss results they dont agree with without having to do any actual work the only evidence people have shown is contrast between trump and sanders making claims about black unemployment rates which is actually explained in the respective articles sanders provided a credible source that used an alternative methodology for determining unemployment trump provided no source
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was mostly taken aback by the obama quote obama has said that women earn less than men for the same work that is absolutely pants on fire false
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i saw that posted in this thread and i dont buy that the comparisons being made in that image are fair with only the ratings and not the articles or even the dates its impossible to know why the statements were graded differently because politifact explains why their rating was given in the articles its entirely possible that the person who made that image just found similar phrases and some of them arent so similar how is the very first one between obama and ted cruz even about the same issue obama is talking about the gender wage gap while cruz is talking about letting little boys shower with little girls how is hillarys statement about gun violence comparable to carly fiorinas about refugees the person who made this image just picked vaguely similar statements sometimes not even similar and slapped them into a list with some commentary up top this isnt convincing at all at best even if these were a good comparison this is an example of cherrypicking but theyre not a good comparison and there isnt enough information in the image alone to gauge whether the ratings were fair
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its almost as if theres nuance beyond the oneliner that they explain in entire articles about these statements that give context to the statement and the known information about it carlys statement about refugees for example is just completely untrue since the vast majority are absolutely not ablebodied men the un numbers they cite in the article show that the genders are pretty even though there are more women by like a percent or two but most of the men are children under only about of the refugees are men over the age of so in what world does constitute a vast majority also why have the editors and contributors to the site shown above if you want to argue theyre biased showing their photo and their title has nothing to do with that unless one of them is literally chairman of the dnc or some shit how does showing a photo of linda qiu and telling me shes a staff writer show bias it has no place here or in the discourse about their content unless its actually relevant and i see no way in which it is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,somewhat true there is for sure a bias though there are tons of statements i believe were false in the debate that werent graded given by both candidates i only see a few graded
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did you been in touch with them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think you make some great points i think however although this is not the point i am arguing that this default definition of unemployment that is super narrow is not necessarily exclusive to the point of absolutely needing a modifier to broaden its scope i would say unemployment is to software as unemployment and labor participation and so on is to idk business software one is a subset of the other or at least one could claim to have intended the broader definition particularly when a number does back it up that makes it all the more credible of a claim as for my argument on sources please read my response to indesertum below id like to know if you find it convincing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres a big obvious difference between someone writing an academic paper including a source with the paper and someone being expected to mail their sources to every random political analysis website after they say anything
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,isnt it the fact checkers job to find those credible sources and compare them to the statement
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly man its unbelievable how quietly people have accepted the suppression on that subreddit it seemingly happened overnight being able to talk freely about the candidates versus being instantly buried if you even mention clintons name without immediately following it with praise it makes me feel like i am going a little crazy why do more people not care about something that is seriously going to completely undermine our democracy practices like ctr are only going to get worse and become more standard as time goes on especially seeing as how they have been extremely successful in their efforts this year
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well that and it says these are entries from as far back as same reason mccain palin romney and ryan are all up there despite none of them running this year
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just to the fbi lmao
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they rated trump as pants on fire when he said crime is going up because the fbis crime statistics only indicated that crime had been going up for at least a year but previous years had been going down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,after listening to other news channels npr is like a breath of fresh air
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the thing about npr journalists is regardless of their own personal biases they try not to indulge agendas in the propagandaheavy environment of todays american journalism theyre a breath of fresh air
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it is npr not wpr the rest of the world is not really relevant in this situation and saying that the civilized world pretty much just entails europe is kind of lame other parts of the world other than the us and europe are civilized
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all things considered i feel like the only one that caught this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that is a level of mindfuck i cant even comprehend welcome to the world of trump supporters buckle up
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats not foreign policy experience
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well if they are to be taken seriously yes it is beholden the fact checker to actually do the fact checking if it becomes apparent that they arent performing that task in a level way then the standard they purport to bear isnt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no its the politicians his campaigns job to proof it they are making the statement if you claim something proof it else i can claim that on of wednesday nights cows will become rampant and kill red haired people if they dont happen to wear glasses just because you dont find a source claiming thats bullshit doesnt mean its true
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think their analysis of politics is on point
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is this pun intentional im genuinely curious
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and the screaming yelling namecalling is nearly nonexistent most media nowadays is an assault in your senses i want sensory overload when im being entertained not while attempting to learn about current events
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nz first last i saw they were third in polls and they are pretty right in terms of immigration
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i doubt that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly the point
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats a shame to hear because when i was in college and less weary to debate politics i used them repeatedly as a source during those debates i remember them being thorough and diligent in responding to my own few requests
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seeing that most of the lies are from republicans i say there is a bias i strongly believe both sides lie equally in quantity i put lie in quotes because i believe some dont do it on purpose they were just wrong about an issue or the facts regarding that issue
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so i can make a website gain fake credibility then just accuse everyone of lying all the time and its the politicians responsibility to contact me to have me change my website
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,come on do you really car guys
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all things considered this american life has become so polarized its ridiculous ask me another
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what pun
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lol not that hard democrats are pretty right wing by my countrys standards as well and super religious to which is weird as fuck for a party pretending to be liberal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but the data presented seems to indicate otherwise so is the data wrong or your belief in the equal amount of lies i think they go with the most prominent statements made but who knows its hard to grade every statement i dont think that the politifact has a big agenda though i trust their pulitzer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just because you believe that both sides lie an equal amount doesnt make it true from everything that i have seen major republican figures as as group lie more than major democrat ones no matter what you believe that is what the numbers say
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think youre correlating honestysincerity with lying which is falical trump bachman and gringich lie conspicuously and unintellengently whereas hilary and obama are more reserved when speaking they are very careful to only state facts they know are true and hilary especially ducks and diverts questions to avoid direct lies i dont think right lies more than left or vice versa but the current right wing figure heads without a doubt make more objectively wrong statements than their opposition
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ummm you think the results are biased because you strongly believe all politicians lie equally
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is only for their determination between mostly true and mostly false there is a fine line that they made between the two verdicts mostly true meaning someone made a mistake while explaining and mostly false as someone whose numbers dont make sense they do research themselves but they give the politicians a chance for a rebuttal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all things considered and fresh air are two of nprs biggest shows
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,try telling that to a blue dog democrat and theyll tell you that you are wrong they think that their center ideologies are liberal its kind of funny and sad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,democrats are hardly super religious if it werent for their need to appeal to religious moderates during the campaign season you wouldnt be able to tell that most of them werent atheist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i dont think its an obvious or prominent agenda like i said earlier i think its just that they are more likely to grade a statement from someone they dislike when they know its false i dont think the data is wrong i belief that most of their grades are correct i also think that if they were non biased the grades would be equal on lies for the parties a lie i can remember is my tax plan lowers taxes for the majority from clinton if youve read both tax plans thats false however i still believe she is better so i may not call her on it does that make sens
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i agree with all your points except the last paragraph only because i dont understand the pointstatment my only point was i do believe difficult to prove sure that its somewhat biased due to the overwhelming results and differences between parties there are things i hate about republicans but lying more than dems is not one of them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well that and their parent company has donated a lot of money to clinton and they themselves have endorsed her i would say that would be evidence of bias i dont know about it being scientific evidence though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not in the us but i think the amount of lies someone tells does not correlate to their honesty its not just swerving the questions though its the risk factor of the lie you can tell a small lie and it have no impact humans do it every day for example mr trump your hair looks great today versus serious lies like im running for president and my morals have never been conflicted by money or pressure groups
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sooo wouldnt it solve like a lot of problems with buying influence if they just banned lobbying and forced campaign contributions to be anonymous or another option all you need to run for office is a certain number of signatures and each qualified candidate receives a small campaign budget from the government seems to me that campaign contributions are the equivalent of bribery
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is purposefully misleading the the second highest recipient of donations from telecom is greg walden ror and frank pallone dnj steve scalise the highest in the data is actually the highest recipient john shimkus in the data is actually the highest recipient this is misleading shoot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yet we have another thread in here showing that its almost equal in terms of contributions to people in congress
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my question is how does this compare to other bills i would expect that those who got higher donations would also be more likely to be cosponsers on average
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thatd probably be the best move unfortunately i have no idea how wed implement that since the people responsible for doing so are the ones befitting from the current system
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if they just banned lobbying first just so we are on the same page define lobbying all you need to run for office is a certain number of signatures and each qualified candidate receives a small campaign budget from the government would that stop me from throwing a promyfavoritecongresscritter party at my house what about if i have a lot of friends so i do it at the local hotelconvention center
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,campaign reform we need
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would also add another option limit all none congressmen terms locked to years no more it would make it too hard to just buy off someone like john mccain always votes yes on military spending thanks to his massive bribes he gets from defense contractors when a new face is constantly being brought in i like a combination of all three though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,another great approach is to revoke the so called sunshine laws and make politicians votes anonymous just like any other citizen it seems counter intuitive but the reason your vote is private is the exact same reason theirs should be when your vote is public it opens you up to all kinds of bullying and bribery did you know you used to receive a receipt for your vote but politicians and other interested parties started offering bounties for vote receipts for their candidates so you had a ton of ambivalent and mostly poor men presuffrage voting for money sound familiar if your senators vote is private you may feel love you dont know if theyre standing up for you but a home attempting to bribe them also doesnt know if theyre getting their moneys worth
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the other post about this topic is misleading as well these practices are a slap in the face to the spirit of science and exist just to provoke outrage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,agreed the average is way low as well according to the average across all senators is so the nonsponsor average of seems quite low
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,would that stop me from throwing a promyfavoritecongresscritter party at my house heres something i never seem to get any time people start talking about restricting lobbying someone always brings up stuff like this isnt there a huge difference between hosting a convention in support of a candidate and literally giving a congressman hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for their vote on an issue
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,define lobbying people whose job it is to speak to politicians on behalf of corporations or private interests to promote their agendas would that stop me from throwing a promyfavoritecongresscritter party at my house what about if i have a lot of friends so i do it at the local hotelconvention center probably not but it would also allow someone who isnt already rich to just canvass neighborhoods to get enough signatures to run currently afaik you need x numbers of signatures and y dollars in order to run for office remove the financial requirement and people who actually understand the middlelower classes might have a chance to influence policy as opposed to these silverspoon motherfuckers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but then we dont who not to vote for
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i assume you are comparing a legal activity with an presumably illegal activity when people say they want to stop lobbying this is what they are thinking about they think about the huge mega corp dropping millions in gifts and donations into the pockets of key politicians thats obviously a problem what they are missing is all the other acts of lobbying that kind of change could stop if the change is not very carefully considered and designed listing various other forms of lobbying tends to get them to think the problem through it isnt nearly as easy as just saying stop lobbying its far more complex than that for example if im a doctor and i wanted to throw a party for my favorite politician and i want to invite my closest doctor friends so we can talk about health care reform any reason i shouldnt be allowed to rent out a large venue and then have someone cater the event maybe have a band for entertainment and book a couple of experts in the field to give speeches we could easily spend putting something like that together would that be illegal now what if it was two events at each with two different but related sponsors like husband and wife what if they are just good friends and its events at what point do you restrict someones ability to interact with politicians and how much damage could that do compared to what you perceive to be the benefit i agree that tossing a suitcase full of bills in the guy trunk should be illegal and already is but how do you construct a law that restricts the activity you want to stop but doesnt stop the million mom march or the next big grass roots movement from having their message heard
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people whose job it is to speak to politicians on behalf of corporations or private interests to promote their agendas that will run afoul of why would you want to kill the aclus ability to lobby for changes to the death penalty why would you want to kill the nras ability to lobby on behalf of its millions of members why would you want to kill planned parenthoods ability to lobby for womens reproductive rights why would you want to stop the us chamber of commerce from lobbying on behalf of all the small businesses around the country why should exxon not get a say when it comes to energy policy why should microsoft or apple not have a say in the nations cyber security policy every one of those organizations are owned by staffed by and supported by citizens their ability to pool their resources toward a shared goal is critical to making those goals a reality why would you want to take that away remove the financial requirement or you know allow them to pool their resources to lobby for the cause they feel is important
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so ill take a pr job and just not tell whatever regulatory body you come up with that the p actually stands for politician overly simple sure but any legislation will have loopholes ensuring it will hit smaller groups disproportionately harder than the entrenched establishment lobbying is essential for democracy like it or hate it its necessary
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hows that working right now sure you do these people arent exactly quiet about their personal philosophy at the end of the day you have to accept that you dont have that much control over your representatives no matter who they are and i think its better to cultivate a political system where ethical behavior is not actually a handicap and then assume that without any incentive to be corrupt because the money isnt there we will at worst have ideologues and hopefully actual patriots
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,were literally in a thread about how telecoms are paying legislators to vote the way they want and youre telling me that this is illegal stop trying to confuse the point by talking about people hosting private events someone holding an event in support of a candidate has absolutely nothing to do with people giving money to legislators to make them vote the way they want
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,imo the corruption surrounding the political contribution system and lobbying causes far more harm than the good that comes from lobbying by good causes alternatively lobbying should have to be done publicly if a special interest group has something to say they should say it where everyone can hear it not behind closed doors or on the golf course
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lobbying allows vocal ie rich minorities to determine the legal framework of the country that is not healthy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,like i said in another comment at the very least they should make it illegal to lobby behind closed doors if a special interest group has an agenda they want to push ti should be done publicly where everyone can know what is being asked of the politicians
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think that is the cause of the problem but it contributes to it it does not mean that your method will work
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you are apparently not only misunderstanding the article and how politics works but also what i am trying to say sorry to have wasted your time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,imo the corruption surrounding the political contribution system and lobbying i agree that there is a lot of corruption but historically speaking it has always been that way its human nature lobbying by good causes just because you disagree with a cause doesnt make it bad alternatively lobbying should have to be done publicly if a special interest group has something to say they should say it where everyone can hear it not behind closed doors or on the golf course there is absolutely no way to enforce that and i really dont see the value because anything nefarious will still be done on the down low they already have to report all gifts and donations and even that is pretty easy to get around the reality is that unless you are willing to throw the baby out with the bath water you cant just stop lobbying i want to be able to lobby my government official so should you my local business organizations and my doctor want the same thing i might not agree with what they are lobbying for but damn it they have the right just as i do how else will politicians be able to find out what the population is needing or wanting do you want them governing in a black hole of ignorance or should they be able to listen to different sides of the issue before making decisions the sad reality is that if i couldnt support the lobbying organization of my choice my opinions would not be heard because it is an expensive and time consuming proposition pooling resources and getting a person that knows what they are doing is the most efficient way to handle it otherwise im just one of millions of letters and phone calls they cant address every year
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats an interesting view assuming you agree with the above definition of lobbying can you tell me what your solution is if you dont agree with the definition can you define it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is not a new concept or a new counter argument watch the video please that guy can cover your concerns way better than i can
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,very enlightening thanks for that i now fully understand how hosting a party where we all say how great trump is is precisely identical to writing trump a cheque for million
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,feedback should be petition based but is not required a politician is a representative the people who vote them in should be relatively sure that their stances will be well represented by a given candidate even in the complete absence of feedback
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am not saying that it is a bad idea i see the merits of it and some of it makes sense but we lose some transparency in doing so i would like to know if the person who is representing me is actually doing so instead of guessing and hoping they are doing right i mean they can say what they believe receive money from lobbyists and vote differently behind the shadows of anonymous voting i just dont trust them enough
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,like i said sorry to waste your time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what do you mean by petition based
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,literally every point is discussed in that video im not gonna play parrot just so you can argue with me if youre actually interested in the counter argument for your absolutely valid points please watch the video i linked
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,like online voting only available to registered voters in the statedistrict
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sure thing boss
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so we should not allow people to write letters to their congressman a form or lobbying we should stop demonstrations outside the supreme court also a form of lobbying we shouldnt allow people to show up at town halls and speak to their senators a form or lobbying the million woman march shall be canceled this year cant dare let all those rich people gather on the mall an unduly influence the legislature now can we nobody should be allowed to write a letter to the editor a form of lobbying well just ban all forms of indirect lobbying too right no more political discussions and organizing on social media ctr and td can just fuck right off eh no more voter drives around particular topics right get out the vote go home the nea can no longer talk politics at rallies also indirect lobbying distribute literature to its members or send cogent well thought out briefs to congress to inform them on education related issues serves all those rich teachers right cant have that kind of lobbying either the aarp might as well close their doors since we cant have them lobbying for the elderly and the retired the national assn of realtors cant help congress understand current problems and issues with housing and other real estate that would be really bad cair darn well better not lobby congress on behalf of all those rich muslim immigrants from syria that would be wrong wouldnt it well just do it all with online petitions for registered voters only i think you havent thought this through
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you shouldnt bait peoples opinions in an innocent tone only to turn around and freak out at them it isnt productive
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,asking for clarification before responding to a post isnt baiting i made no attempt to mislead you in fact i believe it would have been unfair to respond before getting you to clarify im sorry if i offended you back to the topic what are your thoughts if you disagree with me can you explain why
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im really only against undue influence of money because it is a very poor indicator of policy popularity what id like is a datadriven popularity system so that a politician can have nearly instant feedback on their stance it would have a sort of postsocialnetworking feel to it upvotes midvotes important but no particular opinion downvotes but no social interaction aside from the ability to post new topics bills on the voting block would be stickied then you could clearly tell when a politician voted against their constituency ie crossing party lines and also against the popular opinion or with it and to what extent i guess that data might already exist maybe even in collated form the real problem is the money
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im really only against undue influence of money i think most people would completely agree with that the problem is how to fix it without shutting down the democratic process and running into major issues the reality is that money has always been a major problem in politics this is nothing new also against the popular opinion this is where we might disagree i dont believe their job is to reflect popular opinion popular opinion plays a part but their job is to educate themselves and take all the facts into account and then vote in the best interests of the people they represent many times that could very well mean they are voting against popular opinion and i dont have a problem with that granted thats an idealized vision that probably doesnt really play out as often as wed like to believe the reality is that most people dont have the knowledge or time to be educated enough on individual issues to form a proper opinion thats why we are a representative democracy rather than a direct democracy we expect our representatives to represent our best interests to the best of his ability
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its hard to argue that we are even a representative democracy with shit like this browsing history bill how unpopular must that be i cant imagine a single sane person being even neutral on that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that was a sad reflection of how corrupt politicians can be there is no defending it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i thinks whats worse is that it will have to get a lot worse than this for change to occur
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it has always been like this we are just a little more aware because of improvements in communication i dont think any significant change will come for a generation or more

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a continent is so big that you can fit several countries inside of it shocking
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this article is somewhat misleading it is true that the transverse mercator distorts area and thus makes africa appear smaller on a map but it is unlikely that this was done out of prejudice on a global scale humans care about how far things are away from each other trade concerns itself less with how large a locations is and more with how long it will take to get there the transverse mercator has high line distance fidelity on a global scale and it is this reason the transverse mercator is pervasive this article highlights the gallpeters projection and uses it to somehow illustrate a perceived injustice although i would not argue that huge injustices concerning developing nations in africa exist it is unlikely that the wide use of the transverse mercator is a byproduct of this injustice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this map has a strange definition of eastern and western europe
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,these posts about the true size of africa have always puzzled me admittedly i have always been into geography but is it really shocking to find out that a huge continent like africa can fit so many large countries edit its probably more interesting to note how tiny is greenland a fraction of south america
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,twl madagascar is the japan of africa i sure wish they would produce a bunch of cars and cool electronics and export them to us like japan does though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i agree with your statement re mercator projections this is great viz because we understand sizes in relation to other things by fitting other large nations in africa it really drives home the point about the size of africa

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i have always said that the best thing the government can do for the people is to rebalance the electoral college if they want to go further they should force the states to divide their electoral votes do align with the voting results of their state
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would be interested in seeing this map with gradient colors it takes a thorough reading to compare the differences with flat colors
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all the numbers aggregated should give i am too lazy plus sitting in a shaking bus sorry
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,gives new meaning to some are more equal than others when i hear land of the free and home of the brave i thinksure within about a factor of three or so freeish compared to maybe china for now though headed in the wrong direction for those interested in the populationweighted electoral map
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why be fair when you can just gerrymander and always win s
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats not going to happen with current congress because electoral college benefits republicans
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think your map could use a little explanation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not going to happen with any congress because the democrats would keep it for the same reason if they win and its currently benefiting them and lord knows they wont work together on anything
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not a dib its a graphic from an article they weighted the shape and size of the state by its relative electorate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it gives more weight to rural areas that are more red than blue so it doesnt just benefit whoever is in power
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ok got it i agree its not a dib without state lines its hard to get more than a regional understanding
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,post removed for not containing a data visualization
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hi fasnoosh did you make this visualization by yourself
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i didnt and did not tag as oc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there is no constitutional right to be equal in wealth in the us equality is protected as natural rights not wealth
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also put on the graph the amount of government regulation over time i bet you it will coincide for some wired reason people look at data like this and actually think to themselves that we need to make more government rules to correct this not less
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what is the difference if we are really equal in all things then all things would be equal relational
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,constitutionally speaking you only have a right to equal opportunity not outcome there is no way to make everyone equally able to learn understand make good decisions and earn the same amount of money people have different priorities beliefs desires and cultures to make them all equal in outcome or wealth would be impossible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what you say is true in a static sense pardon me if this is not what you meant to say but if you look at how this visualization shows things have changed over time you seem to be saying that people in the bottom have dramatically lost their ability to learn understand and make good decisions since to me this change is much more likely to reflect the influence of something else regulations automation globalization etc in any case to me it would be good to minimize the disparity
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it could be their culture beliefs or priorities have changed since then also you shouldnt make assumptions based completely on wealth or its distribution
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,none of these is my city very misleading title very misleading indeed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,using gtfs data sourced from httpstransitfeedscom python and matplotlib i was able to create a script to generate a frequent transit map for the transit agencies of the biggest metropolitan areas in the united states the darker the line the more frequent transit on that particular route is the darkest routes have service running every ten minutes or better from to throughout the week i wrote a blog post writing about the code in detail
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dallas the growth of our city cannot handle not having mass transit but there is hardly any way to expand the rails anymore were screwed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,quite a bit of the photos have data errors in the title is that intentional
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the descriptions contain any errors with datasets encountered when trying to load the public gtfs feeds ideally it wouldve had all transit within miles of the metro area center but the datasets did not always allow for this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,philly rocks best city ever
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,visualized in tableau data from
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there is a data error on the site involving one county ventura co specifically they forgot to include a zero the population in the data table states ventura cos population as while in fact it is this is especially funny because there are four cities within ventura co oxnard thousand oaks simi valley and ventura that all have a larger population than the data table suggests as a result the mercator and anamorphic maps are both incorrect on the mercator santa barbara and ventura counties should switch colors ventura needs the orange and santa barbara needs the light yellow as for the anamorphic ventura should by bulging into santa barbara strangely enough the compare heatmap by all uscounties actually has it correct with ventura and kern counties being relatively equal otherwise these are interesting maps
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for those that are curious the righthand version of california is made through what is known as a httpswwwgisloungecomareacartogramsexplored they are a great way to see maps the best example i can give of a contiguous cartogram is of the campaign spending during the in particular shows how much spending is concentrated in a few states which were usually swing states
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im trying to imagine minimum wage for flipping burgers at mcdonalds and i cant thats ridiculous you generally make starting framing a house or working as an apprentice might as well flip burgers the rest of youre life im aware minimum wage is the minimum living wage but seriously if im in high school making working at tim hortons im laughing to the bank
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,mmm cant wait for inflation to kick in gonna be a fuking blast
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont know about you but id feel much more accomplished if i was starting in a trade at an hour than i would flipping burgers plus you know the mcdonalds pay is never going to change where as as long as your decent at what you do in a trade you know your going to get pay raises based on your performance also i dont know anyone who is laughing all the way to the bank at an hour that is only around a year before taxes if you work full time the high school student at tim hortons would probably only be working hours a week at most i agree an hour may be too high but i do believe this is an issue that needs to be addressed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont forget its in dollars also california is a very expensive place to live

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this image is a remade version of original graph created by myself this is a similar version but with many minor fixes to errors a different layout and includes the system also the original was not toscale a big thanks to for the massive help with the proper proportions on this new version the source for all the information was openexoplanetcataloguecom and i created it using photoshop
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,with correct planet and star proportions while technically correct is a bit misleading the stars have one scale the planets have a different scale about a factor between them a different scale for gliese and trappist is confusing especially as blowing gliese up so much was not necessary and i dont understand the legend for the distance scales semimajor axis of what
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hey im the guy who made the template for usctester to work their artsy magic with the semimajor axis length for most systems is scaled to au for gliese and trappist the scale is au these got left off but i let usctester know so they can amend future copies of the image there was no way to make the whole thing to the same scale but i wanted to try so people could compare as much as possible between the systems with one image the best you can do is set separate scales for the vastly different distances involved with planet sizes star sizes and semimajor axes eg you can compare star sizes to other star sizes but you cant compare star sizes to planet sizes the scales themselves were chosen mostly to make things all fit on the page and so that planets didnt overlap this process took a little trial and error but worked out fine for most systems except trappist and gliese trappist is just tiny because the planets orbit a very small star the issue with gliese was that the planets were so large that they overlapped significantly and i couldnt make the planets much smaller without the smaller planets disappearing entirely i could have made a separate scale for gliese but i wanted as few scales as possible while still including trappist so i just used the same scale for gliese as i used for trappist i could have just removed gliese but i wanted to keep all the systems usctester included in their original graphic edit i had to make some additional assumptions as well most of these planets did not have a radius listed so i had to improvise i plotted radius vs mass for the planets of our solar system and found a power law fit to be the best trendline i used that equation and the masses of the exoplanets far easier to determine so all planets had values to get an estimate of their radius not perfect but as close as i could get with current data is my comment with full explanation and the original template provided
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,trappist would be very compact sure but the system is compact why not showing that i think overlapping planets for gliese would be better than changing the scale and making that information really hard to find planets with a mass larger than jupiter are typically jupitersized as well unless they are very hot the gliese planet size is too large
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,planets with a mass larger than jupiter are typically jupitersized as well unless they are very hot most definitely brown dwarfs are not much larger than jupiter despite being dozens of times more massive i mostly didnt want to make special exceptions to my equation trying to limit the number of assumptions i made if i used the same scale for gliese the furthest star would have been about inches from the star and the largest star was inches in diameter which heavily obscured the ability to extract information from the graph easily
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you know your equation is really wrong for those masses and you use it anyway i dont see the problem with the planets close to the star changing the scale makes it much harder to extract information in general even worse it leads to viewers extracting wrong information
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i didnt want to freewheel anything if you have an appropriate equation that factors in the upper bound on size im all ears i didnt make any design decisions to separate those two systems you need to disrupt the order in terms of distance from earth personally id do away with the ordering by distance from earth and put a clear divider between the systems with different scales half of the star and most of all the remaining planets in gliese were contained within the largest planet all i can tell you is i tried to make it work with the same scale as the others and it just looked like shit and invited more misconceptions than what i settled on
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you have an appropriate equation that factors in the upper bound on size im all ears jupiter as upper size limit would give a much more accurate description already it also reduces the overlap issue with gliese the system has very large planets with small separations why hiding this fact
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did we hug it too hard the site loads for me but the map never does
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,housing costs are about construction costs this is because supply is artificially constricted ill also add that building cost increase only linearly up to storiesie cost of floor is same as floor best bang for buck would be a bunch of story buildingswhich if done would lower renthouse cost by or so ie rent cost of construction profit margin for builders housings costs are almost the result of protectionist housing policy in the form of restrictive zoning laws the poor and young are the main losers of thisold home owners are beneficiaries
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,new interactive map showing building outlines and heights in england coverage is based on httpenvironmentdatagovukdssurveydownload lidar data which covers about of the country vector tiles are being served up from our own tile server they are only rendered when requested by the browser allowing us to serve up country wide data without consuming too much bandwidth environment agency data has been merged with ordnance survey open map local httpswwwordnancesurveycoukbusinessandgovernmentproductsosopenmaplocalhtml to give resulting heights of buildings full explanation is available in this a lot of the data is available httpwwwemuanalyticscomproductsdatapacksphp for free download
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,building height is especially interesting around buckingham palace also is you go on the roof of a place like admiralty arch you better let the snipers on bp know first
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i really like looking at stuff like this i especially like the features of having addresses it would be pretty much perfect if it gave standard addresses too again absolutely awesome i gave a small chuckle at manchester with the majority of buildings being quite small next to the beetham tower its certainly right too that thing stands out for miles
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not sure how accurate it is tested a building the tower at st georges wharf the site says it is wikipedia says
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my one complaint is the inconsistency with the scale ranges
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,uuuuuh so my house is only tall but still crazy amount of detail even has my garage there as its whole separate building
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,welcome to london and here you can see the needle
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rcitiesskylines needs this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i remember hearingreading about an archaic right to light law from before the commonality of electric lighting in london at least if i recall correctly essentially everyone had a right to get sun and if you built something that shaded the houses of neighbors you had to pay them to give up their rights edit httpsenmwikipediaorgwikirighttolight
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,emu anal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i just want a full screen picture of that map for my desktop background
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that must be a delayed hug normally sites can handle a few hundred people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i hate this people blame rich foreigners for supposedly taking up all the houses but london has one of the lowest empty homes rate of the country then people ask for rent control which or they get mad at developers for producing new properties because the bedroom flats that get built end up being priced in the luxury range which is more to do with the housing shortage than developers building luxury flats since a similar sized flat in another city would probably be affordable and regardless any new home built luxury or otherwise helps reduce the housing crisis yet developers are viewed as the bad guys fundamentally the problem is that there is not enough homes and really its the fact that any comparably populated city looks like or not
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how accurate is this data for example it says the tallest building in sheffield is but i know for a fact the tallest building is st pauls tower which
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah there are a few inconsistencies with using the data at this scale for some specific areas the collection of the lidar data maybe older than the building hence we would get the height as it was built the environment agency are hopefully releasing more recent data across the country in a more detailed format so we will probably patch some of the heights as we go
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which locations it seemed to be pretty consistent for me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hey can you elaborate can look into it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sounds odd might be a glitch in the lidar data i cant really ask where your house is to look into it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what are you on about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sorry guys we didnt spec for so much love just looking at it now edit that was quick brought up another cluster so should be running smoothly now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nyc is better but still has a ton of problems nyc is also construction costs theres a bunch of story walkups all over manhattan they should be bulldozed and replaced by story apt buildings
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i noticed that i was wondering if the difference was due to height as measured from the town hall side rather than the arundel gate side but i doubt that is as much as
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,some of the lidar is collected prior to the completion of some of the taller buildings its possible that the ea only prioritise rescanning an area of flood risk hoping they will be releasing their detailed point cloud data for all these areas though that will allow us to give a more accurate and up to date representation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what i meant was that the increments for the colours on the scale have differences that vary between the next step your scale goes if you wanted it to be more consistent you would use increments that had the same variances like hopefully this makes sense ☺
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah the buildings around here are saying anything between i mean i didnt expect it to get that kind of thing accurate what with the scale of the whole thing and this isnt in a highly populated area at all how does that data get gathered oh you know what i just finished typing that and had a thought when was this data gathered might have been halfway built
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,right looks like we found a ufo hovering over the platform we take the max height for the interactive map rather than the average height so this would cause the issue prob will look at removing noise like this in a future release great spot though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in general probably around should have added a note on site will get that added this morning thanks for the feedback
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeeep wouldve still been in construction cool all working as intended then
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the shard is shown but has a height of because it was still being built when the data was collected we will continue to update the map as the environment agency releases updates glad you like it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,misleading graphic it talks about executive orders but the bars list documents
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im honestly surprised that truman dealt out the most executive orders hes not one of those guys that seems like he used lots of executive power
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for fairness it should probably also include presidential memorandums since theyre more or less the same thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so obviously the big trend is an increase over time but im curious if presidents with friendly congresses write fewer executive orders since they could just push for it to be passed as legislation instead
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can you compare individual terms for multiple term presidents im new here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,gwb slyly coming in at i wouldnt be surprised if he did that on purpose

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so just from looking at this chart around coal production dropped from tons to mil tons and employees dropped from employees to peak employees were in and at over so people in that region maybe feel like coal has a third as many workers of people lost their jobs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all the numbers for this project can be found at the maryland department of the environment site linked in the bottom of the graphic the large drop in production in is because of a large mine mettiki mine closing in western maryland which accounted for million tons of coal production in the year before it closed

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just a little gif i threw together with xfoil while working on a lab report for a class the mach number is not correct for that particular reynolds number but the visualization is still qualitatively informative i dont know that much on the subject as this is a very broadly arranged technical writinglab conducting class weve done vibration testing on a plate with cpu cooling fan attached strain gauge readings on a soda can while opening it etc but from my limited understanding the pressure coefficient is a unitless measure of the pressure on the suction and pressure surfaces of an airfoil the lower graphic is a visualization of the air flow over the foil with flow separation slowly occuring as the angle of attack approaches the minmax values

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dec is going to be an interesting election day trumps electors dont really consider him a member of their party some even had the opinion anyone but trump this election is going to be very very interesting indeed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you could say the same thing about the popular vote the counties that la and new york city are in more than cover the spread that clinton leads trump in the popular vote so how arbitrary is the popular vote it takes only counties to flip the election outcome is just as true notwithstanding the fact that we all went into this election with an understanding that this country operates under the electoral college state not national popular votes are the only thing that matters here its really strange to keep having this discussion about how our system has always worked
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the point of the visualization is not a whatif of peoples votes changing but a whatif of neighboring counties being counted in different states the fact that the system we have in place is arbitrary and gameable is a nonpartisan fact
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes however an electoral system was put in place at our founding to prevent the very idea that large statesmetropolitan centers could reliably force their will on large tracts of the country those are the rules if we think they are so arbitrary a constitutional amendment will need to be initiated i dont see that happening
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they arent worth less that is why states with large populations are granted a greater share of electors but because this country is a union of states smaller states are ensured a voice in the process the architects of the country believed that creating equilibrium between these large states and smaller states would be critical in preventing the dissolution of the union on behalf of smaller states that did not feel their interests were represented economic and social progress cant be weighed by the same metrics across the country what might be a popular green policy initiative in washington state could cripple agriculture in nebraska thats why states are granted a fair amount of autonomy in policy in the first place people can choose to live in states that suit them best it isnt a perfect system but it prevents one size fits all policy decisions in dc that only benefit large population centers politicians need to craft policy that will go over well with a diverse population ruralcitydiversehomogenous in order to maintain paths to win electorally

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but but you didnt crap all over the right what kind of internet denizen are you s
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,with all the news fake news and opinion articles and blogs out there i thought a nice simple reminder could be visualized about how to block out the bad harness the good in whatever we read online just a simple venn diagram i made to illustrate enjoy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well done op id love to find a single outlet that is really striving to be objective
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats a fair point but the purpose here is to illustrate that good journalism is a blend of facts as well as reasonable fair and representative opinions from both sides

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the glucose doesnt matter to much because its a one time shot at a random day the rest is fine only the hdl should get higher the ldl are perfect though nice overview
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont forget omega those lower your ldl and increase your hdl youre welcome
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im afraid this isnt as beautiful as most of the visualized data here but i thought someone might find it interesting these are my blood test results over years the last of which are fasting of note in i went through a very stressful divorce and a move a lot of my life was uprooted and thus you can see some departure from the norm during that time in i gained weight and was the heaviest ive ever been and generally did not eat healthily consuming lots of comfort foods and desserts in i had become vegan before i was an omnivore and had eaten a plantbased diet for months at the time of the blood test as you can see my cholesterol went down plant foods do not contain any dietary cholesterol it was the first time my mch was in the healthy range and my fasting serum glucose had increased probably due to the increased intake of fiber ignore the serum glucose for years prior to as those were not fasting thanks for looking i hope you found this useful andor interesting i want to add that even though i am vegan at the time i was still not eating as healthily as i could have for instance i was still consuming refined products and lots of sugar im working toward eating more whole foods this year so it will be interesting to see the changes at my next blood test in source of data blood test reports from my annual physicals from method of data visualization microsoft excel
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also on a sidenote is there a good place on reddit related to this sub to request data visualizations

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to lowr cholesterol do you have to quit eating saturated fat and then eat plant based food or could you eat both and it lowers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a standard health screening im in america and it is covered under my health insurance policy and is suggested to be run annually as it can be an indicator of many diseases its only ml vial taken
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you so much
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it is my understanding that eating less meat fish dairy and eggs animal products will allow your cholesterol to naturally lower as plant foods grains seeds nuts vegetables fruits beans legumes do not contain any dietary cholesterol while animal products do i think cutting it out all together indeed lowers it quickly but im not in the medical or nutritional profession you should check out a documentary on netflix called forks over knives as it has a really good explanation with real people changing their diet and the results on their disease and risk for disease another awesome thing to check out is nutritionfactsorg which has lots of videos about plantbased diets on health and nutrition best of luck

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fair enough posted from my phone right before i went to bed guess i missed that note in the guidelines thanks for the note
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,source of the data social media mostly tool used to present the data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im ok with approving this but isnt really the source of the data its social media sites like facebook and twitter if you google something and click on a result that downloads a csv you dont say the source of the data was google
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre actually right ive edited it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the next logical step would be try and explain why theres that massive disparity between the black population per capita and the number of black shooting victims per capita how many violent crimes are committed by blacks as a percentage of all violent crimes this might lead to a correlation otherwise really enjoyed the presentation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this data viz was built with javascript and the swiper library by ryan murphy and jolie mccullough made from data compiled by open records requests and news reports
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ok i knew us and especially texas has a problem with shooting cops but wow i was already thinking shooting for roberry was disproportionate but in the category traffic stop shootings what the hell texas is not kidding with road safety also in category otherunknown how cop shoots and does not have to do a precise report of what happened texas never cease to amaze in cases the police officer were off duty your cops carry their guns off duty ho right freedom right to own gun and all that murica nevermind i should have seen that one coming
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there is no information at all about the circumstances of the shootings there they call out how many of the officers doing the shooting where white but not what the percentage of cops are that are white no mention of what percentage of those shot were armed it makes it very hard to tell if there the data is being selectively presented to fit a narrative or if its just sloppy incomplete reporting
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its worth noting that if no candidate gets electoral college votes tie or a few states went to a candidate other than clinton or trump and that candidate doesnt receive votes then by the the house of representatives votes statewise for president from the top three candidates who received electoral college votes due to statelevel gerrymandering after the census betting markets put a the republican house members would then presumably vote for trump the republican candidate or face a huge backlash from their republican constituency tldr if hillary or johnson or stein doesnt get electoral college votes then trump will most likely become president trump merely needs to prevent any single opponent from getting above eg clinton trump stein results in a trump presidency
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the problem is that a third party candidate may have of the polls i think it is less but would have to have most of a state i dont think that will happen
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,think im wrong unless you stepped out of a time machine from the future to tell us the actual result of the election you are wrong you cant make a prediction with confidence there are too many unknown parameters
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think she will win saying she gets a monument is waaaay to much this comment is not taking sides just looking at polls
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,johnson is at in new mexico behind clinton and behind trump not out of the question
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not saying its the most likely scenario but it is much more plausible that a thirdparty candidate wins a state or two than wins the entire presidency in nationally it was clinton bush perot but in say maine perot came in second only losing by in there was a solidly democratic house so perot winning a state helps the democratic candidate win in theres a solidly republican house so a thirdparty candidate winning a state helps the republican candidate win maybe you could imagine the republicans in the house deciding to go with the third candidate if it was gary johnson or evan mcmullin but that would be political suicide if trump got the overwhelming majority of republican votes for representatives to vote differently any how i think this is one of the best arguments against voting third party this election though by all means if you prefer a third party candidate tell that to pollsters just unless theres polling data to suggest a chance to get electoral dont vote third party unless you are more comfortable with trump winning than clinton
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,even if you did your appearance may modify the probabilities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if trump wins the odds of him commissioning a statue are high
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am voting hilary i can see why people would vote for jill stein though i was just saying how unlikely it would be to happen of course it is still plausible i feel like johnson gets his votes as protest i dont really think people like a candidate who said that he wants to think about climate change in the long term and then he said that the long term is that the earth will be enveloped by the sun in a few billion years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its very very likely that hillary will be president its not even chance that she or anyone else on the world will live until election day there is some doubt in your statement
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to me its the opposite i cant understand votes for stein in but completely understand how conservatives and libertarians can vote for johnson or mcmullin over trump their vote still isnt for clinton who has fundamentally different beliefs than them on abortion taxes gun laws social programs lgbtq rights but you still arent actively supporting yourself with trump who you find repugnant for his personal flaws even if you still slightly prefer if his platform wins in the end stein has zero political experience as a legislator or executive outside of being one of town meeting members for six years in a town with selectmen all her experience is in failed political runs two for massachusetts governor liberal state where she got in and in and being allowed in the debates and one prior failed national runs where she got granted im one of those who campaigned hard for nader in and didnt care about his strategy of still campaigning in swing states late in the election i thought there wasnt a difference between bush and gore thinking they were both candidates of big oil and would be no difference i was wrong iraq war gitmo patriot act and bush tax cuts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i just meant as far as her stances i really only disagree when it comes to israel im jewish i am voting for hilary
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats obviously not true
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats like predicting a coin toss will be heads claiming to be certain and then once its heads acting like you were right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a little old but we havnt had any political killings in the state in a long time with the rising tensions were due for one honestly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there is some doubt that she will wake up tomorrow very small amount but there is some

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,data from apples reports chart was made in excel incorporating feedback from a previous post
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,does the app store revenue fall under services or under the device the customer was using during the purchase
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im always amazed by the rise and fall of the mighty ipod i mean it is to be expected but damn in it wasnt far off of their revenue probably no more than a few
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i still use an ipod for my car because i dont want an iphone and dont wana look down all the time the ipod is just easier to use for music when you have a lot in your collection but i bought mine off ebay because they have no nontouch ones now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ipadmac but productivity tools from apple are still missing on large screen ios
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well thats because it got replaced by the iphone there is no room for products which began to become so similari think of the iphone more as a new more powerful ipod except for shuffle thats a total different product which still merits a place
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all stores itunes ibooks apps etc apple music apple pay icloud applecare iads but not anymore
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i know why i just find it interesting
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i find the extremely disparate pricing between ipod and iphone very interesting an ipod touch costs cad and its very nearly identical to an iphone which costs cad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a new us voter and one who is registered as independent when i look at the two candidates we must choose from i am reminded exactly why i do not want to pick one side over the other i think about it like a shower i dont want my water all the way hot or all the way cold i want a tepid comfortable temperature
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,registered independent in ma is a party affiliation unenrolled is not
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in many states registering as independent means you are registering with the independent party and not as an unaffiliated party from the dems and reps make sure you make the right choice because theres nothing worse than getting a million phone calls from a platform you never want to talk to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i used to do phone surveys and political polling what we typically found was that there were almost no republicans there were democrats and then there were people that described themselves as independents but would answer all the questions as conservatively as possible they hate obama think we need to cut social programs need to frack for oil need to grow the military planned to vote for romney you name it liberalleaning independents exist but nine times out of ten if someone described themselves as independent they skewed heavily conservative the data basically came out toward three political parties democrat republican and republican but dont want to admit it makes me wonder if new independents skew similarly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i just registered in texas ive been voting absentee in tennessee since i moved but i also registered as independent i was a republican in tn and ill probably vote for the hilldawg even though im not a fan at least shes competent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just a quick tip to anyone that doesnt know registering as independent is not the same as registering no party affiliation as some other people have said independent voters do not get to vote in the primaries but npa voters do
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im registered as democrat but feel more independent its because of how primaries work in my state and i lean more towards dems anyway i should probably register republican to have a say in those primaries but meh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am an independent because i treat each issue independently i refuse to adhere to a party line that just tries to distract me from the issues i actually care about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a nonamerican what does this even mean why do you have to register your voting preference ahead of time isnt that vote supposed to be secret
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im a registered democrat but ill probably vote for my local plumber just because hes used to dealing with shit all the time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i understand not caring about either party but in most states an independent cant vote in the party primary we need more centrist voters in the primaries
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cute analogy but some issues people are most passionate about are pretty hot or cold should gay marriage be legal or not should we allow abortions under hardship circumstances or not at all is global warming a legitimate issue or exaggerated should we move in a direction where guns are accepted but have stronger background checks or move in a direction where guns should be phased out of common usage the economy gets more complicated but its still like moving towards universal healthcare or not im sure its nice being safe in the middle but if you want change then you need to get down and dirty and push for the more middle ground versions of your republican or democratic candidates
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the register as either and vote in the primaries you fungus
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,does texas make you register with a party i dont think i ever have and ive voted in both partys primaries in the past years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and ill probably vote for the hilldawg even though im not a fan at least shes competent i was looking at the other candidates from the libertarians and the green party there is literally no good choice this time the best thing anyone can do is pick the candidate most likely to preserve the status quo the corruption around hillary is pretty horrid but at least people are learning about it before it gets swept under the rug
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ohioan here who voted for obama in her first two presidential elections voting for trump was the first time i ever participated in a primary i was actually considering changing my affiliation to d after romney because i just couldnt see the gope offering up anyone worth voting for and despite my vote for trump i maintain that they still havent offered up anyone worth voting for in fact i think thats why they got trump the whole reason i participated in the primary was because i saw a bunch of republicans rending their clothes over a fucking hairpiece were all getting exactly what we deserve this season
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah her husband allowed the sale of top secret tech to china in exchange for contributions to the dnc so we can all sleep sound knowing they now have the ability to lob multiple war heads at us thanks to clinton and im sure hilldawg will bring more of that goodness
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i like the jilldawg better but thats just me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i understand that but it doesnt matter anyway by the time the republican primaries came around my way it was down to trump and cruz so i wouldnt have been able to vote for who i actually wanted
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would love to see them allow independents to vote in the primary as long as they arent bound to a decision by that vote a party shouldnt have to nominate anyone let them weigh the independent vote to their party vs the in party vote
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why would you want to vote in the primary of a party that you arent a member of just to sabotage them why is it any of your business who a party that you arent a member of has to represent them in an election
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you have a point but i dont fully agree with one side over the other hence why i am independent i didnt choose it to play it safe i chose it because its how i feel as a citizen and voter i dont agree with a two party system because look where it got us this year
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you want to know how i feel about the primaries you can read the discussion about them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nope as i said i registered as independent in texas you can vote in primaries even if youre not in that party iirc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,shes not going to try to enact tariffs on all foreign goods and spark a trade war and is less likely to undo all the good environmental work thats been done so shes the less bad option for me its like being the tallest midget but shes less corrupt and somehow tells the truth more than trump
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but not much we can really do about it its really sad every election year has been a little more eh but this year is a joke
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the alternative of a fullblown reallife idiocracy under trump sounds so much better right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,would you mind backing up that statement with a source
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hillary clinton is not her husband nor is any woman her capability and actions arent tied to the actions of her husband the chinese have had icbms since the the tech that was exported wasnt some golden key that unlocked the doors of wmds for them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was going to vote for johnson but hes been pretty bad lately
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but what about the next election or the one after that or the one after that of course you can change your registration but my guess is that most people dont
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im an independent but i understand that its a party system i would vote for the best candidate for each party the two i think should vie for the position
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well why dont you flip that argument degrees and have independents ask that of gopdems
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not to sabotage but to influence the reality is that in november either a democrat or a republican will win if you want any influence on who the party nominates then you need to be part of the process back in january we had a spectrum of candidates from sanders to cruz if you dont like who the parties settled on then the solution is to get involved in who they pick next time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean look how passionate people were between hillary and bernie in the heat of the primaries its not just republican vs democrat there is a whole spectrum of politics between each side going right or left should be the easy part the hard part once you have decided is navigating all the components of what that means obviously if so many people register independent im wrong and more people would agree with you its just like every casual conversation about politics with people is about making jokes about hating both candidates and the two party system
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i can see what you mean but i disagree about being less corrupt i think hillary is the most corrupt of any presidential candidate in this race the real shame is that many people are going to be forced to vote for her if they want a safe vote
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but not much we can really do about it theres not much anyone can do about it at this point voting on the objectively best candidate is the losing move the two establishment parties have a nice little kabuki play every years depending on the office and nothing changes corruption powercreep eroding our basic rights both sides like these things and thats why i decided to vote for a hairpiece he probably doesnt have my best interests in mind but thats the beauty of it hes probably only looking out for himself which means hes not looking out for the establishment either i say fight selfish assholes with an even bigger selfish asshole
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,am republican conservative type of guy saw debate trump couldnt even talk about the issues and then said he wanted to bring back stop and frisk and such yeap dont think he gives two craps about the constitution hillary might not to an extent either but at least with her she can be reasoned with so im gonna vote her when i tell people around my conservative area i tell them im american first and foremost really throws them for a loop
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,honestly i dont know which one is going to be worse i think in a year or no matter who we pick were all going to feel like we fucked up
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it gave them the tech to use multiple warheads
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my point was that even if i change my registration my voice in the primaries would not have been fully heard because i didnt have a say in it from the very beginning i dont understand what the point of the primaries is if i have to wait for the more important states to have their say first
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i can understand why youd use your right to vote in an open primary given that you have one and this is a cutthroat world but doesnt your conscience tell you theres something morally wrong with casting a vote in a club that you arent a member of why should you be able to tell another group of people who they should have to represent them do you think you should also have a vote in what your neighbour has for dinner tonight do you think you should have a vote in who leads the local plumbers union not your club so none of your business
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wouldnt necessarily say youre wrong i dont think there really is a right or wrong it politics many young people like myself are probably apprehensive about choosing one side over the other especially this year with candidates being virtually political polar opposites finding credible information about either candidate is also somewhat difficult on the internet because there is so much bullshit to sift through i know i am still undecided on who i want to vote for and this is the first election i am voting in i really hope future elections can be more idk professional
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,every candidate this time is a joke
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i see your point but im more worried about the international implications he may have again dont think there is a lot a candidate can do but i feel like it could put strain on certain foreign relationships dont really have a lot to back that up just a feeling that being said im not voting for hilary either shes too slimy for me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,while i somewhat agree i think people dont really realize that no matter who we vote in neither one will be able to do the majority of shit they said to get into office the wall would be too expensive to build and maintain and im sure hillary isnt going to tell wall street to cut it out lol so while either candidate sucks choice wise they also will have a hard time getting anything donefucking shit up
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fascinating thank you for sharing a couple things to note though the dnc returned all the money to chung once the investigation started neither chung nor liu were found to have lobbied with administration officials chung was wealthy is his own right and donated to the dnc well before he met liu and well before he received any money from her this was not some smokey backroom deal the deal in question was approved by the departments of state commerce and defense after years of investigations and inquiries the results can be summed up by a statement from rands china specialist people have been looking for a magic link that shows how the chinese money affected policy all i see are a bunch of coincidences standing around the same room trying to introduce themselves sources and of course the source you posted
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no it didnt youre mixing up several things around the same time it had come to light that china had been successful in espionage to gain info on us nuclear warhead design clintons administration then relaxed some export laws a company that was approved to do an export loral transferred a satellite for the chinese to launch when then exploded loral was later found to have illegally exported information by giving an unapproved technical report to china on how to improve their launch rocket the cia and air force investigations concluded that this transferred incremental navigational improvements to china but wasnt of tremendous consequence then at the same time woodward and others at the washington post broke a story about how china appeared to be attempting to influence the upcoming election by funneling money through their embassy these things all happened within a three to four timespan the facts are though that bill clinton did not sell or give anything to the chinese especially not warhead design the only places you can find claiming that he did this are altright paranoia forums and infowarscom which should be a huge warning sign that the claims are suspect
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i understood your point i obviously dont know what state you live in but my counterpoint was that just because it didnt matter this year doesnt mean it wont matter in some future election edit and furthermore it may be true that your voice isnt fully heard if you vote in your primary but it is certainly heard more than if you dont vote in the primary at all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,except that also has to deal with the consequences of what these clubs choose its not deciding what his neighbor has for dinner its deciding what he and his hole block get to have for dinner thats democracy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,isnt that what all elections are about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you didnt like bernie or hillary or trump or rubio
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not judging you on the feeling in fact i think its a smart feeling i just feel like im not even a little bit comfortable with where the status quo is headed trump is a wild card and by default that makes him a riskier choice youll get no argument from me maybe if i felt represented on the national level i wouldnt have to grasp at any reality tv star that came within striking distance of the white house i think both sides can combat candidates like trump by actually representing us people like me will still feel unrepresented progun and prochoice oh my but thats why we have swing states yeah
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh sorry i didnt know it changes each election i thought it went by swing states or something for some refernce i am on the east coast if that helps so are you allowed to change your registration multiple times a year so you could vote in both the republican and democratic primaries
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cant understand this point of view at all you can vote for whoever you want at the election and anyone who wants to can stand provided they can show some level of support before hand this isnt the actually election its just a primary this is a group of people deciding who they want to get behind together its not democracy to go to someone elses club and tell them who they should support say you and a group of people really care about the environment so you form a political party and you want to put a candidate forward for president and want to raise money and support for that you all have a great guy in mind to be that candidate but then the law requires that you let everyone else vote on who your candidate is lots of people who dont really care about the environment vote on who you should have as your candidate and they choose a big oil guy some of them even do it just to annoy you wouldnt you say but this was our party for the environment we wanted to support a candidate for that purpose why are these other people allowed to come in and ruin have a vote on who we want to support were not telling anyone else who to support it was just about who we supported its nothing to do with anyone else who we wanted to support why didnt they form their own party if they have a different opinion on who should be president if they didnt want your environment candidate they could have expressed that at the actual election its crazy that they can ruin your party like that dont you think
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but this isnt actually the election is it its clubs deciding who they want to collectively support when it does come to the election why should you get to butt into someones elses club and tell them who you think they should collectively support with their time and money
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,bernie blamed market economics quoting nordic countries as using a more socialist system pm of norway had to fucking call him out and say uhh actually we are a market economy with some safety nets market economics arent an option they run every successful country the thing that sucks is i could have stomached him the current system blows i hate taxing by god damn if you are going to tax highly his ideas are the best way to spend tax dollars just god damn why blame markets for so much government intervention in small business causes so many issues why do you need a licence to cut hair hillary is a shill trump says since really fucking smart things then blames free trade and threatens to go into a trade war with the globe rubio war alright i guess not socially tolerable enough we need to end the drug war we need to stop telling people how to run their lives rand paul was okay probably the best
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cant argue with you there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,swing states got their name because they swing between republican and democrat in the presidential election they dont matter as much in the primaries when votes are being used to select a candidate within each party i dont know for sure what the rules on changing voter registration are but that strategy would only work if you were also moving since you can only vote in your states primary i guess theoretically you could register as a republican and vote in a closer primary in one state and then move to a state with a later primary date change your registration and vote again although my guess is that there are systems to prevent this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh sorry i didnt know it changes each election i thought it went by swing states or something no there is a fixed order to when states have their primaries and it is a highly contentious issue for exactly the reasons you stated the early states get more power in deciding the outcome and thus more campaign spending in their states states have tried to jump the line and move their primaries early and the parties have to threaten to exclude them completely from the primary process if they followed through ujohnnyappleweed was saying next time your vote might matter more to you because a candidate you care about is in the primary thats all so are you allowed to change your registration multiple times a year so you could vote in both the republican and democratic primaries a few states are open registration for primaries meaning that you can vote in whichever you want however i believe you can only vote in one of the two not both in the majority of states no you cannot switch registration in order to vote in both
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean the reason why we have politicians is because not everyone is goodshould be in politics i dont have the ability to create a political group but that shouldnt exclude me from saying this person most represents me i get what your saying but in most elections is just r or d if we had a system that had more parties that could easily come and go youd be right unfortunately what youre asking me to do is wait for two parties to pick people that are very fair from center and then have to do mental gymnastics to figure out which one i support more personally if independents got to vote in all primaries i think our political climate would be better as they would pick people who are much more down the middle and not these crazy outliers that primaries bring about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,because when it comes down to it come time for the general election i realistically have to pick one of the two clubs choices even if im not in the clubs if i dont pick one of them and vote for someone else or run myself im wasting my time and my vote the only way for that not to be the case is either stir up enough support for a third party candidate to shake up the traditional parties enough to impact their policies and who they nominate next or have open primaries and let the populace have their voice heard from the getgo this is because as an independent voter maybe this year i look at the people running for the nomination for party x and i see that i would love to vote for candidate a i just have to hope he gets the nomination without open primaries this is entirely out of my control
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes you fucking canjoke
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this was really helpful thank you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for clarifying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what youre asking me to do is wait for two parties to pick people that are very fair from center and then have to do mental gymnastics to figure out which one i support more im not asking you to do anything you can vote in the main election for whoever you want and you could stand if you wanted to and you could gather up some support if you dont like the r or d candidates then stand yourself or maybe start your own party to support someone else oh but i hope all the republicans and democrats dont vote in your primary to fuck you over you might find that quite annoying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it would be very annoying for me to let my neighbors be heard in a democracy if only there was a government type that only let a few people voice their opinions based on arbitrary groups we make look i get you like the oligarchy but you cant say its fair to people who dont fall into the parties starting a political party takes tens of millions of dollars and unfortunately for us regular people we dont have that laying around if i like someone in the primaries that i would like to win in the general election why should i be prevented from trying to help them get to the general election
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you seem to think that the r and d parties are some kind of official part of our political system they arent the political parties choosing who they want to support isnt part of our public democracy why should it be theyre private parties they arent part of the government theyre nothing more than a group of people who want to get behind one candidate each because they have similar views there are other candidates you could be a candidate if you wanted to and could find some people to support you if i like someone in the primaries that i would like to win in the general election why should i be prevented from trying to help them get to the general election because the primary is about who a club that you arent a member of is going to put its money and support behind why should you get to tell a group of people totally unrelated to you who they should support that seems undemocratic to me you can help them get to the general election however you want what i dont think you should be able to do is vote in whether a private party also helps them get to the general election can nobody even see my point of view a little bit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre point isnt lost i get it youre technically correct i just believe your practically wrong i understand parties are private but they do not act as such in the real world for all intents and purposes they are the only clubs of politics i agree someone who is antigun should vote for nra related stuff in their club but the nra doesnt select a politician from amongst its club it picks one from the r club to back i dont think political parties should be private in that line of thought even though they are i dont believe they should act like private clubs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what do you think about the example of a theoretical environmental party having a big oil candidate because lots of people outside the party voted for him
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think you are spot on with that however we only have parties that can generally win and until there are more parties its a nonissue plus if theres enough oil lovers to influence their own party and another partys primary to get oil candidates then theyre probably the majority anyone
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think this is something new though i cant figure how anyone supports either candidate the fact that theyre running so close is a testament to what poor candidates they both are
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is a poor proxy for public trust or affection for candidates better to superimpose public supporttrustworthiness polls for the voting cycle for all the candidates over each other spoilers trump and clinton are the most distrusted candidates for at minimum a generation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why dont we just i dunno get new candidates can we start a petition for this is it worth it will it work consider how much people hate these candidates they obviously cannot be the best choice for america get bernie and cruz back in there

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,data from google trends searching for lesser of two evils in the united states within the past years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so there was interest in this term at one point also interesting to note how small of a blip midterm elections play
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,like the only reason hillary stands a chance is because trump is so horribly unelectable she would have been the obvious choice if not for all the leaks if we had no idea about any of the horrible shit she has done shed get elected in a landslide
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive basically decided on voting for clinton but i dont feel good at all about it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people are supporting one or the other because the narrative being told to them is that these are the only choices with a chance any rational person would choose the lesser of two evils instead of abstaining if they believed those were their only choices
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not exactly the most accurate measure of americans hate for candidates polls show these two are outliers in how disliked they are httpfivethirtyeightcomfeaturesamericansdistasteforbothtrumpandclintonisrecordbreaking
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,years isnt every presidential cycle
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i believe the percentages are more for if youre comparing two or more search terms and is relative it simply means thats the date in the past years when there was the most interest in lesser of two evils play around with google trends and youll see what i mean no matter what you search for as long as you only search for one term the day it was most popular is always
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the public is so misinformed says the guys guy who apparently bases his entire political opinion on what his accountant tells him
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and the wars will be great for the markets
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,small business owners make up what percent of the country
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and visa versa the fact that the republicans arent winning in a landslide over hillary is evidence of how bad trump is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive decided to not vote and i feel pretty good about it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive decided to vote third party that way when my kids ask me or my grandkids ask i can say that i didnt vote for either of them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i guess im irrational because i wont pick an evil
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think i would get more laughs with trump being in office hilary just seems like a downer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so the idea being that this election cycle that particular term has been the most popular still cool to see that the midterms dont mention the term as much
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the definition of small business is insane and it varies by industry in manufacturing you can have employees and still be considered a small business run a cattle feedlot and youre a small biz as long as you pull in less than million a year in revenue httpswwwsbagovsitesdefaultfilesfilessizestandardstablepdf so the answer is that there are a lot of small businesses and that you should be skeptical of people using the term to gain sympathy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ditto one other thing ive noticed though is that americans seem to be a lot more forgiving about the election this year i cant quantify it but im used to people arguing more this time it seems like a lot more people acknowledge that the choices suck and theyll grant you a mulligan if your choice is different than theirs our maybe i just have cooler friends than i used to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes the graph would suggest that the term term lesser of two evils is much more popular this time around when i searched i figured that would be a phenomenon unique to the surprise to me was that the term was so popular back in with obama v romney
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that is not what i asked the question was pretty clear
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes and people that dont want to work hours a week owning a business dont want to vote for him
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yep both parties dug pretty deep to try and lose this election
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do these include all words said by each candidate i just noticed that hcs is considerably larger than trumps and wonder if that is different parameters of the visualization or if hc had more word diversity
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is the proximity in the cloud significant i wonder how a bar plot would look or a pareto chart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its honestly a beautiful name and its a shame to see it turn into the next adolf
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if anyone finds this naming trends or etymological history in general interesting this website is a great resource and has some fascinating data about how people name their children for example the slow steady year decline of john or the unparalleled meteoric rise of linda in the late or how the name madison simply didnt exist until after the mermaid film splash
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my girlfriends name is isis i personally think its a beautiful name and she says shes grateful she has the same name as a terrorist group because at least everyone knows how to pronounce it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would not call this a steady rise looks much more like a sharp rise and uneasy plateau
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a great dylan song too and at one a popular fanzine is that an actual term no red line good to go
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow my sister was so close to being named isisi have a little sister through an open adoption and the birth mother really wanted to be apart of her life so she thought naming her would be a good start and of coursethe top name on the list was isis being the allknowing eyes in the back of her head futureseeing mom that she is my mom hated it no offense to any isiss out there and had to barter and convince the birth mom that her last name would be my sisters middle name and we could pick whatever name we wanted this important moment could have saved my poor little sisters life
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but whats up with portugal according to the site portugal has had an increase in the baby name isis since and its still going why is people in portugal still naming their babies isis in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably all the people who have the name quickly changed pronunciation from eyesis to ih as in itsis
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id like to see a rise in its popularity for baby names perfumes fashion accessory lines and whatnot as a big fuck you to the group we should take their identity from them write their claim to the name out of existence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seriously this people have been named isis for nearly as long as human civilization has been in existence the name dates from ancient egypt years at least we shouldnt let some approximated abbreviation of a modern terrorist group phase it out of existence someone should start a campaign to force the media to stop using isis and start calling them daesh or isil or fisd fucking islamic state douchebags
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,at least we can still name our babies daesh oh wait
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its also a pretty great yeah yeah yeahs song and i agree its a beautiful name despite the nowunfortunate connotations
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i hope you dont go to jail for giving money to isis
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,possibly they dont call it isis
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont know anyone with that name and i live here i never even heard of it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,because it is not the term they use for the terrorist organisation isis is an english acronym
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ihsis sounds weird should be eesis
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean i think the west is who coined the term isis
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah its pretty annoying egyptian mythology isnt as popular as greek or roman but its still up there and isis is one of the top five names its like giving an awful group the acronym venus or athena and then making everyone else change their names
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i like the last one lets start a petition to make the news media start calling them that plus it counteracts recruitment hey you wanna be a douchebag
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,girls names can be really trendy getting really popular out of nowhere and then abruptly falling out of fashion jennifer and lisa are more examples linda was a bit extreme though i wonder what causes these things some character in a movie or book and why does it go away some of the old names make comebacks grace eleanor came back in recent years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,bob dylan has a song called isis on the desire album also a really great song
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks ill look out for that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i went and looked they call it for isil and isis
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so isis have you considered just changing your name why should i have to change it theyre the ones who suck
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,actually i was joking though there are crazies who would over react so perhaps be a little paranoid do you remember so people can be crazy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,never heard that and i live here people just call it estado islâmico or daesh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,brazil here estado islâmico or ei
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,interesting are acronyms just not as much of a thing in portuguese or is it just in this case that the acronym wasnt adopted
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think its just as common our main tv channels are all acronyms for example
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,none of these women earned it by themselves they just inherited the money what can you say now feminists
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but reddit told me that rich people are born that way
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wish you could combine two options cool graph
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,really nice graph what tool did you use to create it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you look at the data at least half of the inherited billionaires from families
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it gets even more earning based when it gets to mere millionaires
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is rather an information poor graph the definitions of self made inherited and grew a company and inherited company are pretty broad i would be very interested in seeing the parental income andor wealth vs these peoples income
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,apparently amancio ortega grew up in pretty modest circumstances
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i saw somewhere that most billionaires came from pretty wealthy parents like millionaire level this makes sense to me not because they have capital or get money from parents but that they are raised with wealthy habits traits and genetics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lots of down votes on the truth eh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i like downvotes they mean my comment is more accurate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,source historical data – doing business world bank grouptool used was excel i extracted the data from the historical data base and was very much surprised for what i found what did australia do so wrong the made it so difficult to trade across borders you would think it is a third world country too late here in the night to look into world the details of the data to work that out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,made using nrl ladder data from from nrlcom viz made in tableau
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,quick opinion the colored bars in the key should be a bit thicker theyre pretty darn difficult to read
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i agree
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,good point noted d
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they should have called ethnocentric group based or something clearly ingroup behaviour extends beyond ethnicity to language region stateled religiousphilosophical and other social groupings
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,capitalism is still the best
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not traditionally it seems for the purpose of this study taking in non members is considered humanitarian the idea of including non members in a nation state is new and this study seems to indicate its not a healthy thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not sure if that would be counted as selfish or traitorous humanitarian or ethnocentric
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as opposed to communism well yes as opposed to all other possible alternatives of course not the current interpretation of capitalism allows for noncompetitive markets through monopolies it encourages selfishness and discourages cooperation in prisoner dilemmas even when cooperation would eventually increase profit for all ie taxes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hmm the meaning of the word ethnic is different in anthropology and biology that i doubt also it doesnt say anything about it being health or not this study cannot be applied to the immigration issue it disregards the entire integration process for crying out loud
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,integration only happens when self ghettoization doesnt i think thats largely the difference between ethnocentrism if you come here you have to be one of us and humanitarianism like sweden please rob rape and murder us since its your culture
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you dont know much about sweden do you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i know its the rape capital of the west i know their rape rates went up over after they decided to begin allowing in muslims i know there are places the police wont go i know they are going to be a third world country in years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,first off the rape statistics cannot be compared across country borders by absolute numbers the national definitions of rape differ as well as the rate of reporting crimes the only organisation to take this into account so far is the un vetted ngo httpwwwwomanstatsorg among the western countries germany italy most of the baltics and latin america have worse accordingly the estimates of the actual rape rates are highest in i know their rape rates went up over if you are going to make up statistics the actual statistics for and have not been published yet making stuff like that takes time at least try to do so convincingly in a total of immigrants from syria and iraq entered sweden this population has a rape rate of approximately per so a total of rapes were caused by immigrants rounded up and a total of rapes were caused by swedes this means the rape rate went up with approximate its a little less because i rounded up for good measure but well its an estimate anyway i know they are going to be a third world country in years you are not jesus you cant see into the future
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,swedens government decided in that it had to become multicultural and began mass importation of mena men since then the rape rate has risen you can look it up the united nations makes that projection not me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,data on tax havens and federal budget has been updated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,made using sources httpswwwwhitehousegovombbudgethistoricals
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,uisosceleswheel your submission was removed for violating the following rules posts regarding american politics and contentious topics in american media are only permissible on thursdays edt please resubmit your post on thursday this post has been removed for information regarding this and similar issues please see the httpswwwredditcomrdataisbeautifulwikiindex if you have any questions please feel free to httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetordataisbeautifulsubjectquestion regarding the removal of this submission by uisosceleswheelmessagei have a question regarding the removal of this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,found this through a vox article out today that you can see here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why are the labels for mormon and protestant switched in the second set of graphs and is that a labeling error or do the numbers match the different order
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow this is a terrible visualization so much ink in so many different ways for such little data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what is curious is that jews seem to be more okay with just about anything on this list than any other religious group and sometimes even the nonreligious i thought this might speak to certain unique aspects of the religion but i think the conclusion more easily drawn is that this may be heavily skewed either by excluding insular and more religious jewish populations or just having a much lower orthodox population towards more secular liberal jewish populations this would adequately explain the jewish response to the death penalty as a jew myself there is certainly difficulty in measuring the jewish population the religion is matrilineal so people i know who identify as jewish wouldnt necessarily be counted as such it is likely difficult to get responses from certain segments of the jewish population who are just relatively more connected than the amish furthermore jewish is both an ethnicity and a religion i have been an atheist for a long time but still call myself jewish to some degree this is a quality not possessed by most religious populations
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont like that there is no relationship between the charts on the left and the charts on the right of the same line but the visualization is set up as though there is one definitely like the horizontal better than the vertical but just make them all the same orientation in two columns instead of half of them pointing to the left most pro and most against are also strange things to highlight its clear by the length of the bars who is most pro or most against but it results in coloring bars bluish that are still against the idea as a whole ie cloning humans as
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people are more accepting of extramarital affairs than polygamy this confuses me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what is the source data cant tell because this is a screenshot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,now include islam buddhism and judaism and add beheading killing gays and beating women im curious to see the data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cloning humans is still not popular maybe i should clone me a group of people who like it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you can be an jew in the ethnic sense yet not be jewish in the religious sense did this study adjust for secular jews
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,possible trigger warning i find it interesting how everyone is highly against someone deciding to take their own life and yet if a doctor is involved suddenly at least double the amount of people are ok with it now dont get me wrong i know about how legalising things can tend to reduce rates in how much ppl seek certain behaviours out i also know that itd be much nicer to have the option to if you want to end your life early end it in a less violentpainful way i also feel that maybe ppl feel safer feeling a doctor will be in charge of saying so youre wanting to end your life because youre going through chronic pain yes youre right in that it wont go away i can help you stop your suffering or yes you have a dehabilitating disease thatll keep getting worse you want to die early with dignity before putting your family through the grief of watching your personality leave i can help with that and yet if ppl in the same circumstances decided to end their life themselves without a doctorsomeone elses aid suddenly a lot more people would be angrier at the person for doing it and find it morally reprehensible in both circumstances its a person choosing to end their life why are people so against one and ok with the other i understand failed attempts at ending ones life can sometimes end in injury i understand that the second way is a much easier less painful way of the person taking their life early and is likely to have involved more of a process to get to that point which might help people realise they dont want to end their life during it im not making a point against doctor assisted suicide but i find it silly how so many people would highly support and empathise with one and hate the other as if they dont realise that if a person commits suicide without a doctor they may have had well thought out reasons leading up to that point
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so youre telling me that of nonreligious individuals polled find samesex relations morally unacceptable if this is accurate to a fuller representation of society then i am astounded
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,who are these of non religious who think divorce is morally unacceptable for all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am surprised and disappointed that polygamy is something that people care about i do not understand why people have ideas about what is right and wrong between consenting grown ups if ten grown ups want to have a gang bang in a living room somewhere not my business if they all want to say they are married and raise children not my business i am only concerned for the helpless and vulnerable children or adults forced into situations they do not consent to willingly otherwise not my business
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what do the percentages up top refer to cant figure it out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,huh respect to the jews
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,catholics accept divorce and gaylesbian relations more than protestants this is something unexpected
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the jewish are pretty much up for anything
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,isnt it time to address the crescent mooned elephant in the room
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what do the percentages at the top of the image represent they add up to over why are other religions like buddhism and islam completely absent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this should come with a disclaimer that belief that something is immoral may not necessarily mean that that person thinks it should be illegal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a jew from israel i can tell you a few things first the information given here is probably about jews in america which are mostly reform jews and conservative these two are really more modern and im not surprised to see their positive attitude in this diagram but in israel the situation is totally different if those questions had been asked here the results would been definitely against abortion and suicide for sure in israel most people arent religious but we do have religious values most time because we are a bit influenced by the orthodox judaism that is definite in israel orthodox judaism is completely against all of the criterions above except polygamy maybe im myself an atheist like many people finally became in my country but israelis still have some jewish nonmodern values that are against all these controversial topics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,funny how catholics were more okay with divorce than protestants if i recall my history correctly that seems a bit backwards
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,man mormons are boooooring
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how can someone be progay marriage and against polygamy isnt the whole point supposed to be that consenting adults can do what they want
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same here makes me wonder what the differences are other than the whole god thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im an atheist and my ex converted to jewish faith we had a lot of very similar opinions so from my experience they were basically the same
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im an atheist from a relatively nonactive jewish family wasnt earthshattering for anyone haha
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im astonished at how many people think its morally acceptable to have extramarital affairs in overall and more than of the no religion group thats crazy im not religious and am probably more likely to datemarry a nonreligious person so i guess that means ive got a in chance that whoever i end up with will be a cheater wtf i dont understand why anyone who thinks that way would believe in marriage at all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,guaranteed its because a good portion of the people being questioned are cheating on their spouses not many are secretly carrying on a polygamous lifestyle i cant imagine some of the twisted logic the overly religious would use to justify their affairs but i imagine it happens more frequently than we think
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,below
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,religion of peace damn it religion of peace sarcasam
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you need to begin a comment with trigger warning then you probably should just spare us all and not speak at all seriously say what you mean and mean what you say enough with this trigger warning bullshit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think think there is too much of a contradiction doctorassisted suicide is generally discussed in the context of terminallyill patients who have no chance of returning to a normal life in these contexts doctorassisted suicide is about minimizing the suffering when there is no other alternatives generic suicide refers to people taking their own lives due to temporary or treatable reasons in these cases alternatives to suicide exist as if they dont realise that if a person commits suicide without a doctor they may have had well thought out reasons leading up to that point people considering suicide may think they have well thought out reasons but they may not be in a stateofmind where they should be making such irreversible decisions this is why asking for help from others is so important the process for legal doctorassisted suicide has medical requirements involves counseling and takes a relatively long time this is all done to avoid rash decisions made in an instant by a single individual
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,keep in mind no religion does not mean atheist or agnostic in fact most no religion are actually people who still believe in god they just feel estranged from any formal organized religion this is part of a larger trend in society moving away from affiliation with civic groups for instance most independents are actually closet democrats or closet republicans who consistently vote one way but just dont like to call themselves a democrat or republican however a new survey finds that many of the countrys million unaffiliated adults are religious or spiritual in some way twothirds of them say they believe in god more than half say they often feel a deep connection with nature and the earth while more than a third classify themselves as spiritual but not religious and oneinfive say they pray every day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,conservative atheist theres more of them than you would think it would be close to if the question had been should homosexuality be illegal a lot of them that ive seen are libertarians
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not at all many protestants are very fanatic westboro and all these crazy churches are usually protestant
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im guessing that one of those groups may have some unsettling percentages
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,because gaymarriage and polygamy are different things people want the right to marry the person they love just like everybody else and most people believe in monogamy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not sampling orthodox jews seriously affiliation with a religion does not tell you how religious someone is the chart also has no legend giving context i see the source but a title like ethical beliefs of major religions in the us source would go a long way it feels very wrong to group panels two by two like this this kind of graph should be used to distinguish related populations ex age distribution of males vs females i have no idea what the percentages on top mean but they add up to the chart colors are weird the legend unclear i dont want to discourage op but the article made a good job of structuring data you could do groups like what everyone agrees on what is less clear mormon specific stuff add a couple of bullet points like jews and non religious agree on x out of y issues you could also group by topic like sexuality life and death edit also there is another guy doing this viz
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the torah says divorce is fine and abortion is fine because a fetus isnt considered a person until first breath
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,true when i think about protestants i think about northen europeans but i know that in us there are a lot of little fanatic churches
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well if all we cared about was what most people loved gays still wouldnt have the right to marry theres a monumental inconsistency here how does the state have the right to tell people how many people theyre allowed to love any more than they have the right to tell them what gender they have to be do consenting adults get to love and marry who they want or dont they
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how entirely reasonable that two people who dont like each other anymore can go their separate ways and that a fetus isnt a person until it survives the birthing process and becomes biologically independent from its mother thats the first time in recent memory that ive heard something reasonable bordering on nice about a religion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sure thats not talmud where in the torah is that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes consenting adults get to love and marry who they want thats the point heterosexual people seem to prefer monogamy why would you think gay people are different
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i live in thailand buddhism is amazing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exodus for the abortion and deuteronomy for the divorce
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what are you trying to straw man here no one said gay people prefer polygamy any more than straight people thats not the point at all the point is just because most people prefer one partner or most people prefer the opposite sex shouldnt dictate the law some prefer the same sex some prefer multiple partners both straight and gay how can you say that a gay persons love is any more legitimate than a polygamists just because you personally dont love the way that they do
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i agree sadly some people still use it for nationalism and violence httpsenwikipediaorgwikibuddhismandviolencemyanmar
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well burma is an exception not the rule and most buddhism violence is centered around ethniccultural differences not religious the karen have been at civil war for decades now also karen buddhism is actually more of a mix between animism and buddhism so its really not real buddhism also nationalism isnt really a thing now in burma at least yes before burma gained their independence people who were buddhist fought the british but that was more a hey we want to fight for our independence as opposed to fuck you for being christian in fact most of the violence done has been done to the monks not by them again other than the karen they are fighting for independence so everyone fights funny side story one of my kachin friends who is christian asked me if i could get him a few sniper rifles like the ones from american sniper so i can pop he made the noise and then showed the sign for getting your head blown out the burmese
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats cute they have a county that doesnt even exist in my state marked
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah one of the counties in washington theyve got listed as less than black americans marked despite it being a majority black county martin luther king jr king county brynmawrskyway raceethnicitypercent asianhawaiianpacifc hispaniclatino ops data feels like something designed to enrage people not accurately educate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they even marked lucas county oh where the city of toledo pop is at it wouldnt surprise me that there are counties with fewer than black citizens but even a cursory glance makes this hard to take seriously
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can anyone account for the dip in deaths at years its a relatively smooth curve then peaks dips and peaks again
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,plotted in ipython notebook using ggplot backend us mortality data from httpswwwkagglecomcdcmortality unfortunately i was only able to find the data for but overall trends should not have shifted dramatically over years i wanted to do this for british and canadian folks as well but didnt have enough time on my hands one random learning i got out of pulling all the info together is that relatively very few people die of infectious and parasitic diseases these days and nearly all from tuberculosis syphilis and aids the color slice for these arent even visible on the overall chart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is cool did you include leonard cohen and others or are the only celebrities included the ones photographed also i appreciate how you broke it out to cause of death you guys should check out a book that came out this year called how not to die by michael greger md its an amazing look at the top causes of death in america and how most of them can be prevented treated and some even reversed by diet alone whole foods plantbased diet
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the average age of retirement in the us is during the few years after retirement is when you are really going to enjoy your money thats the best i can come up with
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it must be a time of life thing as you suggest or a cohort thing and seeing if it migrates over years should show which or it could be a data error i havent checked but it could be a cohort thing associated a baby boom before and then again after us involvement servicemen starting families before they go then resuming on return

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is it possible to zoom in on the image
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,had to read the article via lynx to get rid of stupid slides
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i found this intensely hard to read in both cases mostly i think because some topics had multiple parents on the outset on another hand because it was damn hard to actually figure out where some things derived from without having really good eyesight
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,very well done im curious about history of western philosophy being at such a high level is that an artifact of references to the book by bertrand russell
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,commenting to come back at a later time on the phone
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rpixelsarebeautiful
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,data is ugly and illegible always have text at a legible angle and unobstructed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this really should be arranged in instead of a circle you know rows the standard way to arrange text lists for centuries
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,warning mobile users mb file above

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i created this viz in tableau public based on excel data provided as part of the makeover monday data viz project over on twitter the link to the original viz is at the bottom left of my viz while the undulating bubbles of the original viz were entertaining they didnt convey the data in a very easy way so i tried to represent the number and frequency of the data breaches more clearly while still maintaining an engaging aesthetic feedback would be welcome this is my first reddit post
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,great report i checked out the source and it was awful
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cool viz is it possible to move the tooltip to the leftright of the graph part sometimes you have to go back and forth with the mouse to compare values
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i knowundulating bubbles probably rarely if ever represent a good viz
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,unfortunately there is no way to control that in tableau the best i could do would be to have a text area below the main graph that has the information related to each breach something i may play with thanks for the feedback

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the media really did a number on the whole race situation freddy gray died under some unjust circumstances but half the cops on trial are black the police force in that area are mostly minorities the police chief is black the mayor is black the president is black yet it turned into a black vs white situation because of the media kind of shows that sometimes talking about racism just creates racism

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,musicovery i think maybe
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,interesting data thanks for sharing id recommend a bar graph though pie charts are for showing percentages not whats happening here while bar graphs are useful for quickly comparing quantities more generally
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just speculating here but is it because female buyers have experienced parents helping them buy cars couples have collective bargaining and single men for the most part younger and less experienced in buying cars want to be a man and probably request help from parents less so than their female counter parts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i got this data from a sourcing tablet survey and the dealers dms dealer management software i used metachartcom to make the bar graph i was curious and i plan to look at more data i have to see the overall picture edited for mods
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not sure if accurate but i read an article that had purchase data by gender and ferrari was male as in there was not a single record of a ferrari purchased by a female anywhere in the world it might have just been for that particular year the article was years old so ish but that blew my mind the most purchased female car was the volkswagen beetle
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you are right not sure what i was thinking
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,another possible issue is the type of car for example in this dataset men are more likely to buy a new car where i would imagine perhaps incorrectly that profit margins are larger this dataset allows for the possibility that women pay higher prices for the same car but are more likely to buy cars that have lower profit margins for those not familiar with simpsons paradox httpsenmwikipediaorgwikisimpsonsparadoxexamples
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the problem with this whole graph is that it isnt single men and single women it is men that came alone and women that came alone sure some of them will be single but a lot will not be and are just shopping for a car on their own actually that isnt a problem with the graph and article those never actually say single op added that part so you know word of the alphabet op
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its also because having a spouse be present at the time of purchase increases the resistance of accepting negotiating terms

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why let truth ruin a perfectly good point
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ill see your and raise you graphs this is not my content
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its nice to see this many people just like hearing what they want to hear about the sat iq and testing in general even though their beliefs are often completely wrong as a scientist it is refreshing to see some of the actual literature presented rather than a misleading hackjob plot by journalists
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what is the actual adjusted for ses effect on score what is the actual heritability coefficient the actual values are important
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would argue that the literature is being used very selectively here to support a specific position also many of these added analyses have issues and the inferences being drawn over state what can be done with the collinear set of predictors
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,glad to hear it the rest of his blog is equally solid
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think its in that blog but from httpsjournalistsresourceorgstudiessocietyeducationsessocioeconomicstatussatgraderelationshipsandincollegeadmissionsdecisions of variance in sat scores is shared with ses as measured here as a composite of mothers education fathers education and parental income
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,many of these analyses do not seem to be controlling for multicolliniarity among predictors that would inflate the r values also your claim of the heritibilty of intelligence being around percent is higher than the meta analyses ive read that indicate a figure more like percent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what do you mean by actual
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also your claim of the heritibilty of intelligence being around percent is higher than the meta analyses ive read that indicate a figure more like percent almost every single study ive seen places iq heritability at least at and most put it closer to by age its been shown to be about as heritable as height
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also your claim of the heritibilty of intelligence being around percent is higher than the meta analyses ive read that indicate a figure more like percent most estimates put heritability of intelligence north of are typical amongst the developed world as people near adulthood heritability increases markedly as kids mature and the shared environment influence school systems neighborhood housing etc fall to something pretty close to zero on average see for example keep in mind that measurement error significantly deflates the heritability estimates which will tend to show up in the nonshared environment because the tests arent perfect measures of the construct we are trying to measure the same person taking the same test will get somewhat different results each time they take the test when the data are aggregated like this issues like measurement error will tend to get mostly averaged out creating a stronger relationship than you might naively expect
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,directly link to the httpwwwredditcomrdataisbeautifulwikiindexwikioriginalsources of the visualization or tag the post as if you made the visualization this post has been removed please once you believe the post is ready to be reinstated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow if this is at all accurate i feel like most media outlets are downplaying the lopsidedness by quite a bit do you think thats because its in their selfinterest to make it seem like a close race or just because so many trump predictions have been proven wrong already
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well if hillary is going to win by such a large margin i might as well vote for trump just for fun theres no way that could go wrong right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why come isnt represented in the stats
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for somebody that lives in a solidly red state and typically wants parties to exist in us politics is it better to vote for the party that we actually like or the one that is more likely to get the numbers is there an argument for backing johnson just to get any party above funding thresholds will this in the long run help get rid of fptp faster
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,god i cant even believe gary johnson is as high as he is on a side note nate silvers not been on his game lately id take this prediction with a grain of salt edit i cant spell im sorry
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hillary winning arizona that would be surprising
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,someone share this to rthedonald
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so theyre giving trump a chance of winning that still feels way too high to be comfortable
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wonder if this ever becomes a selffulfilling prophecy how much do the results influence peoples decisions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,who will win not the people of america thats for damn sure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the gop nominating trump was pathetic even in the past month trumps chances have gone down hillary is sure to win the election
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the fact that one of these two people will become president is pretty depressing trump is a racist nationalist and hillary is a lying crook to the nth degree i realize im going to get downvoted by both supporters but that wont change the fact that despite which of them becomes president the american people are going to lose and that includes the supporters
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,surprised its already that bad for trump the big unknown is the massive latino vote absolutely huge latino populations exist in the southwest to the point that most of them will likely be latino majority by the next election most of them are already up around latino population this is not some marginal minority
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what caused such a dramatic change in n carolina the past few weeks
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wonder if they factored in the inevitable republican votediddling still an awful lot of hackable touchscreen voting machines out there and a lot of stealthdisenfranchising going on exit polls when properly done used to be quite accurate but they have been inexplicably slipping towards failing to predict conservative wins in recent years on top of that i think the republicans were too busy ripping each other to shreds before they havent turned their considerable hate machine up to yet on clinton that is going to be something to see
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not sure what is more scary hillary becoming president or somehow her losing and trump gets it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no mention of jill stein
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lets just not elect anyone
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,go trump go
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no bernie column the write ins will be yuge

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nate silver was wildly off during his predictions of the primaries why believe it now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a little bit of both its in their own self interest to generate drama and conflict to get more views theres also that indeterminate invisible specter for her email scandals but trump has proven to be a wild card and worthy of concernhis campaigns success warrants attention
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,little of column a little of column b
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,an utter blowout doesnt get attention
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not as much as youd think nate silver predicts theyd both get around of the popular vote with clinton leading a little its only with the electoral college that theres a landslide
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well there is a lot of noise right now trump was trending up a month ago when hillary was getting attacked on both sides also a lot of state polls have shown this being close in more states than previously thought trump has been polling poorly in red states and doing better than average in battleground states
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if all potential hillary voters think her win is a foregone conclusion they might not bother to vote low democrat turnout could drastically change the election
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if it goes wrong just whine until you get a doover
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and thats what stupid people are saying about brexit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think youre finally getting it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do you want another brexit because thats how you get another brexit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,please god dont let the brexit phenomenon happen here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no joke public policy polling is including sweet meteor o death in their next national poll
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no more years no more years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rofl this is great
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wants parties to exist in us politics they wont you can get new parties yes but theyll just supplant one of the other two
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if youre state isnt going to be close maybe if a third party reaches a certain threshold of popular vote i think they get invited to the debates next cycle and get some campaign money rest of us really should vote for the person we want in office or risk what happened in the uk last weekend
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,long asnwer short by voting third party you effectively give half a vote to the party you least want to win fptp just works in such a way that it simply becomes a system there is mathematical proof for this you therefore end up having to vote for the party that you least dislike if you vote third party it just means that the party you least dislike has one less vote which just strengthens the party you like the least cgp grey has some political videos that go into a bit more detail while still keeping it simple httpwwwcgpgreycompoliticsintheanimalkingdom
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id like to actually know the answer to this im currently considering voting for either jill stein or gary johnson but i cant decide who i think i may like jill steins policies more but johnson is definitely polling higher and hes on the ballot in all states stein is only on the ballot in im definitely not voting for either trump or hillary so please no one respond with replies about how im wasting my vote
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,silvers modellingdatabased forecasts were on point its when he tried his hand at punditry that he really flopped this is pretty much the same model that called all states correctly in so it definitely has some credibility
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in a trump vs clinton election its not hard to believe that of the people want to vote for anyone other than trump vs clinton ill bet a lot of those dont know very much about gary johnsons positions they might still end up voting for him even if they dont end up liking his positions just to avoid voting for trump or hillary
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats not really fair to say silver developed a new methodology and tested it out during the primaries it actually was pretty close on the dem side now hes testing it in the general but theyve been clear this whole time that pollsplus is experimental
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,even if he was wrongthats one hell of a landslide its going to taint our countrys history books forever we the people overwhelmingly voted in a known crook because the alternative was a bombastic bigot but politics aside theres really no way for any other outcome just perhaps slightly different margins id like to see someone assemble all the data visualizations that uses from this one to any subsequent ones layered together like a gif to see how the prediction changes as time passes perhaps with a correlation list below it to try and understand the reasons for the numbers adjustments over time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nobody is all the time he can only go by the polls and they were way off when it came to trump
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hillary clinton donald trump
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is that sub for real or just a circle jerk
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thatll be just as effective as posting hillarys emails to rhillaryclinton or rdemocrats
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hillary having above a is too much for comfort
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they havent nominated trump yet thats not until mid july
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they said the same thing though when he ran for the nomination and now look at him
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,received the most primary votes of any other gop candidate in the history of the gop and they gave him the nomination are you kidding me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theyre betting on theyll better control the primary process and have contenders that are likeable by the people and party favorites basically not cruz or trump types
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you are the same hillarybots that say sanders is being sexist for not dropping out if a white man called you pathetic hed get arrested verbal assault verbal assault you people define sexism and bigotry white men not welcome its her turn
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to be fair trump is a racist nationalist and a lying crook hilary is just one of those
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its incredible after the election the republican party does their autopsy and concludes they need to appeal more to women and minorities develop a better ground game better data analysis etc if they want to have any hope of winning the presidency then trump comes along and goes nope lets double down on everything that went wrong last time theyre already unskewing the polls and its only june
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,remember that chance of winning is different than percentage of vote the prediction is of the popular vote for hillary that would be the lowest winning percentage since bush in and the only other winner with less than since richard nixon was bill clinton in with when perot picked up but hillary is more than trump which would be the largest margin since bill clintons reelection so hillary and trump are really pushing people to gary johnson who is listed at the last third parties to get more than of the vote were ross perot in and george wallace in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the reason being that she is that low in the polls i really wonder what would have happened to the green party if ralph nader hadnt destroyed it in pity
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wildly off they were right of the time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well he predicted all states last time and hes using a similar model now from the sounds of it his methodology for the primaries was very different and thats the part that was ineffective i personally am a little more skeptical because youre right he did not provide any particularly good predictions about the primaries relative to any other pundits however a for track record on the last presidential election which seems like itd be much easier to model then a primary is more then enough for me to still have confidence in his methods
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he admitted to being a pundit and not a pollster a while back he removed his leftleaning punditry this time around
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it would be chaos exactly thats why they wont do it they would rather distance themselves from trump and try again in years than ignore the will of their voters and lose a sizable chunk of them for the foreseeable future
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my inclination is that the gop would only lose votes by not running trump and hillarys support would stay roughly the same thus they keep the candidate their party members chose can you elaborate on what you mean by having three people in the electoral college changing the vote there have always been more than two candidates for president i mean maybe not always but usually the greens and libertarians are running candidates as well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,trump was a wild card during the primaries because his rhetoric resonated with a party that always been receptive towards voters that held racist beliefs however the ge is far less white than the republican primary was
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so youre saying its only a landslide within the group that actually counts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,read the methodology for the polling its very interesting it states that they give state polls more weight as they tend to be more accurate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,best out of is needed for content in this sub of course
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,worked for bush
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the people who voted for brexit are no less stupid than people who voted to stay many understood the economic consequences they were making a cultural decision
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but the brexit polls all said it would be quite close so the same logic doesnt hold
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the grassroots movement begins
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is what i dont get about the clamoring for third parties if a third party isnt supplanting a major one and isnt just splitting votes and always ensuring victory for the less preferable party then it has to be an environment where parties are splitting the vote in a way where none have a majority but under that system you have to form a coalition in congress to get anything done so people get to feel pure at the ballot box sure but their party is going to end up compromising on a lot of things which is what pisses people off about dems and reps and gets them to support parties in the first place
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for federal funding for debates
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,solidly red state and winnertakeall structure of the state electoral college means that if im not in the majority my vote doesnt matter anyway it becomes nothing but a vote of confidence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats not an absolute rule in canada we have major parties using fptp and in quebec there are major parties due to the separatists
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,long asnwer short by voting third party you effectively give half a vote to the party you least want to win thats assuming you prefer one of the major parties to the other it certainly seems that theres a widening segment of the population that hate them both equally or near enough that it doesnt make a difference
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,stein and johnson arent even comparable wtf
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he didnt necessarily flop either trump was just anamolous historically speaking endorsements and favorability ratings are a much better predictor of primary success think michelle bachmann or herman cain breaking out in early polling during trump failed in both of those when speaking about missing trump harry enten stated that if they looked only at polls they wouldve called trump maybe as early as august of however thats just not how predicting primaries goes if they only looked at polling in they wouldve been wrong many many times its also worth noting that shifted positions on trump by january and began calling him the likely nominee as early as february in actually predicting each primary nate was above in one of the craziest primary cycles in history for those looking for more information read nates httpfivethirtyeightcomfeatureshowiactedlikeapunditandscrewedupondonaldtrump
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you know to be fair nobody could have predicted this cycle it was supposed to be a clinton bush rematch and then the populist rage blew the whole thing to hell kudos for being correct as often as he is despite this new x factor my point about the grain of salt is that looks good on paper but still requires the follow through i dont want folks getting complacent this is by no means over and trump can pull a michigan and fuck everybody
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he predicts using percentages of probability he is always right regardless
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,itll be interesting to see whether he will actually draw many votes from clinton because policywise hes completely imcompatible with the progressive platform i can see some people voting for him regardless though just out of spite
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,those percents are not proportions of voters theyre probabilities of results so had obama with a chance of winning in not an actual number i dont remember exactly when he won with some of the vote that fit perfectly with the prediction that is he wasnt predicting that of people would vote for obama
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but theyve been clear this whole time that pollsplus is experimental i think its important to note that they did a fairly accurate job of prediction each individual primary as it got close to each primary but werent great at the qualitative long term view of how the primaries would turn out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,known crooks tend to have committed crimes clinton hasnt even been formally accused of any crimes let alone convicted can we please save the vitriol until that actually happens
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,some of those trump university patsies might refer to the bombastic racist as a crook too its really a choice between crooks
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,go back to bengazi grandma
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hard to tell likely some of both
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,anyone having any chance of winning is frightening s
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ok presumptive nominee
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to be fair he won in the primaries because he was the only guy who stood out in an incredibly crowded field and nobody took him seriously until it was too late now that its just two candidates left that doesnt fly anymore hes still got a chance apparently but something big would have to change for that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im pretty sure they only said one of those things and not even as much
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,huh how was ops comment sexist or bigoted you can be prohillary and not be a hillbot or not arbitrarily wanting hillary to win because of her gender
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cant argue with that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think you misunderestimate the amount of sticking power that general anger and fear of other plays in society people dont support it when asked in a poll but in the privacy of a voting booth they vote it its why candidates like trump usually do better than their polling
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so hillary and trump are really pushing people to gary johnson go gary go run gary run but remember if gary drops out of the race most of those all republican voters as he is a libertarian former republican possibly or would stick with their party suddenly the race is close
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i really wonder what would have happened to the green party if ralph nader hadnt destroyed it in well instead of being a completely irrelevant party that once got almost of the popular vote they would be a completely irrelevant party that never even sniffed of the popular vote
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hey how about ralph shut up ralph this is no time for joking
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the electoral college isnt a group its the way votes are counted during election day each state is given a certain number of points based on its population and if the majority of people in that state vote for a certain candidate the candidate wins all the points
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,out of
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but it increasingly looks like all the promises of change are going to come up short
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the people who voted for brexit are no less stupid than people who voted to stay that might not be the case the people who voted for bexit are less educated than people who voted to stay and there is an obvious correlation between intelligence and education the people who voted for brexit are therefore likely to be objectively stupider on the whole
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the point is that some people voted leave just for the lolz because they assumed that remain would definitely win
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what economic consequences the has gone up since the vote people panicked first days and then common sense prevailed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,their party is going to end up compromising on a lot of things which is what pisses people off about dems and reps wow you couldnt be more wrong when was the last time the republicans and democrats compromised on anything congress is fucking full of gridlock and filibustering with very little compromise thats what people are sick of any bill that tries to get passed is instantly turned into a my party vs the other party issue and nothing ever gets done a third party would help this if anything
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it does have a strong mathematical tendency to develop a party system even if there is a third or fourth party it usually ends up being inconsequential but even if that doesnt happen you will never get the amount of parties of consequence or nuance as an actually democratic system based on things such as mixed member proportional and even mixed member proportional parliamentary systems can leave a lot to be wished for in terms of nuance
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in that case voting third party may still make sense however if elected of which there isnt much chance you will still end up with a rigged system eventually its just that the third party will become one of the old ones
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did you read my comment at all i dont get your point im thinking about voting for one or the other so they have to somehow be comparable is there some rule that says if i like two candidates they have to be similar well regardless if its relevant at all they are somewhat comparable they are both not trump and not hillary also they both have somewhat similar stances on social issues which i think are more important than the economy for this election so instead of just downvoting me and saying wtf why dont you add some meaningful part to the discussion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the primaries are also much more dynamic than the general because they happen over a long peroid of time events can unfold which cause canidates to surge or fall more rapidly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats not necessarily true you can predict using percentages and still be wrong because your estimated probabilities are way off
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,policywise hes completely imcompatible with the progressive platform i cant imagine this is true prochoice prodrug decriminalization promarijauna legalization antiwar progay rights i mean the only thing that is incompatible with progressive platforms is his economic policy but even on that his tax plan calls for a big prebate for the low income hes also stated hell maintain a safety net
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well not completely aside from being proabortion hes the only antiwar or at least waraverse candidate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah for all practical purposes his policies are irrelevant since hes not going to win most of his votes will come from people who just didnt want to vote for the alternatives
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,young voters dont care about policies only who social media tells them is the good guy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think youre confused or responding to the wrong comment im talking about the that gary johnson is getting in polls he obviously doesnt have a chance of winning the election
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,keep moving those goalposts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,kinda my point im just pointing towards the most obvious character flaws
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and in the general election there is a good chance hell be the only guy that stands out in a field of two that nobody takes seriously until its too late that same hubris that hell just fall off is part of how hes gotten this far when you have a candidate that breaks the traditional rules of the game you cant be confident that you can accurately model how it will play out he absolutely should have been sunk by now with all of his miniscandals and controversy he hasnt similarly he may ride wave of support as republicans colesce around him when faced with the idea of hilary or if they decide he isnt as bad as they thought or he just endlessly mocks her like megyn kelly in a debate and people go for it or he makes a bunch of intentionally sexist statements and people support him because he keeps it nonpc a view reddit loves saying he would never win is like saying the uk would never exit the eu at the time people didnt take it seriously and now you look back and its obvious how much they discounted a possibility
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in fact its the opposite most gop candidates have locked down the nomination must faster than trump in fact your logic is flawed most gop races dont have people vying for the parties nomination in there was only trump locked down the nomination with an over confidence interval when rubio dropped out never before in the history of the gop has a candidate for the nomination stayed in the race with chance of receiving the nomination literally in a man race john kasich trumps victory took much longer and was in many ways less efficient than previous campaigns how are you measuring efficiency its certainly not based off of how much money the candidates spent never before has a presidential candidate spent so little to win so much according to federal election commission records billionaire eccentric donald trump has spent less than any other presidential primary frontrunner in the past years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre better off ignoring the trump brigade wise words are lost on them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,gary wont drop out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,actually it is a group just not a permanent group
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think its to early to call but you have a point
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,on the other hand old people were more likely to vote leave and far less people went to university in the olden days that doesnt mean theyre less intelligent most of todays uni students would have had to leave school at and work in a factory if they were born half a century earlier
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whats the evidence that that occurred and that it occurred enough to affect the final result ive heard this mentioned quit a bit lately
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ya i said that two days ago things have gotten exponentially better since then we can just boot the muslims out and send them back to the stone age
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,democrats and republicans dont compromise because they dont have to as one party will always have a majority my point is that people are angry about intraparty compromise for example people are angry that democrats arent an anticorporate party and the liberal wing compromises with the more centrist wing on business issues thats a big part of antiestablishment sentiment among the left but under a system where we have a relatively small socialist party and a democratic party in congress with say a republican party and a maybe a small nationalist party that intraparty compromise just happens after elections rather than before through institutional means to get a majority socialists form a coalition with democrats and the agenda they go for is a compromise between the two like on healthcare you wont get singlepayer but the socialists end up supporting expanded employer insurance mandates and the democrats live with that even though businesses dont like that of course thats exactly what happened in the democratic party in just on a less public level in the end multiparty systems entail the same compromises the current antiestablishment left dont like the only difference is that those people get to feel morally pure or whatever by voting for the socialist party instead of having to vote directly on a compromise established before the election
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am voting for johnson my hope and i assume other johnson supporters is that he will get in the debates and give more exposure to third parties for the election in the numbers are just not with him in this election if he were more popular he could win the votes of dems and reps who wont vote for hillary or trump and maybe siphon some more after the debates but that is not very likely
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if your motivation for voting for a candidate has nothing to do with the policies they want to put in place then your position is just ridiculous any party but the two who always win isnt an intelligent political view choosing between stein or johnson should be a nobrainer because their political views are diametric opposites
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean all you listed were social policies economic policy regulation wealth redistribution isnt some trivial part of the progressive platform m
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre right i was confused
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive only ever given you one goal post not sure how you can accuse me of moving them but seriously shes broken no law that anyone can point to i think its pretty stupid to call her a crook when she hasnt even stolen anything especially when if youre wrong youve handed the election to mr trump over false accusations the price of jumping to conclusions here is way too high lets wait for the fbi report and go from there and thats been my position on mrs clinton the whole time so i have no idea why youre bringing up goalposts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh its not like he could never win of course he could but i just think that if he managed to turn the thing around it would have to be for different reasons than what made him win the nomination
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how much is correct the record paying you i dont miss the shrieking dc bars and restaurants radical east coast elitists everywhere if you disagree or support the gop in any way you are called crass and most likely having a public school education then i stand up and ask them to step outside lumber jack body type they couldnt see from the high white linen table whoa now i will have to alert the police if you insist on embarrassing our group like this no not your group just you chad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politicians dont walk something back like that unless they have to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you are conflating terms its not are they intelligent broadly but are they educated in a manner that allows them to effectively evaluate the options higher education does likely help with that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont believe there have been any polls on the question
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cant tell if youre joking so no i was talking about johnson not trump
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,uh huh first its wait for the fbi to recommend charges then itll be wait for an indictment then itll be election day then itll be wait for the courts to decide then itll be so we cant very well let an ongoing trial interfere with the second term election youre right we cant make the criminal call of guilty today we know that the server was illegal though because the text of the law is public knowledge and the existence of the server is public knowledge the existence of that server violates the text of that law we also know the server was not secured and we know the text of the laws requiring classified communications to be protected we know that law does not make exceptions for digital communication and weve seen others prosecuted for similar actions we also know the text of the law regarding preservation of federal records and we know that deleting emails violates that law that is enough smoke for me to infer a fire
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cant tell if willfull ignorance or outright lying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,actually existence of the server does not violate law what matters is whether she transmitted documents that were classified at the time no email we know of the fbi may know more fits that description furthermore other people doing similar things have not been prosecuted ever secretary of state since email existed has had private email according to the state departments own report no one has even considered bringing charges any of them so yeah lets wait
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,try honest assessment of the facts we can disagree and thats fine but im neither willfully ignorant nor lying if you have facts to the contrary please share them if shes committed a crime id like to hear it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,executive order and usc sec of the federal code make it unlawful to send or store classified information on personal email it is now known that classified emails were sent and received it is therefore a matter of fact that hillary clinton violated federal law section of the national archives and records administration nara requirements states that agencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency record keeping system hillary clinton did not turn over all emails even if all emails were innocuous her conduct still violates federal law
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,then youre lacking sufficient facts honesty is great unless youre not fully informed then it has a high correlation with dishonesty im not going to get out a soapbox and lay out the facts here theyre so pervasive so prevalent so easy to obtain if youre not encountering them its equivalent to dodging raindrops in a downpour not likely
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no email made public was classified at the time of transmission as required by nara puts a burden on the state department not on its employees it says that the state department must take steps to ensure that certain things are not done the state department had policies that prohibited what clinton and every other sos did boom nara complied with it is also not a criminal statute but a regulation forgive me but you comments sound like those of someone who doesnt know how to read statutes and thats ok not everyone needs to as a practicing attorney though i have specific training in interpreting these things
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive seen tons of facts and sought out more none of them show clinton guilty of any crime the email scandal from what is public is not criminal the whitewater stuff was debunked in the the clinton foundation stuff is perfectly normal and the people making hay out of it have no idea how diplomacy works if they think ksa got special treatment due to that have i missed something all of these so called scandals are trumped up nonsense that only gets thrown at clinton because shes a woman
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that is blatantly false which was both received and then sent as copied text much like hillary herself every claim you have made is fabricated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so the proper analogy would be walking through a rainstorm getting hit with raindrops and then claiming youre not wet ok i dont care about an anonymous person on the internet enough to correct your record
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats news to me a quick investigation shows that no unbiased news sites reported it but i dont see any refutations anywhere either i would suggest that its alarming to me that i cant find an ap or reuters story on it that usually means its nothing but this bares watching by the way every time you ascribe motive to me fabrication rather than mistake or simply not having seen a story posted only to the most biased and false major news outlet it tells me that this is personal for you that you have a hatred rather than a desire for truth hope im wrong about that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so when folks tell you that the media is biased in favor of clinton you probably think theyre crazy when you are presented with damning evidence that no media source disputes you criticize the media source that did run the story fine you can choose to believe that email is genuine or not it is genuine and it is searchable among the database of released emails but that point is actually moot anyway because it actually doesnt matter whether the classified materials were marked or not marked at all those materials were and they are classified the law does not allow anyone to mishandle classified materials under any scenario in other words if an apple in the supermarket bears no price tag that doesnt mean i get to walk out of the store with it if you are going to use an unsecured private server it stands to reason an abundance of caution ought to be used to ensure that all messages be screened as not classified before transmission that step clearly did not occur as classified messages are indisputably among those captured and released to the public since no steps were taken to mitigate the possibility of classified transmissions the server is evidence of criminal negligence whether messages were tagged or not even more seriously in my opinion workrelated emails have been discovered among the batch of emails hillary clinton deleted federal records regulations exist to protect and inform the public circumventing these rules is an act of contempt and hostility toward the republic and toward the citizens of the united states i take no issue with the sentiment that justice be allowed to run its course hillary clinton ought to step down and allow that process to proceed it is unreasonable to ask the american voter to rule on her qualifications for office before these matters are resolved if she is innocent of these charges she is indisputably qualified for office if she is guilty the text of the law explicitly states she is permanently ineligible for the office how can you expect the voters to make that call before a court does edit downvoted without rebuttal im not offended there is no rebuttal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the media is biased against mrs clinton by a wide margin she has gotten more negative coverage than any candidate including mr trump you are simply not looking at facts if you think the media is biased in favor of mrs clinton given that youre damn right that im not interested in listening to fox news or at least in taking their claims as true without corroboration they have time and again demonstrated that they do not care about the facts only about presenting a conservative narrative so when they present a story that is not corroborated by ap or reuters or any other basic reporting service that troubles me ap and reuters report everything everything im not at all suggesting that fox news is wrong here im watching for this story and have read a dozen articles from rightwing sources about it i hope i find some outside source discussing it soon but for the moment it doesnt change my minded because i consider it to be a possible fact not yet confirmed even more seriously in my opinion workrelated emails have been discovered among the batch of emails hillary clinton deleted federal records regulations exist to protect and inform the public circumventing these rules is an act of contempt and hostility toward the republic and toward the citizens of the united states this part is complete bullshit not that it didnt happen but your certainty about mrs clintons contempt thats bullshit have you ever worked for a government agency the amount of documentation required for various sunshine laws is insane the cost of this transparency is that government employees of all kinds dont take meetings in their offices anymore but rather in coffee shops across the street because they dont want to have to deal with the paperwork of having a visitor in the building congressmen email each other about litigation and negotiations on their personal email on personal servers because they dont want to have to disclose the negotiations to the public the entire culture vis a vis public information is to do as much in private places as possible because the current transparency laws are so burdensome the secretaries of state for the last years have all done what mrs clinton did not out of contempt but because its simply debilitating to have to the job of running a diplomatic body all while under public scrutiny this isnt malice its laziness and for what its worth you want her to step aside for mr trump such a decision would be the most damaging single action mrs clinton could do to the united states if mr trump wins in november the united states will face its biggest crisis since the civil war you think mrs clinton has shown contempt of us now asking her to hand us to a madman who wants to nuke europe and end the amendment would be far more contemptuous in my opinion than using some email servers actions have consequences and even if mrs clinton were guilty which i dont believe she is but she could be the cost of prosecuting her would be to horrifically damage the union i dont care to pay that price
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the unacceptable damage to the union is incurred when we willfully ignore the rule of law cast aside our principles and our doctrine and vote to elect the unelectable that act is a disgrace to the dignity of the nations highest office if the alternative is not guilty of federal crime the alternative is the superior choice fear is irrelevant to fact
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you for your original content op ive added to your user flair as gratitude if you didnt already have official subreddit flair for the readers the poster has provided you with information regarding where or how they got the data source and the tool used to generate the visual tools for this post to ensure this information isnt buried i have stickied this link below for your convenience i hope this sticky assists you in having an informed discussion in this thread or inspires you to remix this data for more information please httpswwwredditcomrdataisbeautifulwikiflairwikiocflair
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,op i am not sure if this is the correct way to title this graph or something along that line is pennsylvania really a state that is the least effective in the nation pennsylvania was a swing state at the time and the whole nation was watching who pa would decide on nevertheless it does make sense how states like wyoming and hawaii have a lot of vote strength but some states just do not fit the metric perhaps some kind of measure that has the disparity between the amount of voters for each party and the voter turnout for each state in consideration would be better but i guess this is accurate not perfectwhich is a stats saying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think you flipped the percentages in the description what you described would be
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a state with of the electoral college votes and of the total voters would have a vote power of real strange definition of vote power are you sure you didnt get that backwards as it is a state with vote power of means that each persons vote counts half as much as one with a vote power of also this isnt really beautiful its hard to get any sense of overall trends when you have to read the numbers for each state good for checking your value for a particular state bad for answering questions like republican vs democrat vote power which i presume its oriented towards given your use of coloring should probably also have mentioned the coloring scheme used even if its fairly obvious
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,source for data httpwwwnytimescomelectionsresultspresident tool used gimp
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so the more voters in a state will mean a lower vote power per person in that state whats wrong with that in a representative republic such as this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,good afternoon before we can approve your post can you please list the tool you used to generate this visual eg if a reader wanted to reproduce this map how would they do so
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if by whole country you mean ny texas and california then sure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,added sorry
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that presupposes these states vote as a unified block which they dont there is no country that uses the sane principle of one person one vote and that is dominated by its largest areas
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no probs thanks for the oc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,data from the uscis website httpswwwdhsgovyearbookimmigrationstatistics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we created this the oldfashioned way with straight htmljscss looking to open source soon we have nothing to hide data scraped from httpwikileaksorg with python requests beautifulsoup
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a post must include a this post has been removed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,definitely interesting but the title is a bit misleading income vs wealth
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,data source censusgov visualized with highcharts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,could anyone relate this the percent of people in each county with bachelors degrees theres a map with the percent of the population in each county with a college education and a degree i think it would be interesting to see if this map is more influenced by major cities san francisco and dc or education
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,data source i obtained th list of all the terror incidents since form here httpwwwrandorgnsrdprojectsterrorismincidentsdownloadhtml i categorized each group as islamic or non islamic myself the ideology of a group is not always clear so i tried to error on the side of nonislamic tools python and
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i found the that nate silver made to show this trend much more clearly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,data was collected via fivethiryeight in this article httpfivethirtyeightcomfeaturesthemostdiversecitiesareoftenthemostsegregated tableau public was used to visualize sankey style slope chart comparing how the most populous us cities compare in citywide and neighborhood diversity highly diverse cities with low neighborhood diversity is an indication of high segregation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is awesome i found a mistake though nashville city is connected to seattle neighborhood and seattle city is connected to nashville neighborhood i didnt check them all i just happened to see this one
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,anecdotally jersey city has many different neighborhoods that have a dominant sect for lack of a better word its the way people prefer to live ie with those that share common culture or values
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,doesnt the data and scatter plot directly contradict your headline it looks like a very strong correlation between city diversity and neighborhood diversity to me with a few exceptions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seems like there may need to be some control for location a lot of cities on the west coast seemed to be not as bad as the east maybe what this tells us has more to do about east coast than it does about cities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or years ago i had a friend from la tell me that the chi was super segragated never really noticed but he was right crazy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats the article i got the data i agree scatter plot is much better at telling the story i developed this because i saw a version of a sankey slope chart and wanted to try and recreate in tableau using this dataset im still a student so much of what i share is part of a learning experience
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,santa ana city connected to atlanta neighborhood i would go through and check the lines again sorry for having to point this out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for pointing that out there was an issue with rank function it has been corrected
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you look at the scatter plots every city is below the degree dotted line which represents equal city to neighbohood diversity anything below that line indicates segregation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fair enough just thought it was worth also linking to the dataviz that inspired your dataviz
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its corrected now needed to modify the rank functions thanks again
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,awesome no problem its an awesome graphic
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i thought i did that in my original post but better to provide the direct link to viz apologies for confusion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if only government and business was as transparent and apologetic as you get ready for the world to let you down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was just kind of wondering about this so i decided to crunch a few numbers i copiedpasted from all the default subs aboutmoderators page into an excel spreadsheet i then used vba to copy all the names subreddits into an access database and ran a few sql queries to pull those numbers i ignored bots like automoderator and users who where only there to tweak css the only people included have either full permissions or at least access permission the visualization was made using an excel chart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i remember russia getting introduced to colorado potato beetle since the middle of the it started much earlier but hit heavily in the soviets who were relying heavily on individual potato fields as part of their staple diet were literally got bent spending the whole summers asses up heads down in the potato bushes cleaning them up from the horrible disgusting larva the expression was колорадский жук поставил россию раком wild theories developed about cia sending them as some kind of biological weapon of mass douchebaggery there is not a single insect i hated more than that stupid beetle well no i still hate cockroaches more but that beetle is a solid second
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the theory i heard most often is that they were brought over from the us during wwi to be used as biological weapon against germany
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why am i not on the list i am for sure one of the best chest players and to the guy who commented first on this you are shadow banned
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,visualization of the greatest chest players from might want to repost this to fix the title
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,amazing to see fischer then kasparov then carlson soar away from the competition
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that run by the american morphy in the starting at the age of is amazing as is the german lasker who went on for decades
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ron jeremy is statistically the worlds greatest chest player i dont know who this bobby fischer guy is because ive never seen any of his movies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,must be from the future or alternatively before the century
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh god damnit im a player myself and i let that slip facepalm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am for sure one of the best chest players i like boobs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but the space shuttle has brought way more astronauts into orbit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the number of lines of code doesnt equal quality ill take unix and pine any day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,google is the incredible they are basically at the cutting edge of machine learning and technology googlecom has complete monopoly as the number website in the world
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hd dvd player as a programmer seems to be an outlier any insight into why this may be the case
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it should be noted that the code written to fly the shuttles is officially certified as damn near perfect
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in addition it is concise and accurate code ie high quality whereas google doesnt especially try to reduce the amount of code since most mistakes can be fixed without any real damage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also consider because its designed to operate in fucking space its designed with a the less cogs the less chance something goes terribly wrong mentality
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes thats true also now the pcs in the space are old machines like pentium or similar because the reliability is the most important feature but this article talks about the number of lines of code not the hardware obviously nowadays the lines of code are way more than years ago but google code is impressive and the machine can write it by themself new code machine learning
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but google has brought me porn so
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hey google one of your bots is trying to english and failing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,modern settop dvdbd players are filled to the brim with bloated slow java code because someone decided that settops needed the ability to browse the internet and be able to run apps the slowness is mostly due to the lowgrade processors they put in the settops but the fact they are being tasked with executing java code that probably wasnt developed with performance in mind doesnt help
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you have no idea how right you are a little while ago i was at a software training event on doing proper code audits the guy said nasa about once an hour for hours of training they developed effectively all software testing techniques out there and what they didnt develop they enhanced they even developed techniques to deal with what if the hard drive slips and runs a segment of code randomly and the tools to simulate it and the most amazing part they gave it all away for free
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats nonsense machines dont write code by any sensible definition and the whole idea has nothing to do with machine learning
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,at the cutting edge i did feel like that sounds wrong
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,google is the incredible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to developers and viz experts looking to use traffic light palettes of redyellowgreen ive beaten this topic to death several times but to someone with redgreen colorblindness using the httpwwwcolorblindnesscomcobliscolorblindnesssimulator please consider using colorblindfriendly palettes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i used to do residential leasing in one of the bigger cities in this list medians may be a lot more representative than averages for that purpose i know specifically in the city im talking about its in the sq ft range on this chart but more realistically there were two separate markets i lived with a roommate in a sq ft high end apartment for about a minute bus ride out of the hot zone but i rented some places to clients that were for sq ft youd be perfectly able to find sq ft in a relatively central place for under in a building with parking and amenities if you wanted to rent from a private owner you could get an even better deal a city like madison wi is a good example its both a college town and a state capitol so its got both markets this chart gives the impression that if you walk into madison with youll get about sq ft but you could realistically get a br or a fully decked out br with that but in cities like sf the low end is still really high i think the medians give a more realistic picture of what it would take to live in these cities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i realize these are averages but my boston apartment is about times the sq ft listed for only more than than the if you want to live in downtown boston cambridge or the popular hipster hoods apartments are very expensive yet there are still working class areas with reasonable rents
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i expected denver and portland to be higher considering how much bitching they do about rent prices even nyc and sf dont complain about housing and rent as much as those two minneapolis was a surprise though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,woo minneapolis i know from first hand experience the housing market is going nuts here right now on the lower end
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what about the blind deaf or the disabled i mean if we are going to accommodate one we should accommodate all no
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im in the bay area but not sf itself i pay for a sqft studio in the actual city limits of sf br apartments start at
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would have to say the same about dc youll have to be extremely lucky to get an apartment in a safe area that costs a month that or you have to find roommateshousemates to live with
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats a great point i have been hearing more people from the data viz community warning against our reliance on averages to summarize data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you can if you want to but im talking about of the world male population the problem which can be fixed with a very basic design change in the visual which part are you talking about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah so thats pretty much in line with what ive heard this graph shows that sf and chicago il are about sq ft apart but if you were looking at mean i bet they wouldnt even be in the same ballpark
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,san francisco proper is just too small for rent to not be astronomical considering how many people want to live there especially when so many long time residents are opposed to any development that changes the character of the city los angeles is a lot more sprawling so rent isnt as bad in a lot of areas still considered los angeles
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cant you just install a chrome extension or something
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah in atlanta you can get a lot more space for your dollar then this average shows just depends on where you want to live in the city and how newdecked out you want the place decked out new condos in a few areas of the city are probably throwing the averages off

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wanna know who that rogue year old outlier is and what the fuck he benches
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what does circle diameter signify if anything the legend does not define what the circle size means
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,honestly its the shittiest feeling when i see that my coworker who doesnt work out and is about the same height as me is easily stronger when ive been lifting for years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i really want to know my combined grip strength nowim mildly competitive and very bored
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,marine corps tests show similar results the bottom percent of male performance and the top percent of female performance overlaps within the service
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive always thought that if women could magically become men the first thing they would do after a couple minutes of helicoptering is start flipping tables and furniture
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i feel bad for the one little blue dot at the bottom i can only picture mclovin in my head
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its really hard to see the light green thats sitting in a sea of blue different colors should have been chosen with more contrast between each other and the background
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wife was super jelly when we went to the gym together the first time neither of us work out and she suggested we both leg press the highest amount we could and compare smoked
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,good news i appear to be at peak grip strength age bad news i appear to be at peak grip strength age
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,grip strength so this is why my mom would always struggle to open up sealed jars and have me do it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you for this im a feminist an egalitarian and a data and biology nut and i always hate when people say that women are just as strong as men individually it is possible overall no we have differences and its ok to admit that nbsp not admitting it is just as bad as the people who still say the world is flat or climate change doesnt exist wanting something to be factual doesnt make it so
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,brings me back to grade when my teacher asked the class why we thought men in the did the work while women took care of the kids i raised my hand and said because men are stronger she chastised me in front of the class and told me women were as strong if not stronger than men so did her little butt buddy brad wallenberg this data makes me feel good in your ugly nonpractical face mrs toole
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am and my husband is he is painfree stronger and more optimistic than i am but i am trickier and more creative
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,interesting data if anything this tells you that you shouldnt design anything that requires a greater grip strength than perhaps kg put a chimp up there and we would all look inferior through
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont know why some people cant accept that women and men have differences one isnt more flawed both have their pros and cons as a woman i find it disturbing how often people keep pushing things on me everything is exactly the same and you should be able to do everything men can do no for the same reason men cant do everything we can the same applies to us just stop equality is about being treated the same being paid the same its not being delusional and acting like female and males are the same we arent i was active in sports in high school our varsity female soccer team did a lot better then our mens team we even had a player that would make it to the olympics we had a top team despite that the mens soccer team absolutely destroyed us it wasnt even close and we were extremely in shape and busted our ass just as much as the mens team we worked harder even we were in the gym more we practiced more it wasnt even close the physical differences between genders is huge even women that are fit can be beat by average males that arent gym rats and that is fine we have things we do better then men i actually think our differences are beautiful and should be celebrated working together we can do much more when completing each others weakness but im seeing more and more this push to completely erase any differences to act like they dont exist and its really annoying when people try to push it on you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is why i think its unfair for trans female athletes to compete against nontrans
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,zoom in and check out the forty year old woman well above the blue line
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think ive ever seen any one of my colleagues or family say that women are just as strong as men or stronger i thought it was common sense that at least of men will be stronger than of women i mean even when i used tumblr i never saw such radical content those reddit comments are so strange edit very curious about that year old woman who is stronger than many men in her age group in the chart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no shit this is why we have separate categories in every sport for men and women and why this idiocy of letting transgender athletes compete wherever they want needs to stop this is also the same reason that three count them three women in the history of the wnba have dunked the ball
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do you see that guy mid at the very bottom weaker than all females thats me guys to make sure this isnt a low effort comment the colors arent really easy to see i would change that lightgreen to something more orangered
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think military service where physical strength is necessary should be gender blind and ability nonblind so both weak males and weak females should be disqualified and both strong males and strong females should be qualified there is no need to make the ratio exactly male and female if that doesnt reflect our geneticphysical abilities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,man i used to have great grip strength i was welding moving sheets of steel daily and manipulating them with large hammers and general brute force i could beat any grip game and just lock my hand like the jaws of a pitbull my forearms were cut i had an egg sized muscle between my thumb and forefinger i thought id always be that strong and tough years later and i have arthritis in my hands i cant do so much as dice a couple onions before my hands cramp and fingertips go numb it sucks i went from the top of this chart to near the bottom over the past years fuck my palm is cramping typing this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,arent there physiological differences in the orientation of the musclestendons of hands between men and women i believe that a man who is smaller and weaker than a woman would still have greater grip strength
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nice plot but i think this data would be better represented using a violin or box and whisker plot so we could better compare groups without dots getting covered up in this plot it looks like there are as many girl children than boy children
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,grip strength divergent masturbation techniques come to mind as a potential explanation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im more surprised by how little difference there is between the strength of a woman at and the strength of a woman at
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow average grip strength of an year old man is greater than the average maximum for women now thats old man strength
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,who is the year old guy who has half of the grip strength of an average year old woman
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the point of most not all feminist arguments against generalizations of men and women isnt that the genders arent different on average but that there is enough variance that blanket genderbased restrictions shouldnt be imposed although this graph is pretty hard to read since the thick areas around the average line cover up circles of the other color i think it supports that argument really well since theres overlap between belowaverage men and aboveaverage women it might not be much but when youre talking about the entire adult population of a country thats a lot of people that dont reflect the average seemingly there is greater variance in the male data showing a great many points far above and far below the male average compared to the women where most are closer to the average this is enough to show that using gender as a prerequisite for jobs requiring strength is unfair not to mention grip strength isnt everything
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,despite what some people in these comments are claiming we shouldnt discriminate those women who are indeed strong and prevent them from for example working a physically demanding jobs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,please do not make the same mistake i did of looking at the controversial section of these comments many smug people fighting strawmen about gender equality
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that exponential growth during puberty its when i noticed i could no longer win at arm wrestling
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,op can you quantify the title what is almost all what is the highest value x for which the following statement is true x of men are stronger than x of women
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seeing things like this as a woman scares me a little being weaker than about of the population by default makes me worry about being unable to myself and how easily i could be overpowered by a man i know its likely that im never going to be attacked by anyone throughout my life but it still makes me feel i guess irrationally uneasy i remember talking to one of my male friends about a female boxer and he mentioned he didnt think he could date a woman that was stronger than himhad good fighting skills because it made him uncomfortable it was strange for me to hear that because the majority of straight relationships are like that for women
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id be interested in seeing a male vs female flexibility graph my guess would be itd be almost the opposite of this edit ucourageouswren linked this one from stats canada looks like my hypothesis seems more or less correct cool stuff
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i remember seeing a random statistic saying that men are on average standard deviations stronger than women that would means of men are stronger than the average women and conversely means only of women are stronger than the average man i wondered why girls had such trouble doing push ups in my gym class when i was a kid now i know
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,somewhere out there theres a year old man thats about as strong as a year old girl
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im always surprised at how strong i am compared to women i know im just yet im stronger than practically every girl i know even when some are quite larger in weight and height than me by a far margin never understood why as they clearly are bigger in size and height than me yet i only work out a few times a week and being small in stature they still ask me to help them carry stuff for them that they would struggle with while i wouldnt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wait for the interpretation shouldnt it say on average mens grip strength is stronger than women across all ages saying almost all men are stronger than almost all women means there should almost be no overlap of the data points the green and blue clouds between the two genders
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so there is the mountain at age at the very top laughing at the age beta male thats below all the women gurly man
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the average year old man is stronger than the average woman at any age really
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont show this to the military right now i just got out of the marine corps and even though the females all tested significantly lower than males on fitness test theyre going to lower the standards and allow females in to infantry without trying to instigate a sex issue or pc issue lowering requirements for the most the dangerous job in the military so girls can do it too is probably the worst possible thing you can do side note thats one of the reasons i got out not because females in infantry or whatever but because of that mindset from the top brass leading our military lets lower the requirements and endanger literally everyone on the battlefield so we can tell the public females are allowed to be infantry now there are many instances of similar orders passed lately but it all comes down to perception and how they look versus how the military actually operates they care far more about the appearance of caring for the troops than them actually giving a damn and caring about them other side note if anybody really wants examples of the differences in female and male fitness requirements i can give some the reports from cnn the last few months have been wildly inaccurate but in every single facet of fitness testing the female requirements are much more lax than the male requirements for the same age as of now jobs dont have different requirements except special forces or the like
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my grip strength is terrible but i can lift heavy stuffi would definitely be one of those lower blue bubblesalso love the bubbles why are some of the bubbles bigger than others
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what men and women have some physical differences that make men stronger than women i cant believe it evolution is so sexist and patriarchal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,upper body strength is heavily influenced by testosterone when it comes to lower body strength men are still generally stronger than women but the margin is much smaller it would be interesting to see a chart like this for something like squat strength or at least leg press strength edit potentially untrue see comment below
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is it mostly due to testosterone how would that graph look if we added axis that was testosterone levels in the body
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is why the top ranked female tennis stars would be unable to beat even the ranked male tennis star
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its one of those things that are obviously true but if you say it in conversation people will disagree with you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we can run faster and jump higher too ive known and am related to hardcore feminists whose blood boils at these facts its not injustice its just biology nature isnt always fair deal with it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i remember trying to wrestle the remote from my younger brother several months ago and he without even grunting just tossed me onto the couch and held me down with one arm while flipping channels with the other testosterone isnt a joke but it sucks though as a woman i wont be able to beat mr oldfart in a fight thats a freakish difference in strength between genders
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that one year old male is about as weak as your average infanttrench coat full of kids maybe
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,interesting to see the two depressions in the late wonder if menopause has anything to do with it it is well known that postmenopausal women can develop osteoporosis which would weaken grip strength
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so the average teenager is as strong as the average on behalf of the age range suck it teenagers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i thought everyone already knew this men tend to have more muscle and are larger so yeah go figure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so maybe women shouldnt actually be firefighters if there are any men who are not strong enough then it looks like all women are not strong enough either like if only the upper of the human population is strong enough then thats men lets apply rational testing to physically demanding work
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rock climbing is also another one where women do very well compared to men a lot of rock climbing competitions are divided by sex look at bouldering comps and psicobloc however the first person to ever free climb el cap was a woman
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont get people who refuse to acknowledge this if youve ever slept with a woman you know how easy it is to maneuver them around the bed and how much physically stronger than them you really are anyone who refuses to acknowledge this better be very inexperienced and very young or i will have little to no respect for them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that one dude whos packing like a thanks for making us all look like shit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,while everyone is having this gender convo and such going on here my wife and i want to know who is this one single dot strong as hell at the top dont get in a fight with him
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so the average year old male is stronger than the average year old male cool something to look forward to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my favorite comparison in the subject is the case of karsten braasch v the williams sisters httpwwwtopendsportscomsporttennismenvwomenhtm edit oh i just saw that uallegrettovivamente sorry about that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,according to this an yr old man is still slightly stronger than a yr old woman that doesnt seem accurate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,grip strength i believe the conclusion is likely correct but that seems like a very unencompassing way to measure it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is why i want to be a boy all boys get to have fun without fear of rape or anything and its quite unfair
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it seems necessary here to remind people that feminism doesnt suggest men and women are equal in every single way it only suggests they should have equal rights and opportunities you young people seem to misunderstand this frequently which is why this post is so popular
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,crazy how some people need data for that one would assume thats already been figured out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i have a unique bit of experience with this im mtf transgender and have been on hrt for just over a year the lose in strength is absolutely staggering now i was never like crazy strong but i wasnt a weakling i could easily move my king size bed around by myself and even managed to get it up a flight of stairs solo once after about months of hrt it took my gf and i together to get her twin sized bed up fewer stairs and we needed to take breaks ive hurt myself a few times trying to lift or move things that a year ago would have been no issue i have a few trans friends and all my mtf friends have experienced the same dip in strength while all my ftm friends have had the opposite happen
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this actually struck me the other day while browsing youtube im a beginner weight lifter been at it for about months so far im by no means in amazing shape but im making progress ive spent the entirety of my life being unathletic actually its amazing that as a male i can lift weights at or above the same level as highly trained females its crazy what natural testosterone does anyway my point is that it must be challenging to be a woman who has to train hard for things the average male can do with just a little bit of training and time in the gym
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when people say stronger they dont usually mean grip strength according to this data the average year old man is just as strong as the average year old man and an average year old man is stronger than of women at any age theres no way this is a accurate description of what people would generally call strength
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well duh just because we want gender equality doesnt change the fact our bodies arent built to go toe to toe against each other
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is why i like running obviously very good male runners are better than the best females but in my running group there are plenty of women that are faster than very fit men including myself i could never out do a man in terms of strength but i can have a good go when it comes to running theres are lot more overlap compared to other sports its also interesting to see the differences in the conditioning sessions both guys and us girls are quite evenly matched in box jumps push ups pull ups etc but when it comes to lifting weights theyre miles ahead
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is incredibly interesting and will almost certainly awaken a real shit storm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i love how everyones kneejerk reaction to this chart is lol feminism what on earth does this have to do with that its just data lol this circlejerk of a site good to know that all of these smug comments boil down to this proves men are superior to women because obviously physical strength is the only thing that matters edit and now the thread is gilded lol wow so goldworthy this boring ass chart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it reminds me of a math problem i once did in school it graphed the world records for the yard dash for both men and women it showed that women were closing the gap and asked when women would overtake men in the yard dash i wrote never and refused to do the assignment i got it wrong i still dont care
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is it weird that i dont mind i really like the fact that my boyfriend is bigger and stronger than me but might need to call me over if he needs something small reached or something like that i am all for equality of course but i think covering up the physical and mental differences between men and women is boring and stupid just dont assume things about people before you get to know them just because of their gender and everything is fine
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do you know why there is a similar dip from for both men and women it seems to decline after and then jump back up at
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what variable do the different sized circles represent body weight
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is outrageous why is your actual methodology so much lower than the moreobviouslypolitical comments mods should find a way to sticky methodology posts by op when it isnt provided by the image
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for the links people who want to see the apparatus look at figure pdf page
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i noticed those two as well i really want to see a side by side
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same guy different hands thats what happens if you never switch hitif you know what i mean
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,got one dude just head and shoulders above everyone else i am actually slightly skeptical about this data point httpsenwikipediaorgwikicaptainsofcrushgrippers grippers are pretty much the gold standard for grip strength measurement i would be interested in how they are measuring for this particular test is what their gripper is rated at which is an incredible feat of strength to get certified at here is the closing the so when the graph says combinded grip strength test surely this means both hands right it would seem pretty improbable that in the sample size they used they selected someone in the pinnacle of strongmangrip sports assuming both hands measured together and combined something in that range is still impressive definitely more likely though the number coc is rated at kg and is still pretty difficult to close to completion standards without some type of formal training that increases grip strength anyways long tangent but there is always some guy in these threads trying to make things pedantic just so happens to be a topic im passionate about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,male test levels peak in their but you still need to work out to take advantage of it edit im clearly thinking of something other than test anyone who doesnt mix up words is welcome to buzz in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,arrgg sorry about that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats how its saided where im from we didnt maked a mistake
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it didnt say we were smarter
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its grip strength so probably deadlift
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and his phone number
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the circle size represents the sampling weight for that data point nhanes is not a simple random sample but instead has a complex survey design that you can read about here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i bet your muscles look better than his though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,leverage is the gods way of making dwarves stronger than elves
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its kg your grip strength is kg
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pretty much except for me personally the first thing id do is stand in front of a mirror tuck it in and do that weird silence of the lambs dance first then helicopters and finally hulking out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i thought it would be opening jars
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,season and location allowing write your name in the snow
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,orange and blue on dark grey or black
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats because mens colors are waaaaaaay stronger im sorry i couldnt resist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but now you always need to carry the heavy stuff
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive had something similar to this happen a few times women seem to think they actually are as strong as a man of the same size or even when theyre slightly larger in some of my cases they dont know the power of testosterone
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im already jelly at how you guys can burn calories and drop weight and build muscle way faster than a woman super jelly we women are built to give birth thats all nature gave us everything in our bodies is tuned in a way so we can survive pregnancy and birth most of the time its kind of shitty imo but someones gotta do it men dont have that burden so they can get better at everything else physically speaking other mammals dont have this degree of sexual dimorphism hell in the insectbug world usually the females are the bigstrong ones but we do we deal with it but were still humans and we shouldnt be treated like second class people because of our physical differences thats really all ive cared about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im just happy i get to keep my strength in my
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,op said that guy had muscular dystrophy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,actually this has a great deal to do with another physiological difference womens skin is softer i can open jars with a gripper but without forget it i slip
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i had to call a neighbor to help me open a jar of sauce once when husband was away for a week i was ashamed but the pasta was waiting edit i appreciate all the helpful tips with perseverance i could have opened it myself but when a lady needs carbs these urges must be met asap
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i never thought they were talking about lifting heavy things strength thats just silly although i think jobs where it matters like firefighters should have a firm but fair test and basically be agnostic cause i know there is some amazonian out there that can fling my fat ass over her shoulder
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah the problem is when people try to use it as proof that women shouldnt do any physically taxing jobs i get there are professions where women are more likely to fail the requirements but there are a lot of jobs that require physical strength but not maleexclusive physical strength
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,stay strong and strive for equality im trying to tell my daughter things like this too women are weaker than men on average if you train you can get stronger than a random dude and thats also why you should do your best at other tasks you may have a disadvantage in some area language chess math music whatever but practicing will make you better now if she would only take that advice to heart before shes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i read a story here on reddit a while ago from a young girl just about to head off to college she was one of these people who considered women to be equal to men and thought she was physically strong as she went to the gym a lot and all that so as a lesson it was either her brother or a guy friend just picked her up and threw her into the swimming pool whilst she could do nothing to resist when she get out and dried off he told her that guys are just stronger even guys that are smaller than her and she needed to be aware of that if she was ever in a situation where there could be physical conflict she might be strong but knowing when to run is important
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i always hate when people say that women are just as strong as men moral strength mental strength sure physical strength hell no
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to be fair that was a terrible question in the in the us which is where i assume you were and were talking about the economy was very agrarian and women and men both worked for most of the rich elites neither men nor women worked it was considered unseemly and for that matter neither took care of the children really it was mostly left to servants and boarding schools there was a relatively small middle class where the men were professionals and in that case it was probably gender roles that assigned who worked outside the home later in the came the industrial revolution but many many women went to work in the mills and factories so women and men also both worked so again she was not accurate its true that after marriage a woman would have likely kept the house and raised the children and the men kept going to the factories however housework then was real backbreaking labor and took a lot of strength and stamina and was also work in its own way there was of course hard labor jobs mining steel smelting railroad construction which are still dominated by men largely due to their physical strength
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what was the correct answer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and fuck brad wallenbitch
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow i am sorry that happened to you the real reason is actually that women were usually pregnant or nursing and men cannot do that job although there are jobs that only men can do most of the work can be done by either sex however it doesnt make sense to have women do it as you lose them for baby rearing note that i do allow that certain jobs are always going to be almost exclusively male but a lot of work is pretty light even on the farm edit i have worked on a farm if you dont know what work is light on a farm maybe you only did one job but i can promise youchicken farming is not going to transform your body thibk through what i am actually stating not what soapbox you would like to get on
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and youre on reddit you definitely win
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are you saying chimps are better than humans
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,challenge accepted find me a chimp
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it also says if you design it for a combined grip strength of most men will be able to operate the thing with difficulty and most women will not be able to operate it and at most women will have difficulty and most men will be easily able to operate it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you shouldnt design anything that requires a greater grip strength than perhaps kg way to make us gradually weaker
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was active in sports in high school our varsity female soccer team did a lot better then our mens team we even had a player that would make it to the olympics we had a top team despite that the mens soccer team absolutely destroyed us it wasnt even close the womens national soccer team trains by playing against boys national teams ages they lose more often than they win thats literally the best team of women soccer plays america can field versus teenage boys and they still dont even come out even on the flipside of violent criminals are men testosterone is a hell of a drug
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,our culture increasingly subscribes to a view of the person that is completely debiologized and where all of the attributes applied to it are reduced to mere labels regardless of how absurd treating them as such is recognizing inherent biological traits would require us to completely reassess a philosophy centered around a dehumanized idealized person that has come to dominate our world
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,about equalityi was watching anita sarkesians videos about games against women because i love that kind of stuff but it annoyed me when she would see any violence against women and decry it this was especially problematic when the game was gendernuetral about it and let you do violence against men and women indiscriminately its like violence against men didnt matter to her i get thats her whole thesis but still shouldnt she be happy about that kind of equality
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you for a sensible pov from the female side the physical differences between genders is huge idk if youre old enough for this reference but thats why the battle of the sexes tennis match was between one of the top women and an old hasbeen hustler
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what about that year old lady like fine wine
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what about that year old man with the grip strength of a year old
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if this is the same data set used by a german study a few years back examining grip strength in women and men that might well be the female judo champion of germany whom the researchers acknowledged was a significant outlier frankly i dont think its the same set due to the ages involved but the person concerned may well be a judo karate or handball player or competitive butterchurner i dunno
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats the soccer mom that lifted the car off her kid
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,year old woman confirmed edit i have no intentions of being rude just making good fun my mum does this exact face on the end of everything and i think its adorable
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this so obviously true makes me question being on reddit since these are the people on it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i wonder where all these people come from
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i thought it was common sense that at least of men will be stronger than of women i dont know im not surprised that men are stronger on average than women but maybe because i come from a long line of women who would beat the shit out of people but im surprised at the massive difference i thought it might have been more related to fitness or height or something with more crossover i found that quite interesting it would be particularly interesting to me to see a graph of something other than grip strength say quad strength something a bit less sensitive if were saying smoothnesscollagen etc contributes here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,redditors along with many teenage guys love to build up strawmen feminists and take them down ha take that sjws men are stronger than women who says otherwise
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i just knew this thread would be a hurr durr men are great amirite lol feminists r dumb circlejerk and yup thats exactly what it is nobodys claiming men arent physically stronger get off your fucking soapboxes and stop beating the poor decaying horse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my guess is that the strange comments are written by smug people making up strawmen arguments about feminism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,except horse racing in uk at least thats right the only sport where women enjoy a physical advantage over men by being lighter and what do you know women are allowed and want to race in with men
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it would be interesting to see where transgender people fall on the strength spectrum i know hormones therapy can have a huge influence edit it seams there are a lot of people who dont think it would be interesting lol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no shit this is why we have separate categories in every sport for men and women except not every sport has separate categories like sailing and equestrian sports in the olympics and some sports have separate categories for completely different reasons firearms used to be mixed at the olympics but isnt anymore for reasons in when a woman helene mayer beat the mens us fencing champion in an open tournament her title was revoked the next day and a ban on malefemale competition was created with the reasoning that women had an unfair advantage because men could not seriously attack them in fencing sports like curling and darts should be mixed but for some reason often arent diving could probably be pretty equal but its hard to tell since you cant directly compare their scores since men and womens diving arent exactly the same for no apparent reason
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the real mindfuckwhy do men and women compete separately in chess
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that makes sense but most military specialties dont require much strength the military wants you to be physically fit but there is no reason to disqualify a weaker person from working in the finance office or as a chaplains assistant combat army jobs should probably have special requirements but not all jobs they already discriminate based on intelligence and no one seems to care if you dont test well there are a lot of jobs that you cannot do in the military but if you are weak you can still go be a tanker doesnt make much sense
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i believe that a man who is smaller and weaker than a woman would still have greater grip strength well hes gonna have a lot of time to work on his grip strength thats for sure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres a difference in the collagen structure of the skin between sexes for men the collagen is in an xxxxxxx pattern while for women it is more allowing for a stronger grip for men as the skin doesnt move as much though i dont think thats what they measure here unless they include trying to unscrew jars
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wanted to show strength across the entire age range without breaking it up into age categories but i agree that eg density plots by sex would be a better way to compare the details of the distributions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if this was a youtube comment section itd be so much more controversial because there are so many year old girls like i can beat like most boys in my class in an arm restel and im the fastest in my grade boys r so stupid to belive this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pheasant in a review of datasets on sex differences in strength found that in chance encounters between a man and woman the man would have higher upper limb strength of the time and higher trunk strength of the time the sexes were most equal in pushpulllift strength where men would be stronger of the time all averages across the studies in this dataset the adult female mean combined grip strength is kg of adult men have a combined grip strength greater than the adult female mean pheasant s t sex differences in strength—some observations on their variability applied ergonomics edit in the nhanes data of adult men have a combined group strength that is greater than kg which is the percentile for women adult is defined as years old
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in regards to the first part of your comment you dont need to feel afraid of being overpowered by a man in fact if anything you have to battle that fear so that of the day comes god forbid you can act quickly and efficiently the only thing you need to defend yourself is a sound strategy think about it if hes holding you by the arms a nice kick to the crotch will do legs are particularly strong and being a guy i can tell you hell back down at which point you can run also if you have the opportunity go for the eyes do you think hell be able to harm you after youve pinched his eyes if worse comes to worst and i know this sounds crazy let him sort of have it and beg for him to try to force you to give him oral sex and then you bite like a crazy fucker chances are unless youre trained you wont be able to beat him in an actual fight truth is you dont have to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,heres an analysis by statistics canada sort answer yes women are more flexible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,old men are strong as shit dude
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably pretty accurate we tend to think of old men as frail but that has more to do with cardiovascular capacity and recovery times in terms of muscle strength yeah the average male senior citizen is way stronger than we give them credit for
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,old man strength is real but seriously yes testosterone is that powerful why do you think anabolic steroids male hormones are so effective as performance enhancers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,never heard of old man strength
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my father is and he was on a pitch roof helping me shingle my house we would throw a whole bundle of shingles on his shoulder and carry them up a ladder hes still strong but what hes lacking these days is dexterity and stamina ill see him miss the first step on the ladder and slip or stumble because he dragged his foot and then he doesnt recover like a year old he cant do it all day either he has to sit down and get some water heat and humidity takes a toll on him too at he could lump bails of hay all day long at he could help you unload a few bails but he would run out of steam quickly hes already broken a hip once and had to have it replaced because he trips over things or loses his balance and falls his skin is thin and everything he bumps into leaves a cut or bruise he cant hear or see worth a dam he fumbles things if you threw a baseball at him and said think fast it would probably hit him in the face before he had a chance to flinch let along catch it point is hes not the man he used to be not by a long shot but he could still put up a mean arm wrestle im sure some orderlies at a nursing home could tell you what a pain in the ass it would be to deal with an year old man who decided he didnt want to be in bed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you know most people arent arguing this right even most feminists
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the only reason i try and learn the facts with this kind of stuff is because i have actually had that bullshit used against me before when you point out that men and women have physiological differences and you get harped on for being a sexist it should be part of basic education and highlighted that its not a bad thing at all we should embrace our differences
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the powerlifting records in the lbs weight class are bench press lbs for women lbs for men squat lbs for women lbs for men so here the gap is pretty much the same for upper and lower body strength at the other end of the spectrum typical loads for untrained individuals at a bodyweight of lbs are bench press lbs for women lbs for men squat lbs for women lbs for men again the gap is pretty similar however for the squat it might make sense to add around lbs to account for the portion of the bodyweight thats also being lifted by the legs this gives an approximation of the load which would be used for a leg press approx leg press lbs for women lbs for men in this case its true that the gap is smaller for lower body strength but its still significant also consider that this is for a man and a woman of the same bodyweight whereas in reality the average man is heavier than the average woman untrained loads from httpwwwexrxnettestingweightliftingstrengthstandardshtml
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no strength is much much more complex than just testosterone there are men with low levels of testosterone who are strong there are many many men with high levels of testosterone who are weak you have to understand that when testosterone is used as performance enhancing drug its in doses that are extremely high compared to natural levels at that point sure testosterone takes over and becomes a very important factor for strength in the human body but for normal levels its really not quite as significant as mainstream culture would have you believe i cant go into details im not physician or biologist or anything like that im just a strength coach who knows that while strength potential in individuals varies a lot more than most people think just looking at a persons testosterone levels will say little about it you have to put them through a strength program and compare the results to their peers in order to predict anything furthermore as a strength coach i can tell you that grip strength is hugely dependent on the shape of your hands rather than your ability to build muscle sort story big hands means good grip strength depending a bit on how you test it many people with big hands also get strong but not all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in these nhanes data after controlling for sex testosterone does not correlate significantly with adult grip strength p
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,testosterone is one hell of a drug
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,partially men are built entirely differently to women down to the bone testosterone induced muscular hypertrophy is one of the main factors that leads to men being stronger than women but they are also taller have stronger denser bones and an entirely different distribution of fat and muscle and as i said bone structure plays a big role httpsenwikipediaorgwikisexualdimorphismmediafilehumansvg image is a good representation of the differences and you can read up online about what contributes to them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean serena and venus williams in after she won the us open when she was said she could take any top male in a competitive match so karsten braasch who was ranked above beat both of them he then said he added that he had played like someone ranked in order to keep the game fun you can not compare men vs women in sports and if you do then you should be advocating for gender neutral tournaments
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont think any nondelusional person would disagree
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,because nobody in real life fucking cares its you useless nerds on fucking reddit that rant about women that care
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a guy though its also a little weird that some men on here take such perverse pride in it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,kind of like how men whine and complain and moan about misandry when women take precautions about getting raped crossing the street when a man is walking behind them late at night etc its not misandry youre just multiple times more likely to commit pretty much any violent crime than a woman is and i have no way to defend myself against you deal with it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its probably vincent adultman poor guy doesnt have time to work out hes always busy working at the business factory
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,op said he has a bone disease or something
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,reddit is flimsy college boys who are experts in video games and live in an internet world and youd be right to have little respect for some too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats related to weight not strength you just wanted to mention that you fuck
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly feminism is not manhating nor is it the sexes are equal in every way and anyone who believes otherwise isnt a feminist the youngsters on reddit dont seem to understand that and instead blast anyone who calls themselves a feminist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,commenters are saying that this is proof women shouldnt hunt and fight so yeah just saying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youd be surprised at the level of naivety from people who deny this stuff
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,testosterone is a hell of a hormone
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how do you feel about it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,grip strength is a good proxy for upper and lower limb strength here is the conclusion of one recent study bohannon et al the findings of this study suggest that for healthy adults isometric measures of grip and knee extension strength reflect a common underlying construct that is limb muscle strength nevertheless differences in activities requiring grip and knee extension strength and the findings of our analysis preclude a blanket advocacy for using either alone to describe the limb muscle strength of tested individuals another study viitasalo et al found that the correlation coefficients of isometric measures of various muscle strengths didnt vary too much by age viitasalo j t era p leskinen a l heikkinen e muscular strength profiles and anthropometry in random samples of men aged – – and – years ergonomics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think grip strength is a very good indicator for arm and chest strength given the average morphology of a healthy body i would bet that correlates with overall strength in a significant way i have no statistics to reference though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its almost like theres some strange bias for men to have more practice gripping things that really picks up in the teen years and peaks around
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,obviously very good male runners are better than the best females what are we counting as very good though because the subelite males are not beating the elite female times
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when it comes to running women take advantage of thier lighter weight to make up for the lower muscle density to a degree but you are wrong about females being evenly matched when it comes to running and pushups you are right about situps a breakdown of the army apft standards for females and males of the same age group would show this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why this has been documented for hundreds of years men have like more muscle mass lb for lb where is the shit storm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i didnt realize obvious shit like this was interesting are there actually people who didnt know men are much stronger than women
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont stir drama where there is none
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,even mathematically the figures should have end behaviour of inverse exponentials so women will close the gap with more women training and compete ting but it isnt that the gap will ever fully close unless there is some genetic freak that happens to be female with long legs as wide as trees so youre not wrong but you kind of deserved your
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no that is common sense men and women are meant to complete each other not compete with each other
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no whats weird is thinking that men and women are the exact same and can do the exact same things this is a big problem in the military women have lower requirements to get into the military then men instead of a standard for both you end up with women who cant carry other women or men out of a situation cant carry supplies or rifles etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe really unhealthy people start dying at that age
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,old man strength sets in at
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they regain some strength from having to open so many pill bottles
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont know i used the auto setting for the smoothing parameter bandwidth its possible that its just sampling error but im not sure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont know about women but for men at you start losing your dad strength a period of time when a father is most vulnerable to his male progenies but by you gain old man strength if the son havent acted against the father it is too late and he wouldve missed his window of opportunity its basic male physiology i thought everyone knew this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is a bubble plot the size of the circle is the number of people at that point if it were only one person it would be a this is a bubble plot the size of the circle is the number of people at that point if it were only one person it would be a dot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,honestly ops should be able to sticky comments on their own posts as just a general part of reddit as a lot of link posts require further explanation maybe mods can choose it to disabled on their subreddit if they dont want it but yeah this is halfway down the page so i had already left a comment asking for clarification but here it is way down here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats hafthor bjornsson and stephen hawking bet you cant guess which is which
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i know what you mean but it says combined grip strength so theyre probably measuring two hands
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,definitely more likely though the number coc is rated at kg and is still pretty difficult to close to completion standards without some type of formal training that increases grip strength you never know one time i was visiting this fitness equipment store they happened to sell the ironmind grippers and had them all out on the counter for people to try they said no one had ever been able to close the or i could could close the with either hand using basically what people online later came to call a tablenoset id never heard of them before this was in like but i ended up buying them all and training with them regularly but i mean i was just some random ass guy who happened to have strong hands probably for every or so people that could potentially walk in that store theres one that could do that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dad strength since this is average person strength not athlete strength it could make sense
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wish lol male test levels peak at age
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also what do the different sized circles mean
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to quote a man with really little grip strength youre fired
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,classic case of top comment not being about the content but instead a spelling mistake super cool
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,didnted
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he benches deadlift
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sorry im feeling kinda dense over here edit thanks
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not exciting enough come on you can liven it up a bit like how much is that in earthworms
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for a lot of men this is actually a pretty good description of an average day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that was my day im not even kidding
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would lift stuff and open jars and spend a goodly amount of time appreciating that it doesnt matter what day of the month it is i wont be bleeding from my nether regions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,gooodbye hoooorses
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and dr dre saidnothing you idiots dr dres dead hes locked in my basement
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that was my wifes response when i read her the table flipping comment so youre on to something
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when my boyfriend fills my sons sippy cup i cant get the top back off kiddo took the top of once and dumped juice so now he tightens it really far too make sure it cant happen again ive had to leave cups in the sink for the next time he comes over so he can get the tops off for me to wash them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if not write it on the ground
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,red and green because of men are colorblind
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpimgurcomcuptbdf good job anyways uarlentektolnes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not a problem because it is easy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no no he carries the light stuff still he just tells her she thinks shes carrying the heavy stuff because he makes it look easy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the opposite is kinda true im a skinny guy and when i was younger i was about the same size as my sister so i figured our arm wrestles would be close and honestly i didnt want to vs her because i was worried id lose and thatd be super embarrassing i finally did it and yeah not even close
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,while testosterone is a major factor another big one and possibly the most important is muscle mass distribution and bone density males have more of each which is why a woman of the same height weight and age as another guy will be weaker in terms of power outputtime
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as someone who is on testosterone blockers its crazy apparent to me on an almost daily basis how much weaker i am now vs just a few months ago
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,other mammals dont have this degree of sexual dimorphism compared to quite a few mammals our sexual dimorphism is a joke just look at gorillas their average male is and their average female the male is literally twice as big and heavy we humans on the other hand have about bigger males
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we women are built to give birth thats all nature gave us to be fair thats a fairly important role naturewise men are bigger and stronger because were the expendable gender a tribe that loses a few males to war or hunting doesnt really lose any reproductive capacity
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i have never understood sexualized discrimination or female inferiority complex we are physically built different its like me feeling shitty because i cant run as fast as a cheetah
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,other mammals dont have this degree of sexual dimorphism i took a class on the different types of reproductive systems in animals and one of the things my professor would always reiterate was that humans have incredibly limited sexual dimorphism compared to most animals were hovering at about compare that to our close relative the gorilla who has over most researchers can quickly guess based on skeletal structure if the body of animal was female or male but unless you have the pelvis this is incredibly difficult to do for humans yes male humans can build more muscle and do it faster but saying that humans have this huge degree of sd is incorrect
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im already jelly at how you guys can burn calories and drop weight and build muscle way faster than a woman super jelly shes said that to me lately to be fair my wife has been working harder at getting fit than i ever have and i am super impressed with her determination and progressits really amazing but at the same time she gets mad at this very thing she works her ass off to lose a few pounds and then i say im going to eat less this week and when we weigh in ive lost just as much by eating less as she has working out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,natures done a pretty shitty job of you ask me other mammals just pop the babies out and more than one at a time but humans go through extreme pain and damage for a single baby
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but were still humans and we shouldnt be treated like second class people because of our physical differences one problem is that while designing the laws right to treat people equally is essential there is still an imbalance between male and female strength which is easily exploited by robbers or sexual predators or whatever i try to encourage my female friends to carry defensive weapons so that they have something to turn to other than brute strength if theyre caught in a pinch by a predatory person
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i knew a guy who was a bit over and couldnt carry a gallon of milk not like he couldnt lift if while pouring without spilling it or anything he couldnt even carry it from a counter to table at roughly the same height always tried to dress like neo for some reason and wouldnt shut up about wanting to fuck robots like how are you going to handle servos if you cant even handle milk
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,iirc its because the collagen in mens skin is like this xxxxxx whereas in womens skin its like this l l l l l l l l
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,jam a fork in the threads and bend the lip of the lid a bit to open it i have the average girls strength maybe a little less because i wasnt ever athletic but you can make up for strength in many ways its why we have machines and all that if humans has relied on their strength alone to survive im pretty sure wed be extinct by now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,haha yes i agree no one should ever be denied a position just from eyeing them up or based on their sex let them show what they can do before just shrugging them off nbsp
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a former volunteer firefighter if you need to be moved out of a burning building no one is going to be throwing you over their shoulder theres a massive temperature difference in a smoke filled room the bottom twothree feet can have hundreds of degrees of difference between there and where your head would be if you stood up in one of those rooms a firefighter is going to put a strap under your arm pits if they have one or just grab you if they dont and drag you out while keeping you as low to the ground as possible standing up in a burning building even in all of your fire gear is almost certainly a death sentence the other thing is firefighters go into burning buildings in teams my department used teams of three if we had to get someone out there was no reason we would have to do it alone if it was someone particularly heavy theres always two backup teams on standby outside ready to come in as well the backup team which you can radio in and the rit or rapid intervention team which is on standby specifically for if a firefighter gets in trouble to go in and rescue we had a couple women on our department and even though they werent as physically strong as the guys they had no significant problems because almost everything a firefighter does is as a team and even people who were significantly smaller than me im and were able to move me and get me to safety when we did trainings because they were taught how to move people effectively
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh yes they are they totally mean physical strength in fact most people when you say strong get it wrong you see this in film where people talk about strong female leads writers usually make the character physically dominant where none of the men can come close i agree that strong really means multidimensional and wel written its about people being seen as more as an object or being one dimensional but a lot of people think strong physically strong i see this all the time im a woman that works in the film industry and i see a lot of people mistake strong for strength and sadly a lot of writers dont get this either this is why i thought rey in star wars was poorly written the writers thought strong she can kick everyones ass she never needs help and shes better then everyone else luke in comparison was very flawed he needed to be saved he relied on others which helped grow the relationships which made the original films so good rey in comparison felt completely cold and distant the writers had to keep showing us that she didnt need anyone elses help she was physically dominant over everyone i think daisy ridley did a good job and i like rey but her writing was poor and is a perfect example of how people mistake strongwith strength unintentionally she became onedimensional since her entire character was flat and defined by these things
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lol that reminds me this sad story
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if strength is important theyre going to test it and if you pass you can do the job simple as that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for most of the rich elites neither men nor women worked it was considered unseemly im pretty sure thats still true today the supperrich dont work they invest
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well that and inertia many jobs that used to require brute strength are now done with the assistance of better tools and machines but the culture and wages havent changed to reflect that most women could do those jobs now so they remain maledominated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also women are heaps better at giving birth than men
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that one is less cut and dry women do live longer but by different amounts and due to different reasons russian men die at like because they drink themselves to death while japanese men live about as long because asians are apparently immune to the effects of smoking and drinking or they do enough to cancel each other out whereas men are simply stronger than women
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,good point i think a problem here is that people are assigning value or worth to physical strength and therefore getting offended when one group is said to have less of it pointing out a fact women live longer men are stronger women can carry and deliver babies etc isnt an attack on the other group its simply a fact no one said men are a little stronger on average therefore women suck but it seems like a lot of people are taking it that way
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,who gave this dude gold
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the women in my family often live to be ill take that over the ability to bench press a small refrigerator any day i think people get mad at charts like this because of how the information gets used in social contexts obviously this doesmt mean women cant be physically strong it just takes a more concentrated effort because they dont have all that handy testosterone to work with
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sexism duh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,continuous child bearing and rearing kids died a lot more back then and the solution of the time was to make more of them also the culture was aimed at keeping women proper which partly meant not dirty so families seemed poor if women were helping with manual labor there was also a bit of the strength factor regarding jobs that required it shoveling and plowing dirt on large farms is a good example sure some women could physically do it but its more practical to have the man do it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cisgender patriarchical oppression
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sexism and patriarchy presumably
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think from le reddit armie can help you find the correct answer to that question
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,farm work was never light shovel shit carry buckets of water and feed pick food in the hot sun lift heavy equipment plow the field behind a horse or ox its grueling hard labor even after the invention of the tractor and most labor even as late as the in the usa was agricultural labor edit i guess a lot of people inferred that i thought women couldnt do these things yeah they can children do its still one of the most physically demanding and dangerous kinds of work
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as someone who has worked years in construction i have no doubt that it has everything to do with strength plenty of women work in some of the companies ive been in at cleaning cooking and other positions exactly zero have been in the hole digging or carrying rebar it has everything to do with strength and nothing to do with pregnancy it must be noted those were much highpaying jobs than the cleaning ones and men who started in the cleaning positions often changed to construction jobs because of the money women were in supervision and engineering positions all the time so they are definitely just as smart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes caesar im doing whatever you say caesar
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,followed by a new face
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably been chopping wood and churning butter by hand all her life i wonder whether working rural lower class women used to be stronger back in the days when they were physically so much more active
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,older the berry sweeter the juice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hes probably got some physical disability to be fair
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theyre made out of straw if that helps
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,men have testosterone pick any muscle group and men will and do dominate we are designed to be stronger and youre designed to carry babies just our biological roles
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rock climbing is also another one where women do very well compared to men
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,formula and other racing series is also unisex although men are having a lot more success than women i dont believe there has been a female formula driver yet although williams had a female test driver for a while
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and yet steroids are against the rules for everyone else what if i identify as a more muscular version of myself does that mean i can take steroids
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no amount of hormones can undo the skeletal structure of a grown man
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,males still have a male skeleton which effects where the ligaments attach giving them better leverage and thus more power they still have bigger fists and feet they still have larger lungs and hearts hrt doesnt effect the vast majority of anatomical differences that give malesome advantage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,true but hormones arent the sole separators of gender though i always see at least a few acting if not outright saying such when it comes to trans athletes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a trans women im pretty sure they fall somewhere in between im not even close to my previous strength but still above most women for that reason im against transgender people competing with no trans people the hormone treatment reduces trans womens muscle mass to be comparable to non trans women but we are still larger and have a more robust skeleton
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,most trans people make the switch after they undergo puberty that shit cant be undone
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i listened to some podcast where transgender people were talking about this they say that mtf do get weaker and ftm do get stronger the other interesting thing is that they specifically said grip strength is affected not just by muscles but the way that womens skin is attached to underlying muscle is weaker and mtf transgender to get that looser skin when they do hormone replacement i note that while op called his graph stronger than as if its a general case its specifically using grip strength as a stand in for all strength
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,men who turn to women have been made to compete against other women in some events and thats not at all fair theyre basically enhanced by years and years of anabolic steroids they also have the better skeletal frame and the stronger ligaments and tendons its cheating
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i went to a curling match a couple months ago and according to the fans i talked to the sweeping requires more strength than you would expect and men actually have an advantage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im with you on most of it but not diving that should be absolutely categorized different body types create different splashes men are less flexible etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,diving not as much i know many international level male and female divers and they do not dive at the same level on both springboard and platform a front flip is pretty common at that level for men but women never attempt it in competition an elite female can beat a good male but a elite male will not lose to a female men are able to do better higher dives
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but isnt anymore for reasons well thats helpful
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,having a maleonly combat service is defensible imho in the faultofmen department theres a bunch of studies that show that blokes tend not to think clearly when in a fight with women colleagues and have trouble dealing effectively with women colleagues especially when they are injured this kinda shit which yknow clearly the fault of men but if it is an inate thing andthe options of having a less effective mixed force only hire the small percent of male soldiers that dont white knight in battle or just go femaleonly i can see why the fuck it no chicks is just a practical solution for getting the quantity of soldiers meeting the physical standards tldr men are shit at fighting alongside women but you cant get rid of them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ya only where physical strength is necessary
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,grip strength test has nothing to do with friction
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its real interesting how you can see the moment puberty widens the strength gap
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can confirm father is i am i have been working out for a year now but he can fuck my shit up easy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my grandpa looked frail but fuck that man could hit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dad strength is one of the wonders of the world
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,good rebuttal with evidence i wonder if i thought that because many of the women i know personally avoid upper body lifts could just be bias from my own observations
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this plus men have higher density of bones on top of more muscle mass combine that with size of hands and its easy to understand results
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also why transgenders should only compete in their biological sex category
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its refreshing to know that at least one guy is aware of the weird gloating its strange
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly lol what would happen if you were and a guy was fapping to himself in front of you for being taller not a decision dude
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im pretty sure most of the upvotes on this post wasnt because the graph or data is fascinating but because of haha were stronger than girls take that sjws some people here should grow up
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a bit like women being proud and superior because they live longer i dont often see that though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i agree as a male i would never be like hey gorgeous did you know that i can pin you down with ease if i wanted to but i dont so you need to have dinner with me so yeah reddit at it once again
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,were stonger xddddddd i love beating girls in competitions ill obviously win at s
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im always really impressed by women in the weightroom at the gym precisely becaue its difficult for them yet they do it anywaya woman can put in the exact same intensity of workout at the gym as the guys and barely see any improvement in strength at all while the guys improveby leaps and bounds to persevere through that very slow rate of improvement to know youll spend years trying to get the same improvement that guys reach in weeks and to know youll always be secondrate no matter how hard you work and to do it anyway that takes guts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was always a big and ive frequently been told rather intimidating guy im also a happily married father of two daughters i always take pains to not follow a woman on an otherwise empty street ill be the one to cross the street i hate the idea that im giving someone the heebie jeebies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,women too weak to pull a trigger or beat up a redditor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it really is for better and for worse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,boom scienced
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,grip strength is a good proxy for upper and lower limb strength you do realize that what you quoted discusses grip and knee extension strength and that their analysis precludes a blanket advocacy for using either alone to describe the limb muscle strength of tested individuals
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,tldr grip and knee strength isnt very accurate for most but its accurate enough over large sample size to be used to compare strength
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a good measure for upper body strength which men tend to have a greater advantage in than lower body strength they still have an advantage in lower body strength but its less extreme
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its off the coast still not big enough so its called a shit depression with its current speeds
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,actually for men its upper body and lower body
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this sub is full of immature asshats that want to make this post about antifeminist crap any time a topic in this sub is about women or minorities comments gravitate towards bashing women and minorities in subtle sometimes not so subtle ways the top comment is essentially a see i told you so to women
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the degree of it is interesting
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there are some in this very thread
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it was simple algebra equation was simply a women are increasing their record time at a rate of x men are increasing at a rate of y kind of thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,entirely anecdotal but it is crazy how many people that i work with whom are in their have passed away this year if youre unhealthy and in your the grim reaper seems to cut swiftly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my friends and i would call it old man gainz old coach lifts a bleacher stand by himself that was frozen to the turf old man gainz dad turns a bolt that of us couldnt budge old man gainz
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,then why dont teenagers have retard strength
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fuck me twice and call me suzy i reread this shit like times thinking i missed something
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,deja vu
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think thats right many obvious outliers eg man with very low grip strength are large circles they obviously only represent one person each
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,either that or allow ops to write descriptions for their links
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i saw a picture of that hafthor guy looked like a whole thor to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,both hands hes a big guy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh even the laziest of dads are still getting workouts from pick me up to the old chase me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive never beat my dad in an arm wrestle growing up he always told me some day youll be able to beat me but by then you wont want to beat me one time when i was around i was feeling particularly strong and challenged him we were both going max power and i almost had him but that day made me realize that he was right i never challenged him to an arm wrestle again because i was afraid i would beat him and i dont want to beat him i look at him now and i see his once iron biceps are now aging and it makes me sad to see
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we show that total testosterone peaks at – nmoll at an average age of years and falls in the average case to – nmoll by age years but we find no evidence for a further fall in mean total testosterone with increasing age through to old age so it only drops on average by age
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,world class powerlifters and strongman competitors are all in their late early it takes time to build up the muscle mass
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,afthor bjornss indeed most muscular literature ive found indicates that strength increases into the while cardiovascular stamina is more likely to decrease
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if this is like similar graphs the circle size is like population density the larger the circle the more people were found to be a part of the specific measurement value etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what he has amazing grip strength the best grip strength relative to their size
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh yes i forgotted
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i always find it easier to bench the weight that someone else is deadlifting plates baby
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the nhanes survey is meant to answer many healthrelated questions about the us population to do this accurately they often need to oversample certain segments of the population such as old people there are fewer old people in the population so a simple random sample wouldnt get as many of them and therefore estimates about their health would be less accurate oversampling old people ensures that estimates of elderly health are sufficiently accurate the same goes for various minority ethnic groups in addition nhanes measures many many healthrelated variables including those that require special lab equipment they use very cool mobile laboratories but these are very expensive so they only have a few of them i think these have to travel around the country to conduct the survey they obviously cant hit every city and town so instead they pick representative areas at the end of all this they adjust their data to reflect the actual composition of the us population the survey weights represent these adjustments and special statistical software takes these weights into account when computing estimates such as the lines in the above plots
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the diameter of the circle represents the relative number of samples the study had for that particular combination of gender age and grip strength
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for the study they didnt use a representative sample size in order to ensure that each subgroup had enough members to be representative eg the study consists of people even tough only of the people are black numbers completly imaginative they need to test black people to make sure they didnt just have an unusually strongweak black person tested to correct this oversampling they then weighted each sample to ensure an accurate representation of the populus eg each black person is weighted since there are times as many black people in the sample than in the real population not sure if this would be the correct maths but i hope you still get what i mean
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah the old chicken foot grip
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,listen buddy he wanted to know what his hand strength was and thats the number you got a problem with that take it up with the company who certified the calibration on his hand dynamometer i just work herecapisce
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,work for a moving companycan confirm some days this is all i doonly with alot more eating
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,feminist women love eminem chigga chigga chigga slim shady
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats kind of adorable
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe he does it so that you have to invite him over again
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i have a similar situation with my wife sometimes i drive her car and have to raise the steering wheel apparently i push the locking lever too tight for her to change the wheel height back herself i feel bad but its also kinda of funny watching her struggle to undo it im an awful husband
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you never wouldve noticed the old female smaple in the middle of the sea of blue
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,try as they might they wont get a grip on this chart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i met a man last week in dallas his colors were so strong believe me youve seen nothing like it i mean except for me of course i have the strongest colors of any man really nice colors vibrant i have some of the best hues
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,make colors great again looking at you crayola
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,have you ever fought a girl i dont mean beat a girl but actually fight her they are impressively weak its almost sort of funny i have small male friends that train in various forms of fighting and female friends who are like and have been lifting comparatively to the small males the girls have absolutely no chance women are just weak physically its not comparable ever seen a female trash collector maybe it happens theres a reason for it a weak dude is better than a strong woman thats why i have a fun laugh when people think a girl mma fighter could beat even a non ranked male like maybesure if she gets lucky but the worst male fighter in her own weight class could handily beat the shit out of her even if he was intoxicated women can do great things great things much better than men but physically they are quite literally tied to males when the guys are years old and even then they might still be at a disadvantage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,arent muscle mass distribution and bone density both affected by testosterone
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,arent you just contrasting cause and effect
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont want to be that guy but power is already measured per unit time the more you know
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and muscle mass is directly related to testosterone that is why body builders use it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but their dicks are inches way less than my inches of cold fury
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the biggest gender difference in mammals is elephant seals females weigh up to males can get up to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it is and thats why were built the way we are gotta ensure maximum survival and probability of surviving childbirth and be able to care for the child im just saying that it sucks when the least thing youre doing is reproducing hahah
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,war time is also another good example of this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,very true it goes towards why womens bodies are so popular in art in a certain fashion we worship them for their ability to give birth gotta appreciate the balance between society and nature
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is also why less males and more females are born during famines
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or more precisely it would be like you feeling shitty because you cant give birth
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its like me feeling shitty because i cant run as fast as a cheetah i think its because a lot of women including myself at times feel that the mens role is more rewarding and respected the grass is always greener of course men dont exactly coast through life most of the time since you mentioned cheetahs lets go with the frog a female frog can lay as many as eggs cheetahs usually give birth to a litter im sure the cheetah would envy the frogs ability to propagate their species but at the end of the day which is more respected the cheetah or the frog the cheetah is beautiful powerful fast and strong everyone loves a cheetah except their prey frogs though thats how i would feel when i would get down about being a woman sure i can give birth but at the end of the day i would still be a damn frog
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to be fair thats a pretty good reason to be sad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,try feeling shitty because you know its unlikely youll be able to protect yourself and will never feel safe going places alone and this is shoved in your face via jokes about jars that youve never asked for help with try being near useless when you want to move furniture nobody just wants to experience menstrual pregnancy and birth pain this thread is getting to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to be fair eating less works far better for both men and women to lose weight it takes a lot less work to eat less calories than to burn more calories
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah the whole food thing its so unfair
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is the price we pay for having big brainsheads and walking upright ive read we even are born before we should because otherwise we wouldnt fit on the birth canal so we are all lame and weak as newborns compared to other animals
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for sure i didnt mean to sound that all were good for is breeding were still humans after all we can do everything men can do just with our own limitations
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did he just never lift anything heavier than a fork or did he have some kind of disorder like seriously a gallon of milk only weighs a little more than a decent laptop in its retail box right pounds vs like fuck that dudes not just weak hes lifeimpairingly weak he would struggle to load groceries in the refrigerator much less picking them up when shopping fuck i dont think ive ever had a backpack weigh less than that after about minutes of owning one
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did he model his life after that guy from grandmas boy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,iirc thats also why women end up with cellulite and fat men stay smooth i forget if women have some advantage with their straight collagen though i only remember its disadvantageous in torsion and appearance
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that would be unique few of the jobs ive interviewed for have tested me to see if i could do the job before hiring me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,women are also more fragile for a yearold woman incidence of pelvic fracture and incidence of aclmcl tear compared to a man of the same age hard to test for that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the problem is that people say this and then lower the standards as soon as women start failing for the sake of equality
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it costs time and money to test people seniors are barred from some jobs based off age there are some who can pass the standard but its not worth the cost of finding them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im only breakfast rich and even i dont work
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and they dont get arrested they resign
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,iunno man guys like elon musk work pretty damn hard even if its not physical
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,while true theres a reason its called heavy machinery even operating it takes physical strength maybe not so much nowadays since a lot of controls are bywire or powerassisted but if your equipment breaks down someone has to fix it and parts arent light
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,unless of course you are a seahorse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also women are heaps better at diane downs michelle kehoe susan smith andrea yates casey anthony why is there no moral outage about this we live in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,much more concentrated in my limited experience my wife was a rower in college and we have lots of female friends who work out pound for pound though i am still much stronger than even our female competitive powerlifter friends of course there are women out there who could destroy me i recently saw a post in rpowerlifting where one woman was dling something crazy like at bodyweight ridiculously strong
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well also if youre talking about strength im pretty sure grip strength is pretty far down on what people consider to be a marker of being strong
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the weird thing is farming is something that is often done by women even in parts of the world and times in history with little mechanization
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same reason dangerous jobs typically consist primarily of men as well in a society with high childhood mortality if only one of the parents is left and a child dies guess whod have a better shot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my father in law runs a farm in south africa he hires locals to help most of them are women plowing is done with a tractor but they water weed fertilize and harvest by hand no question that most men are physically stronger than most women but most women can do this kind of work just fine
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,carry buckets of water and feed carrying buckets of water is light enough that it was and still is done by women throughout history in the third world manual water fetching is still almost exclusively done by women light here doesnt mean work that isnt strenuous but rather that doesnt require great strength unlike say lifting heavy equipment similarly picking food in the hot sun is hard but doesnt require great physical strength
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,doable for women though maybe to a smaller degree ie smaller fields but definitely doable how the hell do you think grandmas are able to grow crops if it were so physically impossible for women
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,farm work was never light ive worked in several modern nurseries almost anything a strong woman couldnt do would be too dangerous anyways the farmers daughter is inheriting that farm and it makes sense she understands it so i kinda think youre not the farm hand you claim to be wheels engines osha disability suits exist woman have been harvesting planting breeding since time immortal mucked out horse stables while they start riding they might be mexican or amishbut apparently you wouldnt notice anyways
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dunno dude i dont know about the but today the overwhelming majority of subsistence farming labor which is the only type of farming that is still labor rather than capitalintensive is done by women i guess they dont have to walk miles uphill both ways nowadays tho
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my guess is she worked as a massage therapist that was the job of the tiny year old asian lady in my college physiology class who blew all men and women out of the water for the grip strength test
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its actually well documented that women have gotten significantly weaker in the past years because of the advances weve made that have gotten rid of certain chores and blue collar work id be more interested in this graph then than now tbh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,without judging gender roles consider the upper body strength needed to make bread dough and other mixed suspensions in a busy kitchen all day and if this was traditionally womens work how women had to have that body strength and physical body mass to do that work the phenomenon of fairly skinny athletic strong women is new a lot of chores or jobs that require strength also benefit from being squatter and stockier too to an extent more mass offsets the effort applied to the thing being worked a stockier heavier woman for a given height wont have to fight a massive bowl of dough as hard as she wont be actedupon by her own muscles compared to the action upon the dough ball
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,based on my grandmother who is now and still keeps a halfacre garden in rural louisiana im going to say more than slightly a days work for her in her relaxed retirement years is a dull agonizing slog for her indoor employed grandchildren
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,because of flexibility andor smaller frames
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in rock climbing competitions men usually do a route in less than the time the women do
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,could you show where this information is true because as far as i know it isnt rock climbing competitions are still seperate competitions and women do not seem to do better than men i have seen men do their final routes fail and afterwards check out the womens final routes and just campus them it is true that at a starter level women will use less strength and therefor need to learn more technique so when they start the harder routes they will have the technique learned already men at that level use a lot of strength and have more trouble with average routes then they learn the proper technique so men just learn the necesarry skills at a later point but at top level it seems doubtfull that women achieve better
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,at top levels its all men women do not do well compared to men on a competitive level
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres less difference than most sports but men still have the advantage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is simply not true
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i identify as a gold medal winner
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i say we have a separate league for every sport where steroids are actually allowed that shit would be insane
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they test to make sure testosterone is within a certain range thats considered normal as long as their levels are kept in that range theyre allowed to compete some natural male athletes even take very small doses of steroids just to get their levels at the top of the normal range without triggering a failed test its the same deal with guys who become women their hormone replacement therapy has to suppress their testosterone levels enough that it falls within the accepted normal range for natural born women if their testosterone is too high they have to increase their hormone replacement therapy to block more testosterone if they want to compete as women so its not really current hormone levels that give transgender athletes a possible advantage the advantage is for men who become women their height bone density and what not developed during natural testosterone fueled puberty that natural female competitors never went through for women who become men i cant think of any possible advantage theyd have as long as they have to keep their testosterone levels in check i saw a recent story about a top female swimmer in the us who became a man as a woman she was a top olympic prospect after she transitioned she always finished last against the men on her college team
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank mr skeltal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no surely its all just environment just like that time a transgender female mma fighter httpthelibertarianrepubliccomtransgendermmafighterdestroysfemaleopponent ive never felt so overpowered ever in my life and i am an abnormally strong female in my own right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also springboard has a lot to do with strength getting the most dip out of the board and maximizing spring is a combination of strength form position on the board and balance
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont know why they separated it but it wasnt due to an inability for women to compete in the olympics the skeet competition was open to men and women and the gold medal was won by a women zhang shan subsequently in the olympics the skeet competition was made male only and no female skeet competition was held at the olympics leaving zhang shan unable to defend her title
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,israel found pretty much that to b the case in their recent spat with lebanon units with women in them were basically useless but because israel actually gives a shit about military capability and does not give a shit about gender equality they put all of their women in singlesex secondary units
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this comment is delightfully ambiguous
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how the hell do you remember your username
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what the fuck thats not what theyre thinking i dont begrudgingly work out because if men were doing the same workouts as me theyd have better results i just work out i dont think about men at all its not about that you think women who take care of their bodies and have personal fitness goals deserve admiration because mens bodies are different
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he probably does as he literally quoted that part there are plenty more studies out there saying grip strength is a reliable proxy for total strength its very common throughout the literature
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes different research questions might require different approaches
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,itt people making up strawmen arguments about feminism its like theyre jumping at any chance to be like lol feminists r dum
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i recall reading in some medical journal that were the years when men tended to kick off from heart attack and stroke if you could live past you had an almost certain shot at
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that certainly makes sense a general trend is clear and using this type of analysis is precisely for that purpose
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats because only retards have retard strength ill try to be brief i only got up to take a leak and to check for intruders i think youre mistaking that with the burst of strength typically associated with rage it is often exhibited by people with low selfimpulse control and there is nothing on this planet with lower selfcontrol than a hormone fueled teenager i mean they cant even control their erections anyways people often confuse this with retard strength due to the fact that the individual displaying this type of sudden burst of aggression is acting like a retard all the retards of a retard without the retard strength compounded with the fact that these individuals are usually physically weak that any show of strength however meek and brief is amplified by the unexpected nature of it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think either way would be too different and since a system for stickied comments already exists and a system for link descriptions doesnt it seems like it would be easier to use stickying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,standing next to chris hemsworth hed be twothor or at least oneandahalfthor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you look him up on google images one of the suggested searches is next to a normal person
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,gainz is made on the redditz too you should c my fingers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,one time when i was around we were both going max power and i almost had him his once iron biceps at least one of those things is exaggerated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your dad probably didnt trie his hardest a year old man is way stronger than a year old man
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes weightlifting is very friendly to older athletes youll still see guys in their setting prs personal records sometimes the main disadvantage is injury recovery it takes a lot longer to recover and a lot more work to do so fully if you train smart you should be alright
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you shoulded haved goned back to fixed it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,mirin that bench
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the sampling weight is an adjustment for each particular data point youre saying it represents multiple data points this is so far off the mark its basically bullshit this sub needs to start banning users with zero quantitative education who spend two minutes trying to imagine what statistical concepts mean and then spout off misleading explanations to other unaware users
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the genitial issues are probably worse as a woman but adjusting your butt in a seat and rolling over a nut is a special kind of pain that i wish on nobody and youre never safe
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,holy shit this is funny to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im sick of him look at him walking around grabbing his youknowwhat flipping the youknowwho
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that reminds me of my wife so i concur its adorable indeed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wonder what her life is like
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you know who doesnt have strong colors china very weak colors seriously because they didnt negotiate and i know how to do that trust me ive made alot of deals the russians basically said ok china youre communist now you need a new flag that flag is going to be red and yellow like ours ok so when people see your flag they think about communism and we started that your flag should remind people of our flag thats why your colors are red and yellow now oh by the way we love your wall its great really really great we would have made the mongols pay for it though other than that really great wall superb
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they are impressively weak its almost sort of funny im a woman and i dont find it particularly funny just sad and terrifying knowing that so many people could overpower me and harm me however they see fit is disconcerting to say the least plus ive always wanted to be really strong but no matter what i do i cant make the gains i want ive even considered taking growth hormones but ultimately decided against it due to the other side effects i mean i dont see many advantages to being a woman i gave birth twice and wouldnt trade my children for anything but i really could have done without the pregnancies birth and postpartum depression and psychosis threads like this just make me feel hopeless
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my brothers years younger than me and neither of us work out but are pretty average from about the age of him being i couldnt pick a physical fight with him because he can literally restrain me with one hand goddamnit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that said rousey scares me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pretty sure sexual dimorphism is due to hormones and high levels of testosterone plus some other hormonal differences to a lesser degree is the hormonal stimulus that triggers masculine traits
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its weird how reddit has collectively taken a complete on how to brag about dicksizes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,get em out for harambe boys
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dolphins have semen injectors the length of their bodies ducks unroll and inflate their rape sticks in the blink of an eye and us we have sex for fun and companionship i like us just fine
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or that artists are often men who like looking at women
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to a cheetah
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what are you on about frogs are awesome httpunclemiltoncomphotosjigsawpuzzleredeyedtreefroghrjpg
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is such a good way to put it women are great but our advantage mostly benefits the group men are great but their advantage mostly benefits themselves its hard not to be envious especially since im selfish
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wtf am i reading march god created men and sam colt made them equal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a guy who dresses like neo in real life is not the kind of guy to load groceries in the fridge when his mom could do it instead
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont know if he actually had any disorders but the dude was basically a man baby dude was fat but still really thin like imagine if bones could be fluffy and just have skin on them would throw a fit if he actually had to do anything would sulk for days if someone couldnt give him a ride and he had to walk to class pretty much relied on other people in his house for handling groceries that crazy furry house was pretty communal so hed stir pots or something when they were all making dinner but couldnt do much more than that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it helps the skin stretch during pregnancy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for a firefighter or police job they absolutely test you first for some warehouse jobs they test you too send you to a place where you have to like lift weight and carry it and set it down etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same here only one for me i actually wish more would
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is absolutely critical and the number one reason why women in combat roles is a dumb idea by the month mark of a deployment in which they are humping a full combat load every day of them are useless because of stress fractures ligament tears etc its a simple manpower issue both the marine corps and the army have done multiple studies confirming such the civilian leadership didnt really care though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i tried googling and found nothing what does breakfast rich mean
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or run for president
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or arnold schwarzenegger
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this in my culture farming was such a womens thing that if a man did it people would actually assume he was gay
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lowtech farming can be done with a couple kids in tow which was how they often did it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,traditionally hoeing and weeding has been a job delegated to women in a lot of agrarian societies id love to see a return to that at my job because i hate hoeing weeds
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,definitely still is there are hundreds of millions of people on earth today whose only access to water is from women walking miles to a river filling jugs with water and walking back and doing that two or three times each and every day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah wasnt that a big deal during biblical times women would go to the well early in the morning when it was cool and socialize and talk there while gathering water then bring it back before the sun was at its strongest that was an enormous role because the water they gathered in the morning was what theyd use for the rest of the day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,none of these things are physically impossible for women the study was measuring grip strength anyway not fitness to do manual labor which women do every day all over the world including the impossible tasks of plowing and carrying water and id like to know the last time any man here plowed a field behind an ox thats way beyond the scope of this study anyway
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so i kinda think youre not the farm hand you claim to be and i think its gonna be a long long time til lunch time brings me round again to find im not the hand they think i am on reddit oh no no no im a tractor man tractor man mowing down the fields out here alone
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just as a small side note the phrase is time immemorial not time immortal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this comment was a rollercoaster
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,blew all men i thought this was going somewhere else
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what about men
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh man old school cookingbaking is no joke it does require a lot of arm strength and the few times ive done it i end up exhausted my mom used to tell me my greatgrandmother had massive arms for a woman for working in the kitchen
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that and they have less weight different center of gravity and more use of leg strength instead of arm strength
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,iirc consistent blood circulation is a big thing that women have over men this may be due to having smaller muscles leading to less constriction of the blood vessels
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,go back and watch the womens ice climbing from the x games in the its insane
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he never said women were better he said they were close and they are close—very close they have different skillsets for sure but women climb at a very close level to men throughout the entire skill curve this is vastly different than say basketball or tennis or weightlifting where the skill gap is enormous and the very best women in their sport would be like rank amongst the men
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is the correct answer thank you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,of the next nonrio olympics of course
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it would look almost identical to current sports leagues
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably not to different all top level athletes are already on steroids the only difference is they have to stop a few weeks before their competition for drug testing etc so everything is out of their system
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,russian olympics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you should re watch some games from the mlb in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would watch the shit out of that hes reaching the final hurdle hes jumping hes crossed hes turning aroundhes hes ripping the hurdle apart hes chasing the other athletes oh god the horror hes beating the japanese hurdle champion to death with a hurdle oh jesus why is he putting that there my eyes now lets cross to cycling where lance armstrong is facefucking one of the french champions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for hyperandrogenic and intersex women although it still applies in the transgender case last year the court of arbitration for sport agreed with indian athlete dutee chands contention that hormone testing for females was discriminatory and ineffective it suspended the tests allowing chand and other hyperandrogenic athletes including south african caster semenya to compete
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that view you are responding to is really weird and took me offguard we arent second rate among our gender and thats what matters we arent doing what he thinks we are doing and thats assuming that we are competitive and comparing ourselves to everyone else when we work out we arent working out through our disappointment that men are stronger what a weird thing to assume i wonder where it came from ive got several theories but i dont want to speculate on what that person thinks and put words in their mouth so ill just stop with huh interesting
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my dad made it past to miss you pops
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whew my dad will be in a couple months each year as his birthday approaches i wonder how much longer ill have with him this is a little reassuring at least maybe ill get more years with him
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you could live past you had an almost certain shot at thats not even close to true according to the cdc mortality rates in the us from to is roughly meaning half of those who make it to age are going to die before if a full half of those who make it years past your magic number die a full years before the end of the certain shot number theres no way youre remembering that correctly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is the scariest thing ive read in a long time my dad turns this year and hes got a couple health problems i know im just shooting the messenger here but fuck you buddy youve ruined my night i hope we can still be friends after this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,one and a half thors chris hemsworth and and hafthor bjornsson move into charlie sheens bachelor pad and antics ensue
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,actually his biceps were coated in molten iron in a tragic foundry accident pls pray him god bless
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i feel like that guy might be slow
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wtf happened here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but hes so cute though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,god made man and women samuel colt made them equal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im a woman and i dont find it particularly funny just sad and terrifying knowing that so many people could overpower me and harm me however they see fit is disconcerting to say the least thats the bad but theres a lot more good than bad the majority of those people will use their strength to help others however is necessary
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pounds lighter dude your underestimating yourself
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah near the same weight maybe but jesus if youre to and vs a lber unless he goes for vitals you should shit on him
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i could out lift her but she could probably throw a better punch also id cry more a lot more
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i buy monster condoms for my magnum dong
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i dont know when it became cool to have a inch cock meanwhile i got this inch monster in my pants
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well then ill hurt my intial statement to argue with yours greeks loved everyone including male figures the human body is something that we love in art because its familiar we know the beauty of it we know what perfection wed like too see and we can through art its not a sexual thing greeks and romans didnt go around wacking it too nude statues
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it seems everything in a women helps with pregnancy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not impossible its just rare
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a spectrum not a dichotomy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not quite supper rich just breakfast rich
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in a lot of cultures farming is done by hoes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,welcome to the garden path sentence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they have less weight and thus a better strengthtoweightratio like children
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i thought women had worse circulation although i suppose worse needs to be clarified could be less but more consistent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres no winners at this olympics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but we want the good unhealthy steroids you know the bruce banner steroids i want the real hulk hogan out there playing linebacker yeah these guys use performance enhancers now but were talking clear unflitered raw dick shrinking juice here shoot the shit once and your shit looks like winter time permanently
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dibs on his also buy a dont be selfish
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,relevant user name get it together buddy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we shall always be friends my flappy little goat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can we get kat dennings to be the plot for this one i would crowdfund the shit out of it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would have to imagine these antics mostly revolve around working out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wouldnt it be two and a half thors assuming that chris is one and the mountain is one and a half
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i can give him a facebook like whats the exchange rate for likes to prayers these days
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hasta la vista baby
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nothing like a nut its like having your guts pulled out of your abdomen and then crammed back in all out of order with a second delay so you have time to think about how bad its going to hurt and the joy of waiting for it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i know most men are good people its just hard not to feel a little paranoid sometimes especially when we live in a culture of fear that teaches women to be on guard and fearful all the time i just want to be an awesome super beefy firefighter who rescues children from burning buildings and does all kinds of other awesome stuff i used to be a firefighter while my male counterparts were getting praised i was getting asked why not just let the men handle it and accusations that i didnt truly earn my position even though i was held to the same testing standards as the men and i pass all of them just fine it also sucked that i had to work a lot harder to meet those standards than the guys did i spent soooo much time in the gym and was very careful about everything i ate monitoring macros etc the only bright side was that my chief liked using me in all the departments pr stuff i guess because it looks good to have women and minorities representing your agency i guess all i am trying to say is that for my specific life goals being a woman is a big disadvantage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah chances are youre going to beat anyone pounds lighter weight is also a big deal in fighting unless youre just morbidly obese
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats the thing and really what i was referring to op is nuts if he thinks strength is all there is to a fight those mma types know all kinds of grappling and joint lock shit that i dont care how strong you are youre losing and i took rousey as an example because shes well known but i wouldnt go up against any of them since i dont know what im doing i know im losing though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well yes traits involved with surviving pregnancy got passed on women who die during their first pregnancy probably dont have offspring to carry on their genes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well that is the reason that women exist at all if they didnt have to give birth there would be little natural advantage to the female form in a survival scenario over a male body it would be great if we were all reproduced asexually and our young just started as spores or something but alas we are stuck with these stinky squishy bodies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there are two ways weve gotten to this point in time multiplying and not dying women had to become very good at their job in the evolutionary sense and men had to become quite strong to protect any gains in our population
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in case you still missed itsupper
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,men of the same weight are statistically still stronger on average and most of that strength is in the upper body where they are upwards of stronger at the same weight this is why male bantamweight ufc fighters are not allowed to fight their female counterparts of the same weight among other reasons children of both sexes also have terrible strengthtoweight ratios relative to adults
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nothing like going to the climbing gym and failing climbing up a problemroute and then watching a tiny child just zip up the thing like it was nothing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,men definitely have a better strength to weight ratio women can keep up in rock climbing because there are successful techniques that suit the strengths of both genders
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sure there are didnt get murdered or poisoned you win
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it actually makes your balls shrink not your cock common misconception i think
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your balls shrink my dick was small before steroids and its small after steroids
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i want the real hulk hogan you know he is a real person right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont be a fool wait until he buys a then call dibs on that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,good lord shes a terrible actress but dem titites arent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i too appreciate kat dennings plot contributions to anything she appears in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,prayers facebook like short spike with all the terrible stuff in the world lately
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i know most men are good people its just hard not to feel a little paranoid sometimes especially when we live in a culture of fear that teaches women to be on guard and fearful all the time yeah i definitely understand sorry about that just know that almost all of us out here have your back and were also looking over our shoulders when walking home late at night too i just want to be an awesome super beefy firefighter who rescues children from burning buildings and does all kinds of other awesome stuff i used to be a firefighter while my male counterparts were getting praised i was getting asked why not just let the men handle it and accusations that i didnt truly earn my position even though i was held to the same testing standards as the men and i pass all of them just fine i guess all i am trying to say is that for my specific life goals being a woman is a big disadvantage that sucks and i understand why the hormone options are undesirable too dont laugh but im kinda the opposite and ive certainly never shared this with anyone i honestly desperately wanted to be a woman feminine notsuperbeefy and all starting at about years old id dress up in my moms grossly oversized for me clothes and heels when nobody was around my parents caught me and i got a stern talking to puberty hit i turned into a huge hulking hairbeast and the idea that i could ever be feminine was just laughable no amount of hormones or surgery could put that genie back in the bottle i also volunteer with the local fd i still really like movies like freaky friday go figure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you would have to like purposely lose or give no effort at all to lose to someone pounds lighter i mean are you shitting me you would most likely destroy them unless theyre some kind of professional
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but when he says unranked he means like people into mma but not professionals so theyd probably have less knowledge than a female pro but they wouldnt be any where near clueless
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or that offspring isnt going to survive very long without a mother
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is why male bantamweight ufc fighters are not allowed to fight their female counterparts of the same weight among other reasons but boy that sure didnt stop the media from trying to push a rousey vs man fight id have made so much money off that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and why children have such difficult times climbing ropes a task untrained adults accomplish handily
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when i was i could climb the rope in gym with only using my arms i tried this feat a couple of years ago arms only and no legs and it wasnt even close the squarecube law is an amazing thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,gets zika
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so no winners at this years olympics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wouldnt smaller balls make your dick look bigger
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i swear normies and their steroidotypes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but bloodborne
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,one of her tits actually played the role of the bear that raped leonardo dicaprio in the revenant talented
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,shes not terrible shes below average tits are amazing though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sometimes i just wanna get on tv and let loose but cant but its cool for tom green to hump a dead moose
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i can definitely relate i tried to pass myself off as a guy often but i had kids and now i have huge hips and boobs and that isnt as easy to do as it was when i was a flat chested androgynous teenager
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think you are vastly underestimating the power of hormones i have seen trans people who look like wrestlers turn into some some of the most feminine people you can think of
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ill just use my speed and your mass against you last thing a smaller guy said to me before trying to pick a fight to prove some point about weight divisions in physical contests or something and slowly succumbing to the lowest effort bear hug imaginable and subsequently never talking to me again it was only a pound difference at the time vs maybe or so but definitely night and day unless youve got some really concentrated strength in just a few muscles that you can use to damage a joint or theres an insurmountable difference in skill and experience then the big guy is pretty much always going to dictate those interactions because everything is just so much easier for him
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you know they would have fed her a sacrifice some guy just hired who took a few tae bo classes once even then it would really be a question of who would win against anyone professional the fight would have been brutal for her
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no you wouldnt because vegas oddsmakers are not stupid and they would have given the male fighter a at a minimum
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,was helping a primary school kid get his ball off the roof back in highschool as i lifted him up he grabbed the edges of the roof did a chin up held on with hand and grabbed the ball with the other i felt so freaking emasculated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the guys not kicking the bucket for at least years bloodborne and dark souls will be out by then its a joke i dont need multiple people telling me theyre not making another souls game
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they think its like dark souls and by being lighter they fast roll while you fat roll not how it works
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thing is once youre up around in most situations its no longer whos bigger a guy that size is big enough to make it hurt even if his opponnent is bigger provided the pounder is fit and fast not short n fat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,someone with good fighting training at kgs would walk over someone without any training at if their height was the same weight is really important but youre story would be a lot more accurate if it was to if he was a shit fighter and you were of muscle then that makes sense but at a fit competent fighter will hit you hard enough and fast enough to win you also wouldnt be able to get him in a bear hug
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,reminds me of the williams sisters back in where they challenged any male outside the top a man named karsten braasch took up the challenge the story goes that after playing a round of golf and downing a few beers went on to beat both serena and venus and respectively
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so it looked like bobby fischer had the highest peak of any player nearly but kasparov had the highest career average around does that sound about right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i looked up a player i noticed got to the top and then immediately disappeared around sep httpsenwikipediaorgwikiignatzkolisch his disappearance coincides with the paris tournament mentioned near the end of the wiki article in his case im guessing he won the tournament and decided to stop competing in chess tournaments but wikipedia alone isnt enough to explain i looked him up because seeing someone disappear after becoming first just screams untimely death murder doesnt it but he lived until years after the paris tournament so he must have quit at some point before his death great visualization and a very impactful way to teach history
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,reminds me of this xkcd which shows a similar chart for mens and womens chess as well as the nba
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yay reddit this is really awesome im a crap player but somewhat knowledgable about the cold war history of chess getting to work on gary kasparovs joint venture with ibm clubkasparovcom but discovered the story of paul morphy which as a frequent visitor to his home town of new orleans was fascinating his family home is now the popular brennans restaurant httpsenwikipediaorgwikipaulmorphy and also discovered emmanuel laskar and his interesting checkers variation lasca which ill be trying out as soon as my son and wife get home tomorrow httpwwwlascaorg
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,anyone has more information about the rise and fall of fisher it seems spectacular to say the least
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just from the visualization and with no background info i find it funny how that petrov guy is the first on the graph at around age then slowly but consistently climbs upwards until hes about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,was paul morphy the youngest number or am i missing someone i hadnt heard of him before is it possible to elaborate this dynamic graph in r great video
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not knowing anything about the way this score is calculated i watched until the end hoping to see deep blue in there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i like the music and it looks great but am i the only one who finds it to be barely comprehensible like all im seeing is lines with names moving up and down to music its really heard for me even make any hypotheses about this data because too much is presented at once with sudden transitions and constantly changing axes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why does the number one player so often leave everyone else in the dust
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lol it looks like paul morphy had ignatz kolisch killed after he passed him then tried to do the same to wilhelm steinitz but died in the attempt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id like to imagine that whenever a line ends right as it intersects with another the two chess players had a chess death battle
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was hoping the end would have an ai computer thats miles above anyone else
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,emanuel lasker is a fucking savage finally gets beat after years on top and then instead of being a pussy and passing the torch he says fuck that and plays his ass off to beat that cuban youngblood respect
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is a fascinating graph but i would like to have seen deep blue on here is it barely better than humans or completely dominant is it like a on the chart or like over good
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you look at the credits this was made by cary huang who hosts his own channel called carykh even better he helped make a season animated show on youtube named bfdi with his brother its been years since they had to stop making vids but they are coming back tldr maker has a channel called carykh and check out bfdi cause he helped make that too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what happened to ignatz kolisch he was top player for like months then he just vanished
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i just love this thanks it looks like ignatz kolisch beats paul morphy at and then gets murderedand the plot thickens
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how long have chess players been using the elo system are the ratings of back in the day actually comparable to those from today
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a quick video on the history of chess and its development
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,interesting to see that most number are not able to sustain success in their late or early the mind has a peak and ages just like the body
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its amazing how young some of the players are paul morphy at age was best in the world
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it would be interesting to see an overlay of what was going on in history as this graph progresses also is there a perfect score or rating and how do their ratings jump so much in certain segments ie wouldnt a great chess player play well no matter their age in this graphic it clearly shows drastic improvements as well as steep declines in terms of performance
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its weird that there tends to be one far ahead of the rest whilst the other fight it out then someone rises about as the leader falls and takes their place some people were particularly interesting like alexander petrov from the very beginning staying in the top for a long time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,any info explaining the oddity that is aside from maybe somehow relating to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,op were the rating systems on the same scale or did you have to normalize them if normalization was necessary what method did you use to do so
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,have the brits never had a dominant chess player like the russians were always represented but the union jack never rose above place even during their greatest years as an empire youd think cultural pomposity would affect the emphasis a society places on chess seems not to be so
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its interesting that most of the time the majority of players are in a pack and theres one person who rises above the rest by a large margin most of the players that rise above do it very quickly can any high level chess players detail what each of the top players figured out that put them so high above the rest so quickly its almost like they have an epiphany about how to think in the game and everyone is left trying to piece together what makes them so effective and then everyone slowly catches up until theres another individual with an epiphany
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so i get why players spontaneously disappear retirement death but in the early part of the viz why do players suddenly appear
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i love how it seemed as if kasparov just stopped when he thought someone was going to overtake him also no matter what happened the music seemed in sync
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its difficult to judge adjusted elo ratings by their very nature in addition to the fact more rigorous analysis isnt done that often with that being said i wouldnt be surprised if its true whatever that would mean fischer was probably more dominant than his peers by anyone since morphy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so it looked like bobby fischer had the highest peak of any player nearly but kasparov had the highest career average around does that sound about right the peaks and ratings spanning eras is meaningless the top players today would crush fischer and handily beat kasparov you cant really compare eras in chess because the younger generation has so much more knowledgeetc than the previous generation for example carlsen naka etc would easily beat fischer in a match because the younger generation has so much more chess knowledgeetc it wouldnt be a contest edit for everyone disagreeing and downvoting here is carlsen saying he would beat fischer chess has advanced in the years between when fischer reigned supreme to today
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but they didnt use the elo system back then so they arent acknowledged as much as carlsen right you know since the ranking system is outdated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there was the year old american child prodigy i looked up when he disappeared off the chart i thought my goodness he died young he did die young but still years after he retired loved the video
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,speaking of murder and chess alexander pichushkin is my personal favorite player
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,some of them could probably cheat if it was only for a single tournament it has even happened in our time on a lower level back then you could make a name for yourself and get out before someone found out and ruined your name this is what florence griffith joyner also did as she retired just when they started testing runners for doping much more often
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why do they distinguish between men and women in chess i can understand basketball but arent men and women supposed to be equal with that sort of thing googled for myself and found this thread httpswwwchesscomforumviewgeneralmenswomenschesswhy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,where is kobe
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you very much for that summary
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,awesome knowledge on the stuff very interesting
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow such great strategists i should not have doubted bobby fischer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you a really great read what freaks me out is that its hard to know who is the best ever because a lot of the best players retire a bit to early they burn out while some great players who were never as good can continue for years at near top level weird sport
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im just guessing here but i think those giant jumps generally coincide with having an incredible performance at a given tournament
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it must have been a combination of many factors for the most explosive growth players its usually down to being unusually talented for players who stayed steady first over longer periods of time it may have been other things paul morphy must simply have been an extreme talent he understood intuitively many of the concepts of the modern positional game which wilhelm steinitz the first world champion would later use with devastating effect and which he is largely credited for inventing lasker second wc was perhaps at his best when he could play the opponent rather than the position capablanca third wc was another singular talent maybe the greatest natural ever perhaps held back in the grand scheme of things by being lazy and having a large part of his professional development stunted by the first world war by the time capablanca defeated lasker he had already been regarded as the best player in the world for years fischer was another unique talent whose style is very similar to capablancas but he had the work ethic that capa lacked karpov has the misfortune of having the later half of his peak overshadowed by kasparov but in fact he was not really a weaker player until well into the from to he and kasparov are neckandneck he was also the favourite of the soviet school perhaps because of his relentlessly logical boa constrictor approach kasparov is another unique talent coupled with a superb work ethic he can perhaps be said to be the most universalcomplete player magnus carlsen is of the lasker school and is nigh impossible to handle in simple positions which often turn out not so simple after all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i feel like its because they think of a strategy that works really well then people start figuring out how to beat the strategy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not the most well versed on chess history so i could be a little off but before steinitz chess was played with romantic ideal of attacking at all costs if you want to see some crazy attacks looks any of morphys games steinitz drastically changed this with a long term positional strategy controlling key squares and forcing your opponent into worse and worse spots a lot of what he did is theory about controlling the center with pawns then you have the next wave of chessters called hypermodernists who came up with the idea of controlling the center with longer distance pieces lasker was a game theory genius and not only good at a chess but also checkers bridge board games go hes known for his chess psychology maybe not always making the best move but making practical moves at the right times to confuse the issue capablanca i believe was just a machine who always made the right move and understood defense and endgames better than anyone at that point i hope that helps a little
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,heres fischer annotating a famous game of morphys
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fischer was an enigma his play against the russians karpov and spasky was a cold war victory for the us but there was lots of politics and ego wrapped around it so despite clearly being the best he quit playing for years then came back sort of didnt play kasparov but beat spasky in yugoslavia breaking us and un sanctions then lived as a us expat who claimed that he was bored with chess because no one could challenge him httpsenwikipediaorgwikibobbyfischersuddenobscurity
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he won in in what was kind of an erratic tournament he was making weird requests the entire time but playing great chess he was required to defend his title in but refused and forfeited when he first won he was a huge celebrity in the us but he refused all endorsement deals if you have an hour gives a pretty good summary
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he idolized hitler and read everything about him that he could lay his hands on he also championed a brand of antisemitism that could only be thought up by a mind completely cut off from reality
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,countless books and movies would love to tell you all abou of it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rise dude was a genius an extraordinaory prodigy simple as that fall dude was eccentric and maybe a bit mental he retired from chess very earlyprematurely and moved to iceland after he became tired with his success
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres an hbo documentary about fishers rise and fall httpsenwikipediaorgwikibobbyfischeragainsttheworld
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fischer probably had autism except back then no one knew what autism was he was so obsessed with becoming champion that he didnt know what to do after he won he went on to fixate on cults antisemitism and became extremely paranoid his downfall is a perfect example of the devastating effects of untreated mental illness
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,morphy is another american genius extraordinaire who burst onto the scene at a prodigious age he then retired chess early he pulled a bobby fisher before bobby fischer made it cool seriously their career trajectories are surpisingly similar except morphy died young whereas fischer lived a long life avoiding from public scrutiny
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,deep blue isnt in there but thats because it only played a few games before being dismantled so it doesnt have an accurate elo to satisfy your curiosity though between deep blue and now computer elos have risen to much higher far above much higher than the highest level shown in the video and beyond human capability not to mention these chess computers can be ran on a personal computer or phone rather than on a supercomputer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think it is really interesting as somebody with a chess background and knows the history of the players without that though i can see how it is pretty incomprehensible and unrelatable
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,agree i was basically just watching the top slot or following one person at a time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the way elo is calculated basically if youre beating the majority of your peers in tournaments your elo needs to be far higher than theirs for it to decrease overall remember this is a rating not a scale reflection of skill
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i was hoping for that also i wonder roughly what year computers first became clearly better than the top chess players
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,deep blue famously beat kasparov who is widely considered one of the top of all time but by todays ai standards it wouldnt be that exceptional no person could hope to beat a top chess ai today
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not only that it appeared he was overtaking morphy as welltime to do some diggingand by digging i mean a cursory google search edit so google mentions that he died of kidney failure in twenty two years after this paris win in there goes my theory of morphy exacting his revenge swiftly after being knocked out of the top spot it does mention he wasnt big on attending tournaments perhaps a simple lack of tournament participation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well no no one ever beat morphy in a match
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,about they started the ratings arent comparable from era to era
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they werent in the top before
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why wouldnt they suddenly appear a player has to start playing and there is a certain point where they crack into top top etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably because of modernization of the chess rules and the point system i would guess
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they show up to a tournament and do really well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,one method that is just becoming useful over the last few years is to measure skill based on how chess ai evaluates a players moves doing so provides an objective way to compare historical and modern players httpsenwikipediaorgwikicomparisonoftopchessplayersthroughouthistorymovesplayedcomparedwithcomputerchoices
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fischer was probably more dominant than his peers by anyone since morphy i would say the main reason why kasparov never stood as tall over his peers as those two was mostly because he was playing at the same time as one of the most constently good players of all time namely karpov just check the graph in the video karpov stays above the line for close to years kasparov without karpov had been astronomical and i am quite sure fischer peaks would had been outdone then
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it works better as a classing system a is in an elite class but it doesnt always mean they will always beat a
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fischer himself even realized that the current generation of chess players had an advantage of previous generations due to a better understanding of the opening thats why he created his own variant of chess called fischerrandom where the home rank of each player is randomized so more emphasis is placed on raw strategy and understanding of chess rather than memorizing openings so sure fischer would have crushed previous world champions from years before and todays top grandmasters would probably crush fischer today but in terms of actual brilliance on the board thats up for debate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the top players today would crush fischer and handily beat kasparov despite having been retired for over a decade kasparov randomly popped his head in up a couple months back to get third out of four in blitz tournament scoring against a lineup of hikaru nakamura wesley so and fabiano caruana this is despite a number of simple blunders that an im caliber player in tournament form would never make even in a blitz game his intuitive understanding is just insane at his peak he was really fuckin good his peak play has basically only been surpassed by carlsen though not by much and he unarguably would have been top today
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dude you have no idea what youre talking about kasparov would not be handily beat by the top today shit he just beat of the top ten in game minimatches of blitz kasparov would still be comfortably one of the best in the world if he wanted to play you sound absolutely silly saying that he would get beaten handily and fischer would certainly be able to compete and would likely be better than them all he knew the game inside and out he put in more hours than naka and carlsen combined he would just need to study a little bit of modern opening theory and hed probably be fine without it dont be a fool
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i assume modern chess computers really add the edge to evaluating your own moves and learning from them theres probably a big difference in players before and after modern computers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no serious player today would agree with you i dont think you truly understand just how strong fischer was and how strong kasparov still is may i remind you that he crushed naka and caruana in blitz and only had a negative score against so this is under half a year ago
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so its like combat sports todays mma guys would lick any fighter of yore
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i understand it works like this on videogames but would it in chess
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes they would beat fischer but not kasparov at all fischer was from a different time before the mass aggregation of chess knowledge due to the internet fischer was arguably the most talented player of all time he was simply born years too early to be the strongest absolute player of all time also fischer was in fact competing in rapid chess on the internet in his later years and killing grandmasters left and right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fide adopted the elo system only the e is capitalized its a mans name rather than an acronym in fischer was world champion from
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,paul morphy was ridiculously ahead of his time he essentially took opening theory to a new level unfortunately his innovations were not widely popularized in his time kasparov said that it took another quarter century after morphys death for the chess world to rediscover his innovations morphy conquered the us in the late to much fanfare in the newspapers europe basically ridiculed his achievements and challenged him to cross the atlantic to play their great players morphy obliged and went on to beat the crap out of europe in astounding fashion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i remember that one that quote came quickly at the end but it hit me like a freight train im still not sure what to feel after hearingreading it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,much fewer women play chess so they are underrepresented
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why do they distinguish between men and women in chess they dont really there are some womenonly tournaments but there arent any menonly tournaments
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,of course feats of strength should have separate categories for women but those that dont but are still separated really shouldnt exist eg chess bowling snooker darts curling shooting archery im sure there are many more i think its derisory if not derogatory to women to say you couldnt possibly compete on a par so you get your own category
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sorry for the other ridiculous reply its simply to try to get women to play the best female player of all time reached the top so theyre just as good they just dont generally decide to play chess and then stay with it seriously as often and for as long as men do so they make womens tournaments to encourage women to play because they have a better chance of winning prize money and what not and maybe one day they will play with men more often its important to note that women are allowed to play with men and some choose to but men arent allowed to enter womens tournaments there are no maleonly tournaments
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the answer is easy chess is not as popular to women and if they had to compete with men it would be discouraging to women im sure if a women can challenge the best man they get elo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it could be that the centuries of different ideals and goals that have been set for men and womenby themselves or by society still puts women and men in different roles and gives them different aspirations there is a possibility that there are smaller genetic differences in spatial analysis wiring in the brain or perhaps just a wider variations in general for me no singular answer is given nor is there any scientific consensus on the topic but just ask yourself why have there been so many more russians than americans in the top levels of chess most likely because russia have put a greater number of people in contact with chess and have a much higher saturation of possible chessplayers so this factor is decidedly an important one and since its even more obvious for men vs women i would always go to that as the more likely explaination
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think this answer from the thread was the most enlightening its genetics men have higher variance than women in other words the distribution for men is leptokurtic there are extreemly smartstrong men and hopelessly retardedweak men whereas women tend towards the center this is a known fact easily visible in higher death ratios for musculin babies and sportscience statistics where extreem wins or dies the nature is reasonably wise the natures base assuption in this case is the strongest man will win over others and impregnate multiple women whom should be in sufficient health to carry the babies other men who are unlucky to be on the left side of the dispersion can die early wo children it does not impact the survival chances of the race overall in time the humankind will become stronger
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,mathematicians tend to age like athletes where theyre prime is mid to mid this may be the perfect time of knowledge and creativity in our lives wouldnt be surprised if many chess players peak around the same time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well this clearly backfired
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and you end up at so well done i guess
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what a shitty translator cutting him off before he finishes his sentences
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,beat one of the top players in yugoslavia you mean spassky
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i know a couple people with aspergers theyre the smartest people i know in whatever they specialize in and theyre unbareable to be around my cousin is around or and is already in doing calc same stuff im doing years earlier but he has the mannerisms of a damn toddler
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that is pretty much irrelevant to the question
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i googled for some movies and there seems to be a few can you recommend one that you thought was good
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fischer did go completely mental theres no need to sugarcoat it or try to lessen the blow he lost his mind gradually over his career he was extremely paranoid he thought he was constantly being spied on by the soviet and us governments he was also very racist and antisemitic above all he was afraid of losing and his reaction to this fear manifested in ways that could only be considered mental such as creating lengthy and unreasonable demands to tournament organizers he didnt like how he could hear the noises the camera made he didnt like how the board reflected so much light the audience was too close for his liking he wanted the squares on the chess board to be smaller by the end all that was left of the man was a shell full of hatred well everyone knows what became of him once he quit chess for good his life was a tragic story of mental illness gone completely untreated his greatness at a game allowed him the entitlement of doing as he pleased which enabled his illness to go unchecked and deteriorated him into a person who could only be considered mentally insane
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lol no he was lucky iceland agreed to take him in he was running from the us not just moving to iceland because he was tired of success
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes their carreers were very similar they both started at the age of and reached a peak rating of elo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in overall standingsnot a match
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this person is talking about the absolute start of the video my guess is that there was not a lot of data available in the early days eg only
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the problem is that chess is not about playing accurate moves its about winning players like tal and kasparov have many blunders because they played risky but efficient chess that propelled them both to the highest peak if you play boldly and explore new ideas you will make more mistakes than if you stick to the safe and sound but ultimately drawish style im not saying that ai eval is useless but if used naively it will lead to false conclusions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the problem with those numbers in particular is that most of the players analyzed were stronger or as strong as the engine used to evaluate them edit i was referring to the crafty analysis not rybka crafty had capablanca as the most accurate rybka has fischer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,kasparov without karpov had been astronomical thats totally fair he was even totally dominant against anand
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,kasparov was rated about or so when he defeated the israeli national team guys all at their peaks each in a game minimatch simultaneously with a score of thats kind of confusing to read but basically he was on another level
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yep its a statistical comparison iirc a point difference is a chance of victory for the stronger player while a point difference is so in your example there is some single digit probability that the player will manage a draw or win
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your point stands but just to note a player legitimately should not lose to a ever if they are both playing to win ie not playing dumb openings and fun tactical traps
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,despite having been retired for over a decade kasparov came popped his head in up a couple months back to get third out of four in blitz tournament whats your point out of isnt good and its blitz at his peak he was really fuckin good no shit he was the best chess player of his era just like fischer was the best chess player of his era but todays best player carlsen would beat kasparov
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,shit he just beat of the top ten in game minimatches of blitz yes it was blitz played for fun if kasparov thought he had a chance he would start playing competitive chess again he isnt that alone is revealing there is no doubt kasparov was the best chess player of his generation just like fischer was the best player in his generation but kasparov would have beat fischer and carlsen would beat kasparov and fischer kasparov would still be comfortably one of the best in the world if he wanted to play no he wouldnt he most definitely wouldnt be top
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i assume modern chess computers really add the edge to evaluating your own moves and learning from them yes computers help immensely but also the training conditioning etc are extremely improved as well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no serious player today would agree with you i dont think you truly understand just how strong fischer was and how strong kasparov still is nakamura said that any major player would beat fischer now certainly he might be wrong but its not so unheard of
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no serious player today would agree with you fischer himself agreed with me when he was alive and todays top chess player the best player in human history agrees with me as well i dont think you truly understand just how strong fischer was im well aware of how good he was relative to his peers but chess play has advanced in the years since he pretty much stopped playing okay may i remind you that he crushed naka and caruana in blitz and only had a negative score against so thats blitz and that was played for fun
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well miracles of modern science definitely increase gains and decrease recovery time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes each generation gets better because we learn more about chess also the training is better as well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,having historic games and their analysis is vital to chessplayers especially on the higher levels a lot of high level chess is applying what you already saw and analysed before you play your opponent coming up with moves on the fly just isnt good enough any more the game is too complex with too much room for errors that can be exploited by someone who studied a position extensively these days you can easily get your hands on gigantic numbers of games between the best players in the world for the last two centuries something that was a lot harder to do not that long ago and computers that can calculate the best moves better than any human can so they can provide better analysis of games than ever before
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,of course we know more about chess and chess theory today than we did years ago years ago years ago etc edit im getting downvoted for stating the fact that we know more about chess today than in previous decades the fuck
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,world at years old thats unbelievable
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats awesome thank you so much for sharing what you know
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes but why make the distinction at all if its a mental game im sure there isnt a left handed tournament or a blond hair tournament
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same as with most sports really
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,someone linked to an article that posited that statistics are the biggest factor the elite are rare and fewer women dedicate their life to chess so it is even less likely to find a top of the top elite among them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its an idea which makes an awful lot of sense however just so everybody is clear there are still studies which do not find this difference in variance and intelligence tests in general often find different results based on methodology and how socioeconomics are accounted for so this is still something in the controversial stage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nope from an actual biologist do i need to say again that i hate this irrational argument that the greater variance in males necessarily implies that there are more geniuses in addition to more idiots its not true its the just world fallacy if nature has encumbered men with a higher frequency of genetic problems then its only fair that nature would compensate men with more superior individuals news flash just as evolution actually does produce mistakes nature is not fair nature does not care the reason there are more men in the top ranks of intellectual endeavor is not that they are inherently superior human beings although theyd love for you to think so but because they were given opportunities to prosper and grow that most women were not i suspect that if all human beings were given equal opportunities to learn the statistical distribution would slowly shift and when we looked at the biological properties of both sexes wed find that there are two bell curves of roughly similar shape and distribution but that one is simply shifted to the left relative to the other on charts of physical strength for instance the male curve would be shifted to the right relative to womens
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats not really how evolution works its not just a matter of the strongest a baboon would probably wipe the floor with an mma fighter we survived because we were smarter
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that definitely showed with rising around that interval and then i thought i saw a correlation with people dropping drastically after for the most part i dunno
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sorry wrote that poorly yes spasky in yugoslavia
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how it explains his fall at least partially
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pawn sacrifice was pretty good
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i simplified the more complex situation surrounding fischers departure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fischer reached i think would still be competitivetop today years later
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,right but he never beat morphy at anything
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,additionally there is also the game meta to consider suppose there are particular sorts of moves or strategies which no one seems to be doing during some time period then really even if those are a strong counter to some move that move is still not a blunder in that time period
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ironically as the article states the most accurate game ever played was a tal game i really dont know about your point fundamentally accurate moves are about winning computers play to win they dont play to draw but drawing is certainly better than a loss
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the problem is that chess is not about playing accurate moves its about winning this is such a fair point at the end of the day that usually means playing the best ie computer move but the actual situation is more nuanced than that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the ponomariov vs fritz game on november is the last known win by a human against a top performing computer under normal chess tournament
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that was true of the first analysis using crafty but the second used rybka which is stronger than any human and got basically the same results
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cant believe they were all do you have a source i know that kasparov was an absolute beast but what you are describing is inhuman
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dude the guy that got place is a world top player so he beat a world top player in a blitz tournament months ago
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes it was blitz played for fun if kasparov thought he had a chance he would start playing competitive chess again the spirit of your point stands as chess progresses players improve on average however kasparov would still likely be competitive at an elite level
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i believe he is correct if you were to time warp fischer from to he would lose to the top players in the world on the other hand if you let fischer have some development time in this new age then that might not be so
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just because carlsen is the number one chess player doesnt mean you should take his word for fact there is no way for him to prove it chess players today have more knowledge and comparing their games to people a hundred years ago wouldnt make sense because there are new ideas which ruin old gameplay i have seen some of the moves that tal has made and i have to say that he made some extremely brilliant plays which i have never seen anyone else do fischer is a monster of a player and knew the game inside and out if he was starting out today he would devastate everyone just like he did in his days i rank him or kasparov as of all time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do computers now beat top chess players
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that want a very convincing excerpt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a biologist is not a sociologist or psychologist so most of this quote is a laymans opinion while the gap may get smaller and smaller men will always dominate the upper levels of something like chess that doesnt mean its impossible for a woman to be or that men are smarter than women it means that biologically women dont care about chess as much as men being in the world at chess is a masculine egodriven distinction that one must sacrifice their relationships to achieve biologically women are more nurturing and care more about relationships so in order to be at the top a woman must give up what makes her a woman
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that person is not an expert on the topic were discussing this is an issue of psychology and social science biology isnt even that closelyrelated even if that person were an expert we should be concerned with the consensus there are zillions of experts out there you can find one who will say almost anything you want rather than cherrypicking a few experts who agree with us what we should do is find out what experts as a whole believe you have presented no evidence that this persons beliefs reflect the scientific consensus what you have done is the equivalent of a creationist citing a handful of creatonist doctors and engineers lastly the author seemingly cannot read the person they quoted does not claim that great variation implies a large number of geniuses and a large number of idiots what they actually said is this the intelligence distributions are very different women are much more average while there are more men at the extremes stupid and smart they said that there is high variation that there are many male geniuses and that there are many male idiots they did not say that there are many male geniuses and many male idiots because of high variation they did not claim a causal relationship
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think it does in any way but i know a lot about the subject
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you cant really compare elo across years like that theres inflation and other factors also if he just jumped in to play he would not be competitive because theory has advanced so much especially after computers elo is only useful for comparing players from the same generation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,elo is measured relative to the other players of your time i think the consensus is that a player with a given elo in would in most cases be weaker than a player with the same elo in whether thats true of fischer i dont know
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hmmmso ignatz was ranked number one briefly and morphy was number twoalbeit that is subjective to the calculationsso in vying for top spot of being number one in this videohe got beat at one pointboom i can play semantics too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,interesting computers have a contempt value that controls how risky they will play in order to avoid a draw in all likelihood chess is a technical draw meaning that playing the best moves against perfect opposition is playing for a draw you can also see how the most accurate players have way less decisive games than more swashbuckling guys like kasparov a notable exception would be carlsen though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dunno if you set up this computer versus a human the computer moves generally lead to winning
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah i gotcha i was familiar with the crafty analysis i thought it had capablanca as the most accurate edit actually yeah capablanca was rated the most accurate and fischer was middle of the pack i wouldnt say it got basically the same results because that is a ridiculous thing to say
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you can get the info from chessgamescom turns out it was actually guys all at their peak some at peak and he scored just looked it up and it wouldnt be inhuman at all just an extraordinary performance like caruana at sinquefield
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the difference between and is staggering kasparov is certainly not the only to do this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i believe he is correct as well its not like if fischer played nakamura times nakamura would win but i think a definitive edge would be given to him but importantly this takes away absolutely nothing from fischer giants of today like carlsen and nakamura are only so good because they built off the ability and progress of giants of the past
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just because carlsen is the number one chess player doesnt mean you should take his word for fact not just taking his word im also taking in his rating his play and the fact that chess progressed a lot in the last years there is no way for him to prove it sure to prove it we would need a time machine but we can take things we already know like training better nutrition far better understanding of chess computers etc to understand that todays players are better its not rocket science just like todays athletes are better due to advances in nutrition training and better understanding of sports in general the same applies to chess chess players today have more knowledge and comparing their games to people a hundred years ago wouldnt make sense because there are new ideas which ruin old gameplay yes thats the point i rank him or kasparov as of all time okay id rather than carlsens opinion than yours by a long shot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they have for over a decade
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes the best programms are pretty much impossible to beat even for grandmaster level players and even when they run on normal commercially available computersthe only way for humans to be competitive is to give the computer a much shorter time to think
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ironically it hinges completely on the just world fallacy but reversed genetic variance in men is higher and this does produce more outliers on both ends of the spectrum sure this wont be a distribution because people are complicated but there being more outliers with men is not because of how the world should be but how it is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,of course evidence from a consensus would be better but im also not arguing against any such evidence that has been presented im not in a position to discuss the topic with any authority so i went to someone in more of a position to do so im too lazy to look further right now if you want to present a more convincing argument please do so and no this is not an issue of psychologysocial science the poster i was responding to said it was genetics pz myers studies evolutionary developmental biology a closely related field
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fichers unstable psychology has a lot to do with with his disappearance from the world of chess
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how could those opinions be completely irrelevant thats a fairly extraordinary claim what leads you to believe it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you cant compare it at all like that m well aware of how you cant compare elo not elo its a fellows name not a band from one era to another i was saying that fischer did in fact reach not just and that he would still be competitive at the highest level if he were in his prime playing today
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we know what elo is used for and the consensus is generally true unfortunately with fischer there was no one there to earn points against spassky was world number and about points below him he went in his candidates matches which included a former world champion edit i think he was for the whole world championship cycle one of those losses was for refusing to play game against spassky and many of those draws were him just toying with spassky to get the most out of his world championship match
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,unfortunately you dont know anything about the history morphy retired at and never played again and was considered the best in the world until his death there was no reason for the creator of the video to chart morphys elo after age
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,by todays standards we take computer moves to be the best without much question but the point is that playing the best move isnt necessarily the only or quickest way to win theres also psychological factors fatigue etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,both crafty and rybka have capablanca as the most computer accurate player ever look at the year bracket
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,okay id rather than carlsens opinion than yours by a long shot fair enough in most matters its hard for me to take carlsens opinion here too seriously hes probably right but of course hes going to say hed win no matter what thats the competitive spirit one needs to be the best
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but the only evidence we have is that the outliers are produced more towards the left of the spectrum ie lower iqs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,idolizing hitler led to fischers down fall do you want to do any research or do you just want to be indignant
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah idk why i keep spelling elo in all caps
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dude was on fire for sure again i dont know whether the general holds true for fischer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in this video he was number twotake it up with the video creator you pedantic twat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive already looked at both fischer is clearly better under all of the other periods he didnt even harldy play at the top level for years before retiring
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its hard for me to take carlsens opinion here too seriously hes just the best player in the world and knows more about chess than probably anyone in human history hes probably right but of course hes going to say hed win no matter what he can be objective its just his understanding of how previous players played and what their knowledge of the game was
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats misunderstanding the data if men produce idiots averages and geniuses whilst women are spread what youre would be correct but there would also be twice as many male geniuses since this is the likely scenario
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,like stated before it has something to do with his psychology the direct reason for his departure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive asked for you to elaborate twice now and you havent done it how could his opinions be irrelevant
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so they both give the same results thats what im saying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hes just the best player in the world and knows more about chess than probably anyone in human history yes but hes speaking about himself that doesnt render your point moot but it does make me cautious of what he says i also obviously never even suggested carlsen wasnt himself spectacular this is a pretty irrelevant response imo if he wasnt so good there would be no point in me having said anything since his lack of ability would have spoken for itself he can be objective its just his understanding of how previous players played and what their knowledge of the game was how do you know he can be objective how do you know he is being objective the fact that i agree with him doesnt mean i think he is necessarily being objective im just saying when a professional talks about themselves in public be skeptical this applies to any sport or game
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre conflating things his idolization of hitler has nothing to do with his downfall from the top of the chess world that obsession didnt come until later the reason your question is being ignored is because it is basically nonsensical
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they dont give the same results crafty had fischer at middle of the pack rybka had him on top
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this visualization is highly interactive so please hover and click around things it was created using httppublictableaucom based upon data from httpfsifundforpeaceorg the only data adjustments i made were grouping countries by continent and i took slight liberties with their ranking methodology previously they only ranked countries at a total level the total of the metrics but i weighted the underlying numbers to allow each country to be weighted at an individual metric level heres the that convinced me to take a similar stab at visualizing this data i left the thresholds and kpi colors the same although a bit less saturated as it was hurting my eyes to adhere to the ffps original ranking methodology
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when did europe annex russia
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what is percent of continent is that by area or by population
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seems like currency should play a bigger role in stability the world seems to think the us is the most stable of all which is why they park so much money there in good times and even more in bad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i find it highly unlikely that there are countries in africa that are only given the warning designation i recommend the data collectors collaters and drafters of this document go back and rereview their data on the states shaded yellow on the african continent whether it is due to statistical anomalies or incorrect evaluation criterion something is glaringly erroneous in this portion of the graph
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the us is by far the most stable country in the world it has no real competitors it has the strongest economy in the world has the most powerful currency the most powerful military the world has ever seen is one of the oldest democraciesrepresentative democracies on the planet has enormous and highly varied natural resource reserves and is extremely close friends with almost every single firstworld country in the world what exactly would make canada more stable i bet you it would be easier to destabilize them than the us these seems to be conflating living standards with stability which is not the case
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,depending on the purpose if forced to classify europe in a single continent most authorities on the subject would classify russia as european while of russias land area lies in asia of the population lies in europe as this data deals with metrics surrounding people and their various risk factors it seemed reasonable to group a country with wherever the majority of its citizens resided realistically the correct classification is obviously eurasia so perhaps different divisions of land mass would have been better but with continental divisions i believe the current classification makes the most sense
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for pointing that out ive clarified the label and republished it but it wasis by of countries in the continent population would be another interesting way to look at this data though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would tend to agree for the most part but if i were going to play devils advocate i would be interested in identifying the flaw in methodology of metric collectionclassification which you can read more about httpfsifundforpeaceorgindicators im not sure whether you agree with what they are tracking or not but if you agree with the general measurements things like group grievance would rank very low if the country has little religioussectarianethnic violence a country can be oppressively poor but not be terribly violent and it would still score in the middle of the pack while there are terribly violent and unstable regimes in certain parts of the world ie ghana is one of the yellow countries you mentioned and is ranked lowest in murder rate out of countries not terrible as far as violence goes and something you would expect to be on the uppermiddle area of acceptable which is where it is whatever the case the yellow you mention is elevated warning so the question may be whether that is an appropriate description or if its more the color that you take issue with mostly i was merely tackling a better way to display interact and interrogate the data not necessarily a way to collect and categorize said data either way im not disagreeing just saying that if you evaluate them at a metric level and then aggregate up the results might make more sense
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all data from the american community survey by the us census all data manipulation done in r with visualization in the package heres a link to my blog with the source code and links to the data enjoy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,couldnt have picked better contrasting colors im assuming the legend and plots are in a similar order
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,op i think your visualization isnt enhancing the data youre showing some points youre not really using the y axis but its still being shown instead of only showing the x axis each dot shows the average time for each job but youre not showing how each job is distributed over time maybe a box and whiskers plot would work better in that case you could arrange from earliest to latest in the y axis just in case some of them overlap youre not really using colour yeah each dot has a different colour but you could just have a label over each dot considering theyre so few and are apart of each other with enough distance to have text over them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i was having a little trouble just because of the way ggplot handles factors and i just said screw it because theyre in the same order will work something better out for future plots
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think those are all fair criticisms im going to be digging into this one more ill come back with something better

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well presented visual of the data good job i also think that its worthy to note maybe even worthy enough you may want to put it on the visual for the interest of analyzing it more that in roe vs wade was passed legalizing abortion and explaining the rise then in there were trimester restrictions placed on abortions likely explaining the fall again
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im curious about whether or not they counted illegal back alley abortions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow good job on the chart its easy to read and the data is not at all what i expected
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how would you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,estimates yeah im thinking this is only documented ones
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they do that is interesting
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i analyzed name data of about million records of the social security death master file httpsdmfntisgov which contains firstname lastname birth date death date and ssn of deceased us citizens since the goal was to find statistical abnormalities in life expectancy weekday of birthdeath month of birthdeath and name popularity across the us for most popular first and last names some results are quite surprising for example people with the first name ryan only have an average life expectancy of and by far most peter are born in the month of june i combined the data with some publicy available census and ssa data httpwwwcensusgovtopicspopulationgenealogydatahtml httpswwwssagovoactbabynameslimitshtml and visualized it on a website httpwwwnamedatcom

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dang thats an interesting map can someone how the migration process to remote islands such as hawaii looked like maybe im underestimating the capabilities of our ancestors but im having a hard time imagining flotillas setting out into the middle of the pacific with the aim of finding something habitable
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,humans only inhabited many of these islands relatively recently and they seemed to do it quite rapidly new zealand wasnt inhabited until about years ago compared to australia kya this suggests that there was a technological breakthrough that allowed polynesians to rapidly spread throughout the oceans it appears they initially came from taiwan and because that happened so recently they were giving up some pretty important technologies notably rice farming to do so but they hadhave what seem to be incredibly advanced navigational skills using multiple information sources such as stars climate waves etc and outrigger canoes to go the long distances the fact that these cultures were the ones to discover madagascar rather than african cultures goes to show just how advanced these navigational skills were
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,those islands were only reached in the last thousand or so years by the polynesians who were very skillful boatbuilders and navigators some of the ways they would find new islands was by watching where birds flew and by noting ocean currents
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres a lot of islands along the way and migration takes several generations its pretty feasible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you for the answer do you have more information about it i am interested
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i have another polynesian fact new zealand is one of the most difficult islands on earth to reach from another landmass and it was first colonized by humans polynesian explorers the ancestors of the maori a mere years ago basically the polynesians came up with a great new technology outrigger canoes and polynesian navigation about years ago and used it to colonize all the remote and previously uninhabited islands of the pacific the polynesians themselves were the descendants of boatbuilding austronesian people who used their boatbuilding skills to settle in various islands around oceania starting about years ago theres a great map here the blue arrows on this map represent much much older migrations of humans who probably did get to australia and new guinea just by rafting in ancient times the sea level in that area was much lower and many areas were connected by land even homo erectus managed to get to some of the western indonesian islands
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you again thats excellent i am going to search more you gave different points of entry about this subject cool
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,source oecd health statistics tool used was excel
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you for your original content op if you didnt already have official subreddit flair ive added to your user flair as gratitude for everyone else the poster has provided you with information regarding where or how they got the data source and the tool used to generate the visual tools for this post to ensure this information isnt buried i have stickied this link below for your convenience i hope this sticky assists you in having an informed discussion in this thread or inspires you to remix this data for more information please
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this data is neat but i distrust causality for a handful of reasons but it is worth noting that is not poverty so were not looking at the starving projects children here more of the blue collar type children if you look through the zone however there is still significant variation in result before it clearly trends upward is there any additional information here that can provide a better link to success on the sats edit httpimgurcomanyfda just a little visualization albeit a little arbitrarily so show that there is a lot of variance in the lower income thresholds the trend is obvious in the higher incomes but less so when you are in the range if there was a cola adjustment by district i wonder how much this would normalize eg outside of boston is like in boston
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,could use a legend are the colors or size of markers representing other variables
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,those seem like very low scores in general if this was made during the point scale
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i graduated from lincoln sudbury in its got the highest median household income and a average sat score much of the boost affluence provides on the sat doesnt come from the tutoring and classes one takes months before sitting down for the exam rather it comes from a lifetime of habits and higher expectations for instance a decade spent reading wellwritten novels will prepare one for the writing and critical reading portions of the sat much more than a dozen hours spent rehearsing vocabulary with a tutor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,data obtained from the american community survey for incomes and ma doe for test scores sat it should be noted that this only contains school districts included in the acs so things like charter schools are omitted built using edit interactive version httpsmassschoolsfirebaseappcom edit well this is embarrassing unbeknownst to me at the time the census variable i was using appears to be median household income of homeowners not everyone heres the graphic fixed using now which im pretty sure is what i wanted in the first place and my site has been updated to reflect the change httpsmassschoolsfirebaseappcomimagesfixedpng sorry yall credit to udavidwaldron for the catch
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i just want to know what town had a median household income of that is an insanely high net income per house for an entire town
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it seems easy to draw a conclusion from this but it doesnt even include half of the population median household income in the us is this chart starts at basically not that i expect the scores to be better but the chart could level off or continue linearly or get way way worse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe smart people earn more money and have smarter kids or is that against the battle cry
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,now show me the scores for students coming from single and two parent households
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,urban sat teacher here i teach both content areas of the sat and i specifically teach it to recent immigrants its heavily biased towards native speakers even the math section is often solvable only by understanding the wording of the question
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its nothing to do with student affluence according to this graph it is the income in the school district better schools tend to result in better scores what a shocker if a family lives in an apartment in a nice district they benefit from the nice schools if they move to the dumps and buy a mansion they still have crappy schools one would assume that higherearning parents would value education more and that would encourage their kids to learn more eg they would pay for tutors go to parentteacher conferences etc but this graph is limited to the school districts average income
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it seems a little unusual that the lowest median household income reported for any district is still higher than the median household income for the us as a whole i know massachusetts is a relatively wealthy state but seriously not a single district is below the national median thats wild also great work by lexington school district not only the highest average scores in the state but also nonwhite and esl blowing away pretty much all districts with equivalent numbers in those categories
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when you live in massachussets but have ds and fs teach me bostonians kid from worcester
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,anyone with an eye for education understands this many good teachers dont teach in lowincome areas because the pay is horrible and apart from student loan forgiveness there are almost zero perks yes helping lowincome students is an incredibly gratifying feeling but sometimes it just isnt enough especially when those students dont have the motivation to learn learning isnt like its portrayed in the movies you have to deal with higher crime rates lower school attendance students who are held less accountable at home and raise your families in or near these bad areas it is trying exhausting and drives a lot of really good teachers away its a shame because the good districts like newton and lexington dont need any help its the crappy ones like in lawrence and springfield that really need it but simply put almost nobody wants to teach there except young people looking for a job to establish their career also it would be interesting to look at a state other than mass a recent report came out that ma has the highest standard of education in the usa and would be the or best educated country if it were to secede from the usa so of course in general the sat scores are going to be higher than usual
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,smart people have more money and they have smarter children too genetics lots of research on the sat if curious read rcas long post on the topic
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this isnt just about sat tutors most students even in nice districts dont get sat tutors the data suggest that thats a rounding error in the context of a now point test
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so the median income of a school district also speaks to the tax base supporting it wealthier districts pay teachers better offer more extra curricular have smaller class sizes etc i think we are skipping the resources available to students in each district when assumptions are made regarding the intelligence imparted by wealth
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,while not explicitly displayed here id imagine those school districts have more funding because those households pay more property taxes to better fund their schools those better funded schools probably have better teachers and more resources to better prepare their students for the sats
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what i find most interesting is how sparse it is below the line there are a few outliers where poor areas still perform wellbut nowhere that the incomes are high are there any outliers with bad performance thats very strange
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as someone who grew up in a household with income and scored a on his sat this makes me feel pretty awesome
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow its almost like smarter more successful parents yield smarter kids or something
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,reading to kids is important and probably a significant factor in sat outcomes some wealthier families have more time to read to their kids instead of having to work like jobs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its almost like families are spending money in direct proportion to how much money they have on preparing their children for a test that determines their admissibility to college which is widely perceived to be necessary for bettering the life of the child and that money is having a measurable impact on their results
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this makes perfect sense people who value education generally push their kids to do well in school thus the cycle of success also smarter parents smarter kids i know thats not a pc comment but its true
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,parents who have higher paying jobs tended to have higher education who tended to work a little harder in school who tended to just be more likely what i like to call delayed gratification peoplepeople who are successfulwho also tend to be more involved parents leading to kids who work a little harder in schooland so on and so on try to explain away why youre not a wildly successful billionaire to the man all you wantbut its youits mostly you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i come from a poor asian immigrant family and came to usa when i was i scored a and got on reading yall just dumb yo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this graph would best be labeled something we all know but no one talks about it kinda matters how smart genetically you are it basically determines your future earning power it also explains why rich families tend to stay rich and poor families tend to stay poor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im confused as to why this graph starts at and ends at plently of students score above and below those points editaccording to college board is the percentile and is the so about of students would not be covered by this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so the more wealth the better your education this is obvious wo a chart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe these are families with two parents in the household heaven forbid we address the issue of kids with no dad in their lives thinking theyll be the next kobe
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,taken another way this data is a powerful argument for spending more on education wealthier families pay into wealthier school districts its not just that those families have money for sat prep its that their money enables the creation of a better ecosystem for learning more money more better teachers quality instruction
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people work hard to earn more money and pass the advantage on to their children thats a big reason why people work hard this is how our system was designed its working as intended some smart disadvantaged kids do well plenty of advantaged kids ruin their lives with bad choices also working as intended if you take away the advantages of being rich the economy would fail
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im going to get downvoted to hell for this but has it ever occurred to anyone that the smart people are the ones that make the best sat scores and go on to make the most money and have smart kids its pretty simple evolutionary science the smarter your family is directly correlates to the amount of money you make
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i know this probably isnt the best place to ask but while on the topic is there any easy way to translate a score from the old tests to the current ones with the higher max scores or are they not really equatable
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can anyone translate the scores back to the ole max score format for me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lots of discussion about the sat in this thread and how people spend a bunch of money to study for it but is it even still that relevant i only took the act got a pretty average score and still got into my university no problem is it usually just for private competitive schools now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im so glad ive made it to grad school without ever doing any standardized tests like the sat act gre
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there are two variables that are apparently being displayed here but i dont know what they are do color and diameter represent anything
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sigh youll get pretty much exactly the same result with any decent standardized test including those administered in elementary school since theyre all basically measuring similar constructs to similar extents especially intelligence in fact if you observe in same or similar cohort when they sit for the sat years later the correlation is about there is plenty of good data showing that these gaps are basically fully set well before and that they barely budge thereafter despite the supposed importance of test prep school quality and so on and so forth
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,please label your axis are the dots the median score within a district all tests taken within district plotted what does the dot size indicate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so if you take a persons family income along with their score then you should be able to adjust for that and see the truly exceptional students exceeding their expected household income metrics hmm seems like a good way to make the test useful to find smart poor kids too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,til the sat is not about how capable a student is it is actually a measure of how wealthy that students family is without actually saying it how perfect is that post a test that measures ability knowing full well the plan is to keep poorer people out brilliant then when they graduate that university which wealthy parents are assured to pay the tuition and the student will graduate they will then donate to the universities coffers once they graduate they are assured to get a job either working for other graduates of that same university or for their parents corporation then they have children of their own which go to that same university some lion king circle of life stuff going on here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i linked a study that showed that part of the cause of not reading to children is knowledge deficiencies about child development more likely to exist among the impoverished
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so having more money does make you smarter perhaps trump was the right choice afterall
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that last doesnt really seem to help much looks like theres a pretty steep decreasing return to income for sat performance after
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i knew there were too many questions about the rules of polo and how to maintain your schooner at the marina
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i can contribute i recently had a paper accepted for publication exploring economic factors of act scores including income
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your dad sells his maserati grand tourismo and buys a yacht with the money did he make a good investment
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it would be interesting to see the data from the new sat im sure the effect is the same but without the complicated vocab sections i imagine it isnt as present im guessing on the sat year because the new sat is out of not
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,high quality private sat classes are expensive practically everyone at my law school who got high enough honors to be individually recognized at our graduation took superexpensive exam prep courses before finals throughout the years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why does the income rise so quickly when the majority of america live under
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how would a translate with these new scores im a product of the massachusetts public school system and father made less than i may be an anomaly according to this chart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there are kids whos families make less than but scored higher than all of these people i know because i am one of them the deciding factor is not money it is parenting often wealthy adults make good parenting decisions because they know how to succeed in life often lower class parents do not make good parenting decisions on the same token
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,canadian here whats a good sat score to get into like michigan state or another nonivy but prominent school
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i did a full sat test for funsies some years ago i nearly maxed the math and critical reading parts and had an above average but compared to the rest mediocre score on the writing part likely because i took the test in english which i am not reason i say is that i already completed a bachelors and actually am doing another right now and i was wondering if there are other people who did an sat before college and again for fun after they went to college and what the difference was for them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how does this start at a month thats a lot compared to a lot of people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the sat has two sections worth points each for a total of before it was revised prior to march it had three sections for a total possible of this chart seems to have an upper range that does not correspond to those possible scores what gives
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,children who come from wealthier families tend to have parents who are well educated understand the value of literacy and education and pursue things to see their child excell lower income parents usually do not have decent educations themselves and are just unaware of its value take a look at the every child ready to read program httpeverychildreadytoreadorg more parents just need to be educated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is this because rich people are smarter and have smarter babies or is because rich people can buy more education any identical twin adoption studies where they were split up at birth and raised by seperate rich and poor families
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow lets all go to massachusetts where students have affluence you seem to be missing the part that explains what is going on in this graph
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this data is completely irrelevant since the new sat has now been introduced the test now focuses less on things like vocabulary where affluent students were shown to have an unfair advantage it is also now back to the point a scale and in my opinion is a much better predictor of college success the test now focuses on skills you will need in college like analyzing primary source documents and providing evidence to back up your claims
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so lower income kids can still excel but higher income kids almost never do poorly is that what i should take from this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,contrasted with the much weaker correlation in the funding by pupil chart this suggests the stronger predictor is genetics not household income
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,stupid people make less money they produce stupid children they suck on these tests thats how it goes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not like more money makes you better at the sat but more money allows for more prep and more preparation makes you better at the sat first time i took it i knew i was good at reading but not so much at math so i studied the math section and got a perfect score in the math section but a worse score in reading second time i knew i had the math section in the bag so i studied the reading section and got a perfect score in reading but a worse score in math the amount of studying and prep was directly related to the score i got
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,uh surely this is not correct im certain that some students scored over i mean its not at all impossible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yawn theres this thing called genetics smarter people generally make more money and have smarter kids it aint rocket surgery
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,iq is hereditary smart people generally make more smart people generally have smart kids
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,give it up for me and my household income aint even on the charts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and yet all these schools teach from the same books using the same teaching techniques unless anyone wants to argue that high income school districts are using secret books and their teachers are using secret teaching methods unknown to the lower income school districts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a lot of this can probably relate to families with more money being able to afford sat tutors which can cost upwards of
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the sat is starting to become less valued by many colleges some of whom have gone to satact optional why harvard could probably fill about six full freshman classes with nothing but valedictorians on the scale of harvard students score above average of at stanford in fall of about of applicants were admitted out of about applicants of whom about averaged more than on the sat and averaged on language and averaged on math if you think that a vs a really means anything as far as success in life goes youre crazy gpa and extracurricular activities are way more important than sat scores lots of kids of all races get over on the sat and dont get into harvard or stanford or even duke thats just how competitive it is as someone who taught prep classes when i was in college i can say that prep classes can bump your score by a relatively modest amount and more in math than language i came up with an equation back then new score baseline score practice test without prep this equation seemed to work well in my limited experience at the higher ranges ie over about the number is meaningless since most of the students with a baseline that high dont spend the money on a prep class so what does this mean it means that the sat has meaning as a measure of something related to iq but not quite iq since it is malleable to a degree more than iq there is even an sat to iq converter httpwwwiqcomparisonsitecomsatiqaspx
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i never thought my was that great but judging from this chart wow not trying to brag at all im actually very prone to bash my own intelligence dont roast me lol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not that surprising that educated hard working parents would have educated hard working kids not sure why youd think it would all just reset every generation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,except your example makes no sense managing money involves risk and macroeconomics and sat tutoring involves vocabulary flash cards lol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also known as how much sat tutoring can you afford that useless piece of shit tests nothing but your ability to learn and recognize its bullshit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or and im just throwing this out there maybe the kids whose parents make the most have better parents with better genes and therefore they score higher on tests
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,before writing portion with parents middle of the road this sample seems inconclusive my only defense is anecdotal but i have grievous doubt were accurately accounting for standard deviations here what are the populations being represented by each dot what is the socioeconomic makeup of the state in comparison to others
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not trying to brag or anything but i got an as a sophomore and i was convinced that was average at best according to my friends i go to one of the best public schools in my state and hang with the smarter kids so maybe i actually did pretty good but i figured it would have been pretty middle of the road especially for a well off state
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is cool and all but i made on less than a year median income with siblings no less
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why no yaxis label dont know what this represents without a label drives me crazy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the median household income in the us is the chart mainly shows that massachusetts is a very wealthy state
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would imagine that people with higher salaries pay for the test multiple times and are probably more likely to have sat tutors i took it five times increasing each time as my school knowledge advanced and i had to pay to take it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i can contribute i recently had a paper accepted for publication exploring economic factors of act scores including income
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i can think of one causality that could explain this smart parents smart parents have smart kids smart parents have high income the link between the two could just be the high iq of the parents case in point i went to one of those gifted high schools where you had to take an entrance exam to get in there were students of all different income brackets in that school the sat scores did not reflect on the income some of the richest kids in that school scored poorly on the sat scores some of the poorest kids in that school scored very highly on it including myself whose parents made much less than six figures so income wasnt the biggest factor in sat scores rather the smart parents played a role most of the poorest students had immigrant parents the parents were poor because they came from a poor country but they were still very intelligent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,definitely correlation tho
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it aslo doesnt account for population at those income ranges how many kids in ma come from household income homes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is considered average blue collar wages now holy craigslist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,causality between socioeconomic status and standardized testing scores is already established
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just sharing some of my personal opinion on interpreting statistical models try to keep an open mind because its radically different from how most people think of it though i think people who study quantum might not find it so weird correlation between two variables means that they describe a single spacetime event or phenomenon causation is a label that is applied to distinguish different temporal phases for example calorie intake and bmi are strongly correlated they both describe a single thing a persons metabolism the idea that eating too much causes weight gain just tells you what this thing metabolism looks like at different points in time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well and how many kids with a single kid is not poverty but with four kids is very much not ideal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also the sat is out of this graph doesnt make sense
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but vs national average ma median household income is like much higher than national average the people who are in the might as well be in poverty in ma
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as uwisemanwiseguy points out testing out various data adjustments such as price level adjustment is a logical next step after that id check out the distributions for your median income and sat scores by district are they normalish or are they more skewed in shape that matters if youd like to use a statistical model to try to explain the connection between to two variables while theres no model explicitly tested here the scatterplot suggests a hypothesis that district income level is correlated positively to aggregate sat scores likely not causally related as others have pointed out but thats okay correlations can be really interesting too you could build your model to account for the affect of other important variables that you think might also contribute to a districts avgmedian sat score then you could make statements like accounting for all these other variables median household income has an effect size of x on average sat score in massachusetts school districts cool stuff op
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,per household is only per parent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it also raises the question if sats are subsidizedmandatory on the state if only students serious about college took those tests the score distribution would look a lot different from a school where everyone is encouraged to take it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theyre actually quite high compared to the rest of the country the sats at the time were weighted to make the average meaning the vast majority of school districts in massachusetts are performing above average
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was thinking i was on retard level at before remembering they added another point section after i graduated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well the average is supposed to be i think there is a philosophical argument to be had to a say the average scores of a standardized are too low i mean they literally adjust the scores afterward so that the percentiles fit a bell curve if everybody was randomly a bit more competent one year the scores would theoretically be the same as previous years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its the average for a whole school to average that means a lot of students are scoring near perfect to bring up the kids doing just average also once you get up by the on a section the next points higher moves you only higher for instance i got a on the math and finished but my buddy got a and was in the a girl i was in calc with got a but she was just below
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,were talking about median here is already percentile nationally
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,average score on the scale was around
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so i took the sats in the point days and i remember people saying that was about the average that would mean per section if we even things out if we apply that to the new sats that would be about a score of looking at this chart that seems to be where the median lies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you hit the nail fairly squarely on the head there none of my kids received or currently receive tutoring i would not say that my kids are super smart either to be honest i believe them to be very normal however expectations are high yeah stereotypical asian high b is an f kind of high we prioritize school higher education and have been consistent in enforcing good educational and life habits from the beginning of their lives yes my kids read all manners of books for fun the sat is optional in our state but the act is standard and both my older kids whove taken the act scored low comparative to that range iirc from someone who is first generation immigrant the only thing i do have to say in regards to the act sat or any form of standardized testing is that english is the key for example some math problems are written in complex sentence structure ops chart does not take into account a few points a immigrants typically first gen regardless of where they fall in the household income scale score lower due to incomplete comprehension of the language my older brothers were probably smarter but i outscored them in testing due to the fact that started english in grade and i was a bookworm b all other americans who for any variety of reasons do not have the reading skills necessary also score lower and most of all please dont forget high scores do not equate to success the person you know that scored the highest satact score at your school may not make it through college but someone who scored less than may because of one thing perseverance when youre all done with college no one will give a flying fuck what your actsat score was so if this chart has any reddittors feeling down take the chart and shove it and go study hard
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i always thought standardized tests like lsatsatactgmatgre ect were learnable studying for those tests is learning how to take the test rather than studying to become an expert in geometry and algebra my guess is its a combination a culture that values education and personal success coupled with the means to get access to tools to overcome challenges like tutors prepbooks and more
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres more to it than that you have all of your hierarchy of needs met so you dont have to deal with stressors that could distract you from your schooling school is a lot easier when you know that you get to eat that day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this sounds like my experience growing up c in english im going to be severely punished
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its interesting that the students white seems to curve in the middle on the ground experience tells me that the non white ethnicities on the top and bottom are different
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,some of the income numbers seem a bit high i tried but couldnt match any of them using census data for example median household income for the boston school district is according to acs but in your data did you get income from some other source
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,only two features are documented but there are four being visualized what do color and radius represent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it appears that youve excluded the left tail of the income distribution here as mentioned in the comment above for example springfield public schools has a editoops factfinder wont let me link properly let me see if i can find a linkable source and an httpprofilesdoemassedustatereportsatperfaspx its not a charter district and its not a tiny district either with over test takers in the most recent year what were your criteria for excluding districts in this way
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow the correlation is much stronger here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpsmassschoolsfirebaseappcom select household income for the xaxis and you can poke around
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your point still stands but to be fair median household income in ma is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this chart starts at
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the chart isnt looking at individuals its looking at school districts this doesnt mean there are no households with incomes under it means there are no school districts with median household incomes under within that district there are lots of families making under but the median of the entire district come out to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but what is the median household income in massachusetts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it also takes a lot of expensive prep for most people to do well and a life generally free of povertydysfunctionrelated distraction never hurts i think most most of us already understand that there are more and less bright people out there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,correlation between income and iq is not that strong
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,imo the problem with this view is that it assumes all students start on equal footing they dont students from impoverished backgrounds are exposed to thousands fewer words by the time they hit preschool its uphill from there former teacher ma in education
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this actually doesnt have a strong correlation or at least not as much as you would think i dont remember the name of the study but if i recall it demonstrated that iq over could actually have a negative correlation to affluence a lot of them tend to go into research and other cashpoor professions as opposed to business
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a person who did well on the sat its way more about how well you prepare for the sat than how smart you are there are entire businesses including kaplan and the college board itself predicated on sat and other standardized test prep if you cant afford their products youre not gonna do as well not to mention the fact that you can pay to retake the test keep in mind that the sat doesnt cover any calculus nor any type of science and that the reading questions follow the same formula yeartoyear with the proper heavily monetized study techniques nearly anyone can do well edit im proud of you guys that did well on the sat without preparing honestly thats impressive i just hope you realize that people who arent as smart as you are getting similar scores by spending more money to my mind that isnt okay
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lower income students have more externalities to worry about more pressing and immediate problems rather than just their education having an adequate amount of money can free many of those societal problems
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,research shows that simply moving students to more affluent districts tends to increase their scores section of the link below summarizes some of the relevant research
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is purely anecdotal but using myself as a case study in university am totally broke cant get financial aid no financial help from parents my number priority isnt how much studying do i need to do for that final but is instead shit i dont have enough money for rent essay due on monday but extra shift opens up at work well you can take that late penalty because you need the money at my low point i was a guy trying to make a pack of pita and tub of hummus last two days thats like calories a day fast forward to september i got a surprise windfall from a relative i have enough rent money to see my through the year and am eating enough and eating healthy my average has jumped from a c or c to a a it really made me wonder how many other bright kids either in grade school or post secondary education are held back by poverty by their brain not being fed right and simply worrying more about survival than intellectual stimulation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a thing but not the only thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,where i live there is a lot of high school students following paid courses at a different institute than the school to improve their exam results or do better on an entrance test like this the same happens with elementary school kids and paying to practice for the exam that decides what school level youll do so then having rich parents does give you an advantage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lol of course smart people earn more money and on average have smarter kids but its more about themes around here one of those themes being that rich people never earned a thing in their lives and its all a result of privilege reddit will fight you tooth and nail on the notion that there is any correlation between intelligence and income
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the only thing the sat tests is how good you are at taking the sat even a smart kid is going to have trouble without expensive prep material
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whoa buddy the antiwealthantisuccess commie hivemind aint gonna like that the wealthier people obviously paid the teachers for their higher scores and the poorer kids are all einsteins and are only being held back by their lack of wealth eviscerate the bourgeoisie comrade
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its partially true but not the whole truth by a long shot but then again going into details would go against the battle cry that youre pushing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no despite the income inequality in america class structure is still not super rigid compared to the past or to old world countries and we havent been around long enough as a nation to produce such genetically different populations that it would affect average intelligence greatly also several twin studies have shown that while genetics tends to govern personality characteristics to a limited degree economic success is determined more by the benefits brought on by higher income this is studying twins separated at birth and adopted by parents of different socioeconomic status
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in addition to iq and income not really correlating as mentioned elsewhere in comments there is also strong evidence that nuture plays a stronger role in academic aptitude over nature it is pretty logical from there to contest that poorly funded school discricts which is almost entirely a function of the income of the districts parents will provide worse instruction than well funded ones will link sources if anyone is too lazy to google
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lolol ya keep this line of thought for another hundred years see what happens hint the chart doesnt change wake up sheep in my small graduating class of a chart of sat scores and median incomes would be inverted im sure this is the case in most american private schools the financial aid kids are only around to bring up tests scores for the school only way to get in without money is to have high test scores and the average student literally millionaires for parents was usually around which is garbage the fact is rich people just stay rich and poor people have to earn it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,freakonomics had a recent episode where they talked to one of the harvard economists who published work evaluating the longterm impact of the httpsenwikipediaorgwikimovingtoopportunity programexperiment turns out that the earlier you move kids to more affluent neighborhoods the better the outcome the youngest kids they had data for those moved at age did best and the older they were the lower the impact the move had kids at age were actually negatively effected
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe or maybe smart kids have more opportunity and support to study and do well or maybe both the correlation should have us asking some questions though i for one am inclined to believe that we dont live in a perfect meritocracy and that wealth is not an especially good indicator of intelligence im open to other evidence though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes this is another way of saying that poor people deserve to be poor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that would be really easy to test by controlling for the parents sat score but i do not think that is really likely the biggest influence is going to be parental investment wealthy parents are more likely to spend time with their children when they are reading to them teaching them things like numbers colors etc whether or not a child was read to before they get into prek has a huge huge impact on how they perform throughout school poor kids who are not read to because their parents are absent cant afford books dont care etc have a major disadvantage as they start school way behind their peers who learned stuff at home
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres a confounding influence there smart people have fewer children on average small households would do better independent of environmental effects
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its almost like learning english is essential for working in america
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its probably worth noting col boston area is up there with san francisco and nyc when you have large swaths of the countrys population with drastically lower cols and relatedly lower average wages its going to bring the average down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the racial makeup of the town was white asian black or african american native american pacific islander from other races and from two or more races hispanic or latino of any race were of the populationaccording to a estimate the median income for a household in the town was and the median income for a family was the nonwhites in lexington are usually high income asiansasian americans were talking about the children of doctors lawyers investment bankers professors and scientists yeah these people are always successful
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i grew up in lexington the vast majority of the nonwhite population is either chinese indian or korean all groups that are traditionally high preforming that being said it does have an excellent school system it also has a very high education level of residents have at least a bachelors degree and a whopping have a masters degree or higher
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,more to the point its much much less than the point gap between the average scores of high and low performing districts test prep is a red herring in this debate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the sat actually got changed very recently and is kind of back to a scale
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the correlation between total spending per pupil and test scores is pretty close to zero or even negative in most states this is pretty much visible in the interactive version of this plot click funding per pupil or also these gaps are fully visible well before kids even start school so its highly unlikely the school inputs have much to do with it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my family has high income but spent on my sat prep and i almost got a back before they added writing its not due to money being spent its due to parents placing pressure on their kids to test well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,k
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,similar story similar score but you dont see me being an ass about it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your anecdote clearly refutes this data well done by the way does the sat test scientific literacy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fuck dumb people amiright we should grind their useless bodies into a paste to feed the wealthy smart ones
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no we are all equally smart only difference is some are given money and are rich and others are disenfranchised poor and victims of the rich and youre a traitor for working hard while the rest of your poor brethren didnt know they have to work hard and youre making them look bad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,holy non sequitur batman thatsa jump a far simpler explanation richer people exhaust more resources to ensure their children have a better education
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it also explains why rich families tend to stay rich and poor families tend to stay poor if that was only due to genetics it would be the same globally but its not social mobility varies a lot places with good public schools available for all have high social mobility for example genetics are important but theyre not the only piece of the puzzle
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we are talking about school districts not individual students the axis reflects median household income in the district versus median or possibly average sat score in the district
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you can work hard as you want but if you arent playing smart you will failor at least waste a lot of resources i think a major game changer is the internet a diligent poor person can catch up using this resource
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,scoring and score distributions havent changed much they added a writing section another possible points in cumulative score mean about as on the others a few years back since these sections correlate fairly well expected value on mathverbal old is roughly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,act is more popular in the central us sat is more popular on the coasts texas and a few other states
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,grew up in mass acts are pretty much irrelevant here and not looked at by most schools the vast majority look at sats they did tell us it would be a good idea to take them if we were going to a school in other areas of the country though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dot size reflects the size of the school district i assume hes talking about median no idea if all tests are plotted
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,looks like the test already identified them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they compared the median household income in a school district against the average sat score in that school district as the median income of a town increases we expect to see the average sat score rise
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,disagree the is an outlier if you take out that one and maybe the its a constant slope with a best fit line visually calculated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id implore you to read some of the works by economist stephen levitt your second guess is right on the money those from higher income brackets tend to be more productive as people and they do indeed pass these ideals onto their children who performed better in school as a result its important to note that within sets of data like this median household income is actually an aggregate figure thats dependant on a huge number of variables which we arent being shown first lesson youll learn in any stats class is that correlation doesnt automatically equal causation the example my professor gave me on my first day has always stuck with me and is incredibly useful when looking at things like this the example was this if you compare dam levels to road accidents youll probably find a correlation between the two the problem is its not the dam levels but the rain filling them up thats causing the higher level of car accidents i cant stress how important this kind of thinking is when youre analysing data it really changed my perspective on how i view things like this and it helps open you up to a more productive line of thinking youll get to the real cause faster if you minimise your assumptions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it wont make much difference with respect to these patterns as high ses have a large statistical advantage on essentially all decent tests since theyre all testing very similar constructs especially general cognitive ability and these patterns are entirely consistent with what is observed in gpa graduation further education and the like ie the test cannot significantly change the relative patterns very much without losing its predictive validity
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no these are groups school districts not individuals this plot suggests the higher income school districts means cluster a bit more tightly than the broad middle but thats partially an illusion more middling income observations than high and partly less educational and raceethnic diversity at the top v high income districts tend to be overwhelmingly whiteasian and more uniformally well educated the two categories that explain the lions share of the variance
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is by school district not individual students
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,reddit hasnt believed genetics are real for a very long time now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but your school districts median household income is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your family makes and you only scored a
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there are secret teaching methods that the elders speak of sometimes such as having fewer students per teacher so that the teacher has more time to help students that are struggling or having access to computers lab equipment and other items that are in good repair and dont need to be shared between students
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i suspect that one doesnt cause the other a third variable causes both parents who value education more highly their own and their childrens both earn more money and raise children more inclined to value academic success
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the secret is money in a welloff district the best teachers can be hired at competitive salaries the best equipment can be bought for example students might be issued a laptop which is integrated into the schools online environment theres also the students personal lives they tend to come from more stable households the parents tend to put more emphasis on the importance of education as an analogy consider the movie major league about a major league ball club with financial woes theyve got access to all the same things that other clubs have access to a stadium a coaching staff a plane etc but everything they have is falling apart so sure the students might learn out of the same textbook but one teacher is using an oldschool overhead projector and the other teacher is using a stateoftheart website one teachers budget for classroom materials is so small that they end up buying chalk out of pocket the other doesnt even have to use chalk because theyve got a lightboard etc the result is that many small things add up to a big advantage saving a few minutes here and there packing in more content with less classroom disruptions year after year after years of this the graduating class from the affluent district is miles ahead of their less fortunate counterparts many have a few hours of college credit under their belt before they even have a high school diploma
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in fifth grade my teacher would sit us down for an hour of science class which consisted of the teacher playing an audiobook version of our science book while we read along and she sat in the corner grading papers are you trying to say that this teaching method is universally applied along with all other specific lesson plans that teachers across the country write up or are you trying to say that because we were reading the same book as everyone else our learning experience was identical to someone who did a hands on project out of the same book either assertion is ridiculous and patently false
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the plural of anecdote is not data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sat score
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it also has a higher cost of living
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the median houshold income in mass is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats what i was thinking where in the fuck is a school district median income holy fuck not in the south man i can promise you that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats what i was thinking i was like i wish my parents made that much
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think sat tutors is the big one tutors can teach you patterns of the test and give your practice tests where kids without tutors usually go in to the sat having no idea what the test format will be like but a low income student with access to the internet can just as easily get as much prep for free online than what some kids pay thousands of dollars for to prepare for the tests
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,perhaps the fact in massachusetts has of its education being funded by property taxes can also add to this disparity property tax is a local tax that is highly dependant on income it would be nice to see a side by side with vermont which has property tax by the way your upper limits on the to and the to brackets seem pretty high considering the high amount of larger bubbles at the lower section of these brackets it would be nice to have a or sigma cutoff on these
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it could be parenting and ability to send kids to good schools because good school zones housing tend to be expensive
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats probably some of it dont discount genetics though intelligent and driven people tend to make more money and it is an inherited trait
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or can afford to move into areas with better schools
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,parental involvement plays a much bigger role than parental iq reddit skews young and is attached to idea that merit in this case intelligence is usually rewarded and while it is to some extent its hugely overshadowed by a host of other factors that arent necessarily obvious at first glance
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whenever i see see an article or study that looks at socioeconomic statuss correlation with life outcomes they almost never even mention the obvious confounding variable of iq let alone control for it its a travesty and i think i know why the idea that innate and largely immutable traits hugely influence ones life outcomes is so antithetical to the worldview and goals of social scientists and leftleaning people in general they like to enact social reforms to undo systemic injustices and inequalities which is of course a laudable goal they see data showing inequality of outcome and jump to any plausible explanation that involves social structures and institutions the problem is that it literally never occurs to them that the explanation is as simple and tragic as the fact that intelligence and personality traits are highly heritable and have very high predictive power in assessing life outcomes some of the more pernicious among them will outright deny and take offense at those facts but i think for the most part it just does not occur to them thats not the lens through which they see the world this is why im so troubled by the heavy leftward ideological skew of the social sciences they need people who have reasonable perspectives that happen to be blind spots for progressives
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the literature has tested this theory by comparing children of poor but intelligent parents against the children of intelligent wealthy parents the effect is less pronounced but prominent suggesting that income is a significant variable in the model your mistake may have been to assume that wealthy parents are intelligent and poor parents are less intelligent that and your annevdotal examples instead of studying a representative population
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think this is particularly the case in ma where so many of those top performing wealthy school districts are bedroom communities for the high tech industry and boston area universities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my first thought was that it had to do with how involved their parents were if you have two successful parents you will be in the range for median household income and thats where you see the most obvious increases start my parents when i was growing up would have been on the very low end and they didnt really stay involved with me at all in terms of school on the other side of things i knew quite a few smart kids the thing that i saw in common with all of them was that they were successful and seemed to care more about their kid this isnt to say that you wont turn out well without parental involvement i got a degree and a good job with the handsoff approach i was given
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i agree i plan on teaching my kids at home to supplement their school education why cause i know that if you only rely on classroom education then you will be left behind coming from the ghetto i have also seen the other side and can firmly say that money isnt the deciding factor its intelligence of the people around you and lets face it most people making a year arent stupid last thing my sis is in college to be a lawyer and struggling as a single mother she is clearly smart though her daughter is a freaking genius years old and playing violin and getting straight as and above her grade level money does help of course but a rich kid whos parents dont engage him or at least get him a tutor will probably bomb the sat too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you cannot filter out the advantage of having resources at your disposal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the size of the bubbles are proportional to the of students
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so fun storyin my college stats class i had a project to review average sat scores per state and yes size of classrooms compensation of teachers all matched up ok you know what was nearly a perfect correlation percentage of students who took the test states that had high percentages of students take the test had significantly lower average scores tldr youre on the right track
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which makes perfect sense based on the fact that ma schools are better than most states
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in the scale the scale is back to but now the benchmark is now with the math portion now and english
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i took the sat a long time ago right before they readjusted the mean from around to exactly so as a sophomore if my sat score ever came up during conversation to a freshman and i told them my score theyd wonder how i got in in the first place then id have to explain that this was the last year before the readjustment and in the new system it would be much higher all i got was uh huh sure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,then they removed it it was when i took it a few years ago but its back to now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes someone made fun of me for being proud of my score we realized later that i took the point test back in the day then they made fun of me for being old
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the populations are so large that there really shouldnt be random variance between one academic year and the next not to say variance is impossible itd just have to be a much greater force than random chance for a sample size of millions to be impacted additionally the sat along with the act and other standardized tests is primarily used to compare students within the same class for the purposes of college admissions so it wouldnt even matter if there were variance between grades
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there doesnt need to be a philosophical argument this is just basic statistics with a population this large it is highly unlikely that that would be a problem
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre looking at it the wrong way those same points are harder to get the higher you go and thus a smaller fraction achieves that meaning those points mean more the higher you go not less
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,on the point scale the sum of reading math and english skillswhich recently was reverted back to a point scale anything above is very good and these average scores arent that impressive but then again they are averages of everyone taking the test
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,many of the highest performing districts in massachusetts have asian populations a demographic which tends to correlate to higher sat scores
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,damn this is embarrassing but youre absolutely right the variable i used is mislabelled in the acs variable list it appears to be household income among home owners now with the right variable it looks httpsmassschoolsfirebaseappcomimagesfixedpng
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,double encoding of test scores by y position and color and size of circle is number of test takers in that district sorry mentioned on interactive site forgot to put here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpsmassschoolsfirebaseappcomimagesfixedforrealpng some numbskull me didnt think to escape commas in my csv file thanks for pointing out the error
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im trying to figure that out now it looks like a few districts got dropped somewhere when i was combining my datasets going through my code right now to see whats up nothing intentional just a bug on my part
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,makes a lot of sense i figure either weston newton or a town of the like what do you think causes this discrepancy because this opens up an ideological argument the two predominant arguments are generally as follows towns that are wealthier have better resources which allow for their students to have an edge that students in poorer towns dont have ie people are intrinsically similar and that by there being an inequality of resources there is an explanation for the different results or people from wealthier towns tend to hold values that enable them to work harder and make better use of their resources ie there is a reason people from those towns are where they are and it has very little to do with extrinsic resources i tend to be a believer in the first ideology presented but is there a way to really get a clear answer in a situation like this because when analyzing scenarios as complex as the wealth gap and academic performance there seems to be this chicken or the egg argument that pops up
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,errrhow is that fair if you start at median income or slightly below then you arent showing half of the data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,honestly the people getting test prep from classes or private tutors are whatever arent the richestmost educated kids its the middleuppermiddle class kids who want a instead of a not someone getting a instead of a i got a which was among the worst of my friends and none of us even studied let alone took classes when you go to elite high schools in rich areas you dont need help
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i had a free act prep course at a public high school in a relatively poor part of missouri it was a semester long and we took multiple practice tests honestly asking how different is this from other peoples experience
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think expensive test prep is necessary to do well i raised my score a lot by using workbooks a lot of time you can even find those for free at libraries
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes to the free of povertydysfunction part but you do not need any expensive prep to do well if you are smart you will do well the expensive prep is for the kids who are borderline and want to go to a top school
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,studies show prep adds a very small amount to scores and the same prep adds more to scores of higher incomescoring individuals than to lower
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a culture difference there is a direct correlation between education and earned wealth people who are well educated and have kids tend to promote a culture emphasizing the importance of education in the extreme case there may be kids that dont have the bare necessities to survive but i think it comes down to what the parents want to promote in their kids
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is mostly a myth the traineduntrained gap in random assignment experiments is within the testretest variation for a single individual not a large effect
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people scoring the highest often arent taking prep id be curious to see the score distributions i bet theres a much longer tail in lower income neighborhoods because prep really can help people who arent naturally gifted in test taking and yes standardized test taking is a skill you can be naturally gifted in its one of my least useful talents now but sure was nice in high school missed one damn question on the whole sat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but theres definitely a correlation between income and sat score
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the individual level correlation between httpemilkirkegaarddkenwpcontentuploadsintelligenceandsocioeconomicsuccessametaanalyticreviewoflongitudinalresearchpdf in large part due to life cycle other personality differences career lifestyle preferences visavis hours worked travel stress etc goodbad luck and the like also contributing to the variance but when individuals are aggregated into reasonably large groups like this especially when said aggregation isnt random sorting between neighborhoods the correlation httpemilkirkegaarddkenwpcontentuploadsseeingtheforestpdf since this other source of variation largely gets averaged out for instance if you average education levels within school districts by income levels at a district level and bin by income level youll get moreover parental education levels and raceethnicity virtually entirely mediate this relationship between
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are you suggesting that it takes money to buy words i know youre not
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a lot of them also go into engineering computer science pharmacy and other medical fields plus your study just looking at the highest of intellectuals im sure that there are plenty of iq people with salaried and many people of iq at hourly positions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,on the order of standard deviations not zero but not as strong as many other effects anecdotally i did very little prep and got almost a perfect score on my second attempt skimmed one prep book no tutoring
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,curious canadian asks how much are we talking about we dont have sats up here universitiescolleges rely on grades
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not sure what you define as well but yes most people can increase their scores a moderate amount through prep work however past a certain point you definitely need additional brain power to score higher the other factor that goes unmentioned is that with the same amount of prep work the smarter kid is going to get more out of it than the stupid kid all else equal the stupid kid will never catch up in fact they will tend to lag further and further behind
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,eh i know a lot of people whose parents spent hundreds to thousands of dollars on sat prep and most of them barely eked out a score in the range after multiple attempts and these were kids who lived and breathed barrons and kaplan guides for a full year or two prior to the test whereas i did literally zero prep spent zero dollars and came out with a obviously that isnt the case for a lot of people who dont prepare at all but i have a hard time believing that the test is only indicative of preparation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,by afford their products do you mean walk into a library i didnt spend a cent outside of test cost for my gre just picked up different books from the library and maxed out the portion i was interested in math
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a person who did well on the sat its way more about how well you prepare for the sat than how smart you are there are entire businesses including kaplan and the college board itself predicated on sat and other standardized test prep if you cant afford their products youre not gonna do as well not to mention the fact that you can pay to retake the test keep in mind that the sat doesnt cover any calculus nor any type of science and that the reading questions follow the same formula yeartoyear with the proper heavily monetized study techniques nearly anyone can do well it is way more about how smart you are than how much you prepare rich parents are more likely to be smart and smart parents are more likely to have smart kids i got a perfect score and the organization i volunteer with has had several students with perfect scores none of us were rich and they all did less prep than many merely above average students i did no prep at all there are also vouchers to take the test so there isnt really an issue about being able to afford to take the test furthermore where i volunteer the poor students from certain backgrounds do much better than even the very rich of other backgrounds from my decade plus of experience in the field the stronger correlation for high scores is with the intelligence of the parent not the income of the parent two really smart but not rich immigrants who just got to america are going to have kids that do better than two dumb parents who got their money through the lottery a lawsuit or a successful athletic career the only reason there is such a strong correlation with income is because there is such a strong correlation with intelligence and income we just pretend like there isnt finally you are wrong about nearly anyone can do well by taking kaplan courses over and over again again the poor asian immigrants with smart parents i work with do better than the rich people who take multiple prep courses there are a ton of people who take kaplan courses and end up doing worse afterwards
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you can get all of that material at the library for free or online and they teach it in school too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean the a stands for aptitude yeah you can throw money at it and do better but if you are smart and went to a good school you can score quite well without any prep whatsoever
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its way more about how good of a student you were in middle school
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats called an anecdote bruh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think there are too many factors in play here for the simplicity of the data that is being presented i mean yes we can say that the kids who were in the wealthier schools performed better but why because the schools were better funded were there more resources for them to use or was it because they had fewer distractions in their wealthier neighborhood than in their poorer neighborhood or was it because of fewer distractions in the schools themselves
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why do you think you cant get financial aid
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i had literally no prep and did just fine yes im one person but i am so god damn tired of hearing tests dont measure how smart you are grades dont measure how smart you are iq tests dont measure how smart you are yes those things absolutely do measure how smart you are because smart doesnt just mean what youve memorized from a book it means how youve prepared yourself how much youve applied the intelligence you have and how seriously you took that test in other words all of the traits you would need to have to do well in life it does not cost money
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats not necessarily true myself and most of the people i know that scored very highly did basically no prep the ones that did do prep only improved their scores from average to somewhat above average
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no they arent truly smart people will utterly wreck the test without any study material i got out of im old with no study or prep material at all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the only thing the sat tests is how good you are at taking the sat even a smart kid is going to have trouble without expensive prep material this isnt true at all ive taught the the sat professionally or volunteered to teach it for over a decade the sat is highly predictive in a lot of different capacities other than just how good you are at taking the sat for example there is no calculus on the sat do you think low scorers do just as well as high scorers in calculus there are countless other examples and no smart kids dont have trouble without expensive materials all the materials available are currently free online so pretty much everyone has access to these materials secondly smart kids usually get a higher score on their first test diagnostic or pre test than even above average kids get after all of their prep for example i was a smart kid and i got a perfect score on my first sat with no prep at all you can take a nonsmart kid and lock them in a room for three years with all the expensive test materials in the world and they still wouldnt be able to do that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nope the data do not suggest that test prep is the deciding factor here the overwhelming majority of students including those from affluent homes do not hire private sat tutors sat scores correlate nicely with iq test scores neither necessarily corresponds to college performance
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,none of the people i know who did exceptional on the sat took a class sat prep books are cheap or free from the library
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,definitely not i got a sat ii and act without studying for either test specifically
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you can get the material for free at the library plus they do teach the material in school too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i didnt need prep material its all really easy stuff
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think thats true at all i didnt do any prep work but got a with a in math i also got every multiple choice question on the writing section correct but only did average on the actual written part its possible that i could have done better with some prep especially in my writing but a smart kid can still do well on the sat without any preparation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can confirm that i also did quite well with a single handmedown prep book
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not true at all the prep is usually meaningless if youre clever you understand the types of questions they ask and how to best take it i
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,username checks out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i believe the correct message is that shitty parents give their kids shitty lives
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so whos to blame then people who give a fuck about their kids but not the ones that dont
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres something to be said here about pushing a narrative using bad statistics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that latter portion definitely doesnt surprise me i feel like the actual causal relationship between background and performance is more likely to be parental education level rather than parental income though acknowledging of course that educated people earn more on average good study habits start in the home
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,genetics has absolutely nothing to do with intelligence only metabolism then why are no nobel prize winners dogs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,someones gotta break the stereotype of book smart people being nerdy pushovers if you dumb get out the way
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,issue here no one is talking about dumbsmart if that was the case noone would say a word thing is instead were talking about richpoor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no hes saying fuck the people who are lazy and dont work hard and complain about other people being more successful than they are
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think thats a much further jump than i made intelligence has a wellmeasured genetic link spending money on tests doesnt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah that makes sense im from the midwest
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,though the plot only provides weak support for the view that the slope changes suggestive but surely not statistically significant this is pretty consistent pattern in the data i and others have looked at great deal of similar data and find this pattern time and time around this not coincidentally is about the point where the education levels and raceethnicity get saturated bachelor degree or higher and white and asian in fact income are not significantly associated with test scores in ols once it modestly large sample sizes takes a much larger sample for it to reach statistical significance and the coefficient is usually very modest
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as in average over the entire district
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if only there were a way to quantize such a variable
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the standard deviation is about points cumulatively at each income level approximately normally distributed and different groups have different means too so that is entirely plausible and
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is it a mean median mode what is the population size
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all wealthy places have a higher cost of living
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so i grew up in new england massnewhampshire does all of mass really have that much higher cost of living than the average or does boston extremely expensive and the outlying suburbs skew the statistics i honestly cant really tell its all normal to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its to cold for poor people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that alone isnt it there is consistent data showing educational success correllates more with parental income and education than innate intelligence there are multiple factors sat tutors is just one of this is a trend that is consistent across countries counties states kids of rich parents just have so much more advantage at any type of standardized testing than kids from poorer homes its also one of the many reasons why iq tests are pointless they end up measuring socioeconomic status than actual intellegence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,good point about disparity however vermont does have property tax that funds education
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i prefer to call it access because if your child doesnt have access to the good teacher or a tutor youre going to do less well when i was growing up the local public school didnt have ap classes which was fine if you were going to be a farmer but it limited access to education for the college prep set if you have a charter school that uses merit as the entrance criteria then you are limiting access to the normal student wealthier people can augment or bypass the lack of access through tutors summer classes camps private school or home schooling and if they have a difficult student they can throw more resources at the child to fix the problem they dont have to settle for what the public school offers we start splitting classes into tracks pretty early and god forbid you slip into a lower track its very hard to escape and that creates an additional access issue as lower tier classes dont learn the same material and are placed at an ever growing disadvantage compared to their peers in higher tier classes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is a quantitatively testable and wrong statement it is textbook psychology and has been for many years that a large majority of general intelligence variance among native born americans is attributable to genetic variance
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ring a ding ding we have ourselves a winner
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think the you might be surprised by how often the corolation does not happen i might expect that a higher iq can encourage upward mobility but i do not see high iqs being relative to income in most situations in engineering some of the least intelligent iq become sales engineers and make a higher income than their peers i rarely meet anyone in finance who is more than slightly above average the same goes for corporate leadership the highest salaries for most companies go to individuals whos iq would not standout in most stem fields
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,taller people earn a few thousand dollars more per year than short people accounting for other variables height is largely hereditary this is just one example
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,got any citations on the residual for income not challenging it just curious about what the magnitude looks like
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can you link the studies you are referencing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes we can with twin and adoption studies within the range of environments typical of the united states genetic variance is estimated to account for roughly of variance in intelligence this heritability is about the same as that of height
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,work at a college admission office in a state where the sat is mandatory testing very few take it again
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i never really understood why people thought public school kids werent wellprepared for college until i realized that my public school in ma was a completely different animal from those in other states
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all states massachusetts ranks in the us and on par with the leading countries in the world
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in somewhat of a similar situation i was able to convince one group that i literally won the lottery and donated the winning lottery ticket to the school to get in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah they kept the writing section but its now optional and comes out as a separate score from your readingmath score
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it looks like this to me this site cant provide a secure connection massschoolsfirebaseappcom sent an invalid response
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you forgot income is correlated with intelligence which is significantly hereditary richer parents tend to be more intelligent and have more intelligent kids who will outperform poorer less intelligent kids on average i think the relationship is strong enough to see a clear trend but weak enough to allow for a healthy number of outliers social mobility
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the high achieving kids of poor asian immigrants say its
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is only for one state and only the trend is applicable to the rest of the country
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,median not mean all of the other households could be between and its hard to imagine living on much less than that in ma median just means that there are an equal number of data points above and below that point so if there are points below and points above it that defines the median it doesnt mean that they average out to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i meant fair to op karnim said that the chart starts at above the us median income but the most relevant data point is the ma median income so karnim should use that to make the still valid argument instead
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think youll find the prep is less influential than the opportunities afforded by the previous years of childhood development
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,most poor kids arent as lucky to get a free test prep course its actually a huge thing have you looked up course prices i remember it was back when i was applying ten years ago id imagine its way more now a days
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean i always figured you werent supposed to prep for the tests because it was considered a measurement of your aptitude
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was somehow able to go to en elite high school but came from a middle class family with problems at home i scored in the upper what good is an anecdote
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that might be more of a sample issue i went to a high school in a poorer area with lower scores and still ended up with a group of friends who had no problem with the sat people will find people like them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,went to a poor inner city school made a on the act didnt prep at all and took the test on about hours of sleep
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the plural of anecdote is not data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,schools are funded with property taxes from thier counties or districts so wealthier areas have better funded schools better funded schools tend to provide better educations
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes thats what the data posted is showing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this always seems to be a sensitive subject on here i would guess partly because people get too caught up in the correlations and think that the result is making a judgement on them personally eg if i dont make a lot of money then i must have a low iq really people need to keep in mind that trends like this only reflect averages and subtle shifts in distributions and are definitely not accurate predictive models i suppose the other problem though with reporting this stuff too widely is that many people will use this to pump themselves up and justify shitty policy decisions eg im wealthy therefore i must be smart cough donald trump cough and all poor people must be dumb im never sure if these things should be openly discussed or if its just better to keep those discussions out of the general public as too many people misinterpret
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,haha thats exactly it in all seriousness it is referred to as the cycle of poverty and while some are certainly correct that hard work and determination can lift one out of poverty the point is more that many start with disadvantages that wealthier kids dont have to overcome
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was just going to thank you for posting actual data instead of the anecdote but then you added that too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that study says that simply paying for and experiencing test prep has very moderate effects which i believe if youre in a cram course because you want to do better youre going work hard and do better if youre in a cram course as a prisoner of your parents its not going to help
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,iirc it costs about to take the test so everyone pays at least that you can send scores to four schools for free but after that its there are fees for late registration and rush score reporting and some other stuff for clarity the sat has two sections reading and math from to like there was a writing section and i took the test during this time when i took the test the first time i tried to prepare as cheaply as possible the princeton review book in my library was from a decade prior i did really well but i was applying to tech schools so i wanted a better math for my second try i bought the official prep book for that year published by the college board which owns the sat i got my math up to and obviously didnt take the test again so it cost me about to get my scores which id expect the majority of people could swing but still some people cant inperson classes cost between and depending on rigor length and quality
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well my parents dropped a modest over three years to prepare me for sats and i got a many of my friends spent significantly moresome even paid some a little less least i know of was note this doesnt include fees to take the test which most of us did times nor the cost of sending this scores to colleges i ended up applying to colleges so that got real expensive real fast most of them still scored in the range hopefully that gives some indication its not an inordinate amount of money if you lump it into costs of going to college and your family is very very comfortable financially but the point is that your familys finances shouldnt affect results that directly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fellow canadian here a lot of money depending upon what you are trying to do i came down to the us to get my ma in english and was surprised when i found that every us college wanted a copy of my gre graduate record exam scores i had no clue what the hell that was as the only standardized test id ever taken was the optional descartes math test in high school so i go and get a copy of the official gre test prep booklet from ets educational testing services who runs the sat and all other us standardized tests the thing was damn near incomprehensible im serious never before had i been exposed to questions like if bauxite is to salmon then hitler is to blank what the fuck does that even mean more importantly what the hell are they trying to test here i started to panic and then found a book in my uni bookstore entitled how to beat the gre it explained the primitive thinking behind the gre and all ets products and how they used time and bellcurveesque thinking to neatly shuffle millions of diverse individuals into spots along one arbitrary line most importantly it taught me that you literally dont have to know anything about the subject matter to do well on the test just outthink the test itself half the focus was on timemanagement and the rest was on which areas to ignore favourite quote what does a working knowledge of grade mathematics have to do with getting a graduate degree in english we dont know but ets seems to think its important without having ever taken a standardized test i sat the gre and got a respectable score in the range cant remember exactly and got accepted to every college to which id applied the test itself tests nothing but the ability to take a test now to your question as to how much money is involved the answer is both a lot and it depends the individual student can spend as little as the test fee and in my case another for a book but theres a thriving industry of tutors courses classes testprep systems and guides that desperate students or parents can spend money on the big money however is being made by ets and the people on the other end who have managed to convince the entire us that these tests are actually meaningful in any way ets makes an incredible amount of money unknown and taxfree thanks to their registration as a nonprofit providing theses tests they have an effective monopoly and have badly warped the entire conceptpurpose of education in the usa from personal experience as a teach in massachusetts i know that the mcas comes by and completely obliterates actual learning for over month while the students madly try to cram for a test that does nothing at all but determine funding levels for the school ive seen kids going into panic attacks that were once the exclusive province of college students taking finals its obscene and theres not a damn bit of evidence that any of this is actually either teaching the kids anything or helping them learn oh wait there is a ton of evidence its just all produced by ets to justify their existence and the millions of tests they sell to captive schools charge a modest fee to administrate every year so like any test of any sort iq fitness obesity reading comprehension etc this graph is evidence that people with lots of money and support generally outperform people with less money less support and less stable environments everyone whining about how those on the lower end of the scale are just lazy need to check their privilege and think about how the difference a decent breakfast makes can impact scores add a few million similar physical and mental stressors and its no surprise that the poorer candidates dont do as well as the wealthier ones this is yet another reason why standardized tests or any other measurement really looking at you bmi cant really be applied to entire populations tldr standardized tests are stupid but big moneymakers for the testers rather than the testees and finally because i know someones going to ask this heres the top tips on outhinking tests that i got from my gre book time management is critical and almost all the poor scores are due to students not finishing the test more than anything else you need to focus on whats going to score you the most points each section is divided into thirds aimed at the average student the first third are easy so the average student gets almost all of them right the second third are moderately challenging and the average student has to think about them a bit the final third are very difficult and are designed to trip up the average student they want you to agonize equally over everything and thus burn up more of your time dont fall into that trap for the first third guess youll probably be right for the second third think it through and do your best this will be where you spend the bulk of your time for the final third guess againthen cross that one out as its almost always going to be the wrong answer they want you to make mistakes remember so the questions are designed to make one answer seem obvious its not then look at the other answers yay standardized testing who needs nuance and look for the one that is obviously completely wrong theres almost always one cross that one off as well now youre down to two possibly correct answers and a chance pick one and move on know your own skills and be prepared to avoid wasting time on sections you know you arent good at im not great with math so i used the method above for almost all of the quantitative sections and got a respectable while i focused on the other sections and spent the majority of my time there you need to spend most of your time on the middle third of each section and use any extra time to check those answers rather than laboring over the final third that are designed to be hard remember that all questions are worth the same points so if you get the first two thirds right then the final third is where you can spend any remaining time the people who fail to finish because they were slogging through the final third of each section are guilty of spending more time per point than they should be its that simple disclaimer all my information on the gre is years out of date all my information on the mcas is years out of date its possible this has all changed significantly although i doubt it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sat tutors get paid an hour depending on whether they work for an sat prep tutoring service or are freelance workers as well as depending on how much experiencetraining they have
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i paid something like drops to if youre on freesubsidized lunch to take the test walked in and took it no prep other than the psat provided by the school the questions arent that bad they were about the same as my states standardized tests but more likely to do things like throw in an unbolded not to catch people who arent reading the questions extremely carefully
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a typical class in this area catered to americans is about a typical class catered to asians is about the asian oriented ones give homework and meet often there are times i saw kids leaving after midnight start at during the summer months
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,while its been a long time since i took the tests im somewhat mystified by all the talk in this thread about it not being taught in schools and needing to take outside classes to prepare in the when it was still a point test it was definitely taught in schools i never took a single specialized class nor paid for anything prep i did have a set of handmedown vocab flashcards from my brother but that was it the only practice tests i ever had were the psats which were a year prior and were a required free test at my innercity high school i got a i was a decent student but not great and come from a solidly middleclass family wed have been in the bottom third of the posted chart perhaps it is a more recent phenomenon with the increase in teaching to match certain advancement tests rather than teaching basics of how to think critically and learn to analyze but it boggles my mind a bit children who were just being born when i took the test are taking it themselves now so a lot may have changed but as i remember it the sat was pretty straightforward
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,kids in my prep school would take weekly tutoring classes for their attendance leading up to it i would say the average kid spends around with the really try hard parents at pushing a couple grand its mostly a money making scheme i recall i had to pay some shit even while trying to avoid all costs i believe there was a fee waiver or something
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did you have homework busy work participation make up a big portion of your grade a lot of kids in my school were pretty smart but didnt do their hw ended up with bs and cs due to lack of effort but their near perfect sat scores allowed them to get into decent schools
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats definitely true the point is that since the sat stands for student aptitude test scores should be a function of aptitude and not of wealth cultural background etc to the furthest extent possible this can be achieved by making those resources available to everyone which are now available only to wealthy students
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think youre just an outlier
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the material at my library was insufficient i took my tests in and the best they had was a princeton review book from as for your schools sat prep class i hope everyone takes advantage of it because most people dont have free access to that kind of high quality test prep
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they definitely do not teach it in all schools and to be honest there is a vast difference between taking the classes and just reading the books for one reading the books does poorly in adapting to different educational techniques but honestly this is literally just the beginning wealthy parents can pay for their children to retake the test multiple times wealthy parents give students more time and energy to do test prep wealthy parents would have made their children familiar with the culture the test writers came from the verbiage of sat questions include vocabulary eg regatta that are associated with class honestly the list literally keeps going there is a lot of peer reviewed material on this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,preparing does not hurt though id argue its virtually impossible to get a perfect score without preparing generally im a proponent for the satother standardized tests but they are not without flaws they generally work but stuff tends to get weird when they try to differentiate between the extremes in a population usually there are at least a few really niche questions that dont really show up in any other situation smart students can usually figure them out though however handling all of them if youve never preparedseem them before really hurts your odds
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think its because of a lot of these factors but together they just put the students into different environments a lot of inner city schools are pretty scary places and students end up focusing a lot less of learning than their peers in suburban schools
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to get financial aid where i live you need to prove your parents income to show financial need my parents didnt pay their taxes so i couldnt prove need edit as to show need you gave your parents tax returns from the previous year insert ironic comment about students needing to show tax returns but not american presidents
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also old and from a relatively poor state sd and got a with prepstudy some people are just good at standardized tests
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same here took it almost cold read a practice test or something so i had some marginal idea of the format got dont remember exactly scored higher on verbal than math which made no sense as i suck at english studied a bit retook it both scores went down meh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,of course neglectful parents are to blame for their own children but at the same time there is lots of things we as a society can do to make children more successful throughout their life while we could ignore them and say its not our problem this is bad for america because they are more likely to end up as a burden on society in jail homeless etc on the other hand we could recognize some children need extra help and if we provide that help it will help them grow into productive members of society in the future creating a system of preschools and daycares would do a huge part of this it costs money now but we would all actually save money because you no longer have to spend per year to house an inmate in the future or all the medical emergency or police costs associated with people who are on the streets homeless
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hilarious but also has undertones of eugenics if i could both upvote and downvote this at the same time i would leaving it be doesnt feel right tie goes to the upvote
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nobody thinks booksmart people are nerdy pushovers i have however met a few condescending assholes who also happen to be booksmart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he said dumb so why would i assume that he didnt mean dumb
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no correlation between education investment and achievement lolwut til tutoring isnt real
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes pretty much this particular plot is median income in district by presumably mean score in district averaging the data this way hides a lot of the variation that goes on at the individual level the differences in the means by socioeconomic status and raceethnicity are of real practical significance but the individual level correlation would be much weaker than when you aggregate it like this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i did not mean to imply that their anecdote was inconsistent with the data i merely wanted to contradict the idea that their experience somehow invalidates the data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its pretty self explanatory its the average score for each district
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,tell that to people living lawrence or lowell
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not houston
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats how they keep the riffraff out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i live on the cape its fucking expensive
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the majority of the population is the boston metro area so its still pretty representative the one thing that they did was choose massachusetts the clustering of highiqs around the boston area has to be profound the shear number of universities and several of the worlds best are in bostoncambridge wonder what rhode island looks like there are several upper middle class towns not the wealthiest in metro boston that are teeming with college professors and their families theres a combo of gene pool and particularly high social standards for education edit on top of the rich people factor of course they start em young and college aint good enough ya gotta go to a good grad school too at least thats the tacit expectation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i grew up on the south shore and have lived in a bunch of places ma is expensive and a pain in the ass to deal with because of the regulations not just the taxes but things like getting an inspection sticker bad infrastructure and corrupt public works all drive you a little nuts surprisingly even the t seems to suck now as a kid it was relatively cheap and reliable
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,some of the poorest people in canada live north of the parallel
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my mom makes a year and she supports me when people tell me that its your fault if your poor or to just try harder ill show them this i go to an early college im enrolled at a university at and im trying to make it to med school hopefully ill be one of the outliers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what would be indicative of greater intelligence in wealthy communities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they end up measuring socioeconomic status than actual intellegence i disagree with that point kind of yes all these trends tell us is that money helps especially when you want to consider innate intelligence problem is no one really cares about innate they care about what youve done with it you also make it seem like its only standardized testing that is affected which seems a bit unfounded like imagine if you were picking for a soccer team the kid who grew up poor might be innately better at soccer but the kid who grew up rich and could afford lessons and to play in local leagues and develop his skills probably still has a higher level of skill regardless of innate talent youd pick the second kid for your team
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,does it i thought iq was in theory supposed to measure more innate types of intelligence the sat measures if you know the meaning of uncommon words or have been taught and recall how to do specific types of math at least thats how it was when i took it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yup the sat is pretty much a proxy iq test colleges obviously want the smartest students but they cant administer iq tests directly for fear of public outlash
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it correlates exactly to how hard you study you cant get smarter by doing better on this test
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you need to look at the actual data in the psychometric literature not rely on your anecdotal experience especially when you dont actually know the iq of people you interact with
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre talking about a sample size of people who are likely all above iq some far in excess there is a diminishing return on iq in the workplace where eq becomes more important some of the highest iqs have some of the lowest eqs which is related in a lot of cases if you compare vs vs vs you will see a stark difference
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you were able to do all the work and pass all the certifications to become and actual engineer assuming you dont mean software engineers which arent really engineers then you are above average intelligence and i think that largely proves the correlation past a certain point it is going to be more about your own personal drive and ability to find a good economic niche to determine your actual income but in example his intelligence guaranteed at least a certain level of affluence over the broader population the correlation between iq and income but not necessarily wealth is very strong
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i get that and i realize it was a far better experience than most of the country but i still viewed my time in public schools in massachusetts as a festering waste
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pretty certain a lot of colleges only looked at readingmath anyways
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i guess thats nice i took it during the point period and i bombed the writing i overthought the whole writing process and wrote something like to of a page and erased the entire thing and started over i remember it was difficult to even read what i ended up writing because the old pencil marks were still slightly visible underneath what i ended up writing i also started running out of time and just strung together a bunch of incoherent ideas i think i got something like a on the writing section it was awful
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats incorrect its four sections now each worth reading writing math no calculator and math calculator youre thinking of the essay which is optional and scored separately
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not only that but the expectations of children in rich homes are much higher if your dad is a carpenter the family hopes that you will go to college if your dad is an investment banker the family expects that you will go to college big difference
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yay the eugenics argument studies have shown that nurture is much more important than nature parents that care about education is much more relevant than genetics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all of the other households could be between and but we know this not to be true its easily verified by factchecking
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,most poor kids arent as lucky to get a free test prep course its actually a huge thing have you looked up course prices i remember it was back when i was applying ten years ago id imagine its way more now a days there are a ton of free test prep programs for poor kids i volunteer with one at various poor schools in my area certain groups of poor kids generally show up to every session on time take diligent notes participate the whole time do all the assigned homework and then do better on the test than the average rich kid we have had several perfect scores other groups of poor kids generally show up late or not at all are on their phone the whole time and disrupt other kids they do worse on average than rich kids unfortunately in my experience the second group is a lot larger among certain ethnic groups and a lot smaller in other groups dont worry though colleges have decided to significantly lower the standards for the second group whether they are poor or not to make it fair
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i studied by renting test prep books from the library cost free money is not an excuse i can understand an effect from families living in poverty having a single parent work two or more jobs and no time to look after their kids but money isnt an excuse to do poorly on the sat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not talking solid public school im talking about elite private schools where of the class ends up in top colleges
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats amazing but than you couldve done much better with prep and gotten a would you not do it differently today would that have helped you getting into schools
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the plural of anecdote is data raymond wolfinger
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,okay but how much do you think that changes the outcome ie do you think that for a very hardworking student test prep is twice as effective as it is on average
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,iirc it costs about to take the test so everyone pays at least that you can send scores to four schools for free but after that its there are fees for late registration and rush score reporting and some other stuff for clarity the sat has two sections reading and math from to like there was a writing section and i took the test during this time when i took the test the first time i tried to prepare as cheaply as possible the princeton review book in my library was from a decade prior i did really well but i was applying to tech schools so i wanted a better math for my second try i bought the official prep book for that year published by the college board which owns the sat i got my math up to and obviously didnt take the test again so it cost me about to get my scores which id expect the majority of people could swing but still some people cant inperson classes cost between and depending on rigor length and quality if you are poor you can get a voucher to take the test for free you can also get way more test prep materials and test banks online now completely for free so a poor student could do exactly what you did for free
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,holy crap my parents didnt spend shit and i basically got the same grade off of attempts no prep school or any of that other nonsense the amount of money people are putting out in this thread is seriously insane to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,although doesnt seem like a lot to you it very well can be for others it also helps to have parents who push you to do well and take initiative to sign you up for sat classes people in poverty or near there dont realize the importance of taking this test the thought of sat prep doesnt even cross their minds
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,grades reward suckups who take bongodrumming classes for a guaranteed a they do poorly on tests which are our time to shine
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sat tutors get paid an hour depending on whether they work for an sat prep tutoring service or are freelance workers as well as depending on how much experiencetraining they have it can go a lot higher than that i was making per hour towards the end and more than that when teaching classes now i volunteer to teach the same thing for free so mainly to poor kids the poor kids with smart parents do better than the rich kids whose parents were paying me so much intelligence of parents matters more than income of the parents intelligent people are just more likely to have higher incomes despite what reddit thinks
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,asian sat prep business in my area has a ft x ft wall inscribed with names of students scoring perfect no way to verify names scores but i believe their results
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah asians need to score points more than whites and more than blacks to be considered for the same schools so they bust their asses off
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theyre literally available to everyone man its all online and even if youre the hypothetical kid who doesnt have an internet connection all school and district libraries get sent a book of practice tests
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to be fair the official sat study guide released by the collegeboard is usually i genuinely think that with the right mindset just that book is enough to substantially bump your sat score but thats only from personal experience
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well why are inner city schools pretty scary places because of the infrastructure because of the faculty or perhaps obviously because of the students imagine transplanting all the students in two schools in a trading placesesque exchange would the lowincome students still perform better would the highincome students perform worse i personally believe the lowincome students performed better because of a better grade of peer pressure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,then they didnt claim you as a dependent either and you can file for financial aid without them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,some people are just good at standardized tests never been a fan of this line because it seems a bit disingenuous it makes it sound like these tests only favor good test takers who have a very specific set of skills that make them good at tests and only tests not true most test taking skills are highly dependent on reasoning like knowing that if a b and you know the answer isnt a then it cant be b as well it also involves things like risk assessment where you have to rationalize your guesses to best improve your score now there definitely are some things that can be said about the test environment for some people performing under a test does not work because of anxiety stress etc for others focusing for the entire test in one sitting can be an issue that said while it may be unfair to judge intelligencereasoning because of these issues these issues definitely show up in realworld scenarios where people are expected to perform
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same maybe old people are just smarter
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hmm i didnt have any prep but i did take it in my sophomore year and in my junior year and respectively i also took it in grade and got
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is it helpful sure is it the deciding factor between attending harvard or umass boston hell no
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that makes sense thanks for the explanation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but all this data shows is that the mean income levels correlate fairly well with mean test scores in school districts it tells you nothing about causation and it tends not speak to the substantial dispersion around the mean within income levels for test scores or the income distribution within school districts examples like his cannot in and of themselves falsify this implication that affluence causes this but they help call it into question in any event there is already a great deal of reason to think that affluence is not driving this significantly see genetically sensitive studies evidence from natural experiments eg lottery winners vs losers results from repeated multiple regression analysis lack of evidence that the parentchild association here is reduced by more childrenbirth order effectsetc etc etc you might try starting if youre curious
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,self explanatory would include a label on the yaxis
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lowell is up and coming
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,houston is wealthy its basically the trashy dallas
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,median family income is so it isnt that rich
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,great map but sad where i live the dollar has the least value 😭
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,except heroin sadly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if only people treated them as such
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my mom made a year but had inherited her dads house i have a masters in computer science and making almost what she made its quite possible to get up and out just remember to help your mom out when you get there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,absolutely possible keep working at it you are an inspiration
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but you dont use sat scores to get a job you use them to go to college someone with innate ability but few opportunities could flourish in college while someone with less ability but parents pushing them to prep for the sat will likely flounder when they leave home
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the sat correlates about as well with a highg iq test wais etc as it does with itself testretest correlation about its is not readily trainable randomly assigning people to get test preparation has average effects within the random noise of variation of the same person taking the test twice about pts on the scale to the extent that it pretends to be a measure of academics the sat is a fraud it is by most psychometric properties just an overly long intelligence test with expensive branding this is common knowledge to the world of quantitative psychology less so to the world of education i suspect this delusion persists because education systems want to think of themselves as useful things that make kids smart and iq tests mostly show them to have little value add in this regard it is also important to keep up the facade of academics because it is mostly illegal griggs vs duke power co to just use straight up iq tests for admissions to various institutions the sat is an elaborate ceremony that provides public cover to universities using this cheap tool to assess applicants in a way that mostly ignores schooling
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sat is basically a simplified iq test meaning of uncommon words is part of iq tests its derived from the same source but easier to administer en masse you dont need a person in front of you like a tradition iq test you could prepare to an iq test in exactly the same way and get the same improvements
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when i took it in it was still those questions and to my knowledge they are still similar i think the problem is you havent fully analyzed how the questions work on the sat for example the bit about the uncommon words is a common gripe about the sat yeah fastest way to get the right answer is just to know the definition straight from memory but you cant look at it as rightwrong you have to look at it as a game of odds the sentences are often crafted in a way that hints towards an answer so you might not know the exact word but you might be able to at least infer that the word needs to have a positive connotation this is worth points because youll have a better shot at getting the answer even with a guess the sentences with double blanks showed this the best because usually the sentence hinted towards a certain connection between the two blanks for example you might be able to infer that the words need to be similar in meaning or perhaps the second intensifies the first or perhaps they are opposite in meaning by being able to reason this from the context you increase your chance of getting the right answer as for the math most of the math relies on students being able to find the relationship between numbers the fastest way to solve the problem is to know the answersolution and jump straight there but again it isnt a matter of right vs wrong its a matter of odds perhaps you can reason from the given information that the answer needs to be a large number so youd probably be able to mark a couple choices as wrong this increases your score because over a large number of questions youll have better odds at getting right answers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the sat measures if you know the meaning of uncommon words or have been taught and recall how to do specific types of math all of which are easier for someone to do with higher innate intelligence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well thats reasonable enough but i think its fair and relatively easy to naively look at thresholds of success in different academic disciplines and the divergence of that hierarchy from average career incomes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so basically youre realizing that you lived in an area of higher economic status than the national average if mas median income is and the national median is perhaps the kids interest in college has less to do with how great the schools are and more to do with having the economic opportunity to attend
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,where did you go to school
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that and more people where taking the act
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah it sounded like an even more retarded version of the satii writing test but scaled up to the point where administering and scoring it was even harder i still remember my satii writing prompt because it was so stupid every cloud has a silver lining discuss what is that even going to test
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i bombed the essay too i hated persuasive writing in general but the sat test prompt i got was such utter garbage that i couldnt write anything worth a damn wrote like paragraphs and gave up still ended up with a on writing though so i guess i aced the rest of the writing sections
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whats the difference between writing and the essay do you not write anything for the writing part seriously question been almost years since i took it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which studies here is a page from the nih httpsghrnlmnihgovprimertraitsintelligence it says hereditary genetics are generally viewed as contributing to of general intelligence making genetics the single greatest determinant of your intelligence the correlation between income and intelligence has also been established already so clearly rich people are smarter than poor people on average and pass down this superior intelligence to their children
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the graph is based on school districts its reasonable that the school districts which include many data points themselves will have average incomes that dont fall too far below the state average
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it sounds like you think affirmative action is unfair
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,poor kids have responsibilities rich kids dont if youre working four hours five days a week for grocery money youre doing all the cleaning and cooking and whatever errands you can because your parents are too busy working or you spend your evenings looking after the little kids because daycare costs money you cant study much and even when their families arent asking much of them poor kids in the us are often hungry homeless or otherwise physically unsafe having free academic resources like libraries available is helpful but its not a panacea
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,me too bud
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably not no ive always been pretty good at taking tests though went to a community college to figure out what i wanted to do then transferred to a major state school worked nearly full time throughout college and paid my way took a couple extra years but i dont owe any bank a single penny going to work for one of the worlds top it corporations in just a few weeks doing a job that will allow me to travel and solve problems on a daily basis while earning a great living i like to think the hard work it took to get myself through school will pay dividends in the long term
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not an american but if is accurate an sat score of would place you in the percentile of the population which means your and the ops academic experiences are likely to differ significantly from that of the majority of your countrymen i mean i personally ranked quite similarly for my own national high school examinations without studying much was addicted to wow at the time but its also readily apparent to me that even students who are considered fairly bright require a significant investment of time and resources in order to achieve the same and that for those who are genuinely average in terms of their innate intelligence however one might conceive of such a construct there is not enough time in their life for them to ever accomplish such a feat this is not even an incrimination against their capabilities its just the nature of any venture that entails a competition between people school sport art of participants must fall below the top and if ones ranking in any of these domains were to shape the course of the rest of their life as it does with academia a couple thousand dollars and a few extra hours a week with a tutorassuming these things can be sparedare absolutely worth the cost even if they only amount to a bump of that can be the difference between one or two tiers of university which in turn can be the difference between one or two tiers of job which in turn can be the difference between one or two tiers of school for your own children and on and on these things tends to snowball off each other and result in graphs like the one posted hence immigrant parents who are a little more attune to the competitive realities of the world will scrimp on things like meals clothing housing entertainment and sleep in order to bump their childrens quality of education beyond the expected value at their socioeconomic status
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i was in that range on one test
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i had zero prep and scored in the top point something of a percentile in my one attempt i was also living in deep poverty with seven brothers and sisters a dad in and out of jail in a house that didnt always have electricity what im saying that talking about outliers isnt all that pertinent to general trends truth is money makes a difference in the vast majority of cases
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well if you can bump your kids score from a to a by spending grand its totally worth it as an investment
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,like i said it isnt too much if your family is very very comfortable financially is no small amount thats about half the value of my car also half the value of my computer and those are my two biggest assets in my life so far
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,asian sat prep business in my area has a ft x ft wall inscribed with names of students scoring perfect no way to verify names scores but i believe their results its true i volunteer with an organization that helps poor kids on the sat and act for free even the poor asian kids are getting perfect scores with us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not everyone can take advantage though some kids cant study at the library after school because they have to work or care for younger siblings while their parent works
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in my experience moving from poor schools to rich schools peer pressure wasnt a significant factor imo teacher availability was probably what improved my education most smaller class sizes was important too also small things like having my own textbooks was a nice perk having reliable school busses so i could actually get to school was also helpful there are so many things that rich kids take for granted that make learning so much easier i did well on my tests and in college i cant say the same for many of my friends from poorer schools even though many of them were just as smart they just didnt have the same opportunities based on my anecdotal experience id bet the correlation has everything to do with funding and very little to do with genetics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,mother did her taxes claimed as a dependent of hers father did not do taxes they arent divorced thus i am still a dependent yet did not have both returns to prove need i appreciate it dude but i went through it multiple times with my school and there wasnt anything that could be done at the time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there are sat specific test taking skills though the ability to remain focused and calm for four hours speed reading being able to do repetitive but simple math with a low error rate these skills may not necessarily correlate with intelligence so its possible for someone of average intelligence to do really well on the sat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i appreciate your arguments and thoughts here however i think it is quite a stretch to interpret the comment i was replying to as saying all that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i thought dallas was the trashy dallas
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,got that purple suburban sprawl in my cup
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in houston gets you further than in a coastal city
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not necessarily because you want to adjust for preferences as well there are major differences in income curves across occupations it would be interesting to see whether iq effects are insignificant given occupational sorting
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes you would otherwise have been doing much better things as a year old
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think its the content of your response that matters so much as your overall ability to write a wellformed and thoughtout essay mine was literally about the movie cloverfield which i had seen the week before
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it sounds like they dont like the attitude of the second group and id agree with them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,right and its going to be harder for a poor kid to see the value of studying for some test they dont absolutely have to take when they got real world shit to deal with whereas a rich kid has to take that test often times and frequently it will be one of the only things they are responsible for
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i doubt it the parents of poor kids are not around or are not responsible themselves so ghetto kids literally hang out with their bois all day long compared to upper middle class parents who are home to pester their kid to study and do chores
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nice mind telling which company
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,where do you get such a cheap car mine is and i already needed to do maintenance and pay the cost of the car again because im stupid
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres always the poor asian kids that works the hardest they prove you can work hard to overcome any shortcomings the intellectual rudy if you will
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fair enough
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,opium is the opium of the people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre right its not really the content theyre just looking for structure and adherence to process and stuff like that i just completely bombed it because i thought i had to make some great case i cant even remember what the topic was now i think i got as far as i did and then i just thought whatever i was writing about was completely stupid but i probably would have been fine so long as i was structuring it properly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it sounds like theyre saying the majority of minorities are lazy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,didnt say thats what my car cost me its what my car is worth its my dads old car a hand if you count me and my dad as the same owner corolla dx with almost miles on it trying to sell it now and biuy something slightly newer though insurance alone costs me a year and only because it is now more than old
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seriously impressive to see that type of work ethic coming from sometimes very impoverished homes and when surrounded by such conflicting social pressure these poor kids that ace standardized tests are the academic lifeblood of alot of american private secondary schools that rely on old wasp money that comes with severely mentally handicapped trust fund kiddies the tryhard poor kids cant do anything less than perfect or else their aid dries up good motivation but can cause some weird situations when trying to fit in at home as the preppoor kid that doesnt really have a social in anywhere in youth cause his clothes are too shit to be preppy but not rough and tough enough to be accepted at home are you preppy or poor cant be both
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,everythings bigger in texas so we needed two trashy metropolitan areas
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,went to school in korea took the sat im not from an impoverished home but some kids i know the parents are poor and working hour weeks in odd jobs they use every ounce of their savings to foster the education their kids need to do well on testsgo to good schools its the completely sacrifice your life to extreme levels so your kids have a shot mentality that almost seems like the norm and sometimes its hard to watch but extremely respectful in some ways
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i like how you can identify different cities and then theirs japan solid gdp
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the data is years old and the resolution isnt much better than the thumbnail
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,directly link to the httpwwwredditcomrdataisbeautifulwikiindexwikioriginalsources of the visualization or tag the post as if you made the visualization this post has been removed please once you believe the post is ready to be reinstated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that last value is pretty messed up about half a million to about half a billion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the methodology is flawed to begin with gdp density gdp per capita number of people per square mile thats not a map of gdp density the calculation is skewed by retirees and other non income earning groups that nonetheless live in higher densities in desirable areas see southern spain
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,these plots were made in python using requests beautifulsoup scipy numpy and matplotlib packages data was collected from the wonderful basketballreferencecom in compliance with their httpwwwsportsreferencecomtermsofusehtml each draft is compared to the nearest ten drafts to calculate the expected value usually that means years but for more recent drafts like it is the red dots are every picks performance over that ten year period using a third degree regression scipyoptimizecurvefit the expected value is calculated and then plotted magenta line every pick is then plotted and labelled with a horizontal bar chart showing how they compare to the expected values and historical data the script can calculate this for win shares vorp bpm and then any time stat against any rate state games seasons and minutes with per or ex if there are any reccomendations or questions let me know or if you would like to see a plot ill post it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im pretty stunned that mudiay has negative win shares ive never looked at his stats but the two times i watched him he more than passed the eye test
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dislike how the increments for the xaxis are different for some of them makes it harder to compare players who were picked in different years nonetheless great job
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hello thank you for your efforts in creating this visual analysis unfortunately i am not smart enough to interpret your charts can you please explain the draft expectations curve what does it reflect how does one interpret the individual players draft expectations vs their performance which i assume is reflected by the blue bar thanks again
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the expectations curve is a best fit line for all the red data points you see its a good idea of what you should expect on average for that draft pick based on the ten nearest drafts to the draft youre looking at i hope that helps
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no offense but this chart is not portraying the actual use of tillable farmland at all you are stating the highest grossing agricultural product in the state there is far more pasture land in florida than citrus groves but citrus grosses more in dollars there is way more cotton grain peanuts and tobacco grown in the those southern states than there are acres of poultry houses but poultry is big business down there the label for kentucky is another kentucky is the largest cattle state east of the mississippi river lexington is the third largest cattle market in the united states i implore anybody reading this comment to please take a few minutes on this fine sunday morning and review the httpswwwagcensususdagov this is published by the usda every few years and is extremely detailed you can break each state down and see the acreage of each crop the number of livestock in the state typical incomes etc this source is highly trustworthy farmers love an opportunity to educate about their industry feel free to ask any questions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive lived in both new york and arizona and ive got to say that i dont recall seeing any diary farms in either do you know the breakdown of blank vs lined in each state s
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,percentage farmland and top usage suggests acreage of the various commodity groups but the graphic actually depicts economic value of the commodities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,please color code with white color its hard to figure out where each state falls without referencing the key a billion times
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont feel like south dakota is totally accuratewest river is essentially all cattle
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i recently moved to florida and have yet to find oranges grown here and not imported from california
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was wondering why it seemed weird also is ranching considered farming
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,agreed there are far more wheat fields by square mile in ks than there are pastures hell the western half of ks it practically all wheat field
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,upper new york state is full of smallmedium sized dairy farms the eastern dairy industry really follows a crescent around the great lakes wisconsin michigan ohio pennsylvania new york vermont new hampshire those states have had thriving small dairy industries for over a century kentucky also had a large dairy business but it has slowly dwindled away unfortunately this same trend is ongoing most everywheredairy is a business of hard work low margins and no vacations some years you lose money some you break even sometimes you hit it right in a good year and can save enough to carry through the bad out west youll find large dairies in the central valley of california typically to the north where irrigation water is more accessible for alfalfa there is a large amount of irrigated alfalfa grown in arizona and new mexico but i am not familiar with their dairy industry a lot of what they grow goes to california or is exported to asia
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dairy is huge in upstate new york where did you live
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wew boy thats a question to start an argument the word ranching is typically used in the arid west where big herds of cattle are run on large tracts of marginal grazing land it takes a lot of ground to support cattle there because it is typically poor quality leased blm ground mainly open range cattle are branded for identification cattleman in the east usually raise crops and forages in addition to having a herd of cattle herds a smaller here and run on fenced pastures that are privately owned farmer is the typical term nobody calls themselves a rancher youd look like a tool if so there are exceptions to the rulelike the swamp cowboys in florida general rule do not call a rancher a farmer they dont like that eastern guys dont care but might make it clear that they grow crops too regardless raising cattle is an agricultural pursuit no matter what you call it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was just poking fun at a typo diary vs dairy but thanks for the info
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres a typo on the map diary versus dairy diary a book in which one keeps a daily record of events and experiences
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in idaho the ranchers are ok with being called farmers unless theyre the money ranchers that hire someone and sell their landowner hunting permits
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats a very informative post as a nonamerican thanks
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so you have a tobacco ranch jk thanks for such a detailed answer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,didnt even notice until it was pointed out twice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how about minnisota is it like a little version of the other one
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe its a new disney minnie mouse theme state

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it would be interesting to see net suicides abovebelow the global average to eliminate global health trends
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,underreporting in late or extra focus by the administration for some reason dont know if you edited or notmy fault for not reading what you wrote
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,gorbachev comes to power hey lets take a few years to see how this pans out four years later fuck it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sources yearly reports on httpwwwgksru httpdemoscoperuweeklyknigishkolshkolhtml made with inkscape the drop during early gorbachevs rule is taught to be caused by his antialcohol campaign
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i forgot they pretended someone besides putin was in charge for a while
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,imo you should plot the suicide rate as a line and leave the absolute numbers as bars at a glance it wasnt obvious what the two series were showing i assumed it was male vs female numbers of suicides before i read the axis labels i know people quibble with putting two presentation styles on the same chart but i think its helpful when showing two different quantities other than that this is a nicely presented chart especially as someone who works almost exclusively with excel charts p
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,recent russian suicide prevention commission report said that they cant trust official stats because suicides often reported as accidents and alcohol intoxications unofficial numbers suggest rising suicide rates in the recent years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as someone from russia im kind of surprised that yeltsin rates arent that higher than everyone else those where some dark times in russian history you can see why people who lived through endorse putin
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it was quite a shock to realise that the vertical axis does in fact begin at zero
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the only truly interesting thing here to me as a russian is the sharp rise under khrushchev i can only attribute it to the ptsd in wwii veterans otherwise it was space exploration peace communism in years a seven hour work day the thaw in internal politics and other inspiring stuff it would be interesting to look at the trend at that time in countries like the usa mdash what was going on there under brezhnev life was just steady so the plateau is not surprising andropov and chernenko did not rule long enough to make any difference gorbachev mdash yes perhaps the antialcohol program although it did not win any hearts and minds buying alcohol was a little bit more difficult plus there was a campaign not to use it openly at events like weddings but everybody who wanted to drink like depressed people was able to keep drinking plus it lasted for just about three years again not enough to change the mindset but gorby looked like a change for the better perhaps that inspired people not to off themselves for a while to see what would happen yeltsin mdash thats what happened again no surprise that people began killing themselves on a large scale when he has died recently the common feeling was a pity mdash a pity he went out peacefully and the climate in russia has never changed enough to execute or at least prosecute him and vlad is no surprise either mdash there is a huge difference in the quality of life in and people began seeing the light in the end of the tunnel and that light currently has the approval rating less than three years ago i had no clue in which order the colors went on the russian flag then the winter olympics and sudden realization you fuckers are out to get us yeah well see about that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,obviously its because he
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,about the spike during the yeltsin period i highly recommend reading it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,by comparison suicides in interesting downward trend in western europe us is pretty flat and russia is just reaching japan levels now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nine hours and nobody afaik has mentioned how the data is presented as the russian flag well let me tell you this nice little detail about this data its presented as the russian flag p
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you mapped that against standard of living you will probably find that correlates with the chart from to now as well i doubt it has much to do with who is running the country and more to do with wealthincome
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would be very interested to see why suicide rates seem to be leadership independent when looking at putins two terms i have noticed others in this thread have stated purposefully underreporting is the reason any fact to this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,before opening this thread i looked at the chart and based on the downward trend i guessed that leaded gas would have been banned years earlier in httptransportpolicynetindexphptitlerussiafuelsdieselandgasoline environmental lead really does seem to explain some larger trends for crime and violence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont get it why do we need two graphs wouldnt one of them be enough
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i want to add my cents here because why not ive noticed that the fall in suicides in the is right at the time of the chernobyl incident where young men were litteraly sacrificed to fill the nuclear reactor with sand a traumatising experience for the ussr nation i imagine and why this ticked in my head is more about valery legasov chief of the investigation committee of the chernobyl disaster he made the huge and honest report on the disaster but he comitted suicide by hanging himself on the second anniversary of the tragedy the main reason given for his suicide was he could not speak about the ussrs gov responsibilithy where they forbade even plant operators knowledge of previous accidents and known problems with reactor design i dont know if anyone will find this interesting or relevant but maybe this bit of historical context could explain a small part of this chart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for the soviet years is the suicide rate just in the russian sfsr or is it all of the ussr
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the first striking observation is that gorbachev gave many people hope of things improving
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there is no reason to show two different sets of data they scale the same way so just use two different y axes and spare us the mental hoop jumping required to differentiate your unnecessary data split
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,points of interest gorbachevs prohibition yeltsins peaks in and subsequent decrease significant increase in first putins term as a prime minister and president absent data this is important
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how many of them are actual suicides as opposed to being labeled suicides
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,am i reading this chart incorrectly or does it imply that the population has remained constant over the years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i may very well be the dull one here i look at this graph and see an objective number suicides which are then overlaid with russian leaders to me this data means absolutely nothing less than nothing actually if the inference is a causation between leaders and numbers of suicides the graph paints a massively deceptive picture lets add additional overlays such as world events economic well being quality of life access to firearms abundance of social programs religious state of affairs etc etc there are thousands of factors to consider when trending national issues like suicide i didnt see an article accompany the graph im accessing from my phone apologies if im missing a critical piece of information
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wonder how many were suicides and how many were actually legitimate suicides
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,usa rate is per the rate has been slowly climbing every year so were not far behind russia httpsafsporgaboutsuicidesuicidestatistics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i had a friend a classmate really one of those kinds of people you want to get to know more outside of class but never get a chance to who wanted to do more research into the russian population and substance abuse she was interning at a medical facility had lots of grants given to her bright future one day i found out she committed suicide i found out she wanted to do research on this kind if thing when i saw her work anniversary come up on linkedin a few months later i had linkedin shut down her account i still regret not knowing her
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the yeltsin era was also known as the wild west period of russia with thugs gangsters and racketeers operating unchecked by the police i have a feeling that many of these suicides were actually killings by the mob reported wrongly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,npr reported a few months back that russia stopped pain meds in late stages of cancerother illness care that has made suicides increase due to the suffering of those individuals
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wonder what it would like if it tailored to be a graph on suicides within the lgbt community
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this graph illustrates why putin is popular in russia despite how difficult it is for westerners to understand he has visibly improved the quality of life for the russians over the past decades quite substantially ultimately people care about voting and rights only so much put whatever value judgment you want into that statement but its true
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this graph is trying to imply that the presidentleader has an influence on the suicides rate and everyone is falling for it on a similar note here is a graph prooving that the decline of piracy has led to global warming httpsparrowismsocsrcfnethomepirateshtml
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,any chance there is an american version should we really thank obama or what
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a russian i feel like the recent figures are either padded or extremely underreported we actually have increasing suicide tendency among cancer patients due to the law that makes getting painkillers a bureaucratic hell and suicide prevention or treatment programs are as much as nonexistent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i guess a lot of people were upset about the soviet unions dissolution
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you thought the soviet union was bad the state of russia after it collapsed was worse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,except in the gorbachev era which may be due to under reporting there is no reasonable correlation between leader and suicide rate so why are the leaders names included in the graph it is a bit misleading
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whats the point of having two different scales for the same data it seems to only clutter it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is it too late to point out correlation is not causation this graph is fapping useless
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,putin made suicide puinishable by death wait for it ba da tiss
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont understand how the suicides could go up to out of during the isnt that like almost everyone committing suicide what happened during those spikes forgive me for being ignorant
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you know mr gorbachev the guy that ran russia for so long i am a firm believer that he would still be in power today if he had had that ugly purple thing taken off his head
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is it considered a suicide when people die of intentional drug overdoses
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did you take into account all the coughs nervously scuicides that happened in the early
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it seems to follow a natural curve except for maybe people thought that under gorbachev it would get better and then it didnt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not just about politics though the rest of the world and its advancements affect independently from politicians
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,russia became independent in does this graph include only data for russian part of ussr or whole ussr
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this kind of show what you would expect during the glasnost and persetroika suicides plummet with the uncertainty with the fall of the wall and later the whole empire they go up pobably lots of workers who put in the work for the soviet union all their life and then they retire they maybe dont get their promised pensions and perhaps they believed in communism economic and political uncertainty keep the rates high through out the and with the stability of putin they go down again a disclaimer is that its ofc impossible to know who has duked the stats to what degree but these numbers from the onward seem to fit together with the political realities as for the rise from the to i have no clue
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its always good to see rates like this going down in the last few years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow that spike in the early presumably when the soviet union collapsed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think some economic measure would tell more than the names of the leaders the trends here look very economy related
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im sure the majority of the suicides were men but for some reason nobody ever talks about that because sexism right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,looks like everyone who was going to commit suicide did so in the nobody left to volunteer in the
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,looks like my grandma isnt the only person who dreams of the days of gorbachev to return
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,very interesting as you approach real war the rates decrease and approach mental war the rates increase
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is still an incredibly high suicide rate even during the the average is per people russias had the highest suicide rate in and strangely it was disproportionately guys
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i guarantee the access to gamingcomputerinternetdistraction has saved many many lives
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,forgive the ignorance and being too lazy to google are the putins the same person or is it just a relatively common surname edit a letter
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yet gay bashing is skyrocketing under putins watch
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it shows us that russians got used to living out of their comfort zones
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theyre really putin those guns away and not killing themselves lately
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,usa rate is per the rate has been slowly climbing every year so were not far behind russia httpsafsporgaboutsuicidesuicidestatistics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,heres a graph of russian suicide rates from compared with rates globally in eastern europe as a whole and the us you can see that russias suicide rate bucks the global trend and is much higher than in the us but is pretty consistent with the eastern european rate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the antialcohol campaign that uhellerick mentioned was almost certainly important i dont have anything scientific to add but anecdotally i can tell you that a lot of people saw gorbachev as a major change from the status quo and so put a lot of faith in him theres a documentary called my perestroika that briefly discusses this totally worth a watch then the collapserevolution happened and everything got really awful for a while
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there was a relative feeling of optimism in russian when gorbachev took over the people saw perestroika as something to look forward to and that living conditions would improve relatively soon under his administration thats why it dips in the late when the ussr collapses in theres a huge spike due to the uncertainty and fear of the radical ideals of yeltsin and due to the major economic depression that followed immediately after the collapse of the ussr
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also the wall came down in the late perhaps people were more optimistic
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they had hope when gorbachev took over
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,gorbachev for a brief moment in time russians thought theyd get out from under the tyrants lately theyve been convinced that the tyrant is good for them i guess
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in soviet russia is also chernobyl and the war in afghanistan
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,chernobyl is ive noticed a few things and
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably more like the collapse of the ussr
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well yeltsin was a scary drunkard when putin came to power i remember thinking that at least he wasnt liable to start an international incident in a fit of drunken pique
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we do what we can
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,interesting ive never seen an australia shaped distribution before
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hey are the pre stats taken from the ussr or rsfsr
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,out of interest why did you decide to mark the presidents in power on the data feels like youre implying they had an impact possibly that putin has had a positive impact but if you look at the suicide rates for other countries you see a similar pattern of rises into the then declines after that you can even see that dip in the late in some us hungary canada
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he just switched from president to prime minister iirc he never stopped being the most primary public figure really and always controlled most everything but then i guess he got bored of being prime minister or something and decided fuck it amendment time lol no more term limits
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah america showing how its done bush clinton bush obama clinton
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it was the legal way to bypass the constitution liberals and the west had high hopes on medvedev but he wasnt more than a proxy of putin
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah dictatorships
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,finally somebody comments the style actually that was all i wanted to hear the opinion about truth be told i dont really care about the subject of the graph and i am somewhat annoyed by its popularity here yes i think youre right the graph makes you think that total number is higher than the rate which is wrong i was reluctant about using a line here because the last to years include the data for crimea they dont affect the overall result that much but still strictly speaking the values become incomparable and it wouldnt be correct present them as one line but since the influence for the suicide rate most likely is virtually negligible i guess it would be fine to use a line for it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not from russia but centraleastern europe where life is similarly hard for many people and an acquaintatnce of mine who is a doctor told me a story from his forensic pathology rotation back when he was a medical student they were doing an autopsy on a man hit by a train in an obvious suicide the medical examiner said that since there was no suicide note he would pass it off as an accident so the victims family would get the insurance money he said they did this all the time they essentially break the law so a complete stranger gets some money in hard times
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as soon as i saw the stats i figured this putin frequently lies his ass off and it makes sense he would doctor the numbers to make it look like russia doesnt still have a severe problem with alcoholism and suicide its still a crappy country to live in despite his nationalistic propaganda
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably many people who thought about suicide were killed by criminals before they could do it themselves im only half joking were hell
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,was there a time when russian history wasnt dark
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,really interesting and informative to see it from an insiders perspective thanks was gorbachev as popular there as he was in the west i had a chance to visit while he was in power and every time we mentioned perestroikaglasnost people always giggled i wasnt sure if it was because we pronounced the words funny or because they thought it was bs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,then the winter olympics and sudden realization you fuckers are out to get us yeah well see about that is this sarcasm or genuine if genuine why do you think this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what the hell happened to japan did pokémon games require sacrifices
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how do you think youll get accurate data on wealthincome in ussr everyone was fabulously wealthy how about that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my guess is the very strong economical growth under putin and medvedev higher quality of life and better outlook on the future means less depression and suicides
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,good question i guess just having the rate would be enough
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,indeed that would be fascinating i recently found out that us military suicides exceed combat deaths i was blown away by that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,high under clinton lower under bush highest under obama
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the russian sfsr
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,official figures are in in in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is the article you refer to and it claims nothing of the kind
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sure why not thanks obama
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cant find an american version per say but data shows a steady increase in suicides in the usa since the there has been a slightly larger increase in suicides since but if i had to guess that would be largely related to the economic crisis when the economy is bad people are more likely to commit suicide
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you sound like youre being sarcastic the fall of the soviet union was a disaster that ruined economies families etc httpsenwikipediaorgwikieconomyofrussiamediafilerussianeconomysincefallofsovietunionpng a slow reform wouldve been much better what happened was a mess
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its been estimated that in excess of million people died easily preventable deaths because of economic collapse and yeltsinera mismanagement in the
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well i am seeing plenty of correlation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,one is total the other is per capita one takes into consideration potential changes in total population the other does not a very important distinction in any populationwide issues on this time scale
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,per
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no the left scale is per so around people out of comitted suicide the right scale is the total number out of the total population per year which is still pretty insane
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats per hundred thousand its more detroit less the self purge
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,total not per
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,btw the guys official credential somebody removed the thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,suicide is deliberately killing yourself so intentionally taking drugs to kill yourself would be ruled a suicide
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it counts the russian part of the soviet union
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same person russia has a limit on consecutive terms as president so putin became the prime minister for the term of medvedev who most people think was his puppet then he became president again
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its the same person vladimir putin
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think they meant the dip as well as the overall trend of suicide rates rising until the and then dropping from onward
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the one phrase that sums up russian history fairly accurately and then things got worse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my perestroika never gonna stop give it up such a dirty mind i always get it up for the touch of the younger kind my my my ayeaye woo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it was a coup not a revolution
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i find it funny how this is even in question life in soviet russia really was pretty bleak and hopeless people really hoped gorbachev would change things for the better in the late instead the russian state collapsed and things became even worse for a time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do you really think the anti alcohol campaign is the reason for the drop serious question
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the wall came down at the end of just before that massive spike
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,chernobyl is soviet ukraine not russia
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,gorbachev early is when we were expecting wonderful new age gorbachev late is then wonderful new age came
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably more like the beginning of the as its widely accepted as an end of the modern period chernobyl marks a period of time when people rethink and discuss if the systems they knew till then as trustworthy are really things that they can count on chernobyl collapse of ussr collapse of berlin wall its like a curtain closes in front of your eyes in slow motion only difference is that youre not only the audience but also the actor at the same time the following years were bound to be both dramatic and also creative
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah he just did it in a cool and collected manner
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they call it the ausson distribution
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there never really was a term limit the constitution just states that you cant be president for more that consecutive terms so its all legal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he got pissed about libya which happened under medvedev iirc the plan was not to come back so fast
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,calling it now chelsea clinton makes a bid in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also canadas current prime minister justin trudeau is the son of one of our former prime ministers pierre elliot trudeau
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,political dynasties unlimited terms now to be fair im not a big fan of political dynasties but still you are making a false equivalence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hillary is a rodham not a clinton there is nothing dynastic about electing the former wife of a president
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why is the number of absolute suicides important here isnt everything we need to know data wise baked into the rate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id maybe just plot the rate as a line and forget the bars im not sure how much info the raw s add here and you could use actual year numbers on the x axis with less clutter
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im going to be honest i saw this graf and was so mad it was on rall that i went in here to upvote anything that said it was a horrible dataillustration i still do not know what the bars relate to if i was you i would have made it two lines instead of blocks it would more clearly show a trend i would let the red numbers go to instead of cutting them of at i would have cut all the smal extra lines out theyre like the artistry in baroch very decorative but made for studying not simplicity cut the s on the years and remove the change in background colour the presidents names needs to be done something to i do not know what but something change the on the right to text center the left text make it more clear what you want to show i am still confused what this is supposed to show the correlation between how many people per and how many people in russia committed suicide a given year the more i look at this the more confused i am how is this data beatiful the illustration of it is definitely not i hope you have a great day and try to implement some of my suggestions id love to see a new version
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i thought is was male and female based on the colors used
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,truth be told i dont really care about the subject of the graph if youre doing data visualization you should always care about that you have a responsibility to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i also consider statistics that dont align with my preconceptions to be all falsified
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well first there isnt that much nationalistic propaganda no more than in america and second its not that bad here after the recent crisis calmed down its quite well thank you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in the economy was booming it was a pretty good time for russia
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,gorbachev is absolutely hated today and was hated at least since the moment hes lost his position in the last months of his presidency he was widely seen as a moron and a ball dropper so the only question here is when this feeling has started id say that in he was still seen with interest and inspiration but was when hell began no sympathy for him since that time people likely giggled because of your accent and the fact that you knew these words you could say babushka and get the same reaction especially given that you put stress on the second vowel it should be on the first one perestroika and glasnost were kind of seen like bs because russians traditionally see any government initiative as either suspicious or bs the programs themselves were interesting but people waited to see practical results and practical results were not that helpful for an average russian plus all this was force fed again like any government initiative in russia people resisted
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the coverage of the olympics was vile intentionally deceptive i was not interested in politics much and this was the first time i saw that there could be a concert of intentional lies aimed at smearing a country my country in this case this was later reenforced during the events we all know about and at present despite reaching sky high levels its not even surprising anymore its a fact of life i am not talking about criticism of russia i am talking about intentional lies on a giant scale and with dangerous consequences look at the countries it was previously applied to afghanistan iraq libya syria iran etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the soviets collected lots of economic data in the and every other decade the accuracy is probably suspect but so is data from the putin regime
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which is why i said you start from the the point is i call bullshit on that graph which is trying to imply it has something to do with who is running the country under putin for example oil prices have been at record highs and russia has never been more wealthy has nothing to do with anything that putin is doing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeppretty sad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a slow reform would also be stopped much more easily if anything went wrong and would give a lot more time for reactionary communists i guess it can happen to fight it and potentially reverse it its easy to criticise the way it was done but there arent clear better solutions the slow reform is somewhat contingent on domestic political cooperation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow only now i understand the graph i assumed red and blue referred to male and female with the scales on the left and right perfectly lining up i didnt realize it was actually two different things
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,except the part where everything has gotten steadily better for the last twenty years but it must be that putin only wins elections through fraud
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or more specifically and then a revolution happened and things got worse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this would imply that russia was really great like hundreds of years ago and is now currently the worst its ever been i honestly dont see russia as being much different than a lot of countries it has a super crisis then things kinda gradually get better for a while and then theres another super crisis and then things gradually improve until the next super crisis and so on you can look at the last century of russian history through precisely this lens super crisis because of revolution civil war major famine then things slowly but gradually get a little better over the course of the and then bam another catastrophic famine in stalins great purge from world war where russia probably suffered more than any other country besides maybe poland then things slowly started getting better because of destalinization the economy grew pretty rapidly from then theres a bit of an economic stagnation during the and well call this a mini crisis then perestroika happens which is a major improvement then the government collapses in theres attempted coups economy does very poorly in the early huge rise in suicide alcoholism unemployment and aids and then things have gotten slowly a little better ever since
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why did weird al never do this was it too cerebral oh right he had already done my bologna and it was no longer topical
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,mm not really there was an attempted coup to restore the ussr during that time but it failed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,eh most people dont know much about the ussr beyond their personal perceptions of communism as a system with all the high blown political discourse its easy to forget that its a real place with real people living there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cannot judge i just visualize the data the campaign was serious at the time to have few drinks at your on wedding you had to invent some secret scheme for it and in crimea gorbachev still is hated for ordering to chop down their vineyards
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,suggests that restriction of vodka sales is strongly associated with reduced suicide rates in russia
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,alcohol is a major depressant it definitely had an influence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it is very unlikely this prohibition does not really fit the drop prohibition was drop is of course this it may be that prohibition caused drinking to remain lower for and due to a shortage of alcohol for those years caused by the removal of vineyards etc during prohibition and i dont know when in it started if it was late then that would explain the high rates however the main reason i believe it to be a spurious correlation is that towards the end of there was also a major campaign against alcohol which banned spirits strongly restricted the sale of wines and although much less strongly beer this cannot be seen on the above graph at all if the cause of the drop were caused by the prohibition the i would have expected it to show as a smaller but nonetheless present drop in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the leading cause of death in russia is vodka httpwwwpbsorgnewshourrundownstudysuggestsvodkaleadingcausedeathamongrussianmen
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,prime raskhistorians material
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,couldnt remember exactly what year more alcohol it is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you know its not making any difference at all even if this infographic only shows rsfsr data chernobyl had a great impact on all ussr you can see impacted territories here it a little bigger that ukraine every ussr republic participated in the liquidation of this accident it was also a huge hit for the economics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wonderful new age the fall of the ussr wasnt pretty and left the entire soviet bloc damaged and now putin is dictator
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,usually presidentsgovernors retire after two consecutive terms under such a limit i think thats what the people who put that in there expected nobody thought that somebody would build up such a massive power base that they could keep the de facto president under their thumb for an entire term and then send that guy scuttling off meekly while they returned to their throne under normal circumstances the next president would build up his own power base and it would be difficult for the old guy to waltz in and topple them especially just shoo him and make him no again like putin did i cant really think of any state that has such a rule in which thats happened
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,michelle obama obviously going to run for something down the road too and george prescott bush jebs son texas railroad commissioner which is a stepping stone to governor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rthedonald already has ivanka threads
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fuckkkk that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cant believe we have a pm named justin
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats not the same thats the first ever time that has happened
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,political dynasties arent any better in fact they might be worse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not really it is also a buddy system
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre being very generous you could refer to it as an oligarchy it is not much better than putins flavor of democratic dictatorship
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its still not exactly great to have political dynasties in a democracy families have friends and businesses which they might want to protect
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this there would only be a need to show absolute and rate separately if that told an interesting story i see nothing interesting choose one
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i thought op was indirectly referring to all the politics discussed here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yep data is meaningless on its own therefore visualizations are also meaningless without a specific effort to show otherwise
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks i am not a putin fan but the level of anti putin propaganda is so ridiculous that i am ending up defending him up what does it say about his opponents if they are even worse than him
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in the case of russia there is a good reason to think the numbers are doctored though the same thing was done in east germany for example in the and
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im laughing at the previous comments most westerners are incredibly stupid in regards to views on propaganda in other countries vs americauk etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we americans are certainly desensitized to a lot of our nationalistic propaganda ie promilitary tributes at our american football games but russia under putin unambiguously has far more intense nationalism and propaganda even the were weak and victimized by the evil west is a form of nationalistic propaganda theres nothing in mainstream us politics even vaguely like for example i guess if trump were elected wed see crazy stuff like that but under adult leadership no
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lol you recently accused the belgians of bombing civilians in syria even though the evidence contradicts it the propaganda machine is still going
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there is way more nationalistic bullshit in russia remember soldiers on vacation that kind of obvious bullshit would never fly in the us in the us they at least try to be believable
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not op but as a swede i have to say fuck him americans are the best at doing terrible shit hide those problems and yell the highest when someone else does something bad i dont like you guys spying on our military on gotland though plz stop
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,uhwhat i mean aside from the holmodor and all the purges
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oil prices bottomed out in the which is why there is so much hatred of yeltsin and gorbachev if oil prices go back under and stay there for a decade we will probably see similar hatred of putin as the russian economy sinks back into a long depression conservatives in the us like to credit reagan for defeating the soviet union but it was really low oil prices that destroyed the soviet economy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,naive question would you be alright with clarifying a bit more on what was occurring in particular or a website that pointed these things out if not have a good day regardless
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is interesting when it comes to the reporting on the sochi olympics what liesstories are you referring to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i completely agree with you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well obviously there are no babies left to eat now gonna have to settle for babiushkas tough and chewy meat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,found the russian
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,things can get better while there is also its not an eitheror situation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not that hard to win if you imprison poison or leave penniless everyone who competes with you for power
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ok look no one is denying putin isnt a popular leader and its the russians choice if they want to live under someone like that and to an extent he has been a great leader for russia especially when compared to their history but that doesnt mean that he is good or isnt hurting his country as well a better leader and a fairer economy that didnt focus on making a few people rich off of resources money at the expense of many others could have truly transformed russia instead of making their economy dependent on the price of oil and gas
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,definitely not twenty years but the last or so have been much better the were a very bad time for russia
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,doesnt he win by a stunning landslide of of the vote
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the whole world has gotten much more stable putin just another right wing strong man
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,century entirely the quality of life improved across the board the entire century in the ussr
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also sharona has syllables while perestroika has five
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do what exactly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i googled real quick and found that the lowest value during that time coincided with a pretty significant drop in registered crimes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that is a very humble stance to take
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,correlation doesnt imply causation but it does offer a very believable answer to the question
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cannot judge i just visualize the data i wish more people were like this pragmatic and trying to follow the truth although it is true that correlation doesnt necessarily mean causation but it is still a refreshing thought rather than ideological views that can be based purely on fantasy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes but the problem for russia is that if you make alcohol harder to get even making it more expensive is often enough people will simply drink moonshine booze which is very popular in russia and that may be even more dangerous edit a soviet joke a soviet man is waiting in line to purchase vodka from a liquor store but due to restrictions imposed by gorbachev the line is very long the man loses his composure and screams i cant take this waiting in line anymore i hate gorbachev i am going to the kremlin right now and i am going to kill him after minutes the man returns and elbows his way back to his place in line the crowd begin to ask if he has succeeded in killing gorbachev no i got to the kremlin all right but the line to kill gorbachev was even longer than here edit very recommendable wikipedia article about httpsenwikipediaorgwikirussianpoliticaljokes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also makes you less inhibited so easier to go through with it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,alcohol being depressant doesnt mean it makes you sadder it means it depresses lowers something neurotransmission levels
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it is a depressant in the fact that it depresses the central nervous system it doesnt give you clinical depression
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,being a central nervous system depressant doesnt mean it makes you depressed sorry if thats not what you mean but ive heard this fallacy applied to alcohol and other depressants edit should have read the other replies first as usaafine already pointed this out i do have to correct the last part of his comment though alcohol is classified as a depressant because the receptor it interacts with as a positive allosteric modulator of the gabaa receptor is inhibitory not excitatory it causes an increase in gaba and has a depressant effect on the central nervous system
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,alchol plus very few hours of sunshine in winter equals extra suicides happens in every northern country
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you realised something being a depressant doesnt mean it makes you depressed right it just means it depresses some signals in your nervous system yes it can indirectly cause depression but thats from the social aspects of alcoholism not by any proven physiological mechanism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what a depressant is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats what they taught in dare but its not true what a surprise
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,congratulations on your ability to read sarcasm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pretty sure he was being sarcastic
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,left the entire soviet bloc damaged left russia damaged but most countries are now economically far better off and more people in those countries now lead far better lives russia is just now turning around due to severe mismanagement and corruption but slovakia the czech republic poland kazakhstan etc are much much better off now and most of the countries which are either about the same or worse off are stagnated often because of russias meddling look at the ukrainewell on its way towards economic revitalization over the next century but russia invades and now the countrys future is in turmoil same can be said for georgia rapid economic development and liberalization following the rose revolution and then russia invades them and occupies some of their territory to prevent the expansion of nato
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to be fair id rather live under putin over gorbachev
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the person you responded to was also talking about russia what they said would be incorrect for us presidents
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,george p isnt the railroad commissoner httpwwwrrcstatetxusaboutuscommissionerscommissionerlist and the last time an exrailroad commissioner became governor was in the

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what do you have against the name justin
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats such a ridiculous thing to even think
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i never made a judgement of value personally i feel like what is better depends on the countrys individual circumstances chinas government is not democratic but has done a better job of getting china on its feet than i think a democracy could have done however i think democracy is better when your country is fairly well off and you want to make the government more stable and accountable in the case of americas political dynasties i think that is mainly a result of system problems with the way we run our elections versus a problem with liberal democracy in general i dont think political dynasties are a good thing but i would rather have a meh democracy than a nondemocratic system at least given americas current state
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not sure youve really thought through the potential dangers of allowing unlimited terms
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you mean that there is a club of political elites i think that is probably true in most places
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yet the opposing candidate goes on and on about the russian threat america does the exact same thing in demonizing the country
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if russia had placed missiles in mexico directed at the us as the us has done in poland you would probably see a more comparable defensive nationalism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,were weak and victimized by the evil wes i have never actually met someone who thinks that way patriotism is on the rise yes but its not nationalism just yet people see the recent crisis as a tempering of russian self sustainability because all those sanctions they really made russia stronger less dependent on import my point is while there are cases of nationalism everywhere russia isnt too different from others
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as far as i know russian military has radars recording everything going on in the area but i havent heard anything about the belgians and you have to remember that government and people are two different parts of the country we is not the people nationalism only works when people believe it if not it just doesnt have the power
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dawid has a point nationalism is a matter of perspective america believes russia is the worse enemy because theyre americans russians believe america is the worse enemy because theyre russians both sides have conflicting agendas and objectives but both are technically after the same thing to be top dog thats why theres so much random chest thumping and finger pointing its especially ironic when john kerry claimed you cant just invade a country under completely trumped up pretences when years before just after was suddenly a chance to invade iraq and depose saddam under the wmd excuse despite of the attackers being saudi and none of them being iraqi at all you dont call that obvious bullshit as an excuse to invade
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,everyone who is a patriot wants to believe this but neither russia nor us is honest to their people this presidential race of ours is proof of us politics and the media are in bed and that only means lies and double standards
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yea i wouldnt say a nation that has its children swear allegiance to their flag routinely in school is lacking nationalistic bullshit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we made a mistake and killed a lot of people right so much more believable everyone loves themselves compared to the average nationalism russia isnt sticking out ukraine with all the bandera and right sector is saudi arabia and most other islamic countries too russia no
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in god we trust all others we monitor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,stop being so hypocritical sweden is one of the closest partners in helping the us spy on russia most large countries spy on most other countries germany despite being one of the primary crusaders against american spying on allies was recently caught spying on their allies as well this all has been going on since before world war i the snowden leaks just happened to reveal the uss spying first since he was leaking american documents getting mad as though the us is in any way special in spying on everyone is ignoring the reality of the situation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,syria and russia bomb a city war crime usa and britain bomb a different city regeime change liberation freedom it is an invasion what russia are doing in syria is entirely the same as the us but of course your everyday americanbrit doesnt look at the situation logically the propaganda and the peoples willingness to accept it is staggering it is the us in fact whom are funding arming supporting isis here we have a presidential candidate who proposes anti fly zone in syria which is more or les declaring war with russia who has stated she would be prepared to wage war with russia or china and yet trump who wishes to build relations with russia is the more dangerous of the two this is fucking ludicrous
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,americans spy on their own law abiding citizens you think they would stop spying on foreign militaries
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,holodomor only correcting because the poster below you used the same spelling
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeltsin was a widely known drunkard he grabbed the power and milked it while it lasted like many other crooks in the i was quite young then so my opinion isnt worth much but i dont think ive ever seen any people from the older generation who speak fondly of him
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in a random order some are menial things but they were carefully collected together in the for example fashion painting russians as habitual retards nah lets start with a big thing some travel agency bitch in canada writing that homosexual pdas were illegal in russia and gay athletes or spectators would be arrested yes this was the first ring since it was even before the olympics why even homosexuality is not illegal in russia and gays can kiss hold hands whatever i dont even know why i have to explain this this was huge on reddit by the way tbh ive got my first account here because of that removed it later because i was sick of this then got this one when it became clear it was not a single case of canadian lunacy while we are on the subject the olympics start nobody gets arrested mdash pity eh then some gay guy runs into traffic with the rainbow flag the police naturally drag him away from the road mdash here we are for example oh wait before that some kind of an lgbt book foreign visitors were supposed to buy and smuggle into russia in their underwear because gay books were banned in russia thats probably the moment russians got this unhealthy interest for how it was covered abroad corruption everywhere when you start reading mdash they just parrot our local cuckoos no independent research nothing specific billion dollars in the hole the olympics were actually profitable for the state it got million dollars more than it spent although that was not the goal or point rusty water theyve built scores of brand new hotels in russia nobody lived there yet a foreign journalist comes turns the tap on its rusty water yes bitch its rusty water because nobody lived in your room ever because all piping in russia is iron and if you dont run water for a few days the next time you turn it on it will be rusty for seconds because rust because iron this has nothing to do with water quality its fine or piping quality its fine too or quality of life when you come to a building where the tap was not tapped for a few days youll have rusty water for seconds yet this glass of rusty water was turned into the official mascot of the games in the west same thing a public bathroom two stalls the wall between the stalls is missing for reasons unknown you can clearly see it was there there is a shadow on the wall another mascot this is how russians go to bathrooms two toilets per stall quick loss of interest for the games themselves as soon as it became clear the russians would get most medals the paraolympic games were completely ignored just look at the first results in google for winter olympics russia thats the top results and how many there are positive none
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes but if you get through the tough part theres another smaller one inside
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the kremlin does punish dissenting journalists sometimes even kills them but putin still is very popular with most russians even if there were no vote rigging he would probably win by landslides the fact is putins style and agenda are fairly popular
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which probably means he does have a more informed perspective on how his country feels about their leader ja
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah no fan of putin but if its him vs yeltsin then im not sure theres a contest even with oil prices going up at the time hell even solzhenitsyn liked putin
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fucking russians coming in here interfering with our narrative about russia
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its weird because im absolutely certain putin would win by a landslide in a fair election in russia but for some reason they still go out of their way to pump up the numbers probably for more party strength and less accountability russians as a whole really like strongmen in charge
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but bologna has seventeen syllables
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im only counting four in perestroika am i pronouncing it incorrectly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,perestroika instead on perestroika you just shoe horn it like a hack
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,alcohol is related to more than half of all violent crimes us at least
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it all kind of makes sense when a liquor store opens crime in the surrounding half mile radius goes up noticeably and the surrounding blocks substantially
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you plum smuggling son of a bitch thats pretty cool
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which could mean it was a result of public policy it could still also be a result of altering reports
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats the essence of correlation is not causation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe the suiciders just drank bad moonshine and died of methanol poisoning
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my cousin was a teen in the late she tells me lots of stories about life in russia at the time one thing that really shocked me was her story about how people would eat shoe polish to get that kick basically theyd smear a thick layer of shoe polish on a piece of bread and let it sit for a day then theyd scrape the gunk off the top and eat the bread that has all the chemicals and shit soaked into it i dont know how prevalent that was but i believed her when she told me about it edit also people would shave a spot on their heads put shoe polish on it wear a knit hat and get high that way as well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it is still harder to get even with moonshine
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah the classic bottle of jack daniels a hand gun in the bathroom scene
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,alcohol can worsen depression unlike other depressants thats why benzodiazepine abuse is so different from alcohol abuse its also important to note that depression isnt necessarily associated to sadness
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sure makes me sadder especially when i drink lots of it before noon so i dont do that anymore still sad but sober so i can drive and shit now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it can though especially if you are predisposed to depression emotions are a product of neurotransmission source my psych after explaining to me she wasnt as worried about recreational drug use as she was my regular bar habit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,glad someone said this important distinction that alcohol is a neurotransmitter depressant not a psychological depressant there might be some sort of correlation but not definitely not the same thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the people responding to you dont seem to get what youre saying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is true and the old myth about gin mothers ruin making people sad is just that a myth but theres definitely strong links between depression and alcoholism and its not obvious that its simply situational depression from the destructive aspects of alcohol abuse we dont have a clear understanding of the neuroscience because were talking about complex behaviour not just a simple depressant effect but anyone who has any experience with alcoholism and depression knows that they exacerbate one another and in the context of this data thats whats important
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpwwwmoodoceancoukhtmlneurotransmittershtml jeeze a lot of you guys dont like the truth eh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,suicide not being happy not being happy substance abuse correlation or causation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for educating him and everyone else on what a depressant is then since you made a useless comment and then downvoted me for calling you out on it ill provide helpful information for anyone who is curious a httpsenwikipediaorgwikidepressant or central depressant is a drug that lowers neurotransmission levels which is to depress or reduce arousal or stimulation in various areas of the brain depressants are also occasionally referred to as downers as they lower the level of arousal when taken
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for what reason though the ussr under gorbachev was a frightful time but very little of it was actually his fault russia under putin is less so frightful but is deeply the fault of putin
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,arguably all of the big decisions in period came from putin to be honest
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,source i am russian could you explain what the intended difference is between the roles of pm and president in your government
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lets be fair the bill came from the kgb even if putin were to get hit by a meteor tomorrow it the kgb would just pick out a new figurehead
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,delusion is a powerful narrative
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,shrug theres a long history of people insisting they wont run for something until they are suddenly convinced to do so for example paul ryan and the speakership despite what axelrod and others have said i dont think she would be as public of a figure as she is if she didnt plan on running for something shes chosen to do things in the public eye that other first ladies did not could very well be wrong but just my gut feeling we shall see
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wasnt aware it was an old name thats strange it probably had a different meaning back then although im speaking completely subjectively so im full of shit like why is justin even bad i just thought it was funny
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he had a smokin hot wife too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not op but it sounds like a young persons name
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im sorry justin i dont know man just seems a bit millennialish and lacking authority my name is chad that sounds even worse obama is weird but he gets a pass for originality
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you made quite a big leap from unlimited terms to a lack of democracy to be honest plenty of genuine democracies have no termlimits my country doesnt and it hasnt suffered for it but i would rather have a meh democracy than a nondemocratic system at least given americas current state speaking of false equivalence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,putin got voted in too as did hitler just because a democracy produces a winner doesnt mean the democracy is healthy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,like when they put nuclear warheads in cuba
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think he was referring to the existence of propaganda i too think that propaganda in these times is much harder that is pushing agendas still happens but its harder to control it whether people will believe the governments crap or that of some random twitter celebrity is entirely up to luck
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,americans were ready to believe anything after the gun was loaded and hammer pulled we just needed a target that being said americans have mostly learned from how much of a disaster iraq was and now treat the government with a lot more skepticism not enough but i dont see another wmd excuse working again
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes it is more believable mistakes always happen during a war soldiers on vacation accidentally invading and annexing a part of another country thats beyond absurd its like russia thinks we are all retards
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if we could monitor god we totally would though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lots of great world leaders were drunkards churchill roosevelt and stalin were all drinking heavily when they defeated hitler yeltsin was mainly hated because the economy was shit when he was in office
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,huh well i want to thank you for responding to my post it was very informative and i appreciate that you responded in detail to my question i must admit i should have looked into it more myself before asking because all i had to do was edit my searches more to find them with ease and yeah you are not wrong i want to apologize to you for being so lazy and only starting to read and look it up now yet again thank you for your time and have a great day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and then things got worse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when you control the media and kill anyone who voices an opposing opinion winning elections is easy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes and no there is brainwashing inside the country too and its effective personally i think oil prices had more effect on this than country leadership
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or has more propoganda blasted at him than he knows how to sift through
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people feel about their leader exactly how mass media tells them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeltsin was an alcoholic and basically just wanted someone who would not arrest him for the crony capitalism of the that bankrupted the country i seem to recall that his net worth was huge when he left office despite having only worked legitimately as president since the end of communism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,haaaahahahaha noice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oscar mayer is four syllables
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you are rightthere is only four syllables in the word перестройка
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i pronounced it with a heavy russian accent just to see and it feels more natural if you add an extra syllable emphasising the i perestroyeeka but i think syllables is right though the extra syllable is probably unrequired but maybe thats why they counted five its the only place i can think of to add an extra syllable that makes sense at any rate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its probably the most dangerous drug at least among popular ones
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,then why does everyone say everything went to shit when the us has the prohibition serious question
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yea but people related to violent crimes are probably more likely to be from a social context with high rates of substance abuse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,really sounds interesting sauce
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think that depends on where the liquor store opens up i live in a suburb of nashville and there is a really nice liquor store less than a quarter mile from my place and there is zero crime
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think this is the biggest problem i have with reddit when theres a very clear event of a law being passed and immediate drops in crime and suicide reddit will quickly jump on the correlation ≠ causation train if they dont like the concept of the law but at the same time the majority of reddit will blindly agree to any study that suggests a correlation with unleaded gasoline or abortion and lowered crime rates decades down the line
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the whole deadly levels of methanol common in moonshine mainly stems from when the us government ordered the industrial ethanol supply which was being diverted to drinking alcohol be denatured with methanol during prohibition
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,bear vodka
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,makes buttchugging seem normal by comparison
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,jesus fucking christ
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the vice article is morbidly fascinating
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this makes sucking dick for crack seem completely respectable
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,bottle of bodka and tokarev comrade
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for those who lack the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme alcohol produces effects that are completely unpredictable once unprocessed alcohol passes the blood brain barrier it begins bonding with dopamine creating a variety of chemicals some of which are shaped a lot like an opiate so they fit into the opiate receptor causing addiction and they deplete dopamine causing depression put the two together and you get an endless spiral of addiction and depression
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,good to hear bitchcuntmcniggerfag good to hear
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,obviously alcohol dependency is highly linked to depression however being a depressant refers to physiological response not psychological many cns depressants are used to treat psychiatric disorders as well conditions like epilepsy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people downvoting you out of denial my mum works in psych at the hospital i know that doesnt mean im a doctor too and shes talked to me about how it works alcohol absolutely can lead to depression if not done in moderation and does affect brain chemistry the same way stimulants affect chemistry dopamine etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,from being in therapy for severe starting in childhood depression i know that they do a family tree where they ask about history of depression and manicdepressive among your relations and also about history of alcoholism to sort of assess how much of a genetic component vs situational aspects there is to your illness the way it was explained to me was that the alcoholism was considered a strong indicator that the person was an untreated andor undiagnosed depressive attempting self treatment bc the link between the two conditions was so strong the thinking seems to be more that depressive illness increases the rate of alcoholism vs the alcoholism being the causal factor for the depression of course alcoholism is going to make any existing tendency towards depression worse but the way it was explained to me the current thinking seems to be that the mood disorder is the primary illness with the alcoholism more of a symptom and aggravating factor and then of course living in an alcoholic family could also cause depression under the environmental theory leaving genetics out of it altogether butanyway it is a very complex relationship and very strong correlation between the two conditions and is probably a big stew of both genetics and dysfunctional nurture
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a feedback loop actually
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,substance abuse does not equal being unhappy necessarily lets say i have a otherwise good life but substance x just makes me feel really good and i would rather take it than do other things lets say substance x is ketamine given how enjoyable ketamine is i could easily abuse it even if my other circumstances are good and i am happy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but very little of it was actually his fault i didnt give a reason but i would definitely prefer to live under putin that gorby not saying its gorbys fault but id still rather
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not a specialist in constitutional law but the president governs the country and assigns the pm the pm deals with the ministers and is in charge of the budget all of the laws and government decisions go through the president and he can also veto stuff which the pm cant
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there is no kgb anymore btw in ussr kgb was analogue more to us fbi not cia as depicted in popular western culture now in russia there are several structures some of them have significant separation by federal states because russia population is very heterogeneous so no russia isnt different in this aspect from most of the other countries there is no single mysterious shadow council that could replace president
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also obama is his last name
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you realise that at some point you need a new rotation of middle agedold white men right theyre not going to be called barnaby tobias and winston forever
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly and the us nearly started a nuclear war over it yet thats exactly what is happening at the moment in eastern europe
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes that is a perfect example
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yet when it comes to israel you claim the stupidest things theres a beam in your eye
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for now well have to settle with monitoring all those who believe in a god and those who dont just everyone really
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not every dictator is despised
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you had constant corruption and internal war would you respect the guy to come in and stop it all regardless of how he got into power the end of internal conflict is more important than a fair election to many from the outside looking in you could argue that each usamerican election is just as corrupt its not so much about the person running for president but the amount of funds they can muster combined with how they can push the agendas behind those funds while at the same time smiling and saying it is for the good of the people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im no fan of putin but when you compare his russia vs just about the entire century you can understand why many russians dont seem to mind giving him some leeway
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when you take an economy that is literally and shambles and build it up to a respectable power then the people like you you guys really need to take a good hard look at who the brainwashed people are
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well in us with the media it is not extremely different
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well i mean we could equally say that you are brainwashed to think putin is much worse than any normal politican im not saying hes an angel hes far from it but his actions are definitely overblown by some news outlets building a rhetoric and im not russian and i dont think putin is great either but i dont think these hardline attitudes do anyone any good
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,us is wayyyy more brainwashed than russia is americans have been watching their face exposed arms exposed legs exposed tan cloth wearing soldiers get massacred in third world countries for the last years without interruption but almost no one cares enough to do anything about it america is a strange place where the people literally think their government is going to do good things for them russian people know that the government is not your friend the gov is always a compromise of finding the best possible situation vladimir putin is by far the best possible politician in the world
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,putin has an estimated net worth of billion dollars
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i only remember yeltsin as a guy who kisses everyone source not russian
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think he was going off of oscar mayer has a way with bologna hows that for but yeah oscar mayer is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,one of buddhisms moral precepts is to not consume alcohol or other intoxicants exactly because it makes you unmindful and causes you to do dumb things that create bad karma
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,alcohol significantly lowers inhibition so substance abuse feeds back to more violent crimes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,please be aware that alcohol despite being legal and socialy accepted is one of the most destructive and addictive substance out there even more than some things commonly considered drugs like weed for instance
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yea but alcohol is statistically definitely the more violent of the most popular drugs source alcoholic family
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpresourcesprevorgdocumentsalcoholviolencegruenewaldpdf
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no no no a liquor store is a store that sells a variety of prepackaged alcoholic beverages sure it can be easy to blame a rise in crime on sauce use but i have yet to see a study that shows a correlation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do a websearch on liquor stores and crime or something this is just one of the first of many results that come up httpwwwdrugfreeorgnewsservicestudyfindslinkbetweennumberofneighborhoodliquorstoresandyouthhomicides its sort of common knowledge which is why the alcohol industry is feeding lots of money into antimarijuana campaigns in the states that have recreational use on the ballot this election the alcohol lobbies are using the same scare tactic regarding dispensaries and such but the arguments are foolish because they hyperbolize what will still be a townregulated policy and obviously they are two very different drugs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but i like alcohol so it cant be that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it is not a reddit thing but a human thing people always find reasons to dismiss data that doesnt jive with their beliefs but hold fast to the ones that do
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i agree with the sentiment that reddit likes to be hypocritical at times in what they sayupvote but gorbachev did make quite a few sweeping policy changes and to attribute if to just one and not take the whole body of changes into account would be unfair it doesnt seem very clear to me because a lot more happened then that would make it not
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to be fair switching to unleaded gasoline is very likely explanation to at least part of the decrease in violent crimes during the in populated areas as exposure to lead is known to cause physiological changes in the brain and incite violent behavior
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its because reddit is on that banning things only lead to more crime redirect which makes no sense they cant fathom the point that banning alchohol leads to less alchohol related deaths
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i agree we all love confirmation bias however your abortion analogy is not a good one the effects of abortion clearly would be years later when potential criminal behavior is possible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,data doesnt happen in a vacuum we have a law being passed then an immediate massive drop in reported suicides from a government known to be less than honest with reporting its not hypocritical to suggest that immense drop for years which then returns to the previously observed trend might be due to juking the numbers rather than any real impact from the law in fact its rather dishonest to dismiss that significant possibility
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,evidence linking alcohol particularly binge drinking and crime is extremely robust in the data reddit is just stupid when it comes to statistics even in rscience example particularly almost every dataset you can find shows significant jumps in crime using agerestricted legal access to alcohol as a regression discontinuity these jumps are almost entirely driven by increased crime in individuals with no previous criminal history source was research assistant for an economist specializing in alcohol drugs and crime can dig up some papers when i have more time later tonight if anyone is interested
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yea but it wouldnt be super out of character for official reports like that to be doctored in soviet russia i dont really know much about the administration during the but there were serious discrepancies between actual progress that was being made increased factory output or the effectiveness of an antialcohol campaign maybe and how effective the reports listed their efforts to be for the soviets earlier in their history
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not saying youre wrong about typical reddit behavior but the issue here is that you simply cannot trust the selfreporting of a communist dictatorship look at the dprk for a good modern example if such a government says that they are going to implement new policy x to solve countrywide problem y you can rest assured that next year all their data will show how great of a success their program has been this is true for any dictatorship in the modern era this is why freedom of the press and freedom of speech are so damn important
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,erm no you know that when you distile alcohol you will have a bit of methanol that you will need to get out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that phenotype is super uncommon in russia for obvious reasons
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the reason alcohol has an effect in the first place is because it passes the blood brain barrier regardless of alcohol dehydrogenase status bonding with dopamine like chemically reacting with the neurotransmitter dopamine alcohol can cause addiction and depression but the other information is incorrect
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my family is like percent celtic decent as the stereotype goes there is raging alcoholism all through generations of my family is this kind of genetic mutation and altered response to alcohol more common among the irish because that would explain an awful lotserious question
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,true but your response conveys a much deeper understanding of how this works than the original comment of this thread which unlike your response in its original context seemed to dispute that depressants could cause depression
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was just eye rolling at the absolute lack of understanding necessary to state that alcohol cant make people depressed because it just lowers neurotransmission fuck do you even understand what you just said all emotions thoughts and desires are products of firing synapses affecting neurotransmission is the actual mechanism of action for most antidepressants but no alcohol cant affect your emotional state because obv all it does is lower some silly brain chemical s smh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it sure is you drink to avoid the pain but avoidance only makes things worseas well as the thoughts and actions when drunk which causes more pain so you drink more more pain avoidance more pain more drink more pain more drink more pain die
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,source genuinely curious for studies showing alcohol having a causal link to depression
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would rather take it than do other things this is one of the signs of depression actually the interest in substance abuse over other life activities if youre talking about taking k once in a while youd be correct that there wouldnt necessarily be a causation but were not talking the casual user here for something like issues with alcohol abuse at national levels were absolutely talking about people who use drugs and alcohol to cover their issues
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,substance abuse by definition is using drugs to the point where one is causing harm to oneself in a logical sense youre right someone could be harming themselves while being perfectly happy in reality thats never really the case is it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that is why i left this open ended it can be a correlation or a causation or a feedback loop in the end drinking when depressed it bad but if you cut out alcohol then something else more dangerous will take its place
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well barack is also a pretty original name
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i shouldve worded it differently
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah its pretty weird to think well have yr old men named dakota and jaden
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,every dictator is eventually despised the advantages of one person making sweeping apparently benevolent changes always turn to their cruelties or if they die early their successor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,none are elected though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes and no media is still run by people so there is no such thing as an unbiased media outlet but in russia the rules are different putin came to power in a shady way he was prime minister and getting ready for elections to replace yeltsin then yeltsin resigns early which made putin interim president and dramatically moved up the time table for elections since that is how their constitution is written putin then led an anti corruption campaign along with other things that essentially forced the billionaire oligarchs to either fall in line with the kremlin or were going to raid your companies open investigations freeze accounts block contracts etc until you do the oligarchs held the media so it all fell under kremlin control print and internet still has dissent but tv is all in with the kremlin no all state owned but owned by supporters keep in mind the legal charges were probably legit just more selectively enforced i dont think our media is good but rather a different kind of bad i believe the russians just more direct about it and you cant tell me that when the kremlin stuffed local elections with candidates with the same name as opponents that this was not a manipulation source i lived in russia
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so state media who only report what putin tells them to are the same as independent media who are free to criticise the government and everything are the same thing also if youre a reporter in russia you run the risk of being shot in the head at your doorstep if youre critical which doesnt happen in the us trump hates the media almost as much as putin tho but im pretty confident he wont win
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,almost no one cares enough to do anything about it youre a complete idiot if you think americans didnt care about things like the iraq war america is a strange place where the people literally think their government is going to do good things for them are you joking retarded or a kremlin shill millions of americans are extremely sceptical of big government and think government is always terrible some take it too far and become domestic terrorists vladimir putin is by far the best possible politician in the world at this point i actually hope youre a shill because if youre sincere then you are unbelievably stupid please refrain from ever makng a comment about politics ever again or risk humiliating yourself with such asinine comments as putin is by far the greatest leader of people within the past years or us has chance of besting russia in a war
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i remember yeltsin as a guy who would get totally drunk and then dance really badly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,actually i was full of shit but i like your reasoning better
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,buddha never had iced margaritas if he had there would only be rules and new rule about how getting your drink or smoke on is a very awesome short cut to nirvana
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for me i get more mindful with like or beers in me beyond that and its stupidsville
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why i stopped drinking basically without the buddha bit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no not really my parents are buddhist taoist mixed if i remembered correctly you may consume alcohol just in moderation as with any and all pleasures in life sole exception goes to adultery that is a major nono even if two adults are consenting source i read the pictohistory of siddihartai forgot how to spell his name
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lowering of inhibitions does not always mean more violence heroin certainly lower inhibitions to some degree but people do not get violent on it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i read the second just for kicks to summarize liquor stores are usually found in high crime areas therefore we should close liquor stores because itll cut crime how to do these people have jobs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if opening a liquor store did not result in an increase in nearby people hitting the sauce it was probably a bad place to open a liquor store
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this comment confused me at first because where i live people call alcohol sauce and being drunk sauced
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so is alcohol especially alcohol abuse for which ussr was famous for
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sorry i dont have a source for you my brain is not cooperating on information retrieval this morning but i believe that has been credibly challenged the correlation doesnt hold in other regions that banned leader gas at different times iirc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes i learned this when in finland one anti freeze company changed from ethanol to mix of ethanol and methanol local drunks started to feel ill andor die those who got to hospital in time were given high concentration ethanol to keep them drunk quite near ethanol poisoning levels for day or two to let methanol pass through their system
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that is the funnest of facts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which of course leads to the exciting drinking game drink and survive take a shot of methanol then start drinking if you live to see tomorrow you win dont play this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not really true there is no methanol generated during the distillation process distillation just concentrates things by evaporating off water it doesnt cause chemical changes there is a little bit of methanol in all fermented alcohol and it gets concentrated at the start heads of distillation due to its lower boiling point its still no more than was in the prefermented liquid originally so if you werent getting poisoned by the original wine or whatever you are distilling you wont get poisoned by the distillate unless you are specifically concentrating a huge amount of heads and drinking it for some reason the reputation for methanol in moonshine is indeed from using industrial alcohol another common source of poisoning is using car radiators as stills from lead and antifreeze methanol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how do you get it out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there is no possible way no matter how badly you screw up the mash unsanitary clumsy sloppy rigged together still nothing that you can do to grain sugar yeast and water that will make anywhere near dangerous levels of methanol in moonshine you can however goose your ethanol yield with sawdust and battery acid its the woodchips that break down into methanol every tainted alcohol poisoning i found since the end of prohibition was from mobsters hijacking an industrial denatured alcohol shipment and selling it bootleg to poor people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cant it be both
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you know that our livers have a much higher affinity for ethanol than methanol right so the solution to accidentally drinking the first drops out of the still is treated in hospital with ethanol from the middle of the batch its bullshit propaganda to continue public support for keeping moonshine illegal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the further you get away from where alcohol was invented the higher the alcoholism rate except with east asians wine and beer were first invented somewhere in the region of the middle east and north africa alcohol consumption rates tend to be higher the further you get away from httpsenwikipediaorgwikifilealcoholbycountrypng basically alcohol by itself seems to have had the same impact as a plague on human evolution
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,interact is a better word its hard encapsulating how complex the chemical interaction between alcohol and amines is i could write that alcohol breaks down into aldehyde and that its aldehyde that bonds with dopamine but id lose most readers right away its not very useful to readers to then say that the byproduct of amines aldehyde is isoquinolines which in turn reduce other enzymes and fit into opiate receptors if you can think of a better way to write that please do so it was hard enough doing the reading explaining this to people who drink is almost impossible by the way all that information is from under the influence by james milam studies on alcohol dehydrogenase and wikipedia the reason alcohol has an effect in the first place is because it passes the blood brain barrier regardless of alcohol dehydrogenase status in populations that dont produce the correct enzymes or have reduced enzymatic activity its like the difference between a lake and an ocean the more alcohol that passes the bloodbrain barrier the greater alcohols impact on dopamine levels and the greater the presence of dopaminealcohol byproducts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ireland was the last country or one of the last to receive alcohol in europe which according to some scholars is why they have such a high rate of alcoholism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats differnet though what stood out to me in the original post is that it implied that alcohol made you depressed because it is a depressant i dont think thats how it works but that doesnt mean alcohol may not cause depression in other ways
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly couldnt have said it better myself
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,barack is not uncommon in africa source family from kenya
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was going to give some smartass joke about the media and the elections but after your last line i dont think my joke would have been funny i had to go back and reread your comment thanks for your honest point of view
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,understood thanks for sharing anyway i also added the extremely part like saying look in russia it is almost managed from the government but the results in us due to other factors are not so distant like echo chambers and such things
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,uh the us just invaded a country under false pretenses and destabilize a region less than a decade a go
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not to jump straight to antiamerican propaganda but bush signed off on one of the largest conflicts in modern history on fabricated claims unxer the guise of protecting freedoms tony blair brought the uk into afghanistan on information we now know that he knew to be falsified i cant directly cite any cases of western backed assasinations bexause i dont know the details of any offhand though ireland did grant irish passports to mossad agents and knew they were on a kill mission but im certain theres some we can point to that equal the russians antics im just trying to get the point across that we cannot hold western politicans on a pedestal and claim that the russians are inherantly worse as if they are carchitures of the stereotypical bad guys
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,millions of americans are extremely sceptical of big government and think government is always terrible yea and thats is exactly why it looks like hilary will win this election because hundred millions of americans think idk what they think those liberals
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,with that gut though im sure some hidden drinking was going on
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah you skimmed it good job they site a study done by universities that showed that the opening of a liquor store has the same negative effect on rich neighborhoods as much as it does poor neighborhoods
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly a true capitalist pov
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cant even imagine the hangover that would result from two days of insane drunkenness
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,actually it doesnt boil off the water it boils off the alcohol which is then recondensed water is significantly less volatile that alcohol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you throw first pint or so away because methanol comes out first
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,afaik methanol has a little lower boiling point than ethanol so you can distill it out but the difference is only a few k so it is not as easy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the most common way to get it out is to throw out the tail ends of the distillation the folksy way of testing when the product was clean enough to drink was to light the drops on fire and wait for the color to change lots of explosions tho
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you have to ask very politely
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,those regions thats kind of a bad comparison because the islamic conquests kind of prevented alcohol from being easily consumable
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the main problem with that map is the effect of immigration for instance the vast majority of australians are either genetically european or east asian and so the genetic argument would be that they follow the trends of europeasia
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you are correct in pointing out the role of genetic factors in addiction to alcohol i just wanted to point out the inaccuracy in your explanation alcohol definitely affects opioid systems through modulation of endorphinsenkephalins however while interesting from a chemical perspective the isoquinoline contribution to addiction is at best controversial if not completely discredited source recent primaryreview articles on the neurobiology of alcohol addiction published in under the influence is not exactly a recent source
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that and the fact that until recently it was a pretty miserable place to live
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,depression isnt just being sad depression is also apathy seeing something right in front of you that you want to do that you know needs to be done and being entirely incapable of summoning the initiative to lift a finger to do it not being able to make yourself step outside make a phone call or do many of the things that are part of daytoday life the sadness is just one symptom but not everyone who suffers from depression would describe themselves as sad and those that do often cite their emotional state is a result of their inability to start things or keep interest this behavior is a direct result of abnormal neurotransmitter levels as far as we know we still dont understand exactly what happens in many cases but we do know that treating people with drugs that stabilize how the brain processes certain neurotransmitters works to alleviate many peoples symptoms enough to let them enjoy things again
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly people are saying hurr durr a substance being a depressant doesnt mean that it causes depression yes we know that that doesnt mean that abusing a depressant cant cause depression
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this thread has been locked due to numerous offtopic read nonconstructive and unconducive to discussion of the vis comments
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are alaska and hawaii just chill as fuck and the people have real things to worry about like wolves and storms or is the data just missing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i like repent amarillo is listed as general hate who are you against everyone you fuck you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so i live in the southeast something i noticed quickly as a corrections officer is the majority of hate groups are in the vicinity of prisons and notoriously violent jails is this information taking into account prison populations
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,third reich books fairbury nebraska neonazi so this is like a bookclub for neonazis and whats up with the huge kkk support east of dallas
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i love general hate as a faction like these people are just walking around furious all the time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it would be nice if it was possible to have population density so you could draw some conclusion about how much hate groups per persons
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,clicking through these national socialist movement i can see that being a hate group sadistic souls motorcycle club believable golden state racist skinheads a little on the nose american vikings clothing company turns out yes httpamericanvikingscomphavamalism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was surprised to find a kkk chapter in gerogia not the state georgia mind you the country
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what is radical traditional catholicism do they shoot people who get divorces
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if i made a hate group whos purpose was to hate on other hate groups would it be on this list
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,at first i thought this was a pretty strong indictment of the south then i looked a little closer so its sparse in the west but population centers such as denver still seem to have a nice collection of hate groups wait a minute this is just a population distro map
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wait faith freedom created by secularist exmuslims to help muslims leave islam ive never heard of these people before but isnt this quite noble considering the huge stigma attached to people leaving islam
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,holocaust denial is actually a thing i have always thought that it was just a general slang for extremely outspoken morons who dont check their facts i am kind of interested to learn more but also dont fancy giving them the time of day where is louis theroux
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the hated sounds like a super neckbeardy group that walk around thinking people are making fun of them when they say good morning or hold the door open for them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i love the general hate group category they hate stuff in general thats what they do
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so im right in thinking its not illegal in the us to incident hatred or violence towards a certain group religion sexual orientation race etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the symbols are meaningless the map has black separatist groups with a swastika and even more with the little white hood logo isliamic groups should be represented by a crescent and star and black power should be a white circle with a black fist these groups have their own branding
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this reads pike a cah card the smithsonian museum of science is now hosting an interactive exhibit on thekkk also damn georgia louisiana etc all really need a new hobby
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres a neonazi group in the town of my university and an antihomosexual group in my hometown not quite the til i expected
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,does this confirm my own bias that we are nicer people out west not you california youre still a bunch of dicks probably just population though right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,itt idiots complaining that there are no nonwhite groups who clearly didnt bother clicking the link
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,racist south my foot the entire eastern half from tip top to bottom is a giant smear of groups
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wake up and get to find out that there are multiple antiislam and skinhead groups around where i live thanks op
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im dumbfounded i live in a town thats kinda on the cusp of the deep south but due to a large military population tends to be more diverse even still i saw that symbol and sighed sure we had some kind of redneck kkk situation and then it turned out to be nation of islam i didnt know this was any kind of negative group as the name is vague i know where theyre located and its very remote i wont be using that short cut anymore while alone i sometimes stop and buy greens from this old man selling them from the back of his truck and he warned me about the guys in this house nearby that at the time was plastered with little signs talking about allah coming for you and it felt oddly threatening ive seen the same thing from christian groups so i never thought anything of it we just refer to them as jesuscrazy ie oh now bless her you know her mamas jesuscrazy gave half her daddys insurance money to the preacher on tv
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i love that my hometowns sole hate group is american family association i need to show this to my girlfriends radically southern baptist father
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wait why the heck are there so many israeli black separatist groups last i checked israel was part of asia and was more tan than black
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i feel its important to say this the best way to get rid of people whoms ideas you dont agree with isnt to censor them it is to discuss the topics with them and challenge them if you change their mind then they no longer believe what they used to and will stop preaching those ideas if we just censor them then they can go underground and use the fact that you censored them as ammunition for their cause they will come back stronger and more determined then if you hadnt done anything at all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im wondering why i dont see any radical environmentalist groups listed there are absolutely radicalleft movements in america but i only see radicalright groups identified edit many people are saying its because their violence isnt based on race religion etc that seems to make sense to me its not a list of all terrorist groups in america its a list of hate groups
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,never understood nazi movement i bet some of their family members fought and killed or got killed by nazi during lol i received down vote from some neonazi sympathizer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,glad i live in canada looks like theres none of that whatsoever according to this map
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive lived in a couple of places listed as having hate groups one was kkk and another has some antilgbt and neonazi groups ive never known anyone in them or known them to actually do anything i suspect the map implies a lot more influence than they actually have
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think everyone should keep in mind that the us is a huge country with around million people these hate groups represent a small group of the population likely some of these hate groups share members i dont want to even estimate it as i would probably overestimate the percentage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you could really make this service better by including links to each groups signup page
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,altright is identified as a hate group and what constitutes racist music
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,looks like malevolent freedom out of lowell ma is no longer active no place for shit like that in my home
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it kinda freaked me out that there was a nazi publishing group in wyandotte michigan of all places is that a town of old white people yes yes it is but nazis nonooooooo thankfully i looked it up and they just use a po box there so i feel better that town isnt that kind of place anybody can live there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i live in southwest us and i initially thought that american border patrol was actually the government agency not a hate group tricky bastards
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for my state several of the entries are wrong one of the groups no longe rexists after being busted by the feds a few years ago and most o fthem being in prison another point they have the city about miles out of position other than that its pretty interesting
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a philly area resident i think the only one ive actually seen is the israel united in christ because they stand outside of the center city public transit hub with fucking megaphones edit during the holiday season they are largely outnoised by the salvation goddamn army ringing their turd clapping bells all friggin day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so i was very confused when i saw casa dice near pittsburgh i drive past it all the time and just assumed that it was a rather ugly restaurant apparently the owner sometimes uses his marquee to put up antiimmigrant signs it seems odd to put this on the same level as say an active chapter of the kkk seeing as its one guy with a sign it seems to be missing the group part of hate group and while of course most of the groups that the splc lists are despicable the manner in which most news sources and policy makers immediately cite them as the be allend all of who is and isnt a hate group is concerning like politifact they are not some perfect arbiter above all bias investing such power in them is quite dangerous
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,itt racists get upset at the racist groups they participate in being labeled racist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow i guess the only thing bringing all of these groups together is their hate for me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,charlie hebdo would be a hate group under splc criteria after all they are the winners of the islamic human rights commissions award
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we played dawson springs in basketball my team is mostly black and im not gonna lie i was nervous as hell that whole game
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,one of the groups they list as a hate group are active antigovernment groups in the united states since when is being antigovernment being a hate group im old enough to remember when dissent is the highest form of patriotism note that they actively admit listing here below does not imply that the groups themselves advocate or engage in violence or other criminal activities or are racist so what does it mean it opposes the government so does black lives matter antiwar protesters and colin kaepernick since when does opposing the government put you in the same list as the kkk that is some orwellian crap right there im not naive they are preferring some forms of antigovernment activity to others but that makes you a partisan lobbying group not a neutral antihate group
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,itt people with their heads up their ass not understanding why blm is not on this list of founded hate groups
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,noticeably absent black lives matter also interesting to note the splc has a group called ihm media listed as a hate group but a quick httpihmmedianet indicates theyre part christian bookstore and part catholic advocacy group ihm stands for immaculate heart of mary why does the splc have this group listed as a hate group with no other explanation provided
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i feel like weve really watered down the definition of hate it seems like if you disagree with the wrong thing youre labelled a hate group now i had a discussion on facebook and proposed the compromise that maybe whoever owned the bathroom should get to decide to who can use it and someone told me to stop spewing hate it seems like its become just another word people use to silence their opposition without having any real argument
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow ive not even heard of some of these in spirit of chartres committee radical catholicism their website just says defending pre vatican stuff
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and black lives matter isnt included in the map what makes a hate group a hate group wouldnt going around schools and saying fuck you whites be a hate crime
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i had a professor who majored in race relations and she showed us this website she went on to justify all of the black separatist movements by claiming it was the white mans fault that these groups exist and that these groups are better than the kkk she was called out by a few students about this claim but she shut them up threatening to kick them out i loathed that class
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont have time to click on all of the icons but are there any hate groups that dislike whites christian or anything like that it seems like they must exist but i didnt see them represented
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a pity they dont provide any proof just name groups i find it dangerous to condemn people without giving reasons edit i am not defending any of the groups listed i am saying it is not a good practice to list hate groups without providing an explanation on the classification
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,man i didnt realize there was a kkk organization so close to me in chicago ive met more than a few dietracists around here but never any full blown kkk white supremacist other than one of the end is near guys down in the north loop
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this map is accurate for alaska there is a ton of racist people here but no organized groups of haters
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,looks like nova has a little nest of hate groups one of them is right down the street from work
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for the helpful map ive been looking to join some of these but i wasnt sure where they were im kidding im kidding a lot of the antiislam groups on the map accuse obama of being a muslim it seems that over half of the antiislam groups are explicitly or implicitly pro conservative christianity and yet when looking at their websites where they talk about how obama is a secret muslim they never talk about or at least i cant find it if they do how obama has supported homosexuals or womens rights ill bet that some of those will call obama a muslim jihadist in one breath and a gay rights secularist in the next without seeing the contradiction i have a lot of concerns about radical islam and think that people who say radical islam is not islam are being ignorant or at least if they are different there isnt much more than a twig separating them but im not a lets deport all the muslims and ban all muslim clothing kind of guy either and if more muslims were like obama id be less concerned about them the only potentially controversial things i believe about muslims are that they should receive no special consideration at airports either tell everyone to remove head coverings or tell no one and that if a migrant of any culture or religion shows no desire to integrate or peacefully coexist with the existing common cultures then they should not be there however i believe that many muslims could meet the requirements i set forth
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was kind of suprised that pa had so many and they mostly werent in the shitty redneck part of the state
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think this will play pretty well for wyoming wyoming theres no one here to hate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is there a way to see how some groups got on the list i was surprised to see a catholic hate group so close to me having attended that very catholic church many times i have never heard any hate speech
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,now in puzzle form for the kids
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is there any way to see a map legend of some sort there should be a map legend somewhere
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,strangest link ive ever seen maybe weird seeing several in my city whats even weirder is how specific people are with their hateor in some cases nonspecific general hate like what
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i guess those radical islamic training camps dont qualify as hate groups
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the southern poverty law center uses a very loose definition of hate group basically applying the label to any organization whose politics they disagree with enough and failing to apply any objective criteria to organizations whose politics they do agree with its oddly difficult to find a comprehensive list of hate groups as they apply the label where is the master list its almost like they dont want to publish a list that would let everyone see how subjectively the label is applied
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wait border patrol is a hate group the thing funded by the us government
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this map and watching imperium last night has really made me realize how prominent hate groups are i thought they were weak powerless and dwindling in numbers which is a reality i was comfortable with and to be fair when was the last time you heard of someone burning a cross on someones yard
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is from the southern poverty law center which list white lives matter but not black lives matter as a hate group it is itself a racist organization and this is more a map of their perceived enemies than one that legitimately list hate groups if you search for black lives matter on the linked page they will claim specifically that they are not a hate group however the founder and cofounder of blm have both made public statements which include asking their deity to give me strength not to cusskill these men and white folks out here today blm is a racist hate group at the highest levels of the organization not just low level members and the fact that the splc does not also include them in their list proves that they have no credibility whatsoever
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ahh southern poverty law center a group of lawyers that make money off of finding boogie men as long as they are white while ignoring antiwhite groups and not labeling them hate groups what a fucking joke
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im surprised la raza isnt listed theyre huge a mexican nationalist group who think the southwestern states still belong to mexico theyre well known in california
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why isnt blm here theyre essentially terrorists at this point and why the hell everyone afraid to criticize these fucking animals they block roads spread hate they want an entire race of people dead cause millions of dollars in damage and most importantly they kill people that sounds exactly like a terror organization doesnt it edit an anti blm comment that isnt down voted to oblivion this is great soon we shall band together and eliminate this retarded movement once and for all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seems odd to me that there is no leftextremist stuff or antiwhite stuff listed cause it exists
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont have time to think of anything clever but what am i classified as if i hate hate groups
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if anyones looking for information on hate groups rather than just admiring how the data is presented note that a couple of years ago the fbi stopped linking to the splc as a resource on hate groups
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i also want to add to the morons who are attacking blm protestors a quote from martin luther king jr i contend that the cry of black power is at bottom a reaction to the reluctance of white power to make the kind of changes necessary to make justice a reality for the negro i think that weve got to see that a riot is the language of the unheard and what is it that america has failed to hear it has failed to hear that the economic plight of the negro poor has worsened over the last few years that was from an interview on minutes more on this subject but it is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots it would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without at the same time condemning the contingent intolerable conditions that exist in our society these conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention and i must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard and what is it america has failed to hearit has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met and it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice and humanity — the other america most of those who complain of the protests they see have no concept of the life they watch others fight so violently to defend lets watch the video of the man shot in mineapolis licensed to carry following orders shot dead out of fear and an itchy trigger finger lets look at the arrest policies of the police in ferguson mo before the riots before the shooting of michael brown lets look at the swirling debt cycle we kick poor people mostly people of color into i order to fund the rest of a ridiculously corrupt judicial system lets look at hale county alabama where one of four families almost entirely families of color who do not have any indoor plumbing no plumbing sewage or water in many areas of the us outside of the shoes on peoples feet one could confuse the idea that they drifted back in time to a post civil war era then lets discuss the reasons for riots
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,being antigovernment is to be in a hate group now that kind of makes their whole map useless
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there is a neonazi group in memphis missing the gay safe place downtown here got a bombing threat also theres that famous neonazi sign that was on top of the peabody once
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah dang it ive got neonazis in my backyard is this what homeowners feel like when they find out they have termites
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im pretty sure i bought a from a guy on craigslist whos part of the neonazi group in southern wv he was a nice guy but im also a white male so
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i no longer respect the splc after failing to add blm as a hate group until they do they are part of the problem
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the list seems to be missing a couple of groups black panthers nation of islam err oh never mind this is to back a specific agenda sorry i will go back to my lurking
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so how is the campus leftist movement or blm not a hate group or is this just limited to white people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not depicted blm but apparently the altright is probably has to do with the nazi frogs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why is blm not on this map they incite riots and violence against whites
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when i first read this i saw repent armadillo next thought was wow those folks dont like armadillos need more coffee this morning
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,repent amarillo is a small amarillo texasbased political and quasireligious group which advocates for the spiritual mapping and targeting of specific local areas and venues in order to exorcise demons from those areas so theyre basically the westboro baptist church plus supernatural
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im the one responsible for them being listed i was on splcs website and noticed repent amarillo wasnt on there i notified splc via email and like a week later they were listed it made the local news and everything using a throwaway for obvious reasons
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,from in january the group launched a boycott campaign against the city of houston texas due to the election of annise parker an open lesbian as mayor and the construction of an abortion clinic in the city the website has since been redirected to the main repent amarillo website im sure the people of houston were really brokenhearted about this s
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i read that as repent armadillo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the splc does track hate group activity in the corrections system yes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id like to see this in comparison to jail locations and average incomes i bet the lower the income the more hate groups
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres a lot of hate groups that organize prison guards too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,black guy living in dallas no idea i never drive out that way and have no reason to unless you guys promise me upvotes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,vidor tx wasis the seat of kkk
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,east of dallas is where the real south starts the accent gets more of a drawl and the boots go from designer cowboy boots to work boots
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,east texas going into western louisiana is still a stronghold for the kkk i remember living in huntsville tx in the mid and seeing klan memorabilia and other items sold openly in downtown antique shops even now there are certain towns you dont stop in if youre not white residents might not attack you but the hostility in the air is almost tangible they have been fading for the last few years but groups like the texas knights and knight riders have been recruiting pretty heavily
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive lived on the texaslouisiana line my whole life never really met any active kkk members but maybe thats because no one really promotes that they are part of a hate group the worst people are the passive racists that dont even realize they are being racists mostly older people who cant believe what this world is coming too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,east of dallas goes from dallas city limits to backwoods filled with rednecks pretty fast somewhere between dallas and texarkana there is a church that wrote hell in big huge letters on their roof since dfw is busy all the time i thought it would be hilarious to experience a bunch of turbulence and then look out the plane window and see hell in emboldened letters
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the book club should join forces with the blood and honour social club next door in colorado those would be some interesting ice cream socials vanilla only
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,kkk is fucking everywhere by this map

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,basically they want to be klingon it seems also polite house guests
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we reject the universalist idea that our ancestors were just happy hippies in long ships and that the northern ways are for everyone we reject the modern progressive idea that we should be guilty and willing victims because of our european heritage at the same time if you are going to base your belief system on a race or a culture you had better be realistic racial purity in this day and age is overwhelmingly a myth good lord
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,holy shit this is im swedish because my great great grand uncle was taken to extreme levels id love to see these people getting laughed at by actual scandinavians im not ethiopian because the first human was from there ffs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we stand for the training and conditioning of the mind and body the preparation for glory and honor we never leave home without steel on our sides we are hospitable hosts and respectful guests we remain silent until something worthy needs to be said we strive to be happy and fearless all the days of our lives rjustneckbeardthings
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,actually modern vikings are very commonly open racists its pretty generally well known definitely keep an eye out for someone claiming to be so
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so they say that unless youre lucky enough to die at war youll have to break the law to ensure that someone kills you someday instead of simply dying of old age so suicide by cop or just walking around detroit yelling n these guys need to come back down to earth i love the idea of valhalla as much as the next mans man but at its very bones it was a fabricated idea to help inspire confidence in combat thats it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,havamalism places less emphasis on the scholastic and ritualistic applications of nordic heathenry and a stronger emphasis on physicality masculinity and general spirituality the ol we cant be bothered to learn anything about the fucking religion but we watched vikings once and it was cool approach to pagan reconstructionism

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,father coughlin
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it wouldnt be a hate group unless youre trying to actively hurt or legally discriminate against the other groups
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is the same group splc that branded a single exmuslim artist a hate group for drawing mohammad they lost a lot of my respect that day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is why i have trouble taking the splc all that seriously they have a storied history but today they seem to be incredibly inconsistent and partisan with regard to what they deem a hate group there are plenty of atheist organizations that depict christians as irrational intolerant and violent they also depict the christian faith as sanctioning rape pedophilia and child marriage because parts of the bible clearly do i notice that none of them are labeled hate groups by the splc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,take everything the splc publishes with a grain of saltthey are first and foremost a political organization
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,stigma aka a death sentence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing but if you look at the faith freedom website its more than just an organization to help ex muslims leave islam httpwwwfaithfreedomorgkhizrkhandenigratesnotonlythedeathofhissonbuthundredsofthousandsofussoldierswhodieddefendingfreedom posted recently that sounds like its straight from breitbart in fact it even cites breitbart as a source as it tries to smear khizr khan as an extremist muslim the founder has the following to say about muslims i find the word muslim very derogatory and insulting it is synonymous to stupid barbarian thug arrogant brain dead zombie hooligan goon shameless savage and many other ignoble things i dont know whether this most disgusting word elicits the same meanings in you or not so when i want to show my despise of someone i call him muslim but because muslims are stupid they dont know all these things and they are proud of this name this is a winwin situation because i insult them and they are happy and thank me for it isnt that smart based on all of that i dont think its a stretch to call this group a hate group
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there are people alive now that think didnt happen not that it was an inside job but that it literally just never occurred
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,flat earthers are really a thing after i learned that i feel people can believe just about anything if they try hard enough
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it is certainly a thing they generally believe that the holocaust was made up by the jews to make us hate the nazis who didnt really do anything wrong its actually illegal in many european countries to say that the holocaust didnt happen
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,take a gander at rconspiracy their sidebar image was hitter for a few months
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,looking through that one of the nodes is inconvenient history gave me a real nice chuckle
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rholocaust is still owned by holocaust deniers been waiting for their mods to stop activity so i can redditrequest it away but no dice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh yes there are a lot of holocaust deniers on rthedonald
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i hate stuff jon its what i do
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,only if you are i forget the exact wording explicitly telling a group or person to immediately go and physically harm another specific group or person or their property we take freedom of speech very seriously edit i have to look this up but i believe that it must also be actionable that is if you say something so hyperbolic that the crowd that you are screaming it at could never accomplish it we need to invade kazakhstan and kill all of them you can also not be prosecuted for it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,correct the negative side of a free country is that people are free to be ignorant as well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,american law requires both intent and immediacy to incite violence so groups like this generally can operate without much interference unless they actually do something
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,mostly its because the black separatist groups dont really do much of anything they just have sorta bizarre views heck for most people the most mainstream stuff like that gets is the lyrics of the wutang clan who do have some dabblings in the nation of islam
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its weird how jews are the common intersection for almost all hate groups
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we have a few of them here in nyc some of them call themselves black israelites they mostly stand on a street corner screaming at white people calling them the devil and yelling that jesus was black
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yea youll find those nuts preaching in the streets of new york every once in a while luckily being hispanic im one of the original israeli tribes so im saved smh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they are represented in that way to some extent are you sure youre just not looking at multilayered icons filter out the different groups or look at them by state black separatists are not all black panthers most ive seen according to the map are antisemitic or a part of the nation of islam so their assigned symbol makes sense also a lot of white nationalist groups are outlined with an orange circle and white fist what you propose would be the opposite and would be more confusing to someone just landing on the page antimuslim groups are represented as a red circle with a white crescent moon
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think they should use the symbol of the mainstream group though we dont want people thinking islamic hate groups are the same thing as normal muslims etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,please dont use a crescent and star to represent islamic militant groups that would be like using a cross to represent the kkk the kkk is to christianity what islamic militants are to islam
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,georgian here please dont judge the state by its cover were not all like that i promise
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i think its population its amazing how the land is so devoid of people out there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its basically just a population map
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,speaking as someone from california i was going to protest then i remembered my last trip to la
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not you california youre still a bunch dicks hahahaha man that gave me my first laugh of the day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think if you overlay the hate groups with a minority population map you might notice something
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so youve never been to eastern washington or oregon have you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oregon was founded as a whites only state and still has an abnormally large population of neonazis and white supremacists
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the number of groups pretty much lines up with a of the country people are bigoted everywhere the more people there are the more likely they will find likeminded people to form groups with
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,racial hate is just one type of hate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,please send help maine
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,except connecticut
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,while thats true theres definitely a ku klux klan cluster say that five times fast in the south
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the map doesnt show the size of the groups if the groups in the south tended to have much larger memberships that would be different
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,plot twist youre enrolled in every single one
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats a very weird rabbit hole to go down but basically a lot of black separatists groups think that the jewish people that we all know and love arent the real jews but that black people are they think the jewish moniker was stolen by ashkenazi whites masquerading as jews which is why most jewish people look white thats just the tip of the iceberg it start to get really weird as you go down deeper
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a lot of black separatist movements adopted terminology describing themselves as israelites for reasons of religious identity and also as a call back to the lost tribes of israel which were scattered across the lands it reflects a common history of diaspora rather than an actual geographic connection
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,having grown up in a ghetto part of memphis a surprising amount of poor black people think the people of israel are black i have no idea why i dont know whos telling them that and i suppose theyve never met someone from there either
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it has to do with the they believe black people originally controlled asia or something along those lines and by extension blacks are the real jews and that the modern jews are all evil and stuff like that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wish it were that easy but when they resort to threats andor violence it makes it hard to reason with someone but i agree wholeheartedly not to censor them and to challenge them but its just not that back and white for lack of a better idiom
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,have you ever tried to have a discussion with a racist for example all the ones ive encountered anecdotal i know irl or on the web havent been rational yet misguided people they fabricate their own reality using pseudoscience and twisted facts then bury their head in the sands to everything else those types dont even usually discuss like regular folk its always some ragedriven word soup of hate bitterness and edginess
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not saying we should censor them but no amount if reason will ever overcome their deep ingrained racist beliefs they learned to hate from their parents who learned from their parents etc its who they are and people dont like admitting that who they are is a shitty person the only way to break the cycle is to teach their kids not to hate but fuck if i know how to do that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont know ive personally never seen anything come from being reasonable with unreasonable people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,because its not a list of radical movements its a list of hate groups which is specifically about hating individuals for their race ethnicity sexuality or religion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,these groups exist but im not sure hating capitalism or corporations who pollute use factory farms etc necessarily makes you a hate group i think the term is more for people who hate people based on skin colour religion sexual orientation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,because environmentalists however violent and misguided dont hate a certain group of poeple for their race religion etc it is about people spreading hate against other groups of people not about people who are extremist andor violent in general if there was a vegetarian group calling for all meateaters to be killed they would be on there as well but there is no notable group like that if im not mistaken
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,because this organization is aparently solely focused on farright movements httpswwwsplcenterorghatewatch plus do radical leftist really do anything beyond aggressive blogging and buying mugs that say cis straight male tears i mean these guys are monitoring shit like armed vigilante groups and exkkk politicians pushing weird policies in their areas
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what threat do radical environmentalists pose to civil rights or liberties the right to pollute does not exist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,interesting question that i pondered myself the link itself says that the groups are selected if they straight up hate an entire group of people we can assume this means regardless of any other reason and that for instance an antiislam group hates all muslims no matter the person radicalleft groups tend not to fall into this category id hate to say all the leftwing groups tend to target ideas or social norms as opposed to a group of people based on things they have no control over theyre all still crazy in my honest opinion dont get me wrong
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats because it profiled just the us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its because theyre not socially tolerated its pretty dangerous for them to be out in the open so they hide in a dark corner
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think its our own perception of influence a bunch of icons on a map look kind of scary it looks like the country is running rampant with hate groups but in all likelihood these groups are small and dying id bet there are very few that are gaining membership at this point
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh man welcome to the rabbit hole there is a whole genre of white supremacist music httpwwwshekhovtsovorgarticlesantonshekhovtsovapoliteicmusichtml article is not about explicitly racist music its about quietly fascist music instead but it discusses other neofascist music httpsenwikipediaorgwikiprussianblue the gaede twins have left their neonazi brainwashing behind but for years their mother and grandfather were using them to pump out hateful white supremacist folk music
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,beyond a doubt theyre always talking about how nonwhites have inferior genetics they believe that jews are working to undermine western civilization they even have special identifiers for jews such as writing their names like this in addition many believe that women should not have the right to vote
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpswwwsplcenterorgfightinghateextremistfilesideologyalternativeright the daily stormer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the feds consider juggalos a gang like crips and bloods not sure what they hate outside of usually being poor but i assume a group as harmless as them might be on the list
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,results when you highlight that one
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why does the splc have this group listed as a hate group with no other explanation provided its listed as radical traditionalist catholic so probably for antisemitism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how is any group listed there not a hate group
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the definition of hate hasnt changed the group of protected classes of citizens has changed imagine if you had said that whoever owns the bathroom gets to decide if jews can use it or not i think you would recognize that as a racist statement the difference is that the person you were arguing with has accepted transgender people as a protected class on par with race and religion and you have not im not saying either of you are right or wrong
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you search for blm you get
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as certain factions and local groups that use blm in their name firmly establish themselves as black nationalistblack separatists theyll show up in the splc database of hate groups yes some assholes and hateful people have glommed on to blm but if you think that all of blm is a hate group then youre either simply honestly ignorant of the intent and have heard disingenuous crap from racists seeking to undermine blms point or you yourself are a racist and are intentionally misrepresenting them to perpetuate your crap
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think it focuses on the values that a group intrinsically holds its decentralized but hating police officers and whites people isnt i believe a characteristic that defines the movement just that defines some of the people in it which makes sense because if you labeled a group based on what its members said but not what values it holds then you could probably get any major political party labeled as a hate group as well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,being a group is required blm is not a group now if blm atlanta specifically was a hate group it would get listed because that one is a group there are black groups on the list
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all of that information is on their hate group database on their website
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the map is a guide not a fullblown encyclopedia info about each group is available on the centers website and also at wikipedia and numerous other places online the map will tell you who to be aware of and wary of locally
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they do if you look for ten seconds they have a full index of hate groups on their site where they explain why theyre classified and list articles about their exploits
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are you unfamiliar with the southern poverty law center
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you look under general hate in oakland dc there is assabiqun
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they have nation of islam on there which i believe is black maybe they dont have every hate group yet which group are you referring to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which ones
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are you implying that the splc doesnt track islamic hate groups in the united states out of the hate groups they track are categorized as general hate out of those there are around three organizations in eight locations that id classify as extreme islamic groups assabiqun masjid al islam jamaat almuslimeen along with nation of islam and a few other black separatist movements these eight locations make up the most notable islamic hate groups operating in america if you are referring to the reports of islamic training camps like jamaat ulfuqra that have been making the rounds around the internet i suggest you even the fbi does not classify this group as a potential terror group
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are those the ones obama is running out of his garage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah in some way radical islam and radical feminism isnt mapped either its funny that you got downvoted instantly just because you are pointing out that some groups are not being shown
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a private group per the site american border patrolamerican patrol the firstlisted group was essentially an arizona extension of american patrol which is also known as voice of citizens together is one of the most virulent antiimmigrant groups around on the american patrol website and in selfproduced videos the group rails against mexican immigrants accusing them of bringing to the us crime drugs and squalor and of practicing immigration via the birth canal mexicans in the words of group founder glenn spencer are a cultural cancer following a secret plan the plan de aztlán to complete la reconquista the reconquest or takeover of the american southwest which was once controlled by spain andor mexico
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is not associated with the us government they are using citizen patrols and various sensors and surveillance equipment to track the movement of migrants crossing the mexicoarizona border httpswwwsplcenterorgfightinghateextremistfilesindividualglennspencer httpswwwsplcenterorgfightinghateextremistfilesgroupamericanborderpatrolamericanpatrol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,guys the website youre looking at has all this information httpswwwsplcenterorgfightinghateextremistfilesgroupamericanborderpatrolamericanpatrol its a hate group not affiliated with the government
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats not them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,source on blm founders saying things like that also ive always found it weird that blm is considered a group at all it was just a hashtag that turned into a rallying cry
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you for some reason assume that blm is some sort of massive well organized organization filled with people who work and act together it is not not even close its not even an organization at all its a conglomeration of people who are rallying behind a specific slogan for various reasons there is no direction organization or centralized way to control the followers or even denounce the behavior of those who coopt the slogan
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres a bunch of black separatist groups listed on that site
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,zooming in on southern florida brings up a bunch of black supremacist groups like the new bpp and the nation of islam or whatever its called theyre up there but proportionally represented since there are fewer people who arent white there will be fewer groups based on that idea
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,below is the article the splc wrote regarding blm whether or not you agree with the below this will at least provide their reasoning of the identified hate groups of the hate groups are black separatist as only of the population is black in the us both black and white hate groups are over represented both of these likely stem from the institution of slavery for comparison whites are of the population and make up of the hate groups you also have to consider that many of the groups arent specifically white such as radical traditional catholicism and antiimmigrant granted antiimmigrant is primarily white to my knowledge furthermore the kkks strong history in the us skews the white hate group number fully of white hate groups are kkk affiliated if not for the kkks significant history in the us the white hate group numbers and likely the black hate group numbers would be much lower as its largely due to the kkks continuing clout in certain areas and familial tradition that they can continue to survive whether blm is later identified as a hate group will depend on how their views develop both the black panthers and the nation of islam were not originally considered hate groups however how they have developed and in the case of the bp new offshoots of the original has changed their categorization for some of the chapters if blm takes a few more steps towards radicalization some of their chapters may be on this map before you know it however currently there are no chapters that are specifically antiwhite even if some members are the only other ethnic group in the states that has a large enough population to support race specific hate groups is hispaniclatino they may have some representation in the catholic hate groups however as race relations were generally better historically with latinos and other groups no slavery race riots etc there are fewer reasons for them to incite hate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they have an article about why blm is not a hate group and there are loads of black groups on there such as the nation of islam of the new black panther party not to be confused with the nonracist bpp of the and
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did you miss the nation of islam that is in there there is also the matter of population demographics that also factor in that will also skew the number of white focused hate groups quite a bit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,splc thinks the tea party rand paul and anarchocapitalists are hate groups their opinion on the matter is meaningless
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,except they dont kill people or spread hate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,these fucking animals accuses blm of racism animals
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,essentially terrorists at this point if by essentially you mean not at all or by terrorists you mean peaceful protestors some of the higher profile police shootings of late dallas specifically have been carried out by people who specifically have been against blm saying our lives matter too is significantly different than what you think it is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,blm arent terrorists theyre pointing out that and many of them are rewarded for being so that sounds exactly like a terror organization doesnt it actually what you said sounds exactly like american police and you sound like a raving lunatic
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there are black separatist groups listed these groups belong to one of at least particular organizations that means that of the groups listed on the site are black separatist the israelite church of god in jesus christ israelite school of universal and practical knowledge israel united in christ black hebrew israelites httpswwwsplcenterorgfightinghateextremistfilesgroupnuwaubiannationmoors httpswwwsplcenterorgfightinghateextremistfilesgroupnationislam httpswwwsplcenterorgfightinghateextremistfilesgroupnewblackpantherparty
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,look again the nation of islam is on there and i only look for a minute or two there might be more
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did you even bother to peruse the map or are you just assuming noi is right on there along with several others
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they do exist theyre just a lot less common than far right antiminority groups there are several on the list
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres a lot of antiwhite stuff listed as far as leftextremism in the us at least left extremists are nonviolent the animal rights people will occasionally burn down a lab but any casualties are accidental and not the stated misssion of the organization a lot of people underestimate how thoroughly radical leftism was eradicated in the us just the word communist or socialist is a slur in the us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a reasonable human being
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,funny enough the fbi explicitly stated that isnt true and its right wing propaganda to denounce the splc they just wanted to keep their links internal to the federal government they still have splc listed as a partner just not linked
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the splcs goal with their work isnt exclusively about criminal activity a big part of what the splc does is track and expose how members of actual hate groups infiltrate and exploit other groups and political movements to recruit members and spread their hateful ideologies for example its clear that racists are jumping on the donald trump bandwagon the splc tracks and exposes details of how that is happening and who is doing it that doesnt make the donald trump for president campaign itself a hate group but its important to point out whohow the actual hate groups are exploiting the campaign the fbi clearly checks in with the work the splc is doing to help them track the actual criminals associated with hate groups but it is not appropriate for a criminal law enforcement agency to simply use the splcs hate group list as a list of criminal organizations that crosses the line into criminalizing speech and politics note specifically that this change was made under the obama administration and with eric holder as attorney general its important to point out that many hate groups engage in additional nonviolent criminal activity such as financial fraud again clearly the fbi reads what the splc publishes but they dont take it as gospel the washington examiner isnt as bad as the washington times but is similar in biaslow quality to fox news and as such isnt really a source of journalism and the article you linked grossly misrepresents the splc and the fbis policy change
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that isnt true deer neo nazi
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im sure you were a huge fan before
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres no doubt that some protesters who claim the mantle of black lives matter have said offensive things like the chant pigs in a blanket fry em like bacon that was heard at one rally but before we condemn the entire movement for the words of a few we should ask ourselves whether we would also condemn the entire republican party for the racist words of its presumptive nominee – or for the racist rhetoric of many other politicians in the party over the course of years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did you klan members ever really respect the splc though blm is not a hate group anymore than the us chamber of commerce is a hate group for systematically attacking unions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you realize they are on the list right did you even attempt to look
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,both of those groups are listed in that map sort by black separatist black panthers was harder to find in the sea of nation of islam but theres one in vero beach fl
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there is black separatist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you clearly didnt look at the map both of those are listed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,except both of those are on there you dumbfuck
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpswwwsplcenterorgfightinghateextremistfilesgroupnewblackpantherparty of those are on there maybe its less of an agenda and more just reality that those groups are outnumbered
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nation of islam was in there calm down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the black panther party was dissolved in and the nation of islam is prominently on there maybe read the map first before starting to air your agenda
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dude click the sort by option and click black separatist theres a fuck ton of black hate groups but i guess you had a specific agenda by creating this account just to post here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,look at new jersey
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,plenty of black organisations on there such as the nation of islam and the new black panther party ive never heard of the campus left movement organisation who are they and what do they believe
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the campus leftist movement isnt a hate group because it doesnt exist outside of infowars or breitbart or whatever
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah theres a difference between actual nazis and people who want racial equality go figure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what i changed the filter to altright but there are no groups on the map so altright is being pushed as a hate group but they cant name any yet this is a new level of propaganda
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they sound like a folk punk band to me hi were repent amarillo and were from athens georgia
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im from amarillo and they are famous for the time they exposed the roster of a swingers club on social media
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,god hates wayward sons
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i love how theyre one of pretty much the only hate groups in west texas outside of a couple in el paso west texas so empty we cant even find people to hate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can you tell more about the group what they are against etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a fellow amarilloan i thank you for your service fuck those guys
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh wow what do they believe and why do they hate everyone
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why is tightrope a music symbol is there a song i am missing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,quite a few of the hate groups on the website are kkk or neoconfederate related it could be that there are more hate groups in poor areas because they are predominantly in the south where the kkk and confederate states not too long ago had millions of members
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not necessarily falls church va is one on the wealthiest counties in the us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hows your rap song
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im a black guy living east of dallas i remember when i ran cross country in high school there was a trail i would go on that goes through the country on this trail there were confederate flags and people shootin their guns for sport around where we ran and the worst thing of allloose fucking dogs like if you have a lb german sheppard chasing runners its no mistake that you let it out at in the morning
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dude dont go there aint shit there but hicks and trouble you wouldnt dare some white dude to drive through gary would you id rather you make more rap songs than deal with idiots cause god knows that aint hard to find
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we were talking about vidor at work yesterday the high school my bosss kid goes to played them in football friday night he was talking about how back around the time segregation was really starting up it was super super bad when kids from around our town would go out there even a few years ago when i was in high school i can remember my friends on the basketball team talking about how the coaches would warn the girls not to be running aroundhanging out after the game when theyd play out there no black people had lived in vidor for like years straight until when some moved in they had federal marshals come in and monitor the move and shit fucking
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that place is an all around general hell hole growing up we always used to make sure we had enough gas in houston to at least clear that area all the way to lake charles whenever wed go to no
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i once saw a fully robed klan rally in the market basket parking lot from when i was driving through vidor broad daylight true story
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lived in vidor for years in the early can confirm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that is way further south than dallas though not due east of it but yeah vidor is horrible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,longview tyler etc have pretty good sized black populations the communities tend to be on the other side of the tracks though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you dirty rakist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i can get behind hating on those dyson airblades in restrooms so hygienic when your hands hit the sides that everyone elses hands have hit due to it being nearly impossible to avoid

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fucking magnets how do they work i remember the first time my brother and i heard that beautiful line i thought i would literally yes literally pass out from laughter induced asphyxiation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,commencing mental overlay loading overlay mental map loaded ready for analysis analysis done conclusion the more people the more hate groups level unsurprising
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id love to hear a recording of people wanting to return something for a refund caller this shirt is shit im sending it back give me back my money avc nope you bought it deal with it caller fine then im burning the shirt and coming over there to take my money back avc come at me bro better bring your sword caller oh im bringing my sword avc fine caller fine three days later the shipping time is extended because they lost another employee in a duel
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just as it is ridiculous for a modern person living in sweden or norway to claim an american cannot hear the voices of his nordic ancestors it would be equally ridiculous for me as someone who is presumably completely of european descent to claim that someone who is half european descent cannot hear the voices inside him of his ancestors theres word for what obeying voices in your head is that said i do like the idea of some dude walking around with a ghost viking telling him what to do all the time eeeeeeaaaat looots of cheeeesssseeee then go on holiday and rape looots offf peeooooppplllleee do you mind im trying to eat my macoroni gooood staaaaart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it is not for people who die in car wrecks or accidents because they were warriors all of their lives it is for the man who chooses to cut his life short and die violently at the hands of his enemies in an attempt to right the many wrongs of this modern world wait this is a clothing company what the fuck are we talking about the havamalist is a realistically folkish heathen we reject the universalist idea that our ancestors were just happy hippies in long ships and that the northern ways are for everyone we reject the modern progressive idea that we should be guilty and willing victims because of our european heritage i dont know what all this means im a norwegianamerican descended from actual fucking vikings i have eaten more lutefisk than any human reasonably should the answer to how much lutefisk one should eat none i feel like i should apologize on behalf of the vikings for this nonsense but it made me lol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i feel like im on a list now just visiting it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its hard to be a jewish axeman when so many axemen are nordic skinheads
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,racebased klingon their obsession with violence and breaking the law is pretty scary and there are older versions of those pages that are even more racially charged the splc page on them has some highlights the klingon learned some tolerance though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did you read what you quoted im not seeing anything too bad here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cant open the website but im not seeing anything in the summary that you posted that suggests hate group
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its annoying part of liking nordic viking stuff lot of far right groups use the symbols
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it pisses me off to no end that any sort of nordic culture in americaeurope has been hijacked by racists ever since hitler or maybe wagner its been impossible to enjoy nordic culture or myths without being seen as a complete racist understandably i feel like im in the same boat as tolkien who felt similarly to me hitler took away his ability to enjoy the culture
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no we arent thats vikingist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not by me until now learn something new every day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah its a fucking pain i know someone in denmark who is into norse folk music and he is constantly running into these assholes at gigs and stuff
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it seems to me to just be people psyching themselves up to do some awful shit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a normal catholic i havent met any radtrads that were actually antisemetic but more just anticatholic
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wait i thought jesus was jewish
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but you know do as i say not as i do the guy built his own church so that he could practice his latin mass prevatican ii brand of ultraorthodox catholicism but cheats on his wife and gets divorced
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i take that to mean its ℅ guilt and shame
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how about i just not take them at all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do you even know what american border patrol is its a private organization created by glenn spencer to serve as the arizona chapter of his californian hate group voice of citizens together mexicans in the words of group founder glenn spencer are a cultural cancer following a secret plan the plan de aztlán to complete la reconquista the reconquest or takeover of the american southwest which was once controlled by spain andor mexico
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,proof or it never happened of people denying ever happened not pf
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this one absolutely baffles me beyond belief i spent over an hour the other day watching some of their videos claiming to prove the earth is flat i could not find a single one that even made a tiny bit of sense
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fringe ideologies attract people who think they are the smartest person on the planet smarter than any expert on anything
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i remember reading about them years ago they did a studysorry study where the held a string across a lake since the middle of it stayed dry that was the proof they sure showed big map with all their false mercator projections lining their pockets with the ill gained booty from faulty map sales swimming in their luxury yacht pools its all rigged makes me sickwait what are we talking about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres even a subreddit for it rtheworldisflat beware there are some real nutjobs in there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,surely the flat earth thing is a running gag if you go to the flat earth society or whatever its called if you go to one of those websites it seems full of injokes and sarcastic asides
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dude people believe gods are real like zeus and jesus and shit people can believe anything
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is certainly a thing they generally believe that the holocaust was made up by the jews to make us hate the nazis who didnt really do anything wrong the general outlook of holocaust deniers is the holocaust never happened but i sure wish it had
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when the allies found the camps they decided to film and photograph everything because they knew that one day people would try to claim it never happened
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,similar to all the russians asking for proofs that russia was invading ukraine any actual evidence from any reputable sources including video footage of fighting was dismissed as western media bias and propaganda and they just kept saying that there was no proof
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fuck that subreddit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats insane
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we should get on that in the us holocaust denial is virtually always a dog whistle incitement of violence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for real though i just looked through that subreddit its disgusting straight inhuman savagery look i am always more than happy to quibble about the details of a historical event there is never absolute truth but the nature of the fact that a group of people deny the sickening murders of some millions of people makes me sick straight up makes me physically ill fuck those people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,jesus christ just went through some of the top posts of that subreddit but had to stop because it was too upsetting as a jew this really disturbs me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,read that in egoraptors voice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in a nutshell i hate jews perfectly legal if all the jews were to drop dead thatd be great perfectly legal we must bring about the fall of israel and the jews in government perfectly legal lets go to the synagogue down the street and burn it to the ground illegal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the phrase that youre looking for is httpsenwikipediaorgwikiimminentlawlessaction incidentally
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the precise language is httpsenwikipediaorgwikiunitedstatesfreespeechexceptionsincitement
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,perhaps the legacy of the nazi party has had the effect on europe of that whilst freedom of speech is important especially to criticise the government inciting hatred towards certain groups is most definitely not okay and then through democracy weve decided that we would rather live in a country without hate speech and so weve voted for this limit on free speech
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its only freedom if you allow opinions you dont agree with
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it was popular in the early to mid most of the rappers ended up converting to sunni or shite islam though just like muhammad ali and snoop if you care about actual religion nation of islam doesnt do much for you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i thought wu tang dabbled in five percent islam
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so your fine with them used for antiislam groups like they are in the map
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,relevant xkcd heatmap
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think it has more to do with population every place has hate groups bigots will be bigots everywhere if anything living in a city with people of different faiths and ethnicities makes you more liberal and open minded well generally
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wikipedia has httpsenwikipediaorgwikisouthernpovertylawcentermediafilenumberofhategroupsbystatepermillioninhabitantspng splc hate groupspopulation by state darker is more hate groups
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,relevant xkcd
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think if you took the population map and interacted it with the racism map youd have something close to this map
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think the map is less related to regional propensity than showing that there is a group near you that needs monitoring and potential legal action for regional propensity see this map
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is that what all those facebook group invites from nana were oo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,weird thanks for the info
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what the fuck
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so why is anti government on the list then
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they do cover leftwing hate groups but youre correct in that the large majority of violent and vigilante groups in the us are far right wing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i hope that was the joke
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why the parentheses
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are those people serious
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,damn who knew such open racism existed on reddit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,who made these guys an authority on what the altright is this is like saying the examples on rtumblrinaction represent feminism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this isnt the feds its southern poverty law theyre very good at what they do despite people running lots of smear campaigns against their classifications including that they class they are very firm on their standards a hate group has explicitly part of its platform beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of people typically for their immutable characteristics juggalos do not
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they hate health prosperity and basic education
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,neither is the alt right and would you look at that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its worth pointing out that a lot of muslims around the world react with a huge wtf to the specifics of the american nation of islam of course you need to be careful about no true scotsman stuff but there is a very real argument to be made that the nation of islam isnt actually muslim
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whats a radical feminist group i can join id like some contact info please
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont forget blm how many cities have they burned yet
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah they toil around the border with guns threatening to shoot anyone who has darker skin
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to be fair she does say
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there are times as many white americans as black americans out of the splcs roughly hate groups listed about are black separatists but were arguing with racists here so such silly facts are trumped by their victim feels
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,more like people we hate groups
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nope every one of those is false the splc has pointed out that for instance rand paul has hired staffers who have publicly espoused neoconfederate views but rand paul is an individual and thus can not be a hate group the splc has identified a single group that calls itself tea party nation as a hate group but not the broader tea party movement as such and no other tea party groups are listed and the claims that theyve listed anarchocapitalists as a hate group thats so nebulous that its hard to address but no the splc has not done so sadly within the rightwing crazysphere there are endless false claims of the splc has named x as a hate group what the splc has done is pointed out links between some groups movements and even individuals such as candidates and politicians and actual hate groups and movements for example the ludwig von mises institute promotes itself as a free marketaustrian schoollibertarian group in and of itself no big deal but the splc points out that prominent members of that group are also members of several white supremacistneoconfederate groups and that the organization has made statements praising some specific european neofascists a big part of what the splc does is to track link and expose how leaders in hateful ideologies and political movements link together infiltrate and exploit other groups and political movements to spread their hate and violence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they are animal like in their behavior he is calling blm animals not black people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,shh too busy being an oppressed white guy to read the article
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not surprising he is a kia poster and his little
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hes a persecuted alt right turd dont you understand
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sodid you get any dates out of it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there will not be peace when you are gone
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i grew up in west texas and in general people are very nice not a lot of hate but yeah not a lot of anything lol kinda proud that my spot of texas is a pretty much a hate group free zone lol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they are mostly against gays theyre basically like the westboro baptist church theyve had run ins with strip clubs and swingers groups too they also strongly oppose what they call compromised churches which for the most part means lgbt friendly churches but also includes churches who let their worship band play in secular venues and non mainstream churches like lds jehovas witnesses unitarian etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive only had one run in with them before i was in line to get in to a popular bar on a saturday and they were standing on the street with signs yelling how we were going to hell etc that didnt really bug me but from what i understand is that they like to take the westboro baptist church approach and spread hate messages
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean not to defend a hate group but have you met everyone everyone kinda sucks
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a record label that promotes racist music stuff like skrewdriver
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,does this answer your question httptightropecc the rope which is tight is a noose
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the only song with that name i know of is by janelle monae httpsyoutubepwnefuakcbc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how dare you assume just because hes bl oh i see
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is my favorite i give it an on the thisisaserioussong scale im talking about education and religion httpsmiclarrymusicbandcampcomtracklongnights one has my favorite production i made all of the beats by the way then theres foolishness because i like final fantasy and girls twerking heres the bandcamp httpsmiclarrymusicbandcampcomalbummiclarrymusic also i see you guys really want me to go east of dallas
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wtf oh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,holy shit dude id stay the fuck away from that place and im as white as we get
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its kinda crazy i grew up in dallas and never knew about this i guess its because i dont have friends or family out there for obvious reasons now im still amazed when i see posts with people flying confederate flags like you literally never see that growing up in a black neighbourhood once again for obvious reasons thats just an entirely different america to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i once blew a tire on right outside gary it was about and this was around i wanna say so i had a cell phone but it was either dead or no service honestly i cant remember there was of us total one stayed with the car i had a spare tire in the car but my jack was busted i had used it on some dodge neon a few weeks back and it bent no way i was risking my car on that but i do remember walking down the highway taking an exit trying to get into this closed bar because i could hear people inside but the door was locked so the three of us just kept walking around trying to flag down cars until we made it to an open gas station to call for a tow truck gary indiana never again tho
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you probably shouldnt drive through gary even if youre black i doubt the residents are racists who just love to victimize white people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,agreed i make that trip quite often and i make sure i never have a reason to stop in vidor or jasper
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats exactly how i feel about waco gas up early set cruise control to speed limit drive slowly and try not to breathe too loudly until youre past
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,stupid long horses
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,actually due to the humidity that accumulates in a public restroom and the hot air the machine blows out you end up with more replicating bacteria than if you used a paper towel so yeah fuck air hand dryers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you must have sucked playing operation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,enjoy your morning at the international house of reganomics i lost my appetite
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you knew my nana youd hate her too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are their tshirts plantation cotton because thats all my crew and i wear
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dislike these pseudo viking fanboys so much they have a superficial understanding of norse calling them vikings is like calling greek civilisation hoplites culture and history along with scandinavia as a whole
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just as it is ridiculous for a modern person living in sweden or norway to claim an american cannot hear the voices of his african ancestors it would be equally ridiculous for me as someone who is presumably completely of european descent to claim that someone who is half european descent cannot hear the voices inside him of his african ancestors fixed that for them but seriously the european exceptionalism is strong with them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as opposed to regular speciesbased klingon
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it really doesnt seem that bad its just super weird likewhats their point
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the white pride and this cracker wont crumble graphic tshirts make it pretty clear
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,be a man the best way to keep the chimps and hyenas at bay is to mold yourself into a lion or gorilla humans are animals too be a ferocious one be the hero of your own life story an able protector a warrior instead of watching formidable men play sports and obsessing over it go to the gym skip the bar friday night and buy some boxing gloves with your buddies get punched in the face realize that you arent fragile carrying a warm mildly sore black eye around feels good feels alive may just be the first time you ever really felt like a man in your life try it learn the difference between pain and injury realize that they both heal quicker than fear or shame make yourself formidable stand up to anyone and everything that you think is wrong you might get hurt you might get arrested sure you might even die in the process you also might live to be you might literally rot to death before your own eyes a helpless burden on everyone you ever loved having successfully lived a long and safe life that didnt mean shit no one talked about you no one felt the way about you that you feel about those action heroes you read about or watched on tv your sons never envied your feats they envied the feats of athlete strangers and fake bikers and gangsters on tv while they sat beside you on the couch you might live vicariously for years through anyone and everyone that society tells you to while leaving behind a thirdworld fucking dump for your posterity you might do that also or you might wake up tomorrow and realize that you are an animal albeit a smart animal a civilized animal still an animal your soul craves excitement dominance contest love lust hate and the assurance of the survival of your bloodline all things that you believe are reserved for others things you have been told are primitive and hateful they are not they are the only reason you are here deny them and you will stay miserable you will look up to people that dont exist you will live long die empty and regret it all from whatever afterlife may exist be a man also from their website
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if the words racial purity show up its a hate group
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah the above pasted paragraph there was almost calling racism out as stupid then the next paragraphs were clearly the weasely innuendo of modern racism cant expect a racist to have any intellectual integrity
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that website is possibly the best example of the use of httpsenwikipediaorgwikidogwhistlepolitics ive ever seen
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the first item in their shop is a shirt with the words white pride emblazoned on the front of it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you have to know the code we reject the modern progressive idea that we should be guilty and willing victims because of our european heritage essentially means we view nonwhites as a threat to our existence and power which is ludicrously paranoid
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not that im planning on getting one anymore but this also pretty much rules out getting a tattoo with something from your own ancient culture if youre scandinavian the aryan brotherhood and european neonazis screwed that up for us note that this still doesnt excuse scandinavians with tribal tattoos
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think thats really always true norse stuff is huge in the world of metal and isnt generally tied to racism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,an odins cross or celtic cross tattoo is strong indicator for someone being a racist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres always that when you run out of meth and need another source of courage why not valhalla
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i have worked with one old guy ate sardines out of a can at his desk every friday and railed about how paul vi as well as john paul were heretic as well as their followers our office had an appreciation day where we went out to red robin for lunch on a friday once and it absolutely incensed him that he wasnt allowed to choose a seafood restaurant the guy was fucking awful he stank to high heaven a slob always complained and every time anyone brought their female spouse in he always tried to give them a hug
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,god damn papists
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are you sure they were radtrads the link provided says there is a difference between between the traditional catholics and radical traditional catholics i grew up catholic and have met some traditional catholics but i dont think ive ever met one that was at least openly radical traditional
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i suspect you havent either dug deeply enough or gained their trust enough not only in the creepy ultraright traditionalist catholic circles but pretty much any farright setting just sit back and listen theres a good chance someone will make some odd statement about jewish people in the same way that you can be pretty damn racist even if you dont shout the n word out your car window when you drive past a black family or lynch people there are plenty of antisemites who dont go all drunkmelgibson all the time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,join us at rcatholicism lots of rad trads and normals
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not really defending the guy but being a christian doesnt mean you cant sin or fuck up especially in catholicism the one thing all christians agree on is were all sinners which is why catholics have mass the rosary and confession im tired of this shit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that def makes him a leader of a hate group
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,chalcedonian wouldnt that be close to greek or perhaps russian orthodox or is he seriously theologically aligned with pregreat schism theology
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you gotta think more along the lines of the inquisition
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,their prophet was married to a year old i dont see how anyone can deny this betrothed at six married and consummated at nine apologists usually claim that she was a very mature nine year old however the text says that she was playing on a swing with friends when he first came to her and that she loved playing with dolls at the time they got married doesnt sound like anything but a child to me the argument against him being a pedophile goes he had many wives and the rest of them were much older than aisha after he took mecca he couldve had many more underaged girls if he had wanted but he did not honestly that makes some sense to me i am fine concluding that he was merely a child rapist and not a legitimate pedophile
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pretty sure david copperfield would have made them reappear by now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cant find an explicit denial im sure there is someone out there who believes it though there is a no planes theory and of course jewsreptilian shape shifters
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,follow me on a journey to a place called rconspiracy dont look any of them in the eyes tho that that seems to set them off for some reason
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my favorite are the flatearthers who say earth is a big bowl and thats why it looks curved flat earthers cant even agree that the earth is flat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i thought it was a like a meme gone off the rails like ninjas flipping out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i mean you can get on a plane and fly across the world and back in a few days to prove the damn thing is at least some kind of circular youd have to be a special kind of nut to still believe its flat in this day and age
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its much easier to understand when you realize some people never grew out of that edgycounterpoint mindset so many of us had as adolescents and just based their adult personalities on it its all they have to feel unique i guess with hate groups just factor in a scape goat to explain why theyre a shitty loser bc its not their fault obviously and you got this whole map imo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so these ideologies are just congregations of pseudointellectuals there must be a lot of confirmation bias and dunningkruger effects going on
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,see climate science denial
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lots of the christians i know who i have talked to about this believe their god is deliberately hiding himself and being omnipotent he does a very good job i find that belief a little confusing but a lot less confusing than people who reject the curvature of the earth which is something you can measure geometrically even on the scale of a single city we fly around the earth in airplanes over the polar caps you can infer the sphericality of the earth just from airplane transit times none of that disproves god none of it proves god at all of course which is the major problem with religion but unlike flat earth it is not disproven
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or even weirder it happened a little bit but those sneaky jews exaggerated it because apparently people would feel way less sympathetic if the nazis had only killed four million jews
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but lets be honest the kind of person to deny the holocaust is not going to be convinced by films and photographs its probably impossible to change their opinion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,reminds me of the flatearther in rconspiracy who asked for a realtime feed of the earth rotating that wasnt run by nasa someone linked him to three separate ones and he then went about explaining why none of those counts either
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,basically thats my understanding source and caveat my wife is an attorney who tried to explain this to me and i never expected this comment to get so big
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you shouldnt be down voted that is exactly how freedom of speech evolved in europe in fact it was the allied powers including the us that originally limited free speech in europe to suppress remaining fascist and extremest groups post wwii
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,who defines hate speech
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,perhaps the legacy of the nazi party has had the effect on europe whilst the nazi defeat did influence the legal landscape european countries mainly did never have much total freedom of speech to begin with for instance freedom of speech whether in imperial germany or nazi germany was nonexistent its simply now that its the nazis which are persecuted rather than the persecutors
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the us has a pretty good track record of allowing those opinions not perfect mind you but better than a lot of the rest of the world
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the next time i meet a smug new englander who gives me shit about being from the south
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i lived in dallas from the until i retired a few years ago it was the hub of the john birch society among other things as dfw became more and more urbanized and therefore more and more like urban areas elsewhere in the country which means relatively younger and more liberal the paranoid right wing started moving out to the surrounding towns groups like the ada in dallas actually tracked this process
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,splc is known to have a hardon for associating anti governmentmilitia groups as hate groups while these terms may not be mutually exclusive splc labels militia groups as hate groups imho if militia groups are hate groups then so are eco terrorists etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikitripleparentheses basically its to identify people of jewish descent to other altrighters
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes they tend to be young disgruntled white males with some education and fairly good tech skills your average user fits the bill pretty well one thing they see as a particular problem in todays politics is that weve become too politically correct and were ignoring what they say are obvious differences between races theyre also super worried about white countries being invaded by nonwhite immigrants thus splitting off and finding new groups they cant just be mainstream rightwingersrepublicans wont cater to their open racism and are too religiously fundamentalist instead they have created a loosely defined collection of alternative right wing groups and news sources
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it used to be worse but they banned a lot of those subs heck it used to be way worse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well lets see the term was popularized by richard b spencer a white identitarian and race realist he started the first alt right blog called alternative right lets see what he has to say equality is bullshit hierarchy is essential the races are different the sexes are different morality matters and degeneracy is real all cultures are not equal and we are not obligated to think they are man is a fallen creature and there is more to life than hollow materialism finally the white race matters
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,who made these guys an authority on what the altright is theyre a large group of people who selfidentify as altright
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,who on the altright would you say is not racist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that tumblr subreddit is a collection of the worst posts found scattered throughout the internet that collection is assembled by people who dont particularly identify with feminism imagine if it was an actual organized subreddit rfeminism with an agreed upon self definition that proclaimed themselves as advocates for male genocide that would be the equivalent rtumblrinaction is people who do not identify as feminist or actively identify as nonfeminist characterizing the movement whereas raltright is a huge organized group of people who do identify as altright defining the meaning of their own movement
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,blm is a hashtag
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hehe its how i met my wife in all seriousnessdespite repent amarillos other craziness i really got a kick out of this stunt because it exposed some city council members members who fancied themselves upstanding members of society at the groups height the self appointed leader of ra tried to run for mayor but i think some one got some revenge and leaked some sordid details of his life of course amarillo is a strange david lynchian town man ive got some stories
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but they have a youtube video where they execute santa i mean its santa
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was surprised by the number of hate music labels not sure if i was expecting many more or many less
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats a thing what the hell is skrewdriver should i forget i heard anything and keep my innocence on this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats some dark racist shit to think people still follow this shit is beyond me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i came here for a hate map left with some awesome rap omg it rhymes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,because i like final fantasy and girls twerking this is a message i can support
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not even a rap fan but i really liked that first one you should put it on spotify
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nice beat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you had me at final fantasy and twerking
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rip uaskmeaboutmyrapsong went to royse city and was never seen again
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,gotta be honest the one set to sephiroths theme is fucking great man but they all have really nice flow
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,brainwashed lions great imagery some really nice writing in there deserves some broad exposure too many syllables for that east texas crowd
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lmao you pulled thru
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in todays day age it might have more to do with plausible deniability i let my dog out every day at this time which happens to be the time the kids run by by sheer coincidence if they could get away with just assaulting people they probably would which is an even worse thought
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont take it out on the poor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hell man ill upvote you just to get you promise not to go im glad you havent seen it i have am native not black but ive been called one by racist idiots hell i am not even almost dark enough but any kind of difference upsets those people i just nod and act friendly i try to convince them through kindness they are wrong about their hate if its a crowd of them though just like youd avoid a crowd of gangbangers youd avoid a crowd of racist idiots crowds are dangerous individuals are normally ok
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a native myself i can tell you they definitely wouldnt welcome you in either camp been beat down by white racists and by black racists the black ones eventually accepted me though as a child because i lived in their neighborhood still would catch shit outside of my neighborhood though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you know what waco stands for we aint comin out every bad thing you could possibly think of happening in a city has happened in waco branch davidians the lubys massacre those bikers killing each other all the drama associated with baylor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,tall goats
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont you mean long horses
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,plus they dont dry your hands nearly as well as a paper towel
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a horrible but potentially interesting social experiment just came to mind what would happen if you claimed to have found a lost warehouse full of precivil war slave grownpicked cotton what types of nasty nut jobs would come out of the woodwork to buy that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,organic too my social club is trying to go green
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i like to think they would have accepted riker as their own
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,likewhats their point it really seems like their point is vikings are cool we wanna be vikings
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i get that feeling a lot too from this quote alone i would think that they just like the idea of their ancestors being manly vikings but they admit that their ancestors being purely vikings isnt possible like idk maybe they just like vikings a lot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you must be swift as a coursing river
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so its basically white power fight club
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont remember those lyrics in mulan
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not really hate either
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not seeing any racism here if i copypastad this and put it on rgetmotivated it would get upvoted i guess take charge of your life get off your ass and get shit done is now racist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont know that sounds like they dont think they should have white guilt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,tyr wrote a song called shadow of the swastika specifically because of the fact that the genre and specifically their band has been accused of being neonazis its a hard image to shake and metal bands and fans are constantly frustrated by the association so yeah those who like it are aware that its not racist but many in the general public are not so understanding unfortunately
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,varg would like a word with you on a more serious note i agree entirely the exception being norwegian black metal is pretty obsessed with viking shit and also racist shit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,kinda reminds me of how people think muslim isis the same could be said about metalheads or even skinheads and racism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,man it really disappointed me when i found out a lot of cool norse shit is associated with racists
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what shit i wanted to get a celtic cross they look cool
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,keep in mind all norse symbolism does not have racist connotations if you see someone wearing a thors hammer they are most likely just really into listening to metal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,next theyre gonna huff silver spray paint
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah defintely a lot of vatican ii was the work of the devil we cant trust the pope etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no i have quite a few close friends who are radtrad and have been in settings with groups of them not using this anecdotal experience as proof but based on your wording im guessing you dont have any personal experience with this topic
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i frequent there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,tolerating divorced people is a hallmark of the wishywashy vernacular mass catholics that gibson is rallying against back in the bad old days or maybe still technically im not catholic anymore if you got divorced no more communion for you its not quite like an antigay family values preacher getting caught on rentboycom but its up there with hypocrisy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for this a lot of people forget sin is universal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the long con
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hes holding them hostage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people believing that never happened is proof enough for me to afirm that reptilian aliens are definitely among us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,those meddling jews
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what if the bowl actually wraps around where all the edges actually touch that would explain how people have flown around the world gasp we did it reddit we have solved the mystery checkmate sphericalearthers the planet is is actually a giant closed bowl
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe they are right like we live on upside down bowls that are resting on each others rims
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or what about the fact that i can facetime someone in japan in the middle of the day and clearly see that it is nighttime there do they think timezones are fake or something i seriously want a true flat earth believer to do a serious ama or something
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so like rpolitics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,without the documentation more might have been persuaded though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you deny the holocaust in hungary or germany the police can knock down your door and arrest you they mostly do it to year old grannies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i have a feeling he is not being downvoted because of his position on how it evolved but on the second half of his post which states that it is definitely not okay to incite hatred toward certain groups because this statement disregards the consequences of such an attitude such as selective enforcement of the law nobody gets upset when you incite hatred towards nazis for good reason in europe even though that is hate speech by the definition provided
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,isnt limited free speech a bit of a misnomer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the legislations eg in the uk or germany
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there is illegal speech in the us as well there is libel harassment obscenity secrecy the same kind of people who decide what is and isnt legal speech in the us do so in europe courts and lawmakers just with a different set of rules
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,exactly theres no way to draw the line on what is just criticism vs hate speech as an american i believe that as long as you are not actually taking action against whatever group you hate you can sit around and have your monthly meetings about why you hate gaysblack peoplewhite people makes you an asshole but being an asshole aint illegal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in this particular incidence the southern poverty law center httpswwwsplcenterorgfightinghate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah the other day i was reading the wikipedia page on operation gladio b a cia operation in the funding terrorists and i cried a little freedom tear that we live in a country where we can freely criticize our government like that httpsenwikipediaorgwikisibeledmondsoperationgladiob
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the area surrounding dallas is just littered with kkk affiliates scary
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,antisemites to other antisemites
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nah its worse than it has ever been racist scum feels empowered by their shit opinions no longer being on the fringe given a national platform by the republican nominee places like ildouche further normalize and amplify this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i actually grabbed raltright via redditrequest not too long ago figured id turn it into a discussion sub for looking at the movement critically
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you say this like an upstanding citizen cant frequent a swingers club
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no offense but engaging in consensual adult sex doesnt make you not a upstanding member of society in a lot of peoples eyes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,skrewdriver was a punkoi band really quite excellent actually unfortunately the lead singer had some dumb ideas and brought in some racist skinheads to replace band members from then on they were perhaps the most well known white power band i wont link any of the racist bs for obvious reasons but here is what they sounded like before going nutty
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as an asian indian thats been called a sand nigga i know exactly what you mean funny thing is the guy who said this was inaccurate despite him doing his best to include as many races as he can to insult me referring to his dig at both black and middleeastern people im neither
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,then i guess we india indians have to create our hate group now who will we hate on hmm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am a journalist whos written a lot about the lake waco murders in the late there was a big texas monthly story about it recently anyway the cops in waco know my damn name i have to drive from austin to dallas frequently enough that i basically hold my breath until im outta that hellhole
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and then you dont have said paper towel to open filthy restroom door
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you just gave me a business idea
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well if you want im sure theres all sorts of civil war and before clothing in museums that can be stolen and recycled into modern cloth most surplus cotton bales though if they werent made into clothes got turned into gun cotton in the many many wars that followed but if all you want is cotton harvested by slave labor thats super easy httpwwwcottoncampaignorgblog maybe they could add value by including video of an uppity slave being beaten for not making quota and promising to do better so that youll have the cotton for your new towels of course unless you know the language for all anyone knows it could be some turkish bdsm porn with changed subtitles lol
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cotton is organic so i would imagine it would break down to the point of being completely useless in years anyone who showed up to buy that would be a complete idiot just by definition
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would for the historic significance
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,literally nobody said the above comment was racist did you read any of the comments i guess take charge of your life get off your ass and get shit done is now racist yes thats it everyone was calling that website racist because of the motivational posts they made you got it s um no wtf the website itself is clearly racist and not because of this motivational post they say to be a viking you have to be white and they sell white pride shirts and other garbage thats why people are saying its racist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well if it makes you feel any better ancient norse people probably werent some of the nicest people either
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your best bet then is talking to a reputable tattoo artist and discuss your options on how to tastefully go about it maybe ask rtattoos hopefully youre not also a meteorologist and fond of thunderbolts as well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,get a celtic knot unless hate groups have also ruined those
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,witness me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive heard it plenty firsthand formerly a seminarian who ran in trad circles its quite real
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a persistent urban legend is that httpwwwsnopescomrumorsisraelasp complete antisemitic nonsense of course but it suits certain white supremacist and arab antisemitic narratives about israeli influence on us policy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the world is a dyson sphere and our sun is actually inside the planet
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its mostly because the year old grannies dont bother to get a lawyer and then deny the claim in public the law is only effective to catch stupid or serial holocaust deniers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the difference is that any infringement on speech in the us must be content and viewpoint neutral this is clearly not the case with hate speech laws in europe
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,those cause actual noticeable provable damage and have well grounded and established legal precedence obscenity even is barely if ever enforced or controlled
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres no way to draw the line on what is just criticism vs hate speech but courts have been drawing that line for decades now i personally disagree with where that line is but i dont think it is fair to say that it is impossible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but not the city itself really certainly not the way it used to be incidentally when people talk about the klan as if it were a purely southern phenomenon i point out that at the peak of kkk membership in the the state with the largest membership was indiana my irish catholic grandfather from indianapolis remembered the massive whitesheeted parades very well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dude back in the day there were subs called coontown greatapes and literally gasthekikes td popping up on the front page was just replaced by fph doing the same back then heck at least those things still get protected by free speech laws but jailbait is borderline illegal and it was a sub true some of the things i listed arent racial but its hate speech all the same also i was always just talking about reddit i agree out in the real world its worse now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you clearly know nothing about west texas
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes but not enough people to be the majority of people shit look at the clintons it is fairly obvious through loads of conjecture that they have some sort of open relationship but they cant just come out and say that itd be a shit show
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably pakistan dudes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no paper towels time to koolaid man this door
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is the correct answer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lie to racist nut jobs about slave picked cotton in order to rip them off
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,honey is organic and never breaks down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i do like thunder
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that was my other idea wanted one on the back of my hand
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i use to think about the idea of a hollow earth it was an interesting concept that i would just mull around in my head sad to know some people have took the idea off the deep end
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,those terms seem redundant
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but there are edge cases to that as well just as there are to hate speech laws where we draw the line is not an unsolvable problem im not even defending europes speech laws i think they are ineffective and would get rid of basically all of them if it were just up to me im just saying that the standard who watches the watchmen response to this topic is not a good argument
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the actual damage of hate speech against minorities were the lives of millions of our grandparents generation the potential for huge damage is there and people are in favour of limiting free speech to curb that danger i get that the americans arent but i also get why the europeans are also from a historical point of view
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or most of america really
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes you set up a website like whitepowerblahblahcom or some shit put in actual time and hard work to make a professional looking website not just some basic html page that looks like it was created in the something professional looking then you add a shopping platform to the store have a few basic white pride type items in your shop target mailing lists of known hate organizations and try to get as many people to suscribe as possible then you come out with a limited edition set of these slave picked cotton shirts say a set of or something to increase the perceived value and scarcity of such an item you make a homepage banner or possibly a pop up to put it in the face of the user on the other end you give these shirts their own fancy page when you click on the item have a detailed backstory about where you found the cotton in an old barn on your property or something say that you verified that it was original slave picked cotton set the shirt price to dollars boom watch the money come in then around christmas time you send another email saying that another barn full of cotton has been found and to commemorate the event you have created a special holiday edition version of the shirt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a trefoil on the back of the hand kinda reminds me of the triforce but a lot classier i like that idea
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or most of human society throughout history
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you put hard work in time to make sure the website looks professional everyone will know its a fake
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or better yet claim that the shirts were made from the recycled uniforms of confederate soldiers and how they can wear a piece of their own southern pride if there is one thing racists love its confederate soldier uniforms
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,put in actual time and hard work to make a professional looking website not just some basic html page that looks like it was created in the but then the crazies wouldnt trust it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ill save you some energy its already been httpamericanvikingscomproducts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you for your original content op ive added to your user flair as gratitude if you didnt already have official subreddit flair for the readers the poster has provided you with information regarding where or how they got the data source and the tool used to generate the visual tools for this post to ensure this information isnt buried i have stickied this link below for your convenience i hope this sticky assists you in having an informed discussion in this thread or inspires you to remix this data for more information please httpswwwredditcomrdataisbeautifulwikiflairwikiocflair
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so you picked one issue one demographic and one sort of silly measurement and youre making a case for something not sure what but something are you trying to say that the electoral college gives extra credit for those that like where they live are of european decent and arent afraid to protect themselves sounds about right to me the electoral college isnt meant to mirror your social agenda color of your skin or your affinity for the second amendment its designed to ensure that no one geographic collection of people mostly consumers can have undo influence over the rest of the population mostly producers this just comes off as sour grapes to me and im not a republican and i probably despise donald trump more than you do this data is not particularly useful tbh its also common knowledge wrapped in an agenda your time would have better spent documenting the number of democrats who thought hillary was either a bad choice or a lock and didnt show up to vote as a result
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what is it with this subreddit a lot of people lately trying to just post political stuff this post is a lie it is leaving you with the false impression that the electoral college doesnt represent the people of course this would not even be a thing if hilary won
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i feel like this needs more context like also showing the number of voter turnout is its really skewed if of the voterturnout is made up of minorities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im curious where your data originated the sample size and how the sampling was performed how are you identifying the population of actual gun owners if its based on background checks alone your numbers will be extremely low and if its based on selfreporting then i can say anecdotally that the vast majority of gun owners arent going to self report ownership and will even lie so they dont end up on some list im inclined to highly mistrust your data just because it seems lower than other estimates that are also overly conservative and there needs to be a lot more context for this to even come close to seeming legitimate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the electoral college was never supposed to represent americans perfectly it was meant to represent america trump didnt win the majority of americans but that isnt the point the point is that if states want one thing and states want another but have insanely large cities then the other states dont get trampled over measuring individuals in relation to the electoral college is ignoring its primary purpose
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so what your saying are minorities make up a minority if the electoral college
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as long as they cast their votes in the manner that the state they represent want i could really care less about their demographic or personal beliefs the ec could be men women or all cocker spaniels i would prefer the cocker spaniels though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i agree and identify with you completely i used to be skeptical about the electoral college years ago when i first learned of its existance over time though ive begun to understand its value i know its hard for some people to get their heads around but its actually not a good thing to disenfranchise the nearly half of america who do not live in the densely populated coastal areas the other america has different priorities and they need to be heard anyone who is a staunch democratbitter hillarybernie voter who thinks those flyover state losers should just be ignored needs to look deeper first of all the sense of being ignored is what drove those people many of which who actually voted for obama believe it or not to put a complete lunatic like trump in office now you might like to blame the electoral college or the russians for that but the fact is there was a powerful surge of sentiment there that wasnt going to just go away if not trump it may well have been one of the other gop candidates if hillary had won it would have turned the temperature up beyond boil for those folks because hillary was never going to convince any of them she is anything other than a political automaton she doesnt have of bills charisma she would have been a one term president guaranteed and then you would have gotten and even more powerful trumpian backlash in the other point i want to make is that other america that coastal liberals are so fond of speaking about derisively they are the people who actually make this country function all of the sitcom writers bloggers nyc graphic artists and california app developers could die tomorrow and civilization would carry on if all the truck drivers farmers electricians plumbers etc die off tomorrow store shelves would be empty inside of a week and society would begin to collapse and guess who would suffer the most and be looted and pillaged first the fixie riding ipad prousing gluten free snowflakes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh so you are trying to use three specifically found meaningless points to try to lie i thought it was just bad statistics i notice you didnt use income religion age or some other demographic that is actually more important oh yeah because that doesnt fit your narrative yes it is a trump and hilary thing you would not be here if hillary won in november
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do you really want the ec to represent the average american or america because i think the ec should be better than the average american therefore less minorities is a plus in my book
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i looked up the guardians report you cited which says it used the unpublished harvardnortheastern survey result summary obtained exclusively by the guardian and the trace so the data and way it was obtained isnt even available to vet except to the reporting media outlet and an antigun propaganda outlet funded by bloomberg did you know that when you started or did you just grab some survey result that makes unverifiable claims that enabled you to push an agenda
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i guess in my opinion ice cream causes small pox which is what people thought years ago by gathering up statistics the way you are doing nah we both know in my opinion is your way of trying to say that since you have proved nothing here in regards to the electoral college not representing the people you want the burden of proof to be on me and not you and until i prove that they are represented then it is just in my opinion nice try
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,at first i thought you were just showing bad statistics upon talking to you i then realize that you are purposely trying to mislead people into thinking the electoral college doesnt represent the people now it appears as if you are trying to say the candidates will only hear the percentage of minorities that are on the electoral college without even any statistics maybe hopefully i misunderstood that last point
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you are making a completely different statement than what you are demonstrating in your post saying that the whole premise of the electoral college does not give us a true democracy is a different statement than saying that the electors on the electoral college dont represent the voters
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hmm wonder what caused the big drop off in elderly working as some sort of carer something related to medicare or just the changes to the survey itself
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,from age onwards at least is retired if any of you have done please share the secret
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pretty sure this is the original source
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,very nicely done
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rfinancialindependence at that age probably got a large inheritance or life insurance payout invest it well and youre set for life

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for this information
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not really your problem you are the op after all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wait maybe im reading it wrong but what exactly is it finding racist is it reports words what makes up the numbers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the author has predetermined certain people to be racist dependent on their joining a specific subreddit and deemed every time they interact with another subreddit those forums become more racist seems to be more of a peopletracker or stalking than any sort of useful data index
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wonder how accurately the map reflects coverage i moved from canada to trinidad recently and discovered that google maps was notoriously unreliable on the island for identifying street names etc the map in the op indicates that there are patches of coverage in trinidad but in fact the blue areas represent usersubmitted photographs which arent really street view as we understand it in north america obviously an island of million people is not and should not be high on the list of priorities for the google maps team and im sure it would be a pain to import the equipment necessary to properly cover the island but it does leave me wondering about other areas in the op map and whether theyre truly covered nevertheless thanks for the map
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,places that are covered are typically covered well i am from a small italian town and i cant believe the details in street view but there are exceptions some places adopted a diy approach and then there are places that raised issues

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id love to see this broken down by medicaid medicare marketplace and private insurance categories
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that is because it became illegal to be uninsured just because more people are insured doesnt mean more people can afford it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,given the rise were seeing in insurance prices im curious as to if this trend continues through and start of or if its slowly reversing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,used the brand new data at the from the us census bureau to show the percent uninsured by county over six years the main provisions of obamacare took place in which led to the most dramatic change used to make the map in the then used httpnytimesgithubiosvgcrowbar to extract the svg for cleanup in adobe illustrator animation was done in photoshop this ran with a here if anyone cares to read
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i notice how it stopped at before obamacare started to collapse this is not data we are looking at it is a political message
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,census data takes a while to collect and process it almost always runs a year behind
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe we dont have data yet the year just barely ended
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i just sent this to someone else who said roughly the same thing if that is the case then showing this data is misleading most people know that expenses for obamacare have risen in the last year risen by a lot that would be like like showing housing price data in mar and saying oh we dont have data for so it is okay to show you house prices keep going up and up and up in mar we all knew something was wrong with the housing market
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if that is the case then showing this data is misleading most people know that expenses for obamacare have risen in the last year risen by a lot that would be like like showing housing price data in mar and saying oh we dont have data for so it is okay to show you house prices keep going up and up and up in mar we all knew something was wrong with the housing market
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i get the gist of your point but this is still the best and most recent available data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i really hope nobody contests this but the pessimists will
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its warmer too how fantastic is that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the homicide rate for italy in was that seems really high wikipedia mentions warring between city states does anyone know what was happening in italy at that time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is some great information
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i like a lot of those charts but the way they are presented on this website is horrible too small to read clicking on them often doesnt take you to where you expect to go even got a blank page once list of sources is referred to constantly but very hard to find and its close to unbearable on mobile some charts are a little odd for my taste like the first historical death rate one should imo be ordered by date and not the death rate a bar plot is perhaps not the best choice here the geography between charts is also wildly inconsistent some show the whole world some only show a few countries netherlands gets a lot of attention i understand you have to work with the data you have but perhaps it should be pointed out that some of those charts are more applicable to certain regions than worldwide loving the optimistic numbers though ive long suspected this and its a relief to see the world is indeed an increasingly happy place

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i find this phenomenon about politics to be true we are more critical of the people we dont like than we should and we are less critical of the people we like than we should you bring up a rhetorical question that has an implied answer when obama was president i think i fell into the same trap you are in i am glad he is gone i dont really like trump but i dont really dislike him either i think he has been helping me see things clearer had somebody been in there i liked a lot i probably would have been on the opposite side as you being less critical of that person than i should be

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i love every time this site shows up on reddit ive refferenced it dozens of times in discussions it really gets the point across that causation is not causality
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not really the correlation vs causation problem this illustrates more the problem of multiple comparisons given a large enough dataset you can always find false positives ie statistically significant when naively applied correlations which are meaningless because of the number of comparisons made

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was squinting trying to find ireland in the outer rings like where is it then i saw it smack bang in the middle k
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is a bit misleading at least because the us government owes me about in treasuries
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this data is really ugly to be honest its incredibly frustrating to find any country that is not in the middle
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all of the other than ireland and japan countries with a high amount of debt owed per person are developed nations like the united states austria united kingdom italy germany and others like ireland an japan wouldnt be or am i just crazy and theyre suddenly super undeveloped i do know that ireland isnt the richest but its definitely not the most poor either and japan
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is of course interesting but for comparison a version where you normalize this value by the per capita gdp of the country would be much more instructive that shows the real relative burden of debt on the countries citizenry for example syria would have to put its entire gdp in to its debt every year for years to pay it off while for the us we would only have to do that for about months or so not counting interest rates which dramatically increase this value for syria and a little bit for the us so if everyone is putting all they have in to it this debt falls on your shoulders only for months in the us while it will go on for years for syria
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why is puerto rico counted as its own country in this chart whos the president of puerto rico whats the name of puerto ricos currency whats the central bank of puerto rico
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,short answer none of it its your countrys debt not yours this post is misleading edit the post is misleading not the data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is misleading government debt works on a macro level not the same way a personal debt does
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and because debt is the other side of the coin from wealth we need to know how much of each countrys wealth rests on your shoulders in the us its about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the thumbnail looked like a pizza but when i opened it was much more concerning than a pizza
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it seems a little misleading to say that this is a visual representation of what each person owes to its country im assuming that this is national debt per capita or in other words how much money the country has borrowed divided by the number of people who live in it correct me if im wrong
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,debt per person should be a bad thing but the countries without it seem to be on average worse off ones
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how many people would prefer to be relatively free of debt as a citizen of liberia tajikistanor the congo as opposed to living with all that debt as a citizen of any of the top debtor countries
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this seems incredibly high for canada considering our total debt is about trillion dollars according to the government website for the budget and we have about million people for the same period this give per person which is a huge difference there is no way we took on an additional worth of debt per person in a year sources
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,handled rationally debt is the cornerstone of a functioning economy and your best friend it provides liquidity flexibility and a platform for investment in the future according to this map for instance the average debt an american citizen is shouldering is less than a single years gdp
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how is chinas debt per capita is so low between china and the us the pop difference is by a factor of about billion vs million yet the dept per capita is different by a factor of vs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,attempting to quantify debt of sovereignties in this way can be very misleading sovereign debt in global financial markets works differently than most people understand this debt is not like what you find yourself when you run up a credit card without paying off the balance nope it is essentially leverage a tool that almost every single person and corporation uses strategy often times indefinitely for the record leverage is no indicator of economic health whatsoever the health is indicated by what type of leverage are youoverleveraged or not it is important to understand this because while it makes for an interesting anecdote there are a lot people who are going to look at the us on this chart and be demoralized when in fact the us is in relatively good shapedespite the numerals attached here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so would you rather live in one of the prosperous countries in the center with high debt or the lowdebt countries full of misery on the perimeter maybe high national debt isnt such a terrible thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in case anybody is searching for china they are on the outer ring at oclock with of debt per person considering their huge surplus of us dollars exceeds that amount by magnitudes its like they have a credit card with debt but their checking account could pay it off without a problem thats not the same kind of debt as the other nations on this chart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hmm maybe for christmas i can pay off ugandas national debt delusional self
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can someone explain why chile and argentina have very little debt seems like an anomaly among developed countries
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,russia has never looked so it is at the far left edge around oclock for those who cant find it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,made using arcgis sources public debt and gdp data source various international monetary fund world bank and cia world factbook population data world bank estimate httpdataworldbankorgindicatorsppoptotl calculations debt owed by each citizen is total public debt divided by population public debt is defined as generally defined as the amount of total debt owed by a central government not other government agencies or other parts of the public sector
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the countries and sizes of debts dont seem to match up with the httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofcountriesbyexternaldebt ranking countries external debt per capita in the per capita debt listing the highest in rank order are luxemburg monaco iceland singapore switzerland and the uk numbers are based on dated reports the disparity in the sizes of the debts listed in wiki vs those in the drawing make me wonder at the date of the figures used to make the graphic
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so who owns the debt like if a country owns another countries debt shouldnt they have negative debt or are countries debt owned by individuals
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im really surprised by singapore because they have one of the lowest personal income tax rates of any nation if they have so much debt youd think they would raise taxes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wouldnt this be even more telling if the colors were comparing the debt dividend against median income
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,some bs here as well i know for a fact congo has a lot more debt as belgium forfeits tons of it each year as development aid
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would love to see this adjusted with respect to the cost of living in that country cpi
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but but but what happened to the usa is the only place with debt its these worst
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can you also then weight this by average salary in the relevant country its interesting anyway but if i were a gabonian i doubt i would be terribly happy at a share of national debt being only a third of a british person if it was effectively as expensive for me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i find it interesting that israels silhuette includes gaza but not the west bank or the golan heights over which israel has more control
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can someone explain how a country like norway is in debt i realize that this graphic is a bit misleading but i was under the impression that norway makes a huge amount of money from oil
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,two things the first is that we need a graphic like this but broken down by the number of tax payers as we know babies and senior citizens dont pay taxes the second is we need a graphic of how much has been promised to pay as the retirement obligations arent part of the national debt side note the usa is in worse shape that greece according to this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,maybe im crazy but a better measure is the amount of debt dividend by population shouldnt that be divided by population
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its seemingly illogical that some of the best places to live are the most indebted is there any correlation between a countrys debt per capita and their living standards
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so white people owe money to their country most other people dont ive known that for years man
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is interesting but how would the rankings change if it was based on that countrys average incomewage per person vs the debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the formula is divided by population but the total population doesnt pay taxes they withdraw from the system so as a tax payer the burden is higher than showing on the map
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,debt aint shit when you factor in the capital like sure america has a lot of debt but we have all kinds of stuff for example we could liquidate all the stuff in california and have a surplus
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,unfortunately the figure listed for the usa is simply incorrect usd people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i agree with the idea of using a ratio but population is the wrong one first it gives the impression that someday someone might show up to collect that money from you which is preposterous also while the average japanese person is on the hook for more than she makes in a year so is the average cabo verdean the article makes the point that rich countries are more able to find creditors but the reason is that theyre more able to pay thus a better ratio to useand the one that is actually more commonly used by economistsis public debt as a percentage of gdp that said there is confusion with that as well there are huge differences in the types of debt out there for example the us is in a very good position to manage its debt despite having more than of its gdp in debt there are a few reasons for this first the us has full control over its monetary and fiscal policies which is not the case for the euro area countries for example and there is very high demand for safe us dollardenominated assetsits considered to be among the safest assets out there the result is that us government bonds offer very low interest ratesat or near the level of inflation and whats more investors are happy to get us bonds denominated in us dollars so even if the value of the dollar takes a nosedive the us government still owes the same amount by contrast lets say youre greece you dont have full control of your monetary policy and your fiscal policy is constrained by eu regulations and requirements imposed by the imf your bonds are priced in euros which is good because its your currency the only problem is that you share that currency with a whole slew of other countries and most of them are considered less risky that means you are going to have to offer high interest rates to get any takers and since nobody can really imagine how your country is going to pull itself out of its crisis even then it doesnt mattersomeone can offer to pay you interest and it doesnt matter if you dont believe theyll ever pay anything then theres another country type worth considering lets use barbados as an example but there are tons of them barbados uses the barbadian dollar which is actually worth half of a us dollar right now the bbd is pegged but the central bank of barbados could revalueat the cost of losing the safety that comes from the pegged exchange rate once you revalue your currency people tend not to have as much confidence in the new rate more importantly nobody wants barbadian dollars or assets denominated in barbadian dollars unless youre going to barbados on holiday theres not much to do with them so investors demand that bonds issued by the government be denominated in a currency they actually wantnamely us dollars and that means that while the barbadian central bank could decide to rescind their peg tomorrow and devalue their currency they would owe more money to their creditorsnot less so while their exports might do better and more tourists might show up they would have higher public debt and of course barbadian bonds are nowhere near the safest assets you can buy that are denominated in us dollars they are in fact considered junk bonds by rating agencies so in short this is a nicely drawn infographic but it does not nearly capture the reality of public debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,some of these you do realize is more keystrokes than right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,go team ireland second is a good spot but im guessing the way our taoiseach is fucking is over well be number one in no time m
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so we could like contract our citizens out to other countries for a couple years and pay off all our debt bonus those people get to spend a couple years abroad gaining invaluable experience
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i have been bombarded with news about the chinese debt crisis can someone help me find china on this snowball
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so who is all of this money loaned from then china i presume but for reals tho i cant imagine that everyone owes china that much
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was hoping this would be a fun thing where i could just enter my email address and find out how much i owe specifically as an individual
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,at least in the us bonds market every dollar of public debt represents an investment in the growth potential of the us economy if you have to park public finance amounts of assets somewhere its hard to find a less risky place
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if there are million us citizens and each owes thousand dollars then that equals out to or just over trillion dollars im too lazy and itd be too time consuming for me to do this for every country on this map but id guess it to be pretty near the trillion dollar mark and even if its half that im pretty sure there isnt even close to that amount of money in circulation at any given time that alone gives off the impression that something isnt working right unless of course keeping people in perpetual slavery was in fact the design in which case its working perfectly fine hypothetically if there are only total in circulation at a given time and i hand out each to ten different countries with the expectancy that they return to me each in one years time how will they pay me back when in total i am expecting to receive do you borrow more money from other countries again while the national debts climb and climb and ordinary citizens carry the burden please feel free to correct and enlighten me if im wrong but for damn sure none of it seems all that right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,k bloody bonkers mates that s the price of a new basic model of citigo škoda make more škodas then
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why are us and canada about the same but we have been fightingfunding wars what are they in debt for
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to illustrate relative burden rather than the strength of dollars and the relative per capital borrowing capacity of nations figures should be both ppp adjusted and debt service per person per year should be shown
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,irelands figures are either out of date or too high httpwwwtradingeconomicscomirelandgovernmentdebttogdp
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,some pay taxes all will die each generation dumps debt on the next because those not born or too young cant vote which is very convenient in the usa the current regime borrowed more than all the others combined and will hand it off to the next regime in the most democratic way possible which is comical all the people bragging about their love for their children then screwing them with debt so those same people can enjoy all kinds of things in the present that theyll never pay for laughable if it werent so pathetic
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,government debt is a scam designed by central banking to keep everyone enslaved with taxation its all lies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,almost all of the debt depicted is owed to very rich people with the few exceptions being things like pension funds and others when steps are taken as they have been in greece to force payment its always poor people that are made to suffer the most consequences furthermore the governments that enter into the agreement to go into debt are under the complete control of rich people who create the political environment that causes these countries to choose to go into debt the rich know that they can always go back and force these governments to pay because they control them there is almost no risk on their part even furthermore all that capital being tied up in interest bearing investments debt is money not flowing into investments that build the economy create jobs and pay salaries indebtedness that term alone says it all creates a condition of servitude rather than partnership rich people would much rather have slaves than partners
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sorry stupid question how is it possible that every country in the world has debt someone has to be in the green i dont get it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you are really young you owe the most debt old folks and cadavers wont be made to pay the debt they piled up while they were young and lived
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for the us dont forget to double it because only half of people pay ney federal tax so for half of the us the debt is effectively zero for the other half its
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,between my student loans car loan and credit cards that usa is accurate for me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for norway which has per capita you also have to take into account the pension fund which is about per capita so the gov actually owes me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i had no idea russia was so financially sound i guess going through an entire collapse years ago wasnt all bad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i love how they equally divide the debt insinuating that i am responsible for this amount of debt i believe in only looking at debt responsibility individually you pay off yours because i have no responsibility for what you spend your money on
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,feels bad man when you owe the average of your own country student loan forgiveness please save me was it really worth being a doctor if i owe my government additionally if im providing goods and services my country as a doctor i feel that should cut my debt in half
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,damn thought us would be worse like not sure where i pulled that figure from damn japan why population count
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont get how countries are run like this debt of these magnitudes just seems incredibly irresponsible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,debt is created it isnt a real thing that is owed the us could just erase ours and no one would need to be paid back
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it was something like or when i was in grade school years ago born into responsibility of debt yet no way to reduce it even though i pay taxes a strange thing to debate who is gonna collect haiti who is going to collect money from them and eliminate their debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that feel when your personal share of national debt is half as much as your actual personal debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,too bad politicians do things that the populace has zero control over if we had a referendum on going to war in syria among others would we have done so that was a ton of money
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am not responsible for any of the debt whatsoever i pay my taxes the people who spend our tax dollars flubbed it up and thats on them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,anyone know why its so high
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same with austria but then i noticed that it should be in the list countries where people owe the most but it got spelled wrong as australia rip sorry bad english
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wont you get big money from apple son
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i did the math and in current us dollars its actually more around
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,irelands figures are either out of date or too high httpwwwtradingeconomicscomirelandgovernmentdebttogdp
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a lot of it falls apart when you realize of the debt is owed by us to us trillion debt owed by one part of the government to another part of the government trillion gdp owed by americans to other americans trillion gdp owed by americans to foreign holders trillion gdphttpwwwtreasurydirectgovnpdebtcurrent total debt the vast amount of the debt is owed by us to us which is not what we usually think about when we talk about people being in debt and while its not correct politically to look at the financial net it leaves trillion gdp owed by americans to foreign holders then you also should not forget that for every dollar we owe them they owe us ¢ trillion gdp we owe them trillion gdp they owe us that leaves a net us debt of trillion gdp we owe them ignoring all these accounting tricks of who owes a net of amount of how much to whom the real problem with debt is the fact that it has to be paid each year each year of the federal budget goes to interest on the debt without that interest you could double the education budget double the housing and community budget double the transportation budget all at the same the debt while important is not a crisis which is why its not the issue that some people believe it should be i believe that the debt should be zero i believe that interest payments on debt should be eliminated in order to be used for other spending and social programs but i also believe that the government should borrow when the economy is poor and pay it back when times are good i am in favor of higher taxes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when you buy a bond of dollars you are essential holding the governments debt that is what this means when it pays you the back they are no longer in debt to you so theoretically not wanting to collect your debt or in other words pay the government without expecting to be paid back each citizen would have to pay if all debt were to be eliminated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its also misleading because in many countries the tax rate is progressive in of the income taxes paid are paid by of the work force whatever portion of the debt is paid by individuals is not distributed evenly over a nations population
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and in norway everyone owns the state yet the state holds per person in the oil found so i think we are covered
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not really misleading as its not explicitly stating that its externally held debt the implications may be different but debt is still debt and if you have too much day it means that if it cant be paid taxpayers or your grandchildrenchildrens livelihoods will pay it would be interesting though to see variations of this visualization though im thinking internal debt external debt also debt adjusted for gdp per capital would be nice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what a horrible investment
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its really the worst way to present any of this data naturally spatial relationship between countries lets distribute them all in a hyperbolic disc but leave their shapes in tact rotated and disproportionately scaled excellent now nothing of any consistency is conveyed visually still it does look neat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,idk i went in looking for albania and found it relatively quickly
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its just badly worded they mean that all the other countries with high debt are developed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if the developed nations have all the debt who do they owe bank of bangladesh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why did you just quote the text but put in the effort to take out some countries genuinely curious
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also isnt this ignoring how much debt the us owes to itself and its citizens
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ok thats extremely misleading country population and resource requirement cost of living are all relevant
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in other words adjusted for purchasing power national debt per person divided by average annual income
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,while for the us if we would only have to do that for about months or so this sentence makes no sense leave it to reddit to upvote even if it were reconstructed to make sense it would almost certainly be false
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,puerto rico is sortakindamaybe the us or sortakindamaybe its own country
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,because it has its own debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the nation owed money before i was born it will owe money after i die the money was was never owed to me and i dont owe it to nation this kind of graphic continues to promote the idea that home economics business economics government economics and fiat currency economics are all similar and can be compared to one another its completely false and to display such a graphics is httpsenwikipediaorgwikinotevenwrong but it helps promote a political faction
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the title might be but the data itself has plenty of meaning
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which makes it a perfect tool to manipulate people into thinking that the government is reckless with money
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nothing here suggests otherwise per capita burden isnt intended to imply this is what each person literally owes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not a bad thing think about it this way most folks with a mortgage have more debt than folks without but they are also more well off
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,debt is paid off with income richer countries have higher income so can more easily pay off debts this chart would probably work better if it took income into account
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont forget to an african country is worse than for an american
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whos better off a homeless dude living on the streets who cant afford food and has no debt or someone whos in debt because they just bought a nice home for their family
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,countries better off economically will be charged less interest therefore able to take on larger amounts of debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,heres the thing right looking at that debt like it is something to be paid off is completely misleading because it doesnt have to be paid by anyone government issues bonds for the sole purpose of controlling interest and when it wants to pay it off and can just create money to do so government does not need to borrow to spend because who would they borrow from they control the supply of the currency they spend in no one else has the capacity to permanently produce currency banks create money whenever they lend but it sums to zero long term government created money when they want to spend and when they run a deficit theyll often issue bonds after the fact for people to invest their spare cash into as a way of offsetting inflation and to set a minimum level of interest anyone can offer in the economy if youre offering a lower interest rate than government bonds do no one is going to give you their money another thing to consider looking at a government spending more than it taxes as a deficit and taxing more than it spend as a surplus gives the impression that a surplus is something to strive for in a country like the us where you run a current account deficit you import more than you export the government continually running a surplus means it is constantly draining money from the private sector for no reason when it taxes us dollars there is no difference between it taking that money and putting in an account somewhere or just destroying it as it is taxed and creating it when it is spent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not that theyre frugal its that no one will loan the liberian government money because they dont trust them to pay it back
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,these countries dont have a good credit theres nothing in particular that forbids a developed nation from aiming at low debt practically its pretty hard though as evidenced by the trouble with swiss franc of it used to be goldbacked but the percentage had to be reduced because it made the swiss franc appreciate too much against the euro which started to hurt swiss exports case in point in finland the government got the debt to of gdp with basically nokia money unfortunately after financial trouble the next government then decided to borrow to boost economic growth hoping that the gains from growth would offset the borrowing that never happened and the debt is now over of gdp the eurozone stability and growth pact limit which is kind of a paper tiger because its flouted by a lot of countries though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not sure youll have to ask the future generations theyre the ones who are going to have to pay it back for us today of course its awesome to live high and mighty and free without having to pay for it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,provincial debt municipal debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,different rates
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,china is a net creditor as opposed to being a net debtor nation like the us that is not to say that china does not have a lot of debt its just that most of its debt is not external rather it is internal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,leverage is a good thing but needs to be wielded intelligently poorly managed debt leads to implosions like the housing crash
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theyve devalued their currency for many years leading to very low exchange rate between us and them they also get a ton of work done for much less money because labor is so much cheaper there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what do you think about taking the numbers you have here and normalizing it for average income the us would end up in the neighborhood but japan and presumably poorer countries would be much higher
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nice work do all these sources have an api or do you have to screen scrape the data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,really good job its easy to see who owes a lot location on the graph and who it might be a problem for color
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,does the data on total debt owed take into account the total credit that other people owe the country ie debt money owed to others by country credit money owed by others to country total debt total debtpopulation debt per person
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is really neat well done
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your wikipedia link is all external debt that is all all debts public and private owed to other countries ops figures are all public debt this is just how much the government owes but includes how much it owes to its citizens as well as to foreign countries hope that helps
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,who owns the debt mostly private individuals banks pension funds and central banks governments rarely owe debt to each other directly in the modern era
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think the majority of that debt is the httpsenwikipediaorgwikicentralprovidentfund basically the government takes a portion of your wages and pay it back when you retire though you may draw upon it for some expenditures like buying public housing since the government is directly giving you the money back interest proportional to how much you put in its counted as debt and not a tax
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they do normalize it by gdp its in the color mapping
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,would be most telling if it was debt divided by actual tax payer for example in the usa more than of the population does not pay federal income tax they may pay ss and mc but net income tax paid is zero so they wouldnt be shouldering anything this means the burden on those actually paying income tax and other taxes is higher some pay taxes many do not
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the use still has that title the only reason why japan is higher is because the number is divided by per person willing to bet it is even worse when you burrow down japanese culture is big into saving money american culture not as much if you looked at our debt in all levels federalstatecountycitypersonal we would probably be even in a worse position
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it should have been as a percentage of gdp but people dont find that to be as tangible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you noticed the map only depicts the continental us not alaska or hawaii afaik there is a difference between the territory israel actually controls vs international recognition of the borders
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it is beneficial for norway for norway to stay in debt due to the debt stimulating the economy it is also an important financial tool for the central bank when it is determining its financial policy and subsequent financial stabilization measures norway makes a huge amount of oil money yes but it is limited by law to only use of the oil fund pension fund yearly equal to the estimated yearly return rates of money already invested in the fund
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if youre going to take the amount that has been promised to pay you ought to take into account expected future income from taxes the us economy is growing faster than the greek economy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,public debt per capita is closely correlated with gdp per capita so theres that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,japan is white
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,doesnt really work like that if you just liquidate the tax profit and positive externalities to the economy will also disappear as those assets are there for a reason investment debt doesnt simply sit there and get paid off overtime its accruing year by year along with revenue but yes you are right adjusting for gdp per capita would be a useful graph this graph has its own uses though and to the eye of a business person or economist its natural to read it with the assumptions aware
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so basically sell your citizenry to other countries for no pay cause that would go over so well s
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the green one in the top left
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,except that the us is able to borrow at an extremely low interest ratesometimes lower than inflation with that being the case not taking on more debt would be like throwing away money on the other hand the massive degradation of our natural environment is a disaster
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,except no one has to pay the us debt to pretend they do is to misunderstand the currency system in use the united states if the us wants to pay off that debt they need only credit the accounts of people who hold bonds and then say that bond no longer exists
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you would still be taxed if there was no government debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,greece was forced to repay i dont think greece has even started to repay a single euro paid for by the other eu countries and im not counting the default they had towards bankowned debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,private citizens own government bonds they lent money to their governments the private sector has a huge surplus the public sector runs a deficit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the link doesnt deal with net debt and does not show how much countries have in assetstake china for example they do have like trillion dollars in debt but they are owes trillions more by other countries like the us so if anna owes billy dollars and billy owes carter and carter owes anna they would all be considered in debt by the author when in reality they are net zero dollars in debt and also this doesnt take into consideration that citizens are usually a large chunk of the ownership for a given countrys debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that being said debt to a certain degree is actually a good thing for countries
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i stand by my statement that interest is the most evil thing ever created by man it is also the answer to your question interest there is also no such thing as a stupid question only stupid answers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,time to do alot of living
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i came here to say that norway ought to have a negative size on this map very rare phenomenon i imagine my dog guarding and defending a truck full of beef jerkey while eating none
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,good luck not paying taxes a lot of this debt would be to fund public infrastructure and services transport schools hospitals roads footpaths etc maybe you give more than you take and probably your country has some welfare bludgers tax evaders and inequitable government policy but thats just the way the world works unfortunately
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you get student loan forgiveness if you agree to work in rural or other underserved areas as a doctor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you have to think about what different kinds of debts your looking at more powerful countries usa germany china kanada all could pay off a large amount of their debt if they wanted to but for that to happen they would have to scrap money from all directions their using it for healthcare armies etc in theory they could pay it off but in reality this is a very very long process in germany we only recently introduced the socalled black zero into our constitution which is a paragraph that basically forbids any kind of new debt for the state it shall only work with the money it gets
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i suppose you live in a dictatorship
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you dont know how the national debt works
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i agree here think about what it would imply for you to be responsible for you didnt spend the government would have to take up additional taxes itself because there is no other authority which can take your money if the us government did not exist there would be no entity responsible for paying the debt nor any entity entitled to part of your pay
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,know what helps pay off the debt sticking your head in the sand and pretending its someone elses problem
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ireland chose to pay the debts accrued by its banks and the banks of half of europe rather than simply default because were good like that in ireland you pay your debts like if its your round you buy or youre tarnished for this we get criticised despite as i said quite a lot of these debts really being owed by investment banking from around europe ireland is paying around of europes debt from the financial crisis we dont get thanked we get mocked still businesses seem to quietly be happy which is good because having previously invested heavily in third level education we need foreign business in a small island market to make independence viable so we take measures to be able to pay this back seek investment by having innovative tax breaks and emphasising making sure people get work since this debt is ultimately placed on the people the multinationals dont pay much tax but they employ people people work and pay the taxes but the alternative is nobody working and paying the taxes because chasing away foreign and investment is suicide for this we get called criminals and told how to run our own tax systems told that it is unfair for ireland to seek investment in such a manner when clearly it disadvantages the poor deprived people of germany
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a huge amount of private bank debt was added to the national debt due to the economic crisis this is extremely controversial in ireland as the perception is that the government was unjustly forced to so by brussels
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,their deficit ballooned after the financial crisis
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,running tab
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,okay i know a little about ireland but maybe my speech will give you some areas to look up ireland i think was a behind in the and it took a while to catch up between the it had good economic growth for ireland to keep this growth happening they had to keep spending moneythe reason being to push forward the production possibilities curve thus putting them into deeper debt combine this with the fact that ireland is more socialistic than countries like the us for example maybe there national debt was slightly higher than they wanted at this time then the financial crisis came and just like many other countries including the us the govt had to flood the market with money by taking on more debtthis is something called keynesian economics to keep demand in the economy up this why most debts went up after the financial crisis the govt also slashed taxes for corporations to help keep spending high ireland did largely what other nations did during the financial crisis their preexisting high debt to support their economic growth made the debt of ireland larger than average is this bad for ireland most likely not this is the reason ireland has a very good gdpcapita right now despite somewhat high unemployment rates
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cant tell if youre jokingbut austria and australia are two different countries
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,being appealed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i believe that the debt should be zero this is a dangerous belief one entitys liabilities is anothers assets us debt treasury bonds serves varying roles in the financial system today to completely get rid of the debt would require a large restructuring of that entire sector and not in a way that would likely benefit the country as a whole the more nuanced belief that would be considered fiscally responsible would be to reduce the deficit below annual gdp growth inflation when attempting to lower interest payments
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why should debt be zero
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit footerif you follow any of the above links please respect the rules of reddit and dont vote in the other threads rtotesmessenger messagecomposetortotesmessenger bot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is the type of fiscally responsible that i agree with why cant we go back to arguing about important things like this instead of manufactured controversies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank you kind sir every time i get into a conversation with someone who says the us owes to china i always have to explain that that is not how gross national debt works now i can just show them this comment i believe the world has serious problems that should be address and while the debt is one of them it is distracting us from more urgent issues
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,except the deficit is of the budget so youd actually net a negative of the budget if we had a balanced budget today with no debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is true for practically every country that issues debt in its own currency a large majority of canadian government debt is owed to canadian institutions and individuals a large majority of japanese government debt is owed to japanese institutions and individuals and so on
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the government should maintain a debt of at least trillion dollars to itself so that all the money in social security doesnt get taken out of the economy alternatively use the money on an aid program that allows poor people to buy luxeries they normally couldnt afford and otherwise would not have baught also injecting the money in to the economy and improving quality of live of the poor at the same time though education spending would be a better investment as the money mostly still ends up back in the economy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you eliminate interest on treasury bonds who would buy them they already have incredibly low yields because of how secure they are considered to be id like to see the us government stop using social security as a piggy bank because its only going to fuck over the people like me paying into it now but i digress if debt is then it is impossible to finance anything without the direct tax revenue you talk about doubling budgets if we didnt have debt but the reality is we use debt to pay for the programs that already exist so it wouldnt work out like that you talk about how bad our debt is but the reality is that we can issue bonds at yields lower than anyone theres no easy way to fix the budget the two ways are to cut spending which affects someone or another andor increase spending someone is getting fucked either way
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how do i give gold to you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im pretty sure you could do the same for most countries reported total debt is misleading at least in first world countries
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that is a well thought out well reasoned response you dont belong on reddit get out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in south africa only about of people earn enough to pay tax
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and theyve just banned coal so i suspect oil will be close behind once it is no longer the biggest market controller on the planet
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was trying to find new zealand looked all over the map for the name couldnt find it looked for the shape of nz since its pretty distinctive nope but there it is kinda on the inner kinda on the outer but its laid out sideways idk its an interesting concept but it would be nice if the countries were somewhat in their actual geographic locations
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also is a good word
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,mostly to their own people who save money the only reason why japan is able to carry such a huge debt is because the people in japan consider buying their countries debt as a national obligation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its bonds not household debt perfect example my daughter was born in when she was born her grandmother bought a savings bond the value of the bond is but cant be redeemed until she paid in for in years that is of debt the us government owes my daughter multiply that a couple billion times and you have national debt countries businesses banks and citizens of this and other countries can buy these bonds some mature faster than others but the return is lower say you could pay today for a bond you can redeem for in years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they owe themselves in the case of the united states public debt is mostly in the form of investments in the us bonds market the federal reserve owns a huge share of the market because that is the mechanism they use for controlling inflation the social security trust owns another huge share of the market because they need safe conservative growth of a large fund over a long period of time after those two institutions the next largest pools are foreign investors which for the sake of argument we can include china its not really accurate to call these debts in the sense of comparing them to consumer debts like credit cards
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,mostly people and companies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the iron bank of braavos
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no i just copypasted it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah which is by far most of it citizens dont owe much to anyone the government owes it to its citizens in the us at least
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes it is just a big chain of exchanges
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sure if you are looking to pay it back in a reasonable timeframe but we are talking about first order approximation where every single dollar of product somehow goes towards this debt its just a way of normalizing the debt in an easy to understand way im sure there is a much more correct way to do it my point was that even my simple first order approximation is more instructive than looking at the total value sans any context
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres an extra if and what is false about it i am saying if you divide the value of the debt per person reported in this graphic by the gdp per capita of each country which is given per year you get years for syria and for the us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,culturally perhaps but economically and politically its part of the us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so does delaware and every other state along with most cities and counties
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the data is data thats never misleading so i have to take that back but the presentation of it and the wording makes it seem like its affecting each citizen personally rather its just the debt as a percentage of the gdp divided by the population you personally will never have to pay that in fact its not even applyable to you as politicians like to attempt in fearmongering loaded words in the article like snowball of debt xese people owe x amount to the world biased title and red coloring of heavily indebted countries make it seem negative tldr national debt is healthy and crucial in an expanding economy yet the article accompanying the data implies that debt is a bad thing nation debt personal debt edit a word
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,per capita burden isnt intended to imply this is what each person literally owes how much of your countrys debt rests on your shoulders i dont see how this can be interpreted any other way this is literally what the title is saying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well if by income you mean gdp since thats sort of like the countrys income at the macro instead of the micro then thats what the colors are for i wish there was a wider spectrum of colors though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,actually the imf has loans to the liberian government but the liberian government doesnt issue bonds
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its just not that simple some debt is obviously a good thing it keeps the economy moving the question is how much is too much but no matter what the numbers say the assets of all those rich yet debtor countries arent going anywhere
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but how much of your countrys debt rests on your shoulders isnt accurate because it isnt how much has to be paid because no one pays that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its there but it should be featured more prominently since its more important and it should also be discussed in the discussion
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ss and mc are not strictly part of the national debt iirc how would you handle corporations in this case which may pay taxes but dont correspond to individuals i know when i ran a small corporation the corporation paid income taxes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,norway makes a huge amount of oil money yes but it is limited by law to only use of the oil fund pension fund yearly equal to the estimated yearly return rates of money already invested in the fund oil money is not the same as the oil found money from the oil is put into the found but a lot is used other places of the money that goes in only of the returns not the found itself can be used
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah definitely raising faster in retirees needing their social security and medicare payments
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was just trying to keep it simple i didnt want to get to macroeconomic with it if i say more that a couple sentences people try to harp on one thing they learned in intro to being a dickwad class that makes everything i ever said in my whole life wrong
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hey if all it would take is a year or two to absolve the whole world of its debt just make sure people have comfortable lodging and food
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,irs did not exist until the federal reserve was created
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not up to date on what their progress is in actually paying anything they elected syriza as a message that they knew they were getting screwed and wanted their government to stand up to the rich europeans that lent them the money under predatory conditions then they ended up making some kind of concessions but i dont know what specific kind of pressure ie extortion caused those concessions i hope they stand firm against the predatory lenders
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or the map is out of date and control over natural gas and oil fields pays for a lot of stuff
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes goy war is peace debt is wealth good goy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what do you have to back this up more info please if possible would be a great help
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a libertarian conservative i am for balanced budget if the us got out of debt and became a loaner due to a surplus the tax burden in its own citizens would be light heck if they loaned out enough they could pay a portion of the welfare star the liberals want without taking my money
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive heard that and i love germany for it among plenty of other reasons i think thats very smart and i get that large chunks could be paid off but it still seems unwise to spend what you in effect dont have
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nope i dont good thing it isnt my job to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this exactly this is not debt like your personal income and the fact that people equate it as such only serves as a talking point for people who dont understand it by and large youll notice that the countries with more debt per capita tend to be nicer countries to live if youre wanting to move to a country with low personal debt youre welcome to do so but its going to have essentially no goods and services an analogy might be deciding on an apartment and neighborhood to live in sure you could take the dirt cheap one that has absolutely no services violence no jobs or you can pay a little bit more to live in a very nice community in the center of where all of the work is with a police group that keeps things stable nice roads etc living in the nicer place means that you have access to the nicer job and can afford to pay that rent there is always the question of how much of that rent money is reinvested into the property which would be a factor for countries that have high debt and low quality of living but the averages hold im quite happy to pay higher rent to have more opportunities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if we could drop state pension plan ala ss i would be fine wasting the full time employment years i wasted intonit just to have it abolished so i can spend my the way i want wth a greater return than the i will get back with it in place
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,debt isnt necessarily a bad thing no it is a bad thing a very fucking bad thing money spent on paying off debt or accumulated interest is money not returned to the taxpayers this means shittier roads it means cuts to medical programs it means money that should have been spent on the entire us population is instead given to the tiny portion of the us population that is already welloff put this in perspective for every dollar i send to the federal government now cents goes to pay off the debt under half a cent goes to fund nasa we could have as much space stuff as we have now and still have money left over if we didnt have this debt billion dollars goes into this blackhole each year with nothing to show for it try to think of how many jobs how many projects how many accomplishments we could make with this money hell we could nearly write every man women and child a check for a bit under a dollars in fuckit money each year if we did it right we could probably convert every gas car on the road into electric and still have enough for a charging station grid
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so if i vote for fiscal conservatism dont use any government programs and pay my taxes while our glorious leaders cant balance a budget yet the elderly and some of the poor live off of government programs and continue to vote for more funding to these programs where does the fault lie no politician wants to be the one that cuts off programs to the poor and raise taxes that would in most cases lead to the demise of themselves and their party for awhile
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my comment was really just a way of saying that i dont appreciate looking at the national debt as something im personally responsible for i made absolutely zero decisions about how the regulation works how the money is spent etc and therefore take zero responsibility for the aftermath i dont owe this country shit with all that and before someone pipes in saying well if you dont like it get out and to that i say i love living here but i will never take any fault or responsibility with regards to the national debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not sure it was all that much of a choice trichet told noonan a bomb would go off in dublin if we didnt pay the anglo senior bond holders it looks more as if it was decided that a lot of private debt should be socialised and thereby contained in ireland so that the damage wouldnt spread to the banking systems in more important important places like germany the other thing is that for years we had an obviously overheated property market and massive growth in household debt car loans to buy bmws vws and mercs credit cards etc an economy crying out for higher interest rates in other words but what did we get from the ecb nice low interest rates to help stimulate growth in germany its things like that that make it all the more annoying when we get looked down upon for our fiscal recklessness not that there wasnt plenty of eejitry
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you had me until innovative tax breaks allowing us corporations to not pay hardly any taxes is not innovative why cant other countries in europe do the same and dont tell me about luxemburg or the netherlands also i think you forget your housing bubble
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont understand what effect would defaulting do did greece and spain default in that way but we chose to do the other option for morality reasons
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a lot of these debts really being owed by investment banking from around europe first time ive heard this can someone provide more info please
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but the eu is trying to help you guys out with a massive € windfall from apple but you guys are refusing to accept it weird
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,were good like that ya maybe or your country was backed into financial corner and rescued by the british admittedly iceland was boxed in way more than ireland when those internet banks collapsed canada and new zealand also realized they were boxed in and self liberated themselves as for my fellow americanswe are screwed this map talks about debt when you factor in unfunded liabilities ie promises we are at to per person far higher than japan
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in ireland you pay your debts like in ireland you may sentences like
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its a wonder there hasnt been more moves for brexit style exit in ireland i wouldnt vote for it though would vote to leave the euro but wouldnt be surprised after all the shenanigans if we did leave
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it was the bank bail out that caused the national debt to balloon the deficit coincided with the bail out but had a significantly smaller impact on the national debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,our unemployment is slightly below the average of the eu afaik we sit about while the average is we arent nearly near the top of highest unemployment in eu were actually almost smack bang in the middle
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well at least you covered yourself by saying that you dont know much about ireland because none of that is correct ireland had about years growth from the early to definitely not in the nope when times were good the gov invested in capital projects and public spending but nothing too wreckless when the recession came around in and we certainly did not keep spending up fuck no we cut hard cut deep cut everywhere we did not flood the market with more money by taking on more debt thats not how european economic policy works instead we imposed numerous austerity budgets fun times did not slash taxes for corporations our corporation tax has been for as long as i can remember we instead raised personal taxes please dont guess the answers or assume that ireland follow the same structures as other nations
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is actually one of the worst economic analyses and explanations ive ever read youve gotten things usually taught in the first lesson of any economics class wrong youve gotten all the facts about the irish economy wrong and youve used the most condescending tone imaginable im only going to bother to correct your first bit the bulk of growth in the irish economy was due to very low corporation tax leading to much greater fdi and the government was not spending money in fact between and the irish government ran a budget surplus
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but its outta playce in the list it has less debt pre person than the last country on the list iceland per person australia per person united kingdom per person
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not to mention keeping a debt would pull the rug out from under the feds ability to control the money supply that could lead to some problems with inflation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yep and this conversation started literally before the country was founded borrowing money from and trading with other countries also improves our national defense nobody is going to attack us if we owe them money and they want to keep collecting on it because they know we can stop once they declare war
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a case is norway that has gone through periods with and without debt because it does make economical sense to have some debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the debt should not be zero why do people take out home loans when they could rent an apartment forever and stay debt free why do people take out student loans when they can earn minimum wage otherwise its worth paying interest to get immediate capital by selling bonds the us government has raised trillions of dollars to buy things that we wouldnt have otherwise
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for the same reason i shouldnt be allowed to use your credit card
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was being slightly glib when i said the debt should be zero i believe there should be no debt and that there should be a huge amount in savings the government can be a lender making interest off of the money loaned
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the government should maintain a debt of at least trillion dollars to itself so that all the money in social security doesnt get taken out of the economy why do you think that money would be taken out of the economy the people on social security still have to spend money theyre still going to spend their social security check whether the government debt is billion billion or billion money on an aid program that allows poor people to buy luxeries they normally couldnt afford and otherwise would not have baught also injecting the money in to the economy and improving quality of live of the poor at the same time though education spending would be a better investment as the money mostly still ends up back in the economy it sounds like you think im proposing cutting the budget to zero and in response you say the government should maintain a budget of at least a trillion dollars im proposing cutting the debt people still pay taxes income taxes payroll taxes sales taxes property taxes business taxes government still hands out social security cheques government still believes in government handouts medicare medicaid free health care for all free university taxes pay for things that doesnt change the government still forcibly extracts money from me and you to redistribute which helps drive the economy the more money in the hands of people at the bottom the better everyone is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you eliminate interest on treasury bonds who would buy them you wouldnt have treasury bonds why would sometime but an investment vehicle that has a rate of return if debt is then it is impossible to finance anything without the direct tax revenue of course tax revenue is not going away at least not in any universe that obeys the laws of thermodynamics you talk about doubling budgets if we didnt have debt but the reality is we use debt to pay for the programs that already exist we use tax revenue to pay for programs that already exist im talking about putting money into social programs rather than towards interest on the debt theres no easy way to fix the budget the two ways are to cut spending which affects someone or another andor increase spending someone is getting fucked either way there are three other ways to fix the budget raise taxes eg my taxes at a year are too low employe more people more people means more taxpayers means more revenue raise incomes so that people pay more tax revenue on their higher incomes and when the government has a huge nest egg they can begin to use it to help people the government can start to become a bank lending money to generate more money lending money for student loans lending money to start up small businesses lending money for car loans lending money to have a restaurant buy a new stove
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,go visit rneutralpolitics its full of rational people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is that we the people arent we the income producing assets when it comes to govt debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wait what finland banned coal did norway do it too also norway does not produce that much oil its the reason norway has a lot of money is because few people norway only produces of the amount the us produces and only has a population of uncorrupted government that actually knows how to manage the economy to favour the people strong tax regime tax on oil the us has as low as some places there is no money in that state run oil company even the profits after tax goes to the state not some private company and the oil found has nothing to do with the oil it is founded by profits from oil production but the values it holds does not depend on oil it is self sustained
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its also good because this money could have gone to roads or schools which are good things plus with a us bond you a very likely to get your money back plus some interest so its really a win win
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,collapse is so century they will pay you back with worthless fiat currency though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how does it work who is the debt owed to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no the reason japan is able to carry such a huge debt is because their central bank prints over billion every month and buys the debt with it without central bank intervention interest rates would spiral out of control and japan would default
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my parents kept trying to buy savings bonds for my kids i had to tell them that any savings bonds would be immediately thrown into the garbage theres no way im keeping track of a slip of paper for years for
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the literal quote of the article is all of the other countries with a high amount of debt owed per person are developed nations like the united states belgium austria united kingdom italy germany and others
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,buy more war bonds
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,iirc its about of the debt is to americans and their companies
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a significant part of it represents future obligations to pay social security benefits at some indeterminate time in the future when the payroll tax no longer covers current payments
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for the purposes of analyzing debt though it should probably be considered its own country it issues its own government bonds denominated in usd through the government development bank for puerto rico putting it in the fiscal position of independent countries that use the usd as their currency
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no one cares about your states
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would argue youve swung too far in the opposite direction in response to the fearmongering can debt spurn growth obviously yes is there ample economic theory to suggest that there is such thing as too much debt and disagreement over its long term consequences also yes on top of that some reject the premises altogether that gdp growth is a valuable objective etc nuance is needed on both ends
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,surely to say the title is misleading is different from saying the data is useless
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont think so it doesnt say its our responsibility personally
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,gdp isnt income in fact government expenditures are apart of the gdp calculation gdp cconsumer spending i investment g government spending exexportsimimports
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if they did would you buy them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it really is that simple though you cant just keep borrowing money forever at a certain point your credit dries up and somebody has to eat the cost look at greece and puerto rico and argentina among others you see the us credit rating being downgraded because its clear that unlimited and unsustainable borrowing cant go on forever
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id also like to add that not all debt is equal i have a mortgage with my bank and i have a savings account at my bank in other words i owe the bank some money and they owe me some money in theory i could use all of my savings to pay down part of my mortgage but that would be stupid i need the liquidity that a savings account provides to cover emergencies so id be worse off if i actually tried to pay down my debts right now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what do yo mean no one pays it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,corporations do not pay taxes they collect taxes as part of the sales price for their goods and services and transfer that money to the govt the customer pays the taxes as part of the price therefore some of the debt would be shouldered by the customer of the said corporations you are correct
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your are correct that the oil money is not the same as the pension fund¨ thank you for clarifying that said all the taxes and dividends the state accumulates form the oil industry are after the government subtracts expenses such as investments in major oil platforms put into the pension fund another way of saying it is that the states net cash flow form the oil sector is invested into the fund regarding your second point the state can as decreed by law maximum have a financial deficit in the national budget at of the total value of the fund this means that the government can only use of the total fund value to balance the budget this is referred to the handlingsregelen or the budgetary rule
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,okay my bad x

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it still seems unwise to spend what you in effect dont have but thats just the way the world works everyone of us who buys a car or builds a house is spending money they dont have
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a lot of the time its a bad idea not to have national debt a lot of it is due to spending on arguably necessary programs which were predicted to produce some return if the return is greater than the cost of interest governmentscountries make a net profit on debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you absolutely live off government programs if youve driven on a road flown on a plane been in a hospital or anything remotely resembling those things youve used government programs and before spouting off about government healthcare medicare alone represents a huge government input which helps keep hospitals running
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you reap the benefits but choose to ignore the costs its sticking your head in the sand and being ignorant at best also i presume you vote
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,does germany get to dictate economic policy for the rest of the eu
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres nothing stopping other countries doing the same our tax rate is public has been for several decades the innovation was decades ago you may also consider we invented the concept of dutyfree and its not hardly anything the eus demands are not about our tax rates but where apple pay their taxes our housing bubble was caused by the subprime lending in the usa and by similar nonsense investments from outside ireland into our bubble we werent printing money ourselves every country in europe had the same issues but ireland suffered the most due to outside interference that should sound familiar to any irish person its the story of the famines of the
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the help is trying to force apple out of ireland theres been an apple factory in my home town for about years because germany hates that multinational hqs are here and not there the help we receive is the gift of becoming the poorest province under german law
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rescued you mean they loaned us money which we are repaying with interest to cover the fraudulent dealings and collapse of the royal bank of scotland in northern ireland and the republic i suppose you could call that rescue compared to what we usually get from them in such circumstances
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you dont get to just say wrong youre not running for president of the us tell me what parts you disagree with at least
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why would we leave the eu or the euro zone that would do untold damage with little or no upside
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is trueand this is due to more socialistic european policies i mainly pointed that out because some people might point to unemployment rates as issues
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id like to read more on this but i cant find anything on google can you post the theory that this is about
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,borrowing money from and trading with other countries also improves our national defense nobody is going to attack us if we owe them money and they want to keep collecting on it because they know we can stop once they declare war not one of those countries in top ten are faced with invasion in anything even resembling a normal day
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if the rate to borrow is less than the rate of return on investing that money its good to take out debt the us lends year treasuries at its not that hard to find ways to make a better return on that investment education infrastructure defense anything that grows the tax base facilitates trade or reduces volatilityrisk looks good at that rate of course we need to be ready to pay up or refinance in years if current rates are lower refinance indefinitely the example is with one maturity years out but really the treasury is managing this continuously
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not to mention that norway has their massive trillion investment fund since most years their investments will return a greater percent than what they pay in interest on their debt it makes sense to just continue borrowing while plowing their oil revenues into their investment fund the only real two dangers is if their investment fund completely collapses or theres an extreme liquidity freeze where they cant borrow and cant take out from their fund in both cases it wouldnt be a norwayonly issue itd be a global financial crisis worse than
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yea but norway is rich look at saudi arabia they have very little debt and the reason is pretty obvious what is more interesting is countries like chile which is a well off country with no debt and from what i can tell no obvious reason it doesnt have any
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a case is norway that has gone through periods with and without debt because it does make economical sense to have some debt fine keep a dollar in debt each year i wont complain if it is a dollar
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i know that i was trying to show him hes wrong by making him defend his position
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you throwaway your brain with that account
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when the cost of borrowing is lower than the expected return of the investments you can make with that money you borrow why the fear of debt lots of successful companies have debt rich people have debt the current cost of borrowing for the us is insanely low now is the time to spend
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for a government to have money in savings means to have collected more taxes from citizens than services provided very few people would find this an ideal situation and may lead to revolution should the disparity be great enough
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,at the expense of our infrastructure and services i dont want the government to make money i invest in companies for that i want the government to provide services
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the government needs to maintain a debt roughly equal to the amount of money that has been paid in to ss but has not been paid out because otherwise that money just sits there not getting spent on anything and that is a ton of money
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not entirely there are indirect taxes like customs duties federal reserve earnings interest on foreign debt held etc that said of all federal revenues are from individual and ss taxes plus another from corporate and excise taxes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there is no money in taxing the shit out of oil when your country is so large your entire country makes up of the us land mass it is much easier to have higher taxes when transportation isnt as essential not only that but of your population lives in one city and your entire countries population doesnt even equal our largest city which only makes up of our population
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive never had a chili cheeseburgerhow are they
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,many heavy debtors owe money to other heavy debtors and they in turn owe money back the other way which is why countries arent going bankrupt because they would call in their debts from other countries triggering more bankruptcies have a look at this money owed both ways in many cases for example france owes the uk € but the uk owes france € in but the examples are relevant
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,here in the us the largest owner of debt is a trust fund set up to feed the gaps in oasdhi social insurance program a large chunk is help by private citizens if you purchase a government bond you hold government debt until the bond matures an you are paid back this actually accounts for nearly percent of all national debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,private investors via bonds other countries via loans or itself in the us about of the debt is owned by other nations such as china and japan about are held by the federal reserve private bonds state and local governments and about is owned by itself such as money borrowed from social security and other intragovernmental programs and reserves in many cases old debt decreases over time because interest rates are lower than inflation so the longer you wait to pay it off the less you ultimately owe governments are often able to get insanely lowinterest rates and they pay off their highinterest rates first
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre saying that like its some horrible mistake when its literally the reason a central bank exists
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i guess its a good thing central banks exist then
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i keep them with their social security cards and birth certificate a few other things in that folder too like pics from pre school little notes i and my ex wife would write to them its basically a box o stuff theyll get on or about their birthday momentos and keepsakes from when they were babies i had a real shitty childhood and am kind of overcompensating for that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the payroll tax stopped covering all off the payments in theyve been drawing on the trust to make up the gap since then
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if thats the standard shouldnt every state in the us be counted as its own country as they also issue their own bonds along with many of the cities and counties
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,then why do they care about our territories enough to include one of them on the chart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the english idiom httpidiomsthefreedictionarycomrestonyourshoulder literally does mean that its your personal responsibility
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i understand but governments dont have income either right so my thought was that the comment was calling income as if the government was an individual with a certain income which would be like its gdp as thats what it can spend to lower its debt it probably isnt a great analogy but since the original graphic doesnt explain who actually holds the debt i thought they were trying to say that it was debt held by the government and owed outside of the country thats not actually the case though hence all this rambling
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no but my point was there are other debts not covered by this map
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all three examples you cite have horrible economies with little hope of growing their way out of the problem unlike the us which can at least if we decide to not add to the debt unless it buys future growth infrastructure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but the us government can never become insolvent like you can it literally can not run out of money to spend public debt exists to control interest
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when government decides to pay off the debt it is done by simply crediting the account of the debt holder with money you created just for that purpose money doesnt come out of some poor taxpayers pocket then get moved into a creditors hands currency is destroyed when taxed and created when spent no one pays for debt because whenever it is repaid its done so with newly created money debt isnt there because government ran out of money to spend it is there to control the interest rate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,corporations absolutely do pay income taxes as an llc you get the option of having the income of the corporation taxed as an individual entity or as part of the owners income they also pay property taxes there are many types of corporations but an llc is the only one ive owned so its the one im most familiar with while i was part owner of that corporation i filed two income tax returns every year one for myself and one for the corporation you are right about sales tax you act as a tax collector in this case
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im still up for melting california down jk
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not true
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do doctor of optometry or ophthalmology because i am one and not the other lol thank you for the resources you have been a great help
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so many people dont understand the benefits of debt when you have it on an international buying power scale as opposed to a personal checking account scale just look at what countries rank the best in lowest debt per capita on this chart here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,he pays his fuel tax and car registration to pay for his road use he pays his medical bills to pay for his hospitals he pays income tax as he stated which is more than of americans can say i agree with him like i said earlier i would happily cut ss off right now and lose the years i have put of my income in i would literally give away a years worth of income to the government using my scenario its actually just to rid of the wasted fascist program that is ss but guess what because people think its ok to steal as long as it is done democratically i will never get a say yay fun economics
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,voting and making decisions are two very different things first of all i can vote for whoever i want and they can even get into office what that person does once elected is their own prerogative i pay my taxes so i pay for my benefits also this is bullshit because its taking the debt and dividing it by people that would be as if the debt were created yesterday but it wasnt this is an accumulation of bullshit starting long before i was born no i take no responsibility for where we are now since i had no hand in taking us here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,theres nothing stopping other countries doing the same no eu doesnt allow it why wouldnt those debt problem countries lure all the coorporations with lower taxes of course when is luxemburg doing it everybody just shhhhh and get paid to be quiet
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what youre saying is that the only reason apple is in ireland is because they effectively dont have to pay any taxes that if there were a tax level playing field in the eu apple would never choose to locate any sites in ireland is that really irelands only competitive advantage vs locating in germany or the netherlands or belgium or france
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,blaming one bank especially the rbs is not factually correct your celtic paper tiger years caused a housing bubble that when it collapsed brought down or of your banks who were lending money and breaking the rules of depositstoloans ratios poor financial oversight by the government of banks simply accelerated irelands dire financial position
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cant tell whether i should laugh or cry at the fact that ive lived to see a fool become potus
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,monetary union without fiscal union is not a long term option interest rates will serve the larger euro economies in ways that will boom and bust the irish economy unless there are fiscal transfer from those countries in downturns something i cannot imagine happening the downside of leaving the eu is vast and i am not promoting it at all the downside of leaving the euro is in the short term tough in the long term essential to the irish economy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats actually not a theory the us federal reserve controls the money supply by issuing or buying back various types of bonds bonds debt the us has such a good track record of paying back its debts that buying bonds is a safer store of your money than putting it in a bank so a lot of very wealthy people put their money in bonds controlling the money supply control interest rates as interest rates are the price of money which then modulate aggregate demand google federal reserve dual mandate to get started
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it isnt a theory its the logical conclusion of how things work the fed controls the money supply by changing how many treasury bonds it buys without any treasury bonds to buy government debt of it cant do that anymore and therefore loses its ability to stabilize inflation through the money supply
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think this is what youre looking for httpsenwikipediaorgwikifractionalreservebanking
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wasnt suggesting that they carry a balance for that reason only but that it can be one also your statement could be evidence to support mine since the fact that those countries with large trade balances arent in danger could be in part due to their trade balances
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how does one use a fully functioning human brain to arrive at the conclusion that somebody should be allowed to take out debt in another persons name
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its less a fear of debt and the lure of savings the government can start to fund things off the interest it collects from loaning taxes can be lowered in a superfantastical world income sales and property taxes would be zero
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,very few people would find this an ideal situation and may lead to revolution should the disparity be great enough those people can be as grumpy as they want government should still do it ideally then things can be funded entirely from interest it collects and taxes can go down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they make the money so they can provide the services wouldnt you rather have your taxes be zero
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,otherwise that money just sits there not getting spent on anything and that is a ton of money the money wouldnt just sit there the money doesnt just sit there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lmao i genuinely laughed out loud but i mean yeah im and every smart person i know starting their careers arent putting their savings into the stock market or buying bonds were buying crypto and gold because the generations before us seriously fucked us over we have a really long investment horizon and between now and then yeah bonds are fucked and stocks are way over valued so when they finally go on sale yes we will buy stocks but until then fuck your ponzi schemes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,central banks have been financing most governments for the past few years the fed ecb boj and boe have purchased like trillion of government debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so corporations
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is there a reason they dont forgive each others debt to let it cancel out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the money is not so much borrowed from social security as invested by the social security trust because parking cash has no upside and congress limits the amount of risk the trust can take
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it sounds pretty horrible from his description
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is exactly why the gold standard is a bad idea
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you sound like a thoughtful parent good job
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no because it doesnt pay in and get back money from the federal government in the same way that the states do its really a different situation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,government income is either taxes or tariffs which is just another form of tax so they tax you at x that is collected and spent now when they spend more than they take in the treasury issues tbills to raise capital which is national debt i dont think however this takes into account imf loans which are closer to consumer loans nor does take into account who holds the debts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if we decide to not add to the debt unless it buys future growth the us is definitely not doing that part of the reason why those countries had horrible economies is because of their debt problems
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what are talking about debt is paid with taxes when debt is paid with printing presses is when you get hyperinflations thats why we have independent monetary authorities that cant recklessly monetize the debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sorry i did not explain clearly a corporation builds their taxes into the price of what the sell not an added sales tax but the cost of their taxes into the product or service this is passed on to the customer same with property taxes these taxes are paid with money derived from business activity which is earned through prices charged to the customer hope this is more clear i apologize for a poor explanation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinternalrevenueservice httpsenwikipediaorgwikitaxationhistoryoftheunitedstatesexcisetax the bureau of internal revenue was started under lincoln with the first income tax before that there were still tariffstaxes on trade and excise taxessuch as whiskey which led to the whiskey rebellion

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,voting and making decisions are two very different things first of all i can vote for whoever i want and they can even get into office what that person does once elected is their own prerogative thats just a sad mentality to have in a democracy what about holding our elected officials accountable have you ever told your congressman that you were unhappy with the job he was doing or a decision he made he works for you as a constituent you hired him and you have a voice in firing him would you hire employees and just say what they do once hired is their own prerogative
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes low population island nations with high costs of business tend to have to offer incentives thats why they came here in the first place then we invested heavily in third level education to get them to expand into administration and software not just assembling macintoshs it helps that we are anglophone but multinationals generally have staff from all around europe here the ruling invalidates a relationship created before the eu existed and threatens the same relations with intel microsoft google amazon funny that you should mention belgium and the netherlands as theyve been through the same thing level playing field effectively means what the german economic minister believes to be fair to germany
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not blaming one bank im explaining why you felt the need to cut us a loan rbs going bust over irish dealings wasnt in your interests dont claim it was a rescue when the rescue was of yourself youre describing the lending situation across half the world at the time yes it was appalling our country had gone mad people were paying € for a sandwich and crisps in obriens many people saw it coming we discussed how long it could last in economics class the taosieach at the time questioned why doubters didnt just kill themselves if they was their attitude seriously but the money appeared to be flowing until in america it stopped the government party of the time which had ruled the republic for most of its existence was turfed out and is now crippled since then weve acted with if anything more responsibility than strictly necessary were only million people if we wanted we could have done what iceland did and completely fucked you over we didnt the banks and investors from the uk for the major part and the rest of europe did not suffer the british businesses did not suffer you offer ridiculous bankruptcy terms which those irish companies with offices in the uk used to offshore money and get back into business sooner people like flemings a construction company who folded rather than pay their taxes or contractors including my father carried on in britain and were back in business in ireland within months while my father still pays back deferred tax to avoid bankruptcy so please dont act like you did us a favour you moved money around to minimise your own pain and will make a profit in the mean time oh and the paper tiger line very clever but nonsensical the celtic tiger is a term describing how we went from a largely agrarian economy to high tech hub in little more than a decade not our housing market the global financial crisis doesnt invalidate that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,couldnt they fuck with fractional reserve ratios to do the same thing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,didnt the us credit rating drop recently
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,isnt qe a relatively recent function of the fed though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,since the fact that those countries with large trade balances arent in danger could be in part due to their trade balancessince the fact that those countries with large trade balances arent in danger could be in part due to their trade balances they arent in danger because only one country remains on earth that can fight a war not on its border that has nothing to do with debt and everything to do with the fact that this isnt the century today feels like a jolly good day to carve out another colony a war is an insanely costly thing to do these days the tiny payments that governments get from debt collection is not even a factor japan isnt kept safe from invasion because it pays some debt off every week to some random bond broker in china
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,listen i know the government provides school and everything but stay in it okay bud
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you can post a ba in finance from a top university right now ill buy you a year of reddit gold but you cant because you really have no idea what youre talking about its more complicated than youre making it sound i just explained to you why debt can be good and you respond with savings is good which when dealing with a single entity is the exact same thing as saving that debt is bad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh sure id also like to be paid seven figures to get random blowjobs from attractive women aside from the whole practicality of taking an enterprise that hasnt made a good surplus since the civil war and turning it into some kind of money machine i am extremely hesitant to put the government in a position where it has its own money look at what it does with our money which has to at least pretend to spend in our interests and to our benefit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah it doesnt just sit there because the government loans it to itself
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if your friends are putting their money into fucking crypto currencies and gold theyre not smart dude lmao
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,being young you should invest in higher riskhigher yield investments this isnt the first time we have felt things were a bubble but somehow we always get through it invest heavily in stocks now why because for more than years stocks have consistently produced significantly higher returns than gold or other commodities dont fall into the fear trap be rational and make decisions based on evidence
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh dear lord you might want to reevaluate what you may consider financially smart cypto currency is in its infancy and it purely hinges on numerous varibles and more viotile than pure sodium to water i have two issues with crypto currency the main one being its real world application as in can one use it to exchange goods for it and on the most part no one has to exchange it for real currency making it nothing more than playing the currency game the other being security storage technology and people are fallible things and in combination shit will happen gold its a fucking commodity its as safe as putting your money in oil sure it wont be worthless but buying it doesnt assure roi esspecially if you follow the news and buy the buzz by then its already too late and chances are youve already lost money then again its ur money invest in whatever you want but do your own research and find your own answer i am a strong proponent of investing in what you know so i suggest doing your own research and come to your own conclusions they might be smart but financial smarts isnt corrolated to books or streets smart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youve mistaken the looney bin for the smart people
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,jesus fucking christ go out and invest in a hermetically sealed bunker canned food generators a filtration system a lifetime supply of canned and preserved food rainwater tanks and purification system and a nice fast internet connection so you can post economically illiterate rants on zerohedgecom youll be better off and so will the rest of us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but i mean yeah im and every smart person i know starting their careers arent putting their savings into the stock market or buying bonds were buying crypto and gold because the generations before us seriously fucked us over oh my lord
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ecb is buying more than of corporate bonds over there shit is going to get real real fast when the dominos collapse boj has been large buying stocks and bonds the fed has been floating the rate for years with purchases any audit of any of the banks would lead to a global default scenario
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they purchase it with brandnew money ie the government sells bonds ious to the central bank which pays for the bonds with money hot off the printing press not literally actually in electronic form then the new money is loaned to the commercial banks who loan it to individuals and businesses on a global scale its indistinguishable from a confidence trick
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so corporations banks are a significant holder of sovereign debt yes as are nations and private individuals i believe that banks who issue currency by loaning it to governments are parasites that is a controversial opinion however
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the debt is at different rates being paid out over various periods it could be treasuries and bonds paying various interest rates over various periods sovereign debt isnt a credit card you own money on at high interest rates that you need to pay off asap
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that would lose the benefit of being a creditor to a lot of different governments because if theres a crisis it probably wont affect all of them at once after all modern money is debt theres no underlying commodity to back it up and that is how it should work if you have that means the world dollar market owes you worth of services theres no worth of gold or abstract value somewhere the modern economy is mostly services and manufactured goods which dont exist until theyre actually produced
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,perhaps equally surprising in many cases you cant call off the payout when bonds mature theres no let it ride option which means there are strange consequences on the other end of the investment as well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the gold standard is a bad idea because there isnt enough gold on the planet to represent the global economy with any meaningful mass of gold representing a reasonable unit of denomination
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i understand that puerto rico is not a state however just because it issues bonds does not make it its own country dc isnt a state and issues bonds is dc a country
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hyperinflation is caused by there being too much demand for available supply this can be caused by too much spending but isnt directly caused by the creation of currency if debt was paid by taxes it would literally be impossible to pay back because there isnt enough real currency to do so the reason why this isnt scary is because debt is not paid by taxing people it is paid by the creation of currency
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,much clearer in that respect then wealthy people who purchase more stuff indirectly pay taxes by purchasing things with taxes folded into them even though they may dodge paying taxes directly still doesnt excuse the practice but its a small silver lining so to speak
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your own link commissioner of internal revenue a federal office created in is not the irs the sixteenth amendment to the us constitution was ratified authorizing congress to impose a tax on income and the bureau of internal revenue was established
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,be that as it may sad or otherwise it is the reality of things i wrote my congressman one time you know what happened he essentially wrote me a letter that basically said dont worry your pretty little head well handle this literally disregarded my opinion and belittled me on top of it so sad or not its the reality of things
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes you are blaming one bank and i quote you mean they loaned us money which we are repaying with interest to cover the fraudulent dealings and collapse of the royal bank of scotland in northern ireland and the republic you absolutely were blaming one bank look at your own governments lack of financial oversight and your own property bubble and when you say why you felt the need to cut us a loan i havent loaned ireland a dime nor would i i am not the uk government and i am not british i am american as i pointed out earlier iceland didnt fvck anyone over they voted in a couple of referendums not to pay back but a financial audit found landsbanki had assets sufficient to cover they were hiding the assets and were caught britain and the netherlands were fully paid back around february of this year what ireland should have done was to try what the icelanders did tell the world to go pound sand and what happened to your father was outrageous people should go to jail for what flemings have done to him and countless others
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not hugely familiar with fractional reserve banking but im pretty sure your idea would entail dictating the value of a dollar which would be quite impractical
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they can and do however if banks already exceed reserve ratios as they do now then doing this has no effect
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not that im aware of if it did it hasnt changed interest rates enough to matter crew rating only matters if it causes investors to lose faith edit some credit agencies have downgraded the uss credit rating from aaaoutstanding to aaexcellent as of this probably has to do with the financial crisis and the spending that resulted from it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,qe is its own thing i was not referencing that but you are correct from wikipedia quantitative easing qe is a monetary policy used by central banks to stimulate the economy it is usually used when standard monetary policy has become ineffective a central bank implements quantitative easing by buying financial assets from commercial banks and other financial institutions thus raising the prices of those financial assets and lowering their yield while simultaneously increasing the money supply this differs from the more usual policy of buying or selling shortterm government bonds to keep inter bank interest rates at a specified target value edit httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiquantitativeeasing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i went to private school and you are clearly an argument against public schooling you cant even build a case or address the argument in front of you one wonders if you even understand it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i just explained to you why debt can be good and i explained to you why savings be good so theyre both good why not choose the one that puts more money into economy helps the most people and lets taxes the most and drives economic activity the most
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the reason it does not sit there is because the government cuts social security checks to people the money does not sit there it goes to people social security check recipients get their social security checks regardless of the level of the united states debt increasing or decreasing the debt does not change the checks given to social security recipients why do you think that people would no longer get social security checks if the debt were larger or smaller
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i once had an argument with a guy about the gold standard for an hour we argued about inflation ron paul government robbery of its citizens and all types of crazy crap then told me that he had sold off his and converted much of his monthly salary into gold i realized i had to stop arguing with him he had literally put his money where his mouth was gold is worth as much today as it was when we had that debate

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,municipal bonds are local bonds any town or district can issue bonds to raise capital puerto rico is a territory of the us like guam it technically has its own government but is under the us government whereas states are a part of the us government dc is neither state or territory but a governmental district that is neutral from state allegiances edit youll find that life rarely fits an easy definition
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,puerto rico cant be counted as its own country cause its debt doesnt affect americans whatsoever
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the were the same office just rebranded even look to the right it has the founding of
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i know i dont expect my congressman to agree with me or listen to me either but thats not the point if youre not making sure that your representative knows what you think youre not using the system and if you try and you get that response then try to replace him next time hes up for election and make sure he knows why thats the only way the system can work
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes you are blaming one bank for britains involvement yes the main factor was the global financial crisis itself the main bank in ireland that caused issues was angloirish bank ill let you take a guess as to what the anglo signifies i am american as i pointed out earlier look at your own governments lack of financial oversight ha delicious you realise none of this would have happened if it wast for fannie and freddy et al i am not the uk government i did not say you were i was using the second personal plural pronoun you in ireland wed say ye in parts of america youd say yall
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not totally familiar with fractional reserve banking but its my understanding that a bank can loan lets say for every that they have deposited if they changed it to to less money would flow and if they made it to more money would be available
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ahh gotcha ty for the info
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it was downgraded because congress kept playing chicken with the budgetfunding deadline for the next fiscal year
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah taxation is theft but that doesnt mean anything substantive we are better off with government than without
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre not listening it all depends in the current cost of capitalyour investment opportunities at the time do you know what the us currently borrows atwhat the ror on its most profitable investment would be
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but what about all the people who arent on social security yet theyve mostly played in and the amount that they have played in equals over a trillion dollars and would just sit there if the government didnt loan it out to itself
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ok i put a couple grand in silver last december but that was for a completely diffrent reason the price of silver was getting so low that it was becoming more practical for a lot of industrial applications namely solar pannels and high sensitivity equpiment and silver as well as platinum gets most of its value that way so i thought it would be a good investment i bought it at dollars an ounce and sold it for about an ounce in july
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wellgold is also expensive and bulky and cryptocurrency is expensive and has no intrinsic value also you cant shelter from the elements with cryptocurrency or eat gold say what gives cryptocurrency its value anyway
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no you and your friends are
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if an institutional investor panics and tries to liquidate bonds prematurely they forego the long term interest and accept a penalty rate which is foolish and costly to them and benefits the issuer however if a huge institution say the social security trust decided this liability was worth it because of lost confidence in the sustainability of the united states economy there would be secondary catastrophic effects as everyone else in every other market on the planet also panicked but china has invested in the us bonds market because it is the safest place to park money over the span of decades has the best returns of any security having comparable risk and it would be massively detrimental for them to try to aggressively liquidate as an adversarial move
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,states also have their own government senate constitution etc the bonds puerto rico issues are municipal bonds no different from those issues by a state county district etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its debt doesnt affect americans whatsoever first off puerto ricans are american citizens just because theyre brown and speak spanish doesnt mean they arent american second their debt affects the country just as much as any other municipal debt pretty much every entity that collects taxes in the us states territories cities towns counties etc issues municipal bonds puerto rico isnt special
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it is a good idea to keep a positive attitude and keep trying for sure the system needs to be fixed though if you ask me do i know exactly what or how nope i do know it works in a way that is filled with cronyism and corruption though i know it all comes down to money making it illegal for politicians to accept any money or gifts of any kind during their time in government would be a good start i think
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is where we disagree britains involvement they bailed out the irish government when the only other lender was the imf the imf was the poison pill because they would have raised corporate taxes and possibly crashing the new economy if i was the uk government i wouldnt lend the irish another penny seriously the irish come begging to london for a loan to stave off certain collapse and now people think london is a predatory lender
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah i get you its actually the reverse the bank can lend out x percentage of the money deposited in their accounts this prevents bank runs to an extent they already do this a little bit this is similar to the bond process as it creates debt just not federal debt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,now that im looking at it us series bonds have a real adjusted for inflationinterest rate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah it was that thing ironic that the guys who think issue number one is paying off the public debt played a large part in causing the downgrade
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i didnt say anything about taxation so try to stay on topic i said the reason government debt should be zero is the same reason i shouldnt be able to use your credit card we are better off with government than without evidence you do at least know what that is right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but what about all the people who arent on social security yet theyve mostly played in and the amount that they have played in equals over a trillion dollars theyll get their social security cheques when they retire
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i agree but a lot of his argument rested upon the high price of gold at the time versus the stock market like most ron paul people he was anticipating a full fallout of the global financial system that may happen but i dont think hed be as proud of himself now as he was when gold was projected to get past an ounce
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i legit said ill buy stocks but im not buying them at a pe ratio jesus christ you people are blind
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same thing that gives any currency its value ease of use to exchange goods stable price ability to pay your taxes with it difficult to copyfraud bitcoin seems good at ease of use and security against fraud less good at the other things hayek had a few good articlesbooksideas about private currency but it doesnt look like they were understood by the inventor of bitcoin
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ok assuming im economically retarded then what am i missing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so its possibly okay for their to be a global default in the long run
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah once you started race baiting peace out
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow you need to know youve lost that argument when these are the words you choose
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i agree with you we have too much of a revolving door between public service and private industry theres no way to avoid conflicts of interest even if legislators or regulators arent accepting bribes or kickbacks while in office theyre getting sweet consulting jobs in the private sector after they leave government its so hard to keep the incentives proper my congressman is don young currently the longest serving congressman hes been in office since many have challenged him but theyve all failed hell probably be in office until he dies or decides to quit do i really think he cares what i have to say not really but ive tried lately to get my message to him just so i can say i did my part in the system ive demanded to know his positions on certain things he hasnt necessarily responded the system might not work but not for my lack of trying
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is not an intuitive graph the relative shift of the area of the country is not something immediately obvious to a human it also excludes more than of the world
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,us debt now at about trillion continues to rise government deficits were rare before until then the debttogdp ratio hovered around zero with some minor deficits occurring here and there what a load of bullshit before deficits were smaller but still common after wwii and during wwii wwi and the great depression they were just as big as they are now and the debt didnt hover around zero before in the postwar period it was always above during wwii it rose to more than and it had been above except for a short period in the late since wwi many countries including the us are dealing with unsustainable debt levels in order to reign in this debt either government revenue generation models will need to change spending cuts will need to be made or economic growth will have to increase most economists disagree with this assessment of the us debt interest rates are the lowest in years the deficit is low and the debt has stopped growing relative to gdp theres no reason to believe the debt is unsustainable and theres no reason to dramatically increase consolidation efforts like the article is suggesting its just the typical moralistic argument that we must pay the debt down the debt is not to be payed down it is to be managed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,agreed it also seems that the position of the country encodes information somehow as if they were plotted on axes i know thats not the case though the only shift in size that i could immediately understand was russia but the rest were difficult to grasp how would you redo this im thinking just a simple scatterplot of gdp growth rate against debttogdp ratio would be really clear i cant help but feel that theres scope for something more imaginative though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpwwwworldpopulationatlasorg these do a fairly good job of global distortion maps but they still need a reference
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,moved from birmingham al to atlanta ga funny my perception was that birmingham felt much safer than atlanta the data does not bear me out on that one i guess its down to atlanta being a big city and birmingham the size much less so
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks to ucaptainsasquatch for noticing an error in the first attempt sources httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistofunitedstatescitiesbyarea data httpwwwgoverningcomgovdatasafetyjusticelawenforcementpolicedepartmentemployeetotalsforcitieshtml viz done through excel
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,does anyone know how much of a city does this take into place for saint louis does that just take in the city or the surrounding towns like ferguson florrisant unincorperated ect because saint louis wise practically no one lives in the actual city while the actual city has only population saint louis county has a population of a million a of missouri pop also another thing to wonder does this include east saint louis which is in illinois which would probably make the murder rate higher if it isnt included east saint louis has a murder rate of around per population with a population of though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also atls metro area is so damn expansive its easy to forget some incredibly safe areas are technically within the city
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,here in stl we always ridicule chicago how many murders they have but by person since we are much smaller we have times as more
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it looks nice one quick question how did you get expenditures for birmingham i couldnt find them in the bjs data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its based on city proper often statistics should done by metropolitan statistical area or census urban areas to make the information more comparable exact city limits can be kind of arbitrary the boroughs of nyc are one city but glendale is separate from la i think using city proper is appropriate for this data though if youre going to look at government expenditures and employees it makes sense to only include murders in city limits
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you would have to check in the data sources i cited
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,birmingham was a weird one i checked their city budget documents but they showed only in policecourt spending which was an order of magnitude less than all of the other cities so i ended up just used the average amount of justice spending per population for all cities as an estimate for birmingham
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,okay i might check other cities budgets directly and see if bjs numbers are accurate or inflated my hunch is that the budget number reflects cost of living in the area and police and court employees can get by with less in alabama than nyc or la
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im not sure if it does make an adjustment like that but im guessing the local governments have a different definition of justice expenses
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i glanced at a couple city budgets and the bjs numbers appear to be fairly accurate to what the cities themselves report the number for birmingham doesnt seem that far off of pittsburgh or tulsa which have comparable population and cost of living
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,using that number gave birmingham something around murders per spent on justice which would be like times the next highest amount that just seemed way too far off to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,overpopulation is not just housing its all the stuff needed to keep the people healthy and happy too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,who do i vote for to turn the united states into a solid block of foot mansions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httptinyhousetalkcomhummingbirdtinyhouseloft httpwwwfloorplanscomhouseplansfpcollectionstinyfloorplanshtml
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,according to the it would only cost
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this looks like a grade history classs list of vocabulary words for the week
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,future generations of students are going to be so confused learning about all this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,while i dont like trump thats an unfair representation as it shows almost none of what he said in relation to the other two as data its meant to be objective which this i feel is not
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to encourage participation in threads marked the poster has provided you with information regarding where or how they got the data source and the tool used to generate the visual tools for this post to ensure this information isnt buried we have stickied this link below for your convenience we hope the provided link assists you in having an informed discussion in this thread or inspires you to remix this data for more information please read the sidebar
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you mention using sources such as wikipedia and united nations data but didnt include the source data for the graphs what criteria are you basing the graphs on
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,internet censorship in the us is news to me can you give an example or is this referring to net neutrality issues
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,man i thought canada is safer from human trafficking than us makes me skeptical
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you said you got your data for the human trafficking map from on that map you marked countries that they did not collect data on as being safe
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is there a citation for the legality of same sex marriages because nowhere in australia is it legal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,created a series of visualization using data from wikipedia and united nations to show inequalities based on various important factors i have used leaftletjs mapbox contributions by means of other parameters and charts welcome please use the github link below more writeup here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how did you make this did you make your own website or was there a prebuilt website which allowed you to plug in the dataheadings it look great
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,south korea which bans porn websites and those considered too sympathetic to north korea has no internet censorship
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i extracted the data from wikipedia tables and some i had to find one by one for each country wikipedia the human trafficking data is united nations data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you can read more here httpsenwikipediaorgwikiinternetcensorshipandsurveillancebycountry
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also literacy is over for both men and women in the us so i dont know why were red for that i also thought the human trafficking map looked pretty random though that could just be my ignorance and the most common form of internet censorship filtering websites at the isps has never made it past courts in the us the httpsenmwikipediaorgwikiinternetcensorshipintheunitedstates article mentions that authorities often go after specific websites but that is when there is a specific crime involving the internet such as illegal gambling or child porn or drugs finally the article mentions that reporters without borders has labeled the us an enemy of the internet after the snowden leaks on the extent of the nsas spying operation none of these sound like what comes to mind when i hear the word censorship
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for pointing the report had data for countries missing some countries in africa and few others i will revisit this and put the remaining in the partial category and update its name in legend
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it is legally recognized in states if married overseas according to httpsenwikipediaorgwikilgbtrightsinaustralia i will add it to partial category thanks
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i made the website and the visualizations not much work really with leafletjs and mapbox thanks
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hi i followed the data i have if you want to edit you are free to send a pull request thanks
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i have added the sources of data below each map on the blog you can check
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yea apparently soudan and south soudan are both safe from human trafficking but watch out for canada
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pounds of per what per car and x miles per car and year per x kwh per population and year something else not alltime emissions i guess the numbers would be too low for that and the comparison wouldnt make sense
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,data taken from the httpwwwafdcenergygovvehicleselectricemissionsphp i used httpsmapchartnetusahtml for the graphic the emission levels are based on electricity sources used to charge evs on a local grid states heavier in fossil fuels generate more and those with more renewables especially nuclear do better
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yep if you drive an ev in utah youre driving a coal powered car yay its clean coal according to the government at least the emissions are expelled primarily south of the main population center cold comfort
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,an obvious question here why is wv the worst are they generating the ev electricity source drastically different then everyone else also is this per car or per car per personcapita etc it is a difficult to grasp key
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the following sources and assumptions were used to show electricity sources and calculate the annual vehicle emissions for a conventional hybrid electric plugin hybrid electric or allelectric vehicle httpwwwafdcenergygovvehicleselectricemissionssourceshtml looks like they used the kwhmi of model evs then factored that against the average miles driven by all drivers so that could be a little off if ev drivers currently drive more or less than the average which is weighted towards conventional ice my guess though is that they want to show what any prospective buyer could expect in terms of their carbon footprint
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,appalachia is coal country if you look at the httpwwwafdcenergygovvehicleselectricemissionsphp and pick west virginia you will see they have next to no diversity in energy sources
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they have low emissions standards and the reason they are so low is because of a fairly correct presumption that if they were to raise them a good majority of cars would have to be taken off the road people have shitty cars because of the poverty and theres a slight panic going on down there about how theyre supposed to meet the clean power plan standards also and this is just me speaking from experience there is no walking in west virginia everything is so spread out you have to drive everywhere
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a lot of coal mines are there and probably no evs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,per car per year then with a questionable calculation method
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,san diego i pay for a bedroom in a house i share with three other people all of us are highly educated and experienced scientists engineers and architects in a city where those professions are in high demand rents increase by the maximum every year and wages do not the demand is high because there is not much work that does not require a degree these days degrees are earned at universities in metro cities like san diego add on the fact that the housing market is very unregulated and you have an obvious problem the housing market in the areas surrounding universities is basically just a mass retirement plan for the previous generation that cannot afford to leave the workforce my tuition and books were paid for with grants i worked hours a week outside the school for above minimum california wage and finished my degree a year early but i still took out in loans every single penny of which went to pay for housing which over the last seven years in this city has cost me about that figure is what living with roommates gets you roommates where the living room is also rented out to someone by the leasing company im not sure how to fix that and i dont think that a reddit thread will ever do so but something is wrong with the cost of living for the current generation call us lazy or entitled or whatever we still work our asses for pay that empirically hasnt changed in the promise of delaying having a family until we are in our late and the knowledge that most of us will likely never own any property or a house most of us dont expect a retirement nor do we expect to ever stop working so with that in mind yeah we want things to change and we are going to get creative and weird to try to figure out how to do things differently finally if you really think people are so stupid and stubborn that they only live in rich desirable often read as required for work or education areas because they dont realize other places are cheaper then you are closing your mind to the reality of the situation people dont purposefully harm them selves on such a grand scale just because they dont want to live in a different area code most of the time the very desirability of a city is motivated by the necessity of the residents to be there tldr the economy suckshousing is a retirement fund for baby boomers who didnt save millennials are in a shitty spot and most of them are not the entitled idiots you think they are america believes self flagellation and misery is required for strong moral character
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow my apartment is like a month and about sq feet bed and bath i feel so lucky now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my apt was twenty five years ago when i rented it now it is and besides carpet nothing has changed at all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ya know if it wasnt for basically everything else it sometimes seems like its not worth it to live in the northeast megalopolis
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,golden rule when it comes to housingrent if its more desired it will be more expensive
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,haaahahaha for in atlanta youre joking right ive seen nothing in that pricesqft itp for almost years not anywhere within practical distance of midtown anyway still need a car at which point you might as well live further out and pay in sminings
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,where i live a month rent would get me a decent sized br house in the suburbs or a loft apartment downtown about ft i stay in one of those bigger green boxes near the top of the chart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,fort wayne represent actually in ft wayne rent would be pointless as you could easily get a house factoring in insurance utilities maintainence etc you could get upwards of and still not come close to thats crazy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i pay for a sq ft loft style apartment with exposed brick and stainless steel appliances and a kitchen island its one of the few things keeping me from moving id like to move but cost of living is cheap as shit here and its an up and coming city
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is super misleading i think but im not sure where the math is off i live in jersey city after spending mo looking at the rental market and is just wrong will get you will get you up to in a bad neighborhood
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would get an square foot property in nyc for the rent i pay for my uk flat apartment guess i cant afford nyc just yet haha
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i live in a country where it is more beneficial to buy an apartment than to pay rent price are equal to los angeles or dc if you dont wanna live in a shithole
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the key thing to take away from this data isstay away from nc theres nothing here for you guys 😉
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in nyc that gets me a sleeping bag on the floor and a kickintheback every morning saying im a moocher and that i need to get a better job
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same in toronto will get you a sq ft studio downtown cad which is like usd
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,only downside is the minute commute which is a lot for around here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,most of the time the very desirability of a city is motivated by the necessity of the residents to be there to add to this people dont choose where theyre born if you grow up in a stupidexpensive city to a family living paycheck to paycheck it can be difficult to break the cycle and muster enough money to pay moving expenses and months worth of rent upfront to start somewhere new
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,run for office you got my vote people would learn the hard way that real estate isnt a safe long term bet for monthly recurring income
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wtf where is this magical land
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when i started my first professional job my pay of was plenty to live in an bedroom fast forward years the same salary wouldnt get me much more than a closet just wait until the rental market becomes the next bubble burst
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what area ive been in the milwaukee burbs for about the last years ive lived outside of chicago and outside of manhattan so ive seen some retarded rates but mke surprises me the most can i find a place to buy for sure do i want to live there nope the burbs get even more interesting its going to cost you to buy a sq ft house that sits on of an acre while thats a fuckload cheaper than san fran nyc et al you need to take a look at income for milwaukee median income is something like you move out to the more affluent burbs and the houses triple in cost but income only goes up
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats what cracks me up about threads where people complain about rent these prices are ridiculous but people pay them they dont have any issues finding people to pay these prices thats why they charge these prices and that is why they continue to raise the prices the real question is why someone would pay such a high rent if they cant afford it many people spend way too much of their income on rent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats econ for ya
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah for nearly anywhere on the bottom of the list it is pointless to get an apartment for that cost
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is there even apartments available in jc for under a month i havent been able to find a apartment anywhere in jersey except for paterson i have no real need for high square footage literally just need to be able to live in a place i can afford with a reasonable chance of not being shivved or shot when trying to do my laundry
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,on the plus side were the one city that can say bitch please every time sf whines about the rent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,usd sign me up
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i completely agree for quite a while after i finished my degree my net income was a month there was no way around that i was literally tracking and agonizing over pennies to try to reduce that net loss each month in that situation can one simply pack up and leave no moving even just my body and abandoning my possessions was not feasible can one simply declare bankruptcy and start over no student debt is unaffected by bankruptcy there is no way to avoid it and they garnish your salary if you default shouldnt you have not gone to college then if you didnt have the money perhaps but the problem then is inherent to our system we have trillion in education debt in our country do that math and decide if all those people should have avoided an education wouldnt the market sort out the cost if education if everyone stopped getting degrees yes but that would take a few decades to happen in the mean time you are failing ti educate doctors and nurses and lawyers and engineers and horticulturists and all sorts of other skilled laborers do you really think its a good idea to ensure there is no way to see a doctor for the few decades it takes for the market to adjust
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,alas my calling in life is research not politics to run for office would destroy my career in science ruin me financially and unless i were running for dictator the win wouldnt really affect much change in the world therein perhaps lies the crux of the issue if public office were more like jury duty than a high homecoming race maybe the political candidates would have something of substance to offer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,id guess somewhere in the southeast or midwest
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,north dakota the pro is this amazing apartment the con is that i have to live in north dakota
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,south bay california
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the real question is why someone would pay such a high rent if they cant afford it housing is a necessity if you make minimum wage in somewhere like california youre going to end up spending half or more of your paycheck on rent and the majority of the rest on food bills insurance etc whether you like it or not thats the sad truth of the matter discretionary spending can only go down in a market where necessities are increasing in price as long as wages stay roughly constant
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,glad it cracks you up its not always an option for people that live in these areas to pay the rising prices a lot of people in sf and jc are sitting on a goldmine because theyve lived in their current house for a generation and have seen the worth double or triple in the past decade but the children of these families that are looking to move out on their own are priced out of their own neighborhood even if they have a far better job than their parents dodid for some that means being forced to move far away from friends and family as ridiculous as the prices are these areas are the most densely populated in the us moving a single mile away can add another fifteen minutes to the commute if youre not on a train line and if you are the prices do not go down there are people that live in pennsylvania that commute to nyc for work their hour commute that starts at can be the same as someones that lives only miles outside nyc that leaves at people pay them because some are desperate and have no other options forget buying and creating equity theyre simply trying to make their life livable a property with any kind of amenities and good location can literally be snatched up within minutes after going on the market ive seen it happen there is no real question about why people pay these rents the job market for most peoples careers are booming to a degree where they cannot simply pick up and move to another more affordable city at will old space is torn down new condos go up and the developer charges more than double the past rate for that location something like a month to for a bedroom with few amenities and no im not pulling these numbers out of my ass these are the numbers for new condos on my train line and someone will pay it because theyll find themselves in a desperate situation where they need to find somewhere to live in the next month and this is the best option for them the only real question that needs answering is how someone can reach the levels of smug you have with such fucking ignorance
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there are no other options in most of those markets you can rent an overpriced apartment or go to jail for vagrancy leaving a market like this is almost impossible due to the cost of moving likewise if you have been any sort of a student at a university you often become trapped by your loans people are not all air headed idiots who want to live in the big city they are regular hard working people who are struggling in an area that they have to be to continue moving forward in their lives the housing market then is a fat limping cow for predatory landlords to feed off of most of the people cannot be elsewhere because the world needs doctors and engineers and scientists
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i live in nyc and pay in rent for a studio thats the size of a below average living room nyc isnt even the most expensive city i lived in hong kong property is even more expensive
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well the one thing i can say is keep repeating the mantra to your friends the housing market isnt like other markets in that overnight a locality or state or federal government can say nope you are a burden to society as a whole and force rent controls worse or simply start talking about taking things from people eminent domain of course that will be called to big government but it would be in response to the immorality of unfettered capitalism adam smith talked about it keynes did no surprise and hayek did so even our most liberal economists frown at rents
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,bingo upper midwest
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,housing is a necessity but living in a city is not a necessity
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but people are moving to cities they cant afford then complaining about how they cant afford it i have friendsfamily who have moved to dcnycboston to pursue career opportunities and yea its nice to further your career gain experiences and all that but i will happily be paid less to own a on half an acre without having to stress about rent while their studio apartment is more a month than my mortgage different strokes for different folks i guess
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you are living in a less then sqft apartment you can move with just your car and gas its not expensive at all why can they not try and find a job in the new city before they move the less populated cities here also need doctors engineers and scientists why do you think that is only limited to incredibly crowded cities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,mind if i ask where in the city that is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am with utter certainty not an economist that said it seems to me that the denizens of the housing market in a metro area would benefit from rent pricing control based upon the mode income of that area a change which would probably hurt landlord incentive to provide quality housing this would force the need for housing regulations regarding standards forcing a landlord to provide value in exchange for a place to live equally important might be the need to alter laws prohibiting vagrancy if you have plenty of affordable land to build housing on sure make it illegal to be homeless but when the choice is to pay massive unfair rents or go to jail then the choice is not really a choice this again assumes that one is too poor to escape the city as demonstrated in previous comments if i cannot choose to avoid a rented domicile and i cannot choose to exist elsewhere by necessity of location of infrastructure then i am no longer a free agent i am a resource no different than any other i am mined or depleted carelessly by a property owner the structure of our cities is wrong as well we are sprawling in san diego the rental market becomes more relaxed when you are a three hour commute away from the locus of biotech firms why are we seemingly incapable of building sufficient high density housing near the desired locations then when that housing is occasionally built it is priced as luxury high rise pricing out the students and professionals who work there and by pricing out i mean for a one or two bedroom apartment with no assigned parking in a part of town with no shops or restaurants most of the units sit empty yet the market bears it i think i could ramble about this for hours
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do they have career opportunities wherever theyre from i cant imagine theres a great amount of nonretail nonservice jobs in most small towns throughout the us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yes less populated cities need doctors but those doctors have to be educated then matched for training the education portion is years in a place where the cost of living is extremely expensive this destroys you financially there is no way around it unless you are already rich to begin with the match is not up to them either you go where you are told to go essentially and people are told to go to large underserved metro areas mainly i feel like you may not be fully aware how the system works for many people now say i am ready to move to small town usa im getting out if the city i was required to live in for training after previously living in a city i was required to live in for education i have something like in debt and zero savings i am years old and ready to start at a new job in this small town i now need to somehow afford to pay down hundreds if thousands of dollars in loans plus my cost if living plus the cost of living for any young family i want to try to have and that is with a traditionally high income job assume that i am coming from research my work ensures that we are able to fight disease i am not making medicine or giving it to sick kids but without my work none if your doctors would have anything to learn in medical school i have a the same level of education as a doctor because i have a doctorate yet my value is low because the work is so esoteric as to be seen as useless by the small rural community they have no biology labs to work in they have no research institutions perhaps i work in an agriculture lab or a winery lab or a blood or urine or genetics lab for the county each of those following positions requires two year certifications from the state before you apply for them each of those costs time and money then after you apply there is no guarantee that you will get the job and if you do get the job in a blood lab in small town usa you often get paid much lower salaries than you would in the metro area you now have to pay down your loans which cannot be erased by bankruptcy on a lower salary there is enormous risk then if all that lines up and you find a place to rent now you need to come uo with gas money and first months rent plus deposit even if thats that is unattainable for most peiple in these metro areas its so easy to blame the people and to think it is their fault and for some it certaibyl is but generally speaking the system is providing nothing new and sucking more and more from an already over burdened generation trying to get a foot in the door
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i live in an apartment complex in hells kitchen
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no im with you im just not keen on rent control as a solution its like hitting a nail with a ham if youve not read thomas pickettys book youll get a kick out of his punch line that rentiers are both burdens on innovation and freedom and capitalism he also mentioned that the french revolution came on the coat tales of of such market exploitation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,southwest florida so there are not the same opportunities and the pay will almost certainly be worse with that said its not rural north dakota there are jobs available in most sectors
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the pay is about the same in smaller cities you arent going to be more financially wrecked there why can they not go to more rural areas if you have in debt and savings at you were the one to fuck up your own life end of story being a plumber would be a better trade at that point with a year being the average salary in the us there is a lack of liscenced plumbers in the us and next to no debt as long as you are willing to live off of essentially minimum wage while you are an apprentice and getting liscenced if that is the case you should have gone into a diffrent field dont blame others for your own fuckups the person you described already did fuck up their own life and that is nothing but his own fault you need to work hard and smart to get your foot out of the door not just one of them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah okay that makes sense i was looking at moving from jersey to the city at some point save just on njtransit alone but pretty much the only option thats viable for me is the outer boroughs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i bet all those towns have a massive and renowned university with graduate and undergraduate programs as well ones which have programs for medicine law engineering nursing and everything else that someone needs a doctorate in then when it comes time to match to a post doctoral program i bet those cities totally have the capacity to support and train those professionals your town has doctors and nurses and all of those things but i bet a very small percentage of them were trained in that same town and at that same college having never needed to train elsewhere this simply isnt how our education system works in program specialization there are of course outliers on any curve but the bulk of these professionals had to go to schools which are surrounded by a big liberal expensive city and very often that city exists for that school rather than in spite of it i dont actually understand how this view could work or why one would want to produce a world where every physical locus were capable of being entirely self contained
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am describing the typical path for people in fields requiring a doctorate to suggest that being a medical doctor is a fuck up is irrational our civilization requires doctors if we were all plumbers the country would not be in a very good place i dont want to be rude but i honestly dont think that you have empathetically tried to understand the motivations of the parties involved nor does your sense of realism seem to be grounded in what is feasible and while a median income in the us may be more commonly the important number to look at is the modal income which shows you the income you are likely to get the median income in southern california is but most young professionals read current generation who go to work make an hour even with advanced degrees and many years of experience in their fields modally i suspect the figure would trend toward the lower end if the spectrum narrow the field to reside ts who didnt purchase homes and apartments prior to and i suspect the remaining median income is again extremely low also with a median income of you cannot live in sd according to the department of labor the income needed to rent a apartment here comfortably is closer to my point simply being that you are engaging in victim blaming and are unwilling to metacognate in the matter try to put yourself in their shoes we would not have trillion in student loan debt in this country if it were as easy as everyone deciding to be plumbers thats not how job markets let alone modern civilizations work in the slightest
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whats your budget you could probably find a place for around a grand per month on the upper west side or like you said the outer boroughs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my problem is my budget isnt even that much currently im living with my parents putting everything towards paying down my college loan hope to have that deep sixed at the end of after that moving out would become an option if i can find the right place im only making about a month after taxes though would be more like though once im not committing full amount to transit check so id be hesitant to go above rent im not averse to roommates but is for a even feasible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,honestly if i were you i would continue to stay with your parents living in nyc isnt all what its made out to be especially if youre living frugally if you do find a decent position in nyc and can afford the rent and still have enough to go out and do things then thats a different story i have plenty of friends who commute from jersey city to nyc via path and its a comparable travel time to people who live in the outer boroughs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the main thing i want now is privacy which i cant get with the parents doesnt necessarily need to be inside the city but i doubt i could afford monthly commuter rail on top of metrocard when im paying rent especially since the price point of jc or hoboken isnt all that much lower than manhattan
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,perhaps i posted this to too serious of a sub but it was the first one that came to mind after my own curiosity a super shallow post ill admit but fun i think if youre familiar with the show basically sean evans with first we feast brings celebrities on to heat increasingly hot chicken wings it starts with relatively common name sauces and gets to very very hot ones i wanted to visualize the curve source httpswwwyoutubecomuserfirstwefeast any of their hot ones videos made in pages because im basic like that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is a fantastic series i would suggest to anyone i bought some pain and dabomb beyond insanity wow these are hot
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i find it interesting i spent some time waitressing in berkeley and i could never understand the people who just ordered hot peppers and beer as a meal i tried a tiny bite and decided never again this was in the early before hot peppers became a thing sorta like craft beer i bet those peppers i served were at about probably not hot according to what people eat nowadays but wouldnt megadeath really do harm to a person
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dunno if it is true of the hottest pepper on the chart but i googled the subject later and yeah turns out capsaicin is a neurotoxin and too much can cause all sorts of digestive disorders as well eaten in sensible amounts good for you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,year old me would compare humanity to a disease spreading and then wonder why he cant get laid
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,til the beginnings of st louis were as a hub of native american trade activity around the year
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i thought it was interesting until it marked the trojan war and the exodus theres no archeological basis for either

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,year old me would think ill lie and say how great it is just to get laid have children and then lament that i became part of the disease
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ya i was wondering what exactly was going on in the midwest us right around ad like what exactly was going on in that area for it to be defined as urbanization
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no it hasnt
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it amazed me it was so early does anyone know of a strict rule for founding a city do you just declare it and as long as you have a population it counted
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thanks for letting me know i believe that your browser or program youre using simply hasnt refreshed the post is shown as removed on my end and if i open an incognito window it is nowhere to be found do let me know if the issue persists edit just to clarify you will still be able to access this post from its url but it cant be found by going through the rdataisbeautiful subreddit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well you have to move your settler to an open square and press b
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah im viewing it through narwhal a popular reddit client on ios i guess thats why i can still see it thanks for the reply edit meaning narwhat doesnt seem to refresh periodically
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah thats most likely why and not a problem
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,switzerland isnt usually stereotyped as a poor food nation globally we are pretty heavily associated with chocolateother confectionery or fondueracletteemmentalcheese in general if the author tried to make a point he should have omitted switzerland from that chart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ill be damned if uk has anywhere near food tastiness of germany absolutely laughable londoner here i was in greece a while back and it almost brought tear to my eye when i realised what toast should taste like out of compared to best toast i ate in uk i conversed about food in there and athenians seem to agree that gemany has fantastic food quality edit i would like to add that i am slovak by origin few know this about my small country but us slovaks pride ourselves with food quality even poorer families would spend last money to get premium quality food we make superb meat and milk products and not to pride myself with it many slovaks use polish food as reference of cheap and poor taste we make everything ourselves and we only import selected products that we think we cant do better almost all of those food products are from germany so yea somebody tells me that uk food is right up there i laugh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,better yet how is the goodness of food decided
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i looked for syria
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seriously who thinks british food is better than the us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think this is pretty informal so its probably his personal opinion honestly this probably doesnt belong on this sub due to subjectivity
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably pretty similar to lebanon
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i do way better
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oakland not angry riots have broken out in folsom san quentin and pelican bay
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,compiled the data from into excel and found totals for every team compared to total reported
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,errrr id put a white outline on the text some of the percentiles are hard to read
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,op i think your graph could be better besides the points shown there i would also sort from bigger to smaller resulting in httpiimgurcomzwotiwbpng and you could make a horizontal bar and whiskers graph comparing all the teams that would make a great chart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,arrests not violence think about why they arent necessarily proportional
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont understand what the little circles mean and its annoying that the legend is upside down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,revised per upelusteriano s suggestions all data from the american community survey by the us census all data manipulation done in r with visualization in the package heres a link to my blog with the source code and links to the data enjoy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it seems better what do you think about it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,agree id like to have them in order by mean but i didnt want to fight with it like i was with the point plot i also dont love the default ggplot rainbow color scale but its take it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also should look up the res optimized image size next time before i post
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,somethings can still be improved but that would only be nitpicking moving the job labels to the left aligning them right with their plot that would remove the colour label saving you the problem of the default colours since that way it can be colourless im not sure but the whisks seem to be from to percentile maybe reducing them to to or to would help with those scattered dots that push the start time too far away indicating the sample size n in each case would be nice too this one is more a personal quirk since im more involved with research and stating the sample size is mandatory i think it looks nice enough as it is though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a few propositions just suggestions really commiditization of spices was a major game changer along with a weak india the industrial revolutions effect were not good for india and china but india did well for being colonized the wars were great for america whatever china did in the mid last century is working to rebound them well now everything comes and goes and repeat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why did us economy not suffer through the wars and also the last chart current supply of doctors plotted against literacy rate for selected countries is kinda obvious dont you think as the percentage of literate people increase more number of doctors will be there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i guess after the dutch rule of india ended britain took over and indias economy just collapsed i wonder why
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,shouldnt combined uk france germany together they are individual separate nations they dont operate as a single supranational entity like india china or usa
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dutch india consisted of the settlements and trading posts of the dutch east india company on the indian subcontinent it is only used as a geographical definition as there has never been a political authority ruling all dutch india dutch presence on the indian subcontinent lasted from to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this infographic makes no sense why is the la circle way bigger and wouldnt having the ratio of median list price to median income be useful in determining housing affordability
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think there is a bit more at work than supply and demand the money supply introduced into the economy has caused inflation in just about every asset class since stock market housing food costs education health insurance etc cant think of too many things that havent increased in price aggressively
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,following a percent increase in home prices over the past five years home affordability has again become a hot topic housing prices are locally dependent and some metro areas have a more severe affordability problem than others while national home prices have risen percent over the past five years home prices in the mountain region have seen a percent increase and the pacific coast has seen a percent increase why have home prices risen so much faster than household incomes as usual its all about supply and demand supply is constrained on two different levels the supply of new homes homebuilding is constrained as a result of the worsening lot shortage ie the shortage of welllocated lots on which to build the number of homes listed for sale is constrained partly as a result of the number of homeowners underwater on their mortgages though this situation has improved as home prices have risen
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive yet to see a good map that clearly shows just how much housing costs vary over an area there should be a red line along the coast for water front property popular cities should be deep red as well with it getting cheaper as you spread out im too lazy but square footage and sold prices are out there
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think the big thing to take away from this is that employers using the excuse of cost of living for certain pay rates is bullshit unless youre in san fran new york or boston
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont know if this is old or what but its showing dollars per square foot in san francisco as its more like
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wtf olathe kansas the median household income
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,san francisco is poster child of affordability problems and solution is obvious build apartments stop protecting property values at the expense of affordability have to balance affordability and property values polticians are incapable as are realtors too and reform tax code to end basis to toward favoring mortgages
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,new jersey the most densely populated state in the country and the farthest south they list is trentonand the only others listed are jersey city just outside of manhattan and newark an absolute shithole hardly representative of the real estate market in the state of nj
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nice effort but the city selection seems almost random where is new orleans la jacksonville fl anyplace but se in va new york bizarre
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,saint louis is not cape girardeau rcrappydesign
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sort of related but really more of a rant how in the hell do you guys survive to throw some numbers out there that arent quite my families numbers but close we struggle and really shouldnt say my family lives in the heart of the us cost of living is very low compared to the coasts i live in a modest city and not a larger player like kansas city or st louis or omaha i make my wife makes i have children one in day care for a month our mortgage was taken out for and is a month with taxes and insurance and pmi i have hobbies that i have totalled to cost me a year my wife is much more expensive but her fun totals a year our children both do gymnastics for and the oldest also does dance for another we eat out for groceries at i have a medical condition that costs then we have just one car payment at insurance gas electric tvinternet watersewer and car gas total around we literally have about extra every month not obligated to something how do people take trips or buy nice things we live fairly humbly typically buying only necessities besides the eating out a little too much
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think this infographic shows lots of data but is not visual friendly i prefer to sort out a spreadsheet
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im going to flint michigan ft i can sell my house in maryland and have so much money left over i can buy a lifetime supply of bottled water automatic weapons and hand grenades not to mention that id never have to work again even if there were any jobs in flint
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cool infographic thanks for sharing i wonder why the creators chose to save it as a jpg instead of a png sadly this makes the text fuzzy and hard to read
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,huge difference in home prices of oppressive liberal states and bastions of freedom such as texas
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also these numbers essentially mean nothing for places like portland or sure portland homes may list for an average of per sq ft but they sure as shit are selling much higher than that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its the visualization of median cost per square foot its a far more useful figure than some noisy ratio that says nothing at all du to all the noisy inputs i actually was coming here to comment that although nicely visualized the type of data and information really tells us nothing at all because it says nothing about how the averages are composed especially when compared to medians its all really just noise that of course implies the very kinds of things we already know
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,keep in mind that inflation is supposed to be broad based you are talking about sectoral price changes in relation to other sectors if those higher volatility sectors are inflated then other sectors have deflated so that cpi pce gdp deflator and the billion price project show low aggregate inflation and if those measures are missing inflation then so are market participants who are currently pricing the year treasury at a yield also ngdp and ngdi measurements have been below since
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,totally agree there is so much context lost in averages and medians theres also an inherent flaw in the income measure because it looses the context of distribution and weight is that avgmedian income all high and low income with little in between at the actual avg or median level or is it a healthy and balanced distribution or any number of other important distributions the danger there is not only meaningless data and visualization no matter how well intended but it will also make people make decisions based on false assumptions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,could be what people are paying now for what they bought years ago
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,denver is way off too i havent seen anything for in at least two years edit i may not be reading the graphic correctly im in mobile and it doesnt zoom well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats not true about the jpgpng thing you can save a really high res jpg
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ours has gone up over the past two and a half years so thats very possible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for me since i bought in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,no its not la doesnt have a higher median cost per square foot than sf or ny its just arbitrarily bigger and the purpose of median is to avoid the noise that plagues averages however a ratio of medians is still fine and does tell us whether the median person can afford housing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its interesting you bring that up because the official measures of inflation are pedantic nonsense so what that some minute discretionary and relatively inconsequential things have deflated when wildly consequential things like homes rents and cars have been inflating at a rather rapid pace sure one can compartmentalize it as sectional but that is ignorant of the reality one wants to fit into a contrived manufactured and inherently flawed measure of inflation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hell yeah thats awesome i hope the value continues to grow for you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats why i referenced alternative indicators like the billion price project ngdp and ngdi which are directly aggregated and us treasury prices you could also add the trade weighted dollar swap spreads and fed funds futures shadow inflation should be showing up in at least some of these indicators as opposed to all of them showing consistency with official measures of inflation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i live near boody one time some one stole the water tower they were putting up trailering it to a local scrap yard was a poor choice

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you get a pay jump if you stop preparing food and start cleaning toilets
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,interesting that teachers are not represented here their union is over strong httpsenwikipediaorgwikilistoflaborunionsintheunitedstates
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,janitors and cleaners are heroes they save lives every day by keeping things clean and preventing the spread of disease ive always wanted to say that
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,waiters and waitresses are underreported because so many of them dont claim cash tips their income is a lot lower
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,source bureau of labor statistics httpswwwblsgovnewsreleasepdfocwagepdf made with tableau
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,every recent list ive seen of most popular profession by state lists truck driver am i missing something
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my barber keeps telling me i need to marry an rn he says they are intelligent make good money and they can always find work no such thing as an unemployed rn he says
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow just look at the biggest categories they generally are ripe to be replaced by automation retail sales the largest category there cashiers absolutely replaceable food prep service and waitstaff all replaceable with robots janitors laborers nearly the entire list is up for automation it will take time of course and we wont see it this decade but well see it beginning and in a few decades this list will be about massive unemployment problems
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in what universe is the average pay for a registered nurse that is insane i wish i could drill down into the bls statistics to see what it is in my cbsa because my girlfriend who works at a major metro hospital and her peers make nowhere near that much edit maybe now im wondering if registered nurse also includes level of schooling above rn eg bsn arnp etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,lol at all the people clamoring to become nurses now if you join this field for the money you wont last long im pretty sure every nurse in this thread can tell you stories of biting scratching urinefeces flinging sexual assault and general assault threats of assault on a daily basis getting your ass grabbed or having patients suggest disgusting things is just a fact of life and im a male nurse you should hear the things my female coworkers experience i make an hour currently but after two years as an er nurse you could make double that as a traveling nurse seems like a lot till you factor in all the student debt you racked up also the blood borne pathogen exposure testing from aforementioned bites flung fluids or stabbingattempted stabbing that being said i love this field after i come home covered in vomit blood or whatever else from being coughed all day in the face i can look in the mirror and say that i gave more than i took today but lol at doing it for the money
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wonder what this would look like if waiters and waitresses average unreported tips were included
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,politicians spend so much time pandering to bluecollar workers when the vast majority of the working class is in retail or food service still these jobs are ignored because theyre not perceived as hardworking nobody respects the cashier at walmart like they do the coal miner or factory worker they look down on them hes just a cashier probably some high school dropout
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,does anyone want to talk about how every job on that list with the possible exception of rn can and will be automated in the next decade
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so why are food preparation and serving workers a different category from waiters and waitresses also there are about million truck drivers stupid data isnt beautiful
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive never understood why number of jobs is the rubric of choice for seeing how people are doing like all jobs are some how equal a million jobs created is hardly a success story if theyre all near minimum wage jobs i think a much more reliable rubric that should get much more attention is income and wealth disparity and its trends
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow nurses get paid a lot over there over here they get fuck all thanks to the funding in the nhs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,looking at this chart i feel like apple samsung should not be selling as many phones as they door people shouldnt be buying as many as they do
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,now it makes sense why half my university is studying to be a nurse couple of my engineer major friends have switched to nursing field due to lower amount of studywork load im here still biting the bullet with engineering
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,look at this and then think about how the average livable wage is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its crazy how nursing is one of the largest occupations but still is in such a high demand because of how large of a shortage there is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,someone at sometime has to dig the ditch i spent years serving tables before graduating college
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seriously that is median income because that is dirt except for registered nurse but that one requires college education
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wonder how much outliers effect the data like a head nurse making a lot more than a new hire the admin assistant must have a wide range of data actually surprised its so high theirs probably some really wellpaid ones
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we really need to start rethink what work in century can be nurses are paid this much rightly so bc they will be around far longer rest healthcare is a safe bet for some time to come job wise funny how they say we are going to bring back jobs its all political rhetoric from the stone ages preying on simplier minds we need to start seeing these people as victims of these politicians
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,most of these professions are of the type that ai and robotics are capable of replacing it would not be unlikely to see a decrease in these numbers over the next years if autonomous driving and delivery vehiclesrobots are added to the equation we are looking at the death of capitalism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is this suggesting that there are not enough it people doing it jobs is this why it is in such demand i expected it jobs to be in the graph it support programmers dbas etc etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rns are the highest paying job in the graph they are mostly women stem jobs are surprisingly not in the graph but i would bet are comparable salary to rns probably number at least million and are mostly men so maybe instead of only crying that we should have more women go into stem maybe we should also be encouraging more men to be rns
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this also seems to be a list of people who get shit on for doing there job edit typo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,tfw you spend years of training and get a bachelors and spend on flight training and you finally make it to an airline pilot job with the zero tolerance expectations standards and responsibilities of flying a million dollar jet full of people and you make about as much as a janitor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sacramento california graduated with my bachelors in nursing in started work at no overtime required training and paid education time supplements this up to now and scheduled for a raise soon our hospital is currently negotiating with our nursing union so wages should go even higher very rewarding and practical its a great profession
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dont forget the waitress stats are skewed heavily most likely dont include tips my gf is a waitress and she makes in salary and about in tips which is mostly tax free her take home last year was nearly my job pays a year and she makes more than me because i lose so much in taxes that she doesnt brutal
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you are any of those people i have no idea how you can live in places like the bay area or new york city
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the average pay of waiters and waitresses is definitely higher than if tips are included
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that data must exclude texas because while i envy my rn counterparts pay i dont know any that make full time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,solar and the alternative energy industry we need to jump on this before china monopolizes the market
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,every single one of these is largely vulnerable to automation registered nurses probably being the least vulnerable but even that job has alot of processes that could be replaced by machines
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow nurses actually get payed way more than i expected they deserve it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it seems weird that ive never really thought about this before its really interesting
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this certainly shows the rise of the pink collar professions as being the leading path towards a stable middle class income in the future registered nurses administrative assistants office clerks and customer servicesales are the toppaying categories and overwhelmingly female the fact that a lot of guys seem unwilling to even consider entering into those fields is a major problem
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i can see all of these but retail and nurses being replaced by robots in the next years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,okay and stack these next to the list of jobs made obsolete by advanced technology america needs to focus more on mobility for these types of workers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the majority of these job categories will be replaced by robots think about that for a minute
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thank god most of these jobs will never be replaced by robots in the near futu wait a second
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seeing the food prep numbers just reminds me of why i dont work in food service anymore

dataisbeautiful,not_removed,comparing a salary for what a year college degree gets you vs jobs that seldom require a ged to qualify for what the fuck kind of point is this supposed to prove
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,most of these professions are of the type that ai and robotics are capable of replacing it would not be unlikely to see a decrease in these numbers over the next years if autonomous driving and delivery vehiclesrobots are added to the equation we are looking at the death of capitalism
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it terrifies me to think about how easily the top three can be automated away
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the politics of warfare on my facebook must be getting to me i thought i was going to be looking at a timeline of military statesoccupations
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what is the cultural reason for service jobs to be scorned and looked down upon huge ridicule from people when the idea of raising the minimum wage for fast food workers is presented vs just as low skill factory jobs for bluecollar workers that pay a living wage to be idealized
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,about half of those jobs will be replaced by robotics or automation in the near future what will happen to all of those left unemployed what will happen to all that taxable income for the government these are questions we need to be asking ourselves now and finding solutions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,average pay seems like a poor statistic to use median would likely be better and some idea on variation would be a great addition
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how many of these jobs are less than a decade away from being fully automated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how in the absolute fuck do so many people make dollars and live i make around and have dollars to my name and the only thing notable i have is a studio apartment and a kia
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but wait im confused didnt conservatives tell me a thousand times that retail and other low paying jobs are just entry level jobs for teenagers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,pay wages make me sick my parents never needed a college degree and easily made working on a factory line they were able to buy a house have two kids and own cars not lease and retire with a pension nowadays kids are fucking beyond swamped with debt college and credit cards and are needing to decide if they should buy a house or have kids this topic is interesting but makes me sick to my stomach sorryfortherant
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,mmm poverty line fuck large corporations and their everincreasing billions in profit while folks are on food stamps working fulltime costs the tax payers money as well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so this tells me that janitors have got it going on they make more than food prep cashiers waiters and retail salespersons
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i feel like some data is missing it looks like they strategically chose data to make it seem like nurses are the only high paying job that is in high demand
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive worked in the service industry for over years now and have seen salesperson cashier and csr used almost interchangeably these titles are completely arbitrary
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what about if you are self employed like petes plumbing or freds flooring tyoe stuff i considered this skilled occupations
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would be very curious to see the opposite end of this spectrum to see if jobs that are rarer end up with a generally higher salary it would make sense but i still like numbers in front of my face to verify
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,while they deserve more i am surprised at the wage of a registered nurse note both mum and sister are nurses no money is enough for the shit they have to put up with
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,til being a janitorcleaner in the us is twice as remunerative as being a doctor in hungary
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,are material movers truck drivers the pay seems small and i thought there were more than truck drivers in the us that occupation will be hit the quickest by ais
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,million software developers and programmers average salary httpswwwblsgovnewsreleasepdfocwagepdf
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we will retrain the coalworkers to retial salesperson cashiers food preperationist and janitors western democracy does not look good
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,average im seriously doubting these numbers im in retailcashier and my take home last year was which was the highest amount ive earned yet my state has the second highest minimum wage in the us even if i had full time hours and worked every day without fail i still couldnt make per year
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seems like its missing a few data points there are million software engineers in the us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i see no production jobs in the top understandably we can produce more with less people but a completely service based economy is guaranteed to raise inflation and deficit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a cleaner you can make way more than that in nyc especially in the school system some make more than teachers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i only have year left of college and i still dont know what i want to do for a living
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there are software engineers earning an average of over annually if you throw in managers trainers and other it folks the average salary only goes down to but the number increases to almost
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,since when did rns make that much the only rns i know who have been working for years each make like a year
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how is the average pay for rns is this including nurse practitioners because that throws off the whole graph
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nursing could stand a little breakdown as graduate nursing degrees make so much more than rns
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,all i see is a list of jobs that will eventually be automated in the next years if you cant seeare not frightened by the wave of automation that is going to hit us in the next few decades then you are probably going to be replaced by a machine in the next few decades
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a scarier thought is how many of these are going to replaced with automated robots in the future
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,million peoplewhat the fuck is everyone else doing thats only of the nation
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i find it somewhat worrying that the top two groups from this are within a decade of being completely automated and there is no plan for what to do with them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the sad thing is these all service jobs or jobs based around service no manafucting jobs in the top od list this could be scary if it doesnt change in some years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,waiter salary not counting tips which is the majority of what they make
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,first conclusion nurses are greedy second conclusion if there is anyone i dont want messing up their work due to turnover or understaffin its nurses
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,aside from nurses and secretaries pretty much all of these jobs are going to be robofied
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,some people feel its demeaning to be a janitor or cleaner but people dont realise that being a cleaner is fine its a job and a job thats in demand
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,kinda scary how many of these jobs are likely to become nonexistent or at least employ vastly fewer people within ten years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nurse here currently in grad school but still working part time any questions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,most of these are going to be decimated by automation in ten years time to start sending your kids to trade schools or med school
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i would love to see an average age for each of these jobs regardless great work
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i cant believe how much money i make compared to other people compared to how much money i have
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the scary thing is that robots will be doing most of these jobs in years with exception of maybe nurses lets go universal basic income
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,tax companies for replacing workers with machines its economically inefficient but were already at a place where efficiency is just funnelling money down the gullet of the top and it will just keep getting worse a bit more economic inefficiency for more economic equality should be a welcome tradeoff for of people that really shouldnt be a difficult sell in a democracy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it would appear that this chart is propaganda designed to create more nursing students
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its crazy to me how few of these categories make over i cant even imagine living on less than that i make about that and i consider myself not very well off at all i guess living costs vary from place to place though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,dang i gotta marry me a nurse and she can take care of me when i am sick only down side is she might die from a stroke after being overworked
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,httpswwwblsgovoescurrentoesnathtm is where they got the stats if im not mistaken
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i make less than half the cashier average annual pay but i like my job and i work the hours i want so fuck it slacker life retire as a california beach bum it is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,besides registered nurses all these jobs will be replaced by robots how many years do you think itll take
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,only one of those needs a four year degree and only a couple need an associates degree
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yup the lowest average wage for us kitchen folk aint it great how much we get paid for the hardest part of any restaurant
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,soooo the takeaway here seems to be that unless you are in healthcare unless you have an uncommon job youre starving smh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,woah wait the majority of people work in retail no wonder everyone is so shitty to each other all the time seriously if someone wants to improve the whole country all they need to do is reform retail jobs so people like their retail jobs cashiers still kind of falls in the same boat there as does food prep etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its gunna be a bummer in years when only about of those jobs still exist
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sooo many of these will soon no longer exist as jobs for humans ai is gonna hit us hard
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youtube a minute documentary about automation browse permaculture as well it is the instruction manual to have a pleasant transition
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i see a couple of jobs here that could pretty easily be completely replaced by machines in the next years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rn here clearly living the wrong side of the world because im not nearly making that crazy amount
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,is nobody concerned that these are all service jobs i thought a solid economy needs a base of resource gathering and refining into complex goods to be stable if we are just servicing each other and selling things wont the bottom fall out im not an economist or anything thats just how i always imagined it works
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in case somebody is interested in similar data for germany pages to to summarize we have million people who have a job the following numbers are in millions i just looked for all groups with more than people office clerks whitecollar workers administration and administrative assistants other health no doctors no pharmacists no nurses no vets social jobs sales accountants and it teachers cleaners traders groß und einzelhandelskaufleute transportation berufe des landverkehrs engineers notes nurses i couldnt find waiters food preparation and serving workers customer service representatives in there but i dont know what to look for the office clerk group also contains software developers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i have always wondered why american nurses earn so much compare their pay to swedish nurses which earn roughly bucks a month
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how long until the nursing field becomes saturated and the pay goes down
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,jobs like cashiers drivers customer service reps etc will be replaced by robots in the near future
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i wonder if there is a relationship between the number of workers and how much someone gets paid the only one that really seems to break the trend here is registered nurses
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nursing requires school so i guess it makes sense why compensation would be higher
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think you have to be the ultimate zenmaster to do that job and not have a heart attack theres a great doc on netflix about la er doctors and nurses that is really good i thinks its called code black shows that cool head some providers must have also their frustration with having so much dang paperwork and how uninsured ppl try to use ers for primary care
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is rather an odd list nurses are schooled and licensed by passing a complex test the others listed are untrained is this a stay in school kids list
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,man its crazy to think that the largest occupations in the united states are mostly entry levelintroduction to the workforce style jobs that people have to make a career out of its kind of sad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rn bsn of less than two years make though associate degrees arent paid less on my floor if theyre hired granted im in state that pays well ak ive been told east coast pay is atrocious
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wow nursing is the only skilled profession as in a career in this list everything else were low skill nondegreed low paying jobs sad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which is one of the reasons fight for and organizing fast food workers is so important the labor movement needs to invest more into organizing all of these workers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,jesus i make so much more money than like everyone and im just comfortable enough to have a small amount of disposable income how do the poors manage to survive
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,waiters and waitresses at something tells me that somebody isnt reporting all of their tips
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the really scary part comes when you look at how many of these jobs are going to be automated very soon
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so the people doing the most physically demanding work are getting paid the least is the general pattern
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why in the fuck would any of these people worry about a rich persons taxes raising if none of them make even close to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,holy shuckin shit wages need to be raised here in america tax the rich tax wallstreet tax corporations
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is also like a list of the occupations that overall produce very little and really are largely a waste of human capital
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats about the jump i made from function serving to material handling i wanted to get away from people but still move around a lot worked for me but now i need to figure out the next jump
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and you have to deal with a lot less people too i actually liked janitoring pretty well when i was in school vs working in accounts payable for the college it paid better too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or a jump if you stop preparing food and start serving it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as it should be
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,usually the less desirable jobs pay more
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they probably break them down by elementary middle and high school teachers which would make the professions seem smaller if you grouped them by preschool primary secondary and special education school teachers as a category thats million employed with an average salary of grabbing everything listed under education training and library occupations gets you about million people making around on averagethats dragged down by substitute teachers teaching assistants and other support roles
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think there are a lot of people represented by the teachers union that arent actually teachers my friend is in that union because the hospital he works at is a teaching hospital
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,teachers unions include a lot of nonteachers at the public university down the street form me i believe the professors are not in any of the teachers unions they have their own aaup but the janitors and patrolmen are in the nea teachers union although their jobs are custodial and policesecurity in nature
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,trust an eve player to be on rdataisbeautiful
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i agree i hate how people treat them in general
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,oh really you guys think im just some untouchable peasant serf peon well maybe so but following a broom around after shitheads like you for the last years ive learned a couple of things i look through your letters i look through your lockers i listen to your conversations you dont know that but i do i am the eyes and ears of this institution my friends
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,anyone that treats a person that wakes up in the morning and puts an honest days work in poorly is a douche i dont care what type of job you do nothing is beneath any of us in the usa it is far easier and often more lucrative to stay at home and do nothing then it is to show up to work everyday at a shitty job
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i work in a hospital my lottery fantasy is to share a massive win with the ancillary staff on condition they resign on the spot would love to see the managers when they realise the cost of the disruption is waaaaaay more than they ever credited to their staff in wages
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i work in a hospital and our sanitation department is the best anyone that can basically rid a hospital room of mrsa or cdiff with no risk of transferring it to the next patient in the room is a hero to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i always feel particularly pleased to see street cleaners around my city whilst a significant proportion of the population will so happily dump their waste wherever they please these silent heroes sort it out they may be paid but i feel they perform a particularly important service and i doubt they receive much gratitude for that work
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seems like there has to be far more waiters and waitresses than
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats why youll notice waiterswaitresses never make the argument for and eliminating tips every server i know brings home more than not a single one of them reports their tips like they should i have very little sympathy when i hear about them complaining about their low wages
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also a lot of waiterswaitresses work part time because they are still in school or its a second job i wonder how much they would make if they worked as much time as their employer was willing to give them i was a food runner and i made about more per hour than when i worked in retail and the servers made considerably more than i did
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,awesome that you used tableau for this quick question did you happen to connect a data source to tableau from bls website
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i click that link and it says that page cannot be found
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre not missing anything ops shit data source certainly is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i saw a map of the us with truck drivers being the number one job in most states would they fall under material movers on this list
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,came here to ask the same question i thought they make almost half of all occupations i could be wrong i dont have a source
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think thats under material mover
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,barbers are so wise
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think it will be a long time before robots can replace janitors at an affordable cost they would have to be able to empty garbage cans clean countertops mop stairways etc
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,just imagine how many oarsmen would still be employed if we didnt automate rowing damn robots everyone knows that after a job is obsoleted due to automation new jobs are never created just look at all the oarsmen millers and threshers that are out of work
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,retail sales the largest category there is already being probed for replacement amazon has existed for over a decade the internet is crushing retail stores just like walmart crushed mom and pop shops that takes care of retail and cashiers which was the same thing when i worked in retail there were never just cashiers it was always retail workers who would cashier on downtime and when needed
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i doubt retail workers will be replaced by robots instead theyll still hire a human helper but cashiers will be replaced by cameras and sensors apply amazons largest business model aws to this technology and you can probably transform grocery stores across the country to cashierless stores overnight
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ah but you forget something most people are fucking idiots every customer that walks in our door is either an idiot or rude until they prove themselves otherwise so automation would be wonderful getting rid of clerks would be fantastic but your year old grandma would have a conniption if she couldnt talk to a person to tell her for a millionth time that yes you do need to press the button that says edit to edit your photos
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,so much commenting about the automation of these jobs what i find remarkable is how menial the average job in this country has apparently become
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,came to say the same thing scenario is about to get pretty rough
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,new jobs will be created its been this way since the first machines were created
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i really dont see sales being replaced by robots they can try but i used to work sales and the human element and psychology is essential for any company that wants to maximize sales
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,food prep service and waitstaff all replaceable with robots ehhhhhh i dont think so
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you really think were not going to have humans cooking food in restaurants maybe robots will be making your big mac but people dining out at an actual restaurant will still have humans preparing their food
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre forgetting jedi delivering nurses
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,keep in mind average can be significantly higher than median registered nurse salaries from another source httpwwwpayscalecomresearchusjobregisterednursernhourlyrate edit to add another data source
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i just took a cursory look at the article and it seems that there was quite a bit of cherry picking going on not sure how they set up the graph but pirmary school teachers might go somewhere on this graph
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in what universe is the average pay for a registered nurse i know some nurses and this sounds about right if they are working hours many are working fewer hours most i know earn in the high or low keep in mind this is for rn not nurse assistant or lpn the people who attend to you when you go to a regular doctors visit are never rns
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i am an rn with a bachelors degree and years of experience and i work in a hospital clinic nurses here make less but that isnt true everywhere if i worked full time at my current hourly wage i would be making significantly more than also rn is the licensure it doesnt denote what your degree is could be associates bachelors or infrequently now diploma
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,seems pretty accurate to me ive only been an rn for around years and i pull down an hour with a two year degree many of my coworkers whom have worked for years make over and at most have a bachelors none are advanced practice we work in mn which is one of the best states to work in as a nurse
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,probably includes overtime all the er nurses i know in several different hospital groups all get pretty regular overtime lots of time its overtime bonus or double bonus which means time and a half plus hours or plus so a nurse working double bonus for a hour shift gets hours of time and a half plus thats usually over for a single hour shift
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what metro area though huge difference between tulsa and san fran though nursing is one of those fields at lease right now that the pay remains more constant across regions from urban to rura because of the high demand in aging rural communities so while retail salesperson might be having the wage curve dragged down by the people selling cell phones in iowa the nurses dont so it keeps the mean and median higher
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im an rn in phoenix and i make an hour in a level trauma icu it all depends where you live california makes way more but then again cost of living is much more too an average nurse works hours per week so hour shifts i also have another job that i work day a week and get paid an hour doing that so i make per year at icu job and roughly at my other job i will say the vast majority of nurses either work overtime or another job top end for regular nurses are roughly here managers make here that or more i dont know if statistics also include nurse anesthetists because they make plus anywhere they go theres also nurse perfusionists that make great money too edit i only have years total experience so i have much room for salary advancement over the years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont know what the nursing situation is in america but in canada its extremely lucrative and well earned too since they work bonkers hours
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do they have a asn or bsn
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive never known a nurse to make less than i worked at a suburban hospital in high school then in a few cities on the east coast now im in hawaii there might be some nurses here making less than that but i work with some nurses in a management capacity and im sure theyre all in the or higher yes of course this includes people who have their bsn and msn but their jobs are still rn unless theyre lpns
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,registered nurses in my area start out as a newgrad at around on top of their basepay there can be bonuses shiftdifferential weekenddifferential and tons of extrashift and ot you can easily gross this annually additionally you can often get your rn in programs making it one of the best in terms of highestpaid to time in school ratio but dont jump onboard just yet while nursing commands respect outside the hospital inside the hospital it can be hellish and that respect does not apply the average nurse only does it for about years the things you see are up there with a soldier dealing with the same people day in and day out who do not seek to improve you are seeing the worst of humanity both physically and mentally and its very difficult not to internalize this stuff it takes a certain typea and stronglydriven physicallystrong personality who can balance empathy with controlling emotional damage to ones self that is being a robot will not make you a good nurse neither will internalizing everything and attaching ones self too strongly to your patients id say most nurses end up leaving early or becoming very cold shells of their former selves they also get injured a lot prone to back and shoulder problems from lifting fat people its one of the most difficult jobs you can do in my opinion and they earn every penny unlike many highpaying jobs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,my gf in chicago makes and its her first year
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nyc average is like an hour edit in
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive literally had none of the above happen to me however i dont work in the ec i do agree with you about not entering the field solely on the expectations in earning a decent wage great pay is nice and helps but also does genuinely enjoying your job for the most part
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats why i couldnt do it i was in nursing school i would have been a generation nurse and two months in i realized im not a selfless enough person sucked dropping grand learning that about myself
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,do they not have ppe where you live if you are getting covered in vomit and blood every day youre doing it wrong
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in my experience people look down on hard working professions too like landscaping is one of the most physically intensive blue collar jobs and yet people just think landscaping is just for poor illegal immigrants
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nah its because bluecollar work happens out in rural america whose voters have disproportionate amounts of influence on political elections retail workers have no money and live in cities so their votes simply do not count as much and their voices matter not at all why court someone who cant fund your campaign and whose group isnt going to swing any states anyway
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats the problem to a certain extent and honestly why trump had such a huge appeal people are working these lesser jobs which pay poorly and come with virtually zero benefits retirement and healthcare yet we are dreaming of jobs that do not exist any more blue collar jobs that had good pay and good benefits that supposedly all went overseas someone who saw that their parentsgrand parents had this awesome blue collar job or someone who is unemployedunderemployed who remembers having an awesome blue collar job they all want them back rather than to be stuck in the service industry we either have to bring back those jobs and also have them provide good pay or raise the paybenefits of the jobs that we do have somehow otherwise the problem grows its interesting to think about actually as to how to solve the problem of larger unemployment only needing mass amounts of people in low paying jobs combined with a growing population thats where some difficulties lie
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats because blue collar jobs of old were the best jobs available for the uneducated and i dont mean that in the pejorative sense when the blue collar industry was strongest any joe blow could have a decent job a house and an income to support a family they talk about blue collar jobs a lot because many of those employed in the above fields would be working said blue collar jobs had the opportunities not evaporated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well comparing a coal miner and a walmart cashier is a bit of a stretch to say the least being a cashier does not require a lot of specialized training and does not come with a permanent possibility of death not even at walmart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,customer service will not be automated any more than it currently isthere is a demand for human to human customer service and with automation increasing in the coming years i would expect even more customer service representatives that might even become the new typical teenager job job once most of the retailcashier positions melt away
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,janitors wont be automated waiterswaitresses wont be automated not all retail workers will be automated either
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can sure will be not likely unless theres a strong imperative to automate people will drag their feet its a big and risky investment even amazon only has some automated warehouses they arent the standard yet
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,anyone wanna talk about how theyve been saying that since the
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that too can be automated
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,because waiting tables in a restraint is a different job than making sandwiches at subway
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i was just gonna pop in and bring up the missing truckers i guess if they wanted to they could lump drivers in with material movers but an average truck driver will earn around which im sure would move that number up quite a bit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,could be divided out based on pay methods waiters and waitresses are paid like an hour and the rest is from tips or however much it is these days so this is based on what is reported etc the other category could be all the folks who are paid based on an actual wage i could see how you would want to divide out the data that way based on how those folks are paid to get a more applestoapples but thats just conjecture
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,well theres also a huge issue with nursing shortages nearly in nurses quit the field within their first two years
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,it really depends on location im in a largeish town in the midwest and most of my nurse friends make after years of experience still pretty good though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,education is paid for right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,considering how much time people spend on their phones nowadays that price tag isnt too crazy when ya think about it
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to be fairmost people dont have top tier iphones or samsungs many get older versions or cheaper phones
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this data only accounts for of americans even if you only include working americans its still less than
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,who actually spends on phones these days are people really dropping the full price on them instead of getting the plan that subsidizes it and makes it cheaper upfront
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats like saying you dont understand how gm sells a car
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,how do they feel about poo and inserting catheters also paperwork so much paperwork respect to nurses yalls crazy work is only matched by not all your crazy attitudes
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,stick with engineering its worth it the ceiling for an engineer is so much higher than the ceiling for a nurse plus you dont have to deal with other peoples bodily fluids
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im an engineer and always thought nursing was one of the handful of majors in college that is as hard or harder the requirements for rote memorization seemed a lot higher plus clinicals sounded awful plus outside of a few specific engineer fields odds are no one will die if i make a minor math error so thats nice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i did engineering but now in med school let me tell you engineering was easier for me a normal brain is either built for math or memory
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wont we just be saturated with rns then and start paying them minimum wage
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,capitalismcorporate greed i work in the law enforcement category but im about to go to college for computer engineering robots and artificial intelligence are the future its best to get a head start on ai because thats the future digital gold rush when it comes to making good money
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats not what an outlier is or really how they work an outlier is typically defined as above the or below the quartile so if in the nursing profession if the mean is about and we assume the salaries are approximately normally distributed with a standard deviation of about a number i pulled completely out of my ass then youre looking at a of and a of about with an iqr of so puts an outlier salary at and above incidentally that would also put below as an outlier so the data might be slightly skewed regardless the point of outliers is that they are by definition unusual so unless they are so egregious as to mask what youre trying to learn or you can identify them as errors in the data you dont much concern yourself with them because they are valid data for instance if you run a small business with employees plus yourself you pay them each a year and yourself it would be misleading to say the average salary at your company is but if you have nurses at a variety of part rates now you have a at and a at for an iqr of so and nothing is considered unusual here though the question of normality is still of concern the point is individually well paid nurses arent really moving the needle on the mean so much so that it makes reporting the mean with them included misleading edit fixed a minor brainfart
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i expected it jobs to be in the graph it support programmers dbas etc etc theyre probably not in the graph precisely because technology jobs are split into so many specialties most statistics are not going to put programmers and it technicians into the same column
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,as a male rn i concur we need more men in nursing
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,commercial pilots make around bit more than a janitor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its only tax free because she evades paying taxes on tips
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,to show that the most employed jobs in the us pay near poverty wages big companies like walmart could easily pay their workers more but they care more about their billion dollars profit then the fact that over half their workers are on food stamps and in poverty
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if autonomous driving and delivery vehiclesrobots are added to the equation we are looking at the death of capitalism it wont be the death of capitalism someone will still own those autonomous vehicles there will just be a much larger lower class
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,everyone is looking for an excuse to feel superior to someone else
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,when i was a supermarket cashier i hit the paywall for what a front end associate could make and to get another raise they had to reclassify me as maintenance since i had crosstrained in that department while it was being implemented i was the highest profile cashier in the front end worked the most hours and was pretty much the only one who would push carriages and ring items but when it came time to demand that raise it was my months pushing mops and taking out trash that pushed me to a fair rate
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,according to the httpswwwblsgovnewsreleasepdfocwagepdf the survey does not include the selfemployed owners and partners in unincorporated firms household workers or unpaid family workers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,granted the data is almost years old but this is from the same site as the op data
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i think you can get that boosted up to like but no idea where they get paid more than source my wife was an er nurse and is now a np
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,at least coke is cheap
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this list isnt all inclusive
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or correct at all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,working population is actually around people in the us
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,also nursing is the only occupation on the list that requires multiple years of special schooling which can be expensive income incentives are the only way to convince people that nursing school is worth the time and as you said we need plenty of nurses
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,chances are the hospital will have her on a mandatory life insurance policy as will emr developers and other medmedtech facilities
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nope there are kind of jobs agricultural industry service and itcommunication at first every society has the great majority of workers in the first field more than then the industrial revolutions turned more and more people to industry because we could automate many of the agricultural jobs like using machines instead of people to cut stuff down then the more advanced the industry became the less human resources were needed because it became much more efficient so people turned from the automated or unneeded jobs to those which are needed these are the services we cant automate these yet so this is where most of the human workforce is needed we still produce just as many if not more food and the industries are just as strong as before well maybe the two world wars pushed them to the edge but by not much we just dont need as many people working there all in all there is nothing wrong about the situation in the future more of the service jobs will be automated so more people will work in it then when we automate that we will either create a new type of work or stop working perhaps everyone becomes an artist or philosopher since those will be the nonautomated jobs or the society collapses who knows
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they are usually entry level part time or temporary jobs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in my mind was always what i considered to be a typical annual income of a middleaged person without a college degree the idea that so many people make below is abysmal im horrified and somewhat ashamed of myself now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,did you read the title
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im a material handler which paid me about as much as a starting teacher my job didnt require a degree but when its time to move up the supervisor planning procurement etc positions above me all require a degree
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the poors are roughing it for sure
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,idk how you live or where but in the midwest i can and did live well as a single guy on cost of living is a huge factor when you can spend for a single bedroom apartment for yourself vs about in places like california
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,because no uncommon skills or education are needed i assume and of course the lack of unions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thatll sure raise wages
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,what do you mean specifically by materials handling
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i can imagine that being away from the chaos of other people would be nice
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,in accounting you are working by yourself most of the time at least thats how it is with my accounting job it obviously varies and it definitely pays better too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,why then are driversales workers and truck drivers not represented in the graph they are attributed as a single group in the document graph seems kinda fishy to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats dragged down by substitute teachers teaching assistants and other support roles oh and teachers in north carolina sighs as i go back to grading papers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,that doesnt appear to be the reason this chart specified registered nurses leaving out nursing assistants and lpns so they could easily specify fulltime teachers too who make up the overwhelming majority of teaching positions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,nea represents school food service and non teaching roles as well as retired teachers so yeah youre right
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we do like our graphs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,delet this cyno lit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,throws candy bar wrapper on the ground its their job to pick it up duh job security dude lol a fucking ass hole
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i worked as a janitor in a manufacturing plant for about a year i cleaned both the offices and the factory bathrooms and some other parts of the factory floor the factory workers were responsible for cleaning their own workstations because of safety reasons i can say one thing i far preferred cleaning the factory area only time an office worker said thanks to me was hey could you grab me a coffee thanks as i was taking the soda cup they left half full that they put directly in the trash to the sink feet away to empty it for them so my trash bag wouldnt leak their desks were messy and theyd bitch if you moved a single thing to clean off their phone in general they complained that i was there at all despite it already being after hours for them the factory workers even though the bathrooms were by far the dirtiest bathrooms ive ever seen they appreciated me and treated me well on the job i never had a problem with them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was in hospital one day and my mother was sitting next to me she knocked a drink onto the floor but coincidentally the janitor was walking passed so she said excuse me im so sorry ive spilt a drink could you help the janitor said of course one moment ill be right back but before he left he put a wet floor sign down this angered my mother she turned to me he was holding a mop it would have taken him seconds now hes made more work for himself doing two trips and we have to sit here in a dirty room in a hospital my mother is a very polite woman so this was some serious shade she was throwing around this is when i realised that average people dont understand how difficult it is being a janitor in a hospital mum i began in the most condescending tone possible considering shed just been condescending about the cleaner im pretty sure he just used that mop to clean the urine of the drug resistant uti patient down the hall im fucking glad he didnt smear that mop around in my room you could instantly see the oh im an idiot bulb turn on in my mothers brain sure enough minutes later the cleaner was back with his black mop not his yellow mop cleaned the floor in seconds and i left the hospital without a nosocomial infection
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,there probably is but maybe they only count full time
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i used to think this going from a retail job to a serving job they work less hours and make a lot more so why shouldnt i you work your ass off serving you work harder in a hour shift than you do at any hour shift at your typical retail job theres a reason not everyone does it edit my experience was at a very busy highend restaurant im having people compare that to serving at a movie theater and telling me how easy it is
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im sure many would take minimum wage if it included scheduled bathroom breaks sick days and healthcare
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,me too i was a server for a long time and due to some issues with my feet im now a hostess getting paid hourly servers are some of the most entitled people i know and i completely recognize i was like that when i was serving too got into a discussion about a minimum wage and they were saying minimum wage jobs are minimum skill they dont even see the hypocrisy well i have to know about beers we have and im responsible for serving alcohol and im very good at my job well great except minimum wage workers generally know how to do their job and many of them sell alcohol too sooo
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,for real i used to bartend at a very popular higher end restaurant chain when i began bartending i was getting the crappy shifts mondaywednesday afternoon pulling roughly a shift then after a couple years when people quit my seniority bumped up and eventually got the thursdaysaturday nights holy crap it was amazing a night but you are really working your ass off sweating the whole shift dealing with assholes kissing ass cleaning dirty platesglassware etc etc and you have to do it all with a shit eating smile one fuck up and you are gone saw my friend get fired on the spot for talking back to a rude guest damn miss that guy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i just created a spreadsheet in excel copied the values from bls into that and imported the file into tableau
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hm it still works for me maybe try this httpswwwblsgovoescurrentoesnathtm
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ops data source is the government so
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,this is a good point because humans are far more flexible in their ability to perform multiple complex tasks than machines if you look at how roombas work or dont you get a good idea of how far technology has to go to replace people even for basic cleaning tasks let alone things as complex as what you describe a janitor doing and janitors do other ondemand tasks that a machine would have to have much more complexity to accomplish like cleaning up after a kid at school vomits on his desk rather than the floor a good example is security cameras not having replaced security personnel but augmenting the effectiveness and range of what an individual can accomplish often what we envision machines will do isnt the same as what they actually do it is possible that selfdriving vehicles wont replace all drivers but extend their hours by allowing the vehicle to operate a day while the driver watches the system sleeps listens for alarms refuels arranges for loading and unloading and generally monitors the truck that a machine now drives it may not be what people imagine it to be
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i fully expect mcdonalds to replace humans taking orders through a microphone to placing and paying for your drive through order on a touchscreen within the next years im honestly surprised they havent went this way yet edit apparently this concept is commonplace already outside of the us point proven
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yea im not going to a nice restaurant to order a steak off an ipad
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah but thatll be a boutique service like bellhops or sword makers or cobblers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,chain fast food places yeah but and i know this is anecdotal but most people i know wouldnt want their waiterswaitresses replaced at sit down restaurants until that is one restaurant does it and it becomes normalized to the point where human waiters seem old fashionedsigh
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,sure but high end restaurants arent the majority so its a bit irrelevant
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah seriously i dont think well ever really get rid of family owned restaurants people like that shit that mexican restaurant any day over chipotle that chicken spot im there day one
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,if you use a car or light bulbs you obviously dont care about buggy drivers and lantern lighters letting damn technology take their jobs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,think of how many jobs each forklift destroys my grandfathers first job at the steel mills in indiana was on a crew carrying steel that fine job is gone now
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i welcome some aspects of it dread others right now if you and your spouse each work and still need some government assistance to raise your family youre branded lazy and entitled welfare queens imagine when you just have no job at all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,service industry jobs replaced manufacturing jobs but because of the way theyre viewed many dont think they should be paid a decent living wage once those jobs are replaced unless we get some progressive thinking people in government were fucked
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,automation will certainly be coupled with remotework when it comes to customer service video kiosks an such however id also point out that customer service absolutely can be automated as someone whos worked phonesemails for the countrys largest retail outlet youd be amazed at how much of that job is automated software is trolling the email for keywords and guiding you through a flowchart style program wherin you arent making any decisions at all youre emails in before a human being is actually taking the time to read what youre telling them and type an original reply in short youre often working as a glorified captcha discerning bad grammer and typos and texttospeech program in that field already thats very minimal human element that were absolutely working on automating out currently
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,has apparently become compared to what farming industrial revolution factories where millions of people worked in assembly lines for decades before being automated away
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,im pretty sure the average job in this country has always been menial
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can we really stop using payscale as if it were a valid scientific poll i mean just because forbes got tricked doesnt mean we all have to
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or even driversales workers and truck drivers
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,rn with a couple years exp here make without differential plus there is always extra shifts that pay time and a half for base and for overtime is an easy target knew a rn working nights and weekends making about without overtime im also in the south so its a very good salary rns in ca regularly make over
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whats a rn
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yea theres also a high end my friend got his masters in nursing and runs an oncology department and makes really good money
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i banked last year full time ericu it sorta annoys me how many people forget rn is a science degree
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,tbf nurse specialists tend to make more than just plain rns especially if its something particularly specialized like or nicu etc also its ca if youre in bay area la or sd youll make a lot more because you cant afford to buy a house out here on a single low six fig budget unless you want of your money going into a mortgage on a shack
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,a lot of nurses here in ca make a year easily in northern ca at least thank you unions
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah nurses in nc dont make squat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you need to come to eastern nc my wife is an rn making a little under
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,relative to cost of living
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,brb going to nursing school
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,same job same test pay difference is minimal unless you are in managment
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,thats not true bigger hospitals are moving to only hire bsns but the majority of hospitals will hire both with slight preference for bsns these hospitals may require their adns to pursue a bsn but i cannot speak to that years of experience also plays a big role in candidate selection
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you know how many kids i deal with that vomit after getting swabbed i dont get much vomit on me anymore but thats only cause im quick as for blood i work in an urgent care center now i dont have to deal with as much blood as i did before
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we have a very distorted view of work in this country we idolize people who do the least amount of physical work but make the most money and we look down on people who do the most physical works and make the least money yet we look up to people who work hard in general and down on people who are lazy we dislike people who are wealthy but didnt earn the money and we look up to people who are poor but still work hard i think it has to do with the collision between puritan work ethic and freemarket capitalism you are supposed to work hard for next to nothing for a certain number of years then find yourself in a position where you dont have to do much yet make a lot of money anyone who does that is a good example of the american dream and anyone who doesnt is lazy the problem is very few people manage to follow that path because the amount of effort you put in has very little to do with the potential rewards and it takes quite a bit of luck in combination with hard work in just the right direction to go from poor to wealthy
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ive never understood that either ive seen the guys who landscape the public spaces in my neighborhood they have their own business with their own truck theyre obviously getting up stupid early to work and in many cases their teen and up kids are involved too so its a work ethic that theyre passing on and their work is seen by literally everyone who lives here so if it wasnt good everyone would know if they dont deserve respect nobody does
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,landscapers are still better treated then movers are and moving is a shit ton harder then landscaping landscapers are much better paid too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,bluecollar jobs paid well because they were unionised without unions theyd be just as bad as the service industry
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah right up until a realistic computer and respond semi intelligently to questions and give actually good advice then boom everyone will be phoning up robotscomputers for help
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,people often mistake automation for things like robots or a pad to choose what you are going to eat at panara sure these things are automation but we are making fundamental changes that allow automation to take over with disruptive technology and infrastructure sure youll want to talk to someone in the store if you go to the store but i can order all i want from my couch for amazon sure if i go to the taxi kiosk at the airport i probably want to talk to a person but i can just summon a taxi with my phone through uber or lyft would you even go to a restaurant if you can get the food delivered to your house would you be willing to pay a premium to get it hand delivered or get it faster and cheaper with a drone certainly if there is a problem with a delivery youll call the help support line and a friendly ai screens the calls and offers refunds for blatent fault on the part of the company even if its wrong of the time still cheaper then management time and forwards the rest to the manager who is working from home cuz why would they need an office million people work in transportation even more support them by being gas station attendees waitresses at greasy spoons mechanics to fix the cars police to make sure that everyone behaves if that million is halfed because of driverless vehicles take over taxi and shipping the demand for labor will drops insanely over the next years and pretending that it wont is just irresponsible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i just went to a restaurant last saturday that had a choo choo train deliver our food and drinks the future is here
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,waiterswaitresses wont be automated why not it would be amazing to have a small robot drive over to the table and bring food and drinks and just press a button to get a refill on the drink
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,janitors roombas
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,but were still in the early stages of automation its only going to get more reliable and cheaper as labor becomes more and more expensive there will be pushback from the people who swore they would only buy american or shop mom and pop but weve seen in the past how long that lasts
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,we have been losing jobs to automation for decades
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and how much has technology advanced in those years years is nothing in the grand scheme of things its just a lot to your experience
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and over the past years its actually happening the pace of automation is moving too fast for the displaced workers to find other jobs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,weve been losing jobs to automation since before the and with the rate that machine learning and robotics technology are advancing we need to start preparing for millions of people being replaced by robots in the next few decades
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,your article points out that the reason for turnover is undefined and makes no mention of the proportion leaving due to job dissatisfaction
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,might that be partly because of women who want families and babies are dropping out to have families and raise children i dont know im just wondering if it could be a major factor the vast majority of rns are female
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yeah i posted this further up the thread but is the pay scale for a uk nurse band is a fully qualified nurse so an rn is slightly more senior gained with experience eg nurse team leader bands to are for more senior levels such as nurse advanced modern matron and nurse consultant which i gather you dont need extra qualifications for i would expect most nurses dont get beyond band or though the cost of healthcare is wildly inflated in the us compared to much of the rest of the world which results in all medical professionals getting paid significantly more although i wouldnt be surprised if other countries in europe paid their nurses more the nhs is kind of underfunded and being i believe still the second biggest employer in the world it takes a lot of money to pay all the salaries httpswwwprospectsacukjobprofilesadultnursesalary
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,especially since for many its a laptop substitute
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,or dont pay it in full up front for a new iphone is usually easier than flat
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,not all nursing is like that one of the fun parts of the field is that switching specialization is relatively easy and there is more specialties than you would think its a very dynamic degree to have source icuer rn
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,advanced practice rns routinely make in the figures so its not too shabby and when you get to the higher levels the volume of bodily fluids decreases dramatically as well
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i dont see how anyone can just switch to nursing thinking its easier it consumes your entire life and clinical are awful source currently a nursing student
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,true for example i am one of those that have a general idea of biology and how everything works but everything is so intertwined and so many specific names that i suck at the actual class and tests its a different type of brains hah true
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,appreciate ya
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,now thats an answer
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,hopefully someday after i burn out of ems i can go burn out of nursing too
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,you get higher pay because you are in high demand
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,on average yes starting pilot wages across the industry are near poverty level a few years ago starting pay for most jet jobs was a year its just now starting to improve
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which will hurt in the long run if social security sticks around long enough
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,wage rates are determined like all other prices by supply and demand these are the most common jobs therefore you should expect them to pay relatively less than other jobs
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,they could but why should they
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its capitalism there are many people looking for minimum wage jobs why would they pay more when the supply is large i understand people want companies to be good but they need to do good by their investors and share holders which means they need to try and get as much profit as possible
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,its not a corporations responsibility to care about their employees wellbeing their job is to please the shareholders and they are not demanding for higher employee wages
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,the most employed jobs pay close to poverty wages because almost anyone can qualify to occupy these jobs nursing is the only exception to this because it is the most diverse professional medical degree one can acquire in the us this chart doesnt account for the fact that nursing is one of the only fields that actually compensates employees for local cost of living which actually causes a huge discrepancy in the average paid wage regular rns do not make on average someone with a year bsn or lpn sure but these numbers are bullshit
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,can confirm have bs worked two years in oil gas then everyone was laid off unloaded wheelers at for target and stocked the shelves hating my life every second i was there still waiting for the big bounce back in og to go back
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,which is part of our problem the service industry is viewed as a job for high schoolers part timersetc yet more and more of our population are being funneled into that industry for various reasons unemployed no college lack of other jobs etc so the employment make up of that industry is shifting to people who need full time work and need to support themselvestheir families yet we still view the entire industry as only for entry level part time and temporary with the pay hours and benefits that go with them
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,interesting was always what i considered to be a typical annual income of a middleaged person with a degree do you live in a high cost of living area
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,material handling is a vague description of what really amounts to several positions in warehousing i work for a company contracted by amtrak to provide on site material management at their maintenance facility this means that any part chemical safety equipment whatever they would need to fix trains is shipped in by my company and i take it off the trucks and store it in our cages to be issued out later my job is about computer based where i process material service requests and stock transfer ordersmsrs and stos and physical where i use physical labor or forklifts to move around parts ranging from small nuts and bolts to pound hvac units i also work with the planning purchasing and quality assurance departments to make sure that we always remain stocked with what amtrak needs its relatively low stress stress job and i can often spend as much time on reddit and youtube in a shift as i do working just keep in mind that you can deal massive damage to amtrak property with that forklift if your not careful and paying attention to your surroundings i only have about feet of space to manuver the forklift between the cages and train the hardest part though is the scheduling because im the only guy without kids i get jerked around to cover shifts a lot were a facility and i can get put on any shift with minimal prior notice right now im in day of a hour work week nice opportunity for overtime though
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,right but were talking about jobs that are on the graph not jobs in general my present job is perfect for me and is completely solitary i work from home selling models but a tiny number of people have that job so it would never make a graph like this
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i was also surprised that truck drivers wasnt more represented i think its because of the way the data is categorized driversales workers and truck drivers is considered a general category with driversales workers at people heavy and tractortrailer truck drivers at and light truck or delivery services drivers at i dont know who decides how to categorize these but i can see how it would be misleading i used from the bls as a general guide and it seems to be consistent
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,basically reads like an rn advert to me
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,ask the bureau of labor
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,i know it doesnt add digits to your salary but thank you for doing what you do i truly hope our nc teachers and public education will see better days ahead even if it isnt in the near future thank you though thank you thank you thank you
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,youre raising the next generation and doing fantastic work
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,yup like year whether youre in lumberton where thats solid middle class or cary where that gets you a shack behind whole foods then theres firefighters who had to picket in wake county for anyone to pay attention when they were starting at hr even after picketing they only got a raise in whoopeee and cops who throughout the triangle start at and down most of them in a region where decent homes are rocketing past and a decaying farmhouse minutes from downtown still costs then theres ems who like almost everywhere else get emergency dispatchers for police fire and ems are making in most of the area except durham who raised pay to but are still struggling to keep their roster even half full public service in north carolina get treated like fucking garbage i cant wait for it to blow up in their faces but i dont plan on being here when it does
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,whats sad is that even with the low pay my friend could not get a job teaching in nc even with a bachelors degree because he did not hold a teaching certificate to get a certificate you need a degree or experience and you cant get experience without the certificate kind of ridiculous
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,and some districts arent represented at all
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,cops jobs are to stop crime so should we all start breaking into houses its job is to fix tech when it breaks so should we all start taking sledgehammers to out computers medical professionals heal people when they get sick should we stop washing our hands and dishes to keep them some job security its a terrible argument really anyone big enough of a douche to say this doesnt deserve to be a friend
dataisbeautiful,not_removed,google the word janitor with top trump adviser stephen millers name he actually argued that
